lotto dosia tolas gracias por que dar se

2
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,490
hasta esta hora creo que juega las

3
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,170
direcciones not ova ck dobra gracias a

4
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,410
un saludo para mi familia que esta acha

5
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:37,070
creo hola familia ah bueno vamos a pasar

6
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,510
in des por que ama facil para me ah so

7
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,790
yeah add my talk is called sleepy map

8
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,089
style geo canvas design with caro CSS

9
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,550
and my name is a vaguely moser and i'm

10
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,140
from the mozilla science lab which is a

11
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,690
part of mozilla that build open-source

12
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,489
science software and its includes

13
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,860
geospatial geospatial scientific

14
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,220
software so this is making maps and all

15
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,050
of my slides or down at that link there

16
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,850
too so if you want to follow along I

17
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,650
have all of the links in the in the

18
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,770
notes below so the backgrounds isn't a

19
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,290
map you might have noticed it's a comic

20
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,659
so I'm going to reference comics as well

21
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:17,120
just like Rachel did in her talk kind of

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,250
except I'm not a comic creator i'm more

23
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,759
of a comic consumer but i like comics as

24
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:24,590
a metaphor for framing how we design

25
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,469
maps because maps are kind of built with

26
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:29,780
this similar story like cell structure

27
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,359
right maps are composed of tiles usually

28
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,890
if you're dealing with raster maps and

29
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,600
they kind of compose next to each other

30
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,140
to build a story and CSS supplies style

31
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,369
to that and so i'm going to talk a

32
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:43,219
little bit about how Carlos CSS kind of

33
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:46,340
gives a lot of punch and and and beauty

34
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:52,159
to maps so uh I like to start talks

35
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,740
talking about how we process things with

36
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,829
our vision our eyes are kind of

37
00:01:57,829 --> 00:01:59,539
reflexive processors right they're

38
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:01,189
pretty sophisticated process or is much

39
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:03,020
more sophisticated than the machines are

40
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,439
at processing our 3d world understanding

41
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:09,740
depth perceiving what areas need to be

42
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,890
prioritized and also colorizing our

43
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:13,970
world and you don't have to write a new

44
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,830
rules for it depending on the quality of

45
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,940
your vision your eyes just kind of

46
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,440
naturally adjust to this right and

47
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,600
that's the kind of reflexive design that

48
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,860
we hope to achieve on the web but

49
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,540
there's usually some latency right

50
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,250
there's usually some loading screen with

51
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:25,540
web

52
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,400
visualizations things are kind of slow

53
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,980
so it's not as reflexive as with your

54
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,900
eyes but we'd like it to be and I'm

55
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,069
going to show you how we can make it

56
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,250
better with vector mapping too so this

57
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,500
is where I'm from from New York this is

58
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,709
a map from Wonder Woman comic I like to

59
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:43,900
start out with this too because it kind

60
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,650
of brings up the mythology of maps so

61
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,239
when you design maps you know or when

62
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:50,439
you use maps you don't really think

63
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:54,040
about how accurate they might be right

64
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,780
unless it's inaccurate and you know it's

65
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,010
inaccurate because you're in the place

66
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,069
that is inaccurate but really someone

67
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:02,500
had to draw that at some point even if

68
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,959
they had machine aids someone had to

69
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,329
kind of design the way we appreciate a

70
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:11,530
3d globe in a flat 2d canvas and so

71
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,450
there's a mythology beyond it behind it

72
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,129
that not a lot of people really

73
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,780
appreciate or they don't you know really

74
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,220
think about when they use maps for

75
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,409
navigation so it's not unlike designing

76
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:26,230
mythological maps for comics either real

77
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,450
mapping also relies on some assumptions

78
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,739
and some constraints and you kind of

79
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:34,599
have to give in to some of the errors

80
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,970
that are quite natural in building 2d

81
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,579
maps so this is the canvas that I

82
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:42,159
typically work on this is cardo or this

83
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,500
is osm openstreetmap who knows about

84
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,620
openstreetmap everyone almost hopefully

85
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,000
some people okay openstreetmap is kind

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,680
of like the Wikipedia for base maps

87
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,260
right people can go in and edit their

88
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,370
own communities so it's a

89
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,340
community-driven project and it's quite

90
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,199
robust in some areas and not so much in

91
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,629
others but I like to show this as an

92
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:06,400
animated chip because it shows me

93
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,870
panning and zooming left and right and

94
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,599
also zooming in infinitely and I don't

95
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:13,060
think people who design for the web or

96
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,609
even just regular you know charts and

97
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:17,949
bar graphs really think about how

98
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:19,989
complex this canvas is because you have

99
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:22,599
to design for the zoo II interface that

100
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:25,539
people expect to naturally adjust as

101
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:27,460
they zoom and they have very little

102
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,800
patience for it when it doesn't work and

103
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,110
then they pan infinitely left and right

104
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,190
so the canvas is infinite and and that's

105
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,470
a pretty serious

106
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,690
straight for development and also to

107
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,790
when it pans left you'll also see that

108
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,370
there are these blocks of gray let you

109
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,040
see right now so those are tiles loading

110
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,230
right so you appreciate the canvas as

111
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,770
being infinite because you can move but

112
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,270
but it's actually limited to your

113
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,770
browser screen usually if you're dealing

114
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,800
with raster maps or maps that use tiles

115
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,140
so this is from a talk that I saw in New

116
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,280
York very minimalistic slides but the

117
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,920
developer of a small mapping library I

118
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,950
think called simple tiles at ProPublica

119
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,050
which is a news investigative journalism

120
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,280
organization in in New York and he did a

121
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,280
lot of work with satellite imagery for

122
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,290
maps so he was talking about how slippy

123
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,640
maps which are the maps that you saw

124
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,070
here because you can slip around right

125
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,220
slippy mats slippy maps are optimized

126
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,560
for location and wayfinding and not for

127
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,680
aw which is so sad when that's what you

128
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,390
do for a living right you think that

129
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,220
someone just said at a conference that

130
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,800
your stuff is boring and not awesome and

131
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,919
it's usually utilitarian so this is a

132
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,540
similar block so I make a lot of maps

133
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,580
but I also make a lot of charts and

134
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,580
graphs with geodata and and I started

135
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,410
thinking a lot about this idea that maps

136
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,360
weren't particularly awesome and how we

137
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,880
could convince people otherwise so this

138
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,770
is a slippy map you can't see it sliding

139
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,419
because it's just an image but it's an

140
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,550
iso map of iceland and what that means

141
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,010
that has little iso lines that indicate

142
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,500
elevation so if you zoomed in you could

143
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,030
see those little iso lines you can kind

144
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,290
of see them over there where it's more

145
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,590
yellow but this was built in card ODB

146
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,940
which is the company that I worked for

147
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,360
before Mozilla and I worked on a bunch

148
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,890
of educational materials to teach people

149
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,930
how to build maps like this and a lot of

150
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,600
documentation on CSS to teach people how

151
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,960
to design maps like this it's beautiful

152
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,370
right you wouldn't necessarily use it

153
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,470
for location or wayfinding you wouldn't

154
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,300
hike across Iceland using this map but

155
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,890
but you can appreciate how beautiful and

156
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,010
artistic is and this is another one it's

157
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,710
a really bad jiff of

158
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,230
app that uses torque j/s which is a

159
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,200
library developed by cart 0 DB which is

160
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,700
now called card oh they just changed

161
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,290
their name like a couple of weeks ago

162
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,310
but it's a time series data map or

163
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,860
mapping library and what that means is

164
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,410
you can animate time series information

165
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,880
across a map if you have a time stamp

166
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,310
associated with any of your data so

167
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,630
these are tweets about the Indian

168
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,700
elections and they're colored according

169
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,320
to the candidates when people are

170
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,090
tweeting with certain hashtags you can

171
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,160
see like plumes of activity and where

172
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,510
people are pocketed that are more

173
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,550
interested in talking about a certain

174
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,860
candidate so you can also create these

175
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,960
kind of dynamic maps oh I'm sorry iTunes

176
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,910
I'm gonna have to quit you because

177
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:31,560
you're destroying the slides um yeah so

178
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,690
you can even do special cardo CSS hacks

179
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,640
for time series data which is very

180
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,690
exciting and I'll show you that in a bit

181
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,330
and mapmakers are really big on

182
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,030
mythology's like I talked about before

183
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,360
we kind of create stories that maybe our

184
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,550
little known in the wider web community

185
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,260
but are very well known in ours so this

186
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,810
is a place called null island it's at

187
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,810
0-0 coordinates so zero latitude zero

188
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,030
longitude which kind of falls just

189
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,720
beneath this little lip of Africa here

190
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,150
and it's kind of where everything geo

191
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,490
rectifies when you incorrectly set it up

192
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,220
in your data it will zero out and go to

193
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,200
the center and the center is Nell island

194
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,690
and it's this fictional place that we've

195
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,910
defined in most of our Maps so if you go

196
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,370
a nice easter egg on a lot of base maps

197
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,620
is if you zoom in really close to this

198
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,840
area you can find a null island and it's

199
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,430
usually shaped like this conventionally

200
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,400
people make t-shirts for this it has its

201
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:35,460
own Twitter it has its own flag you can

202
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,090
make it in sequel in cart 0 we built

203
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,940
this little example that uses sequel to

204
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,860
design an ISO map of null island that

205
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,050
you can then fork and use your

206
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:50,280
developments and somebody postulated on

207
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,770
the internet that because there are so

208
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,750
many projections on maps which are

209
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,400
different ways of viewing the world like

210
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,380
Mercator versus something else because

211
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,700
there are so many projections that are

212
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,180
actually

213
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,830
infinite null islands and it's a null

214
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,770
island archipelago and not an island so

215
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,810
people get really into the nerdiness of

216
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,450
it and and we love like building these

217
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,760
kind of stories right so it's not

218
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,950
necessarily as simple as a comic with

219
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,529
like very separate tiles we try to make

220
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:18,209
them as seamless as possible but the

221
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,709
story that you build in maps is very

222
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:21,930
analogous so I chose this just because

223
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,649
it's a part of a longer XKCD comic but

224
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,720
it includes a map and then also i

225
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,610
replaced the cryptography up there with

226
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,149
cartography because the way that you

227
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:35,399
built web maps a few years ago or 10

228
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,850
years ago is ah was very much like a

229
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,060
cryptographic a complex process and I'll

230
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,290
talk about that in a bit and how we

231
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,810
improved on it so how is this related to

232
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,790
comics well cardo CSS is kind of like

233
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,970
the onomatopoeia of maps it applies this

234
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,750
wow factor this POW this like

235
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,310
stimulation of movements and a dynamism

236
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,920
in ways that maps wouldn't have

237
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,660
naturally without some kind of CSS

238
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,940
properties and it makes it easier to to

239
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,860
access those kind of styles which we're

240
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,810
available before in XML and in other

241
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,240
formats but not as easy for developers

242
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,070
to grog so origin stories you talk about

243
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,870
origin stories with Superman or with

244
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,430
Wonder Woman so we'll talk about them

245
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,220
with Curtis ESS this is an architectural

246
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:25,620
diagram of components of osm and so I'll

247
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,390
talk a little bit about map Nick which

248
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,459
is the renderer of the tile renderer for

249
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,860
typical raster maps and I know what some

250
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,260
in particular post Chiss is like a

251
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,600
querying add-on on top of a Postgres

252
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,680
database and then up here openlayers and

253
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,790
leaf litter things you might be familiar

254
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,560
with if you've done any map development

255
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,070
on the web there is libraries and layers

256
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,959
that you can use for your base layers

257
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,150
and you can also swap in a lot of other

258
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,790
base maps so this is the kind of no

259
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,529
pseudo architecture that we dealt with

260
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,420
before and this part over here is kind

261
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,779
of how people edited osm or used to edit

262
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:03,029
osm now I think Matt box built a fancy

263
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:06,209
or GUI for it but ja 'some and pull

264
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:09,350
latch they have very tough names to say

265
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,959
but I just pulled this from and you can

266
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,670
get the link from the slides in the

267
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,540
comments this is part of a I think 54

268
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,999
slide deck that describes how to set up

269
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:24,240
a web map with osm and this is just the

270
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,490
part that talks about math Nick style

271
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,860
sheets so the XML style sheets that I

272
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,259
described before it's I think 10 some

273
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:33,209
slides and at the end of all of these

274
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:34,980
slides you finally get something that

275
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,389
says now that we've got all the

276
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:38,699
necessary software installed you need to

277
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,559
configure some of the software to work

278
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:42,509
correctly so even after installing it

279
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:44,819
it's still not going to work for you and

280
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:46,559
this is the kind of the process that you

281
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,189
had to go through with maps before right

282
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:52,379
so then came along all of these

283
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,899
companies that are super pro web

284
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:57,720
mattebox developed cardo CSS which is a

285
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,110
map Nick style preprocessor that

286
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,389
inherited from cascade Nick which is

287
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,009
like cascading style sheets but with the

288
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:07,920
map Nick end so they developed it and

289
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,290
developed a kind of gooey for dealing

290
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,029
with it called tile mill which they've

291
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:13,920
been deprecated and recently deprecated

292
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,839
crow CSS but other people have picked it

293
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,629
up so it's not totally dead stamen

294
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:20,910
designs beautiful base maps and they do

295
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,769
a lot of tutorials and things in carlow

296
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:25,920
CSS too so they make some very

297
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,509
sophisticated designs and they are

298
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:29,339
actually a contract company for places

299
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:30,720
who want to make very distinctive base

300
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,839
maps maps n is cool they're a company

301
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,799
that does a lot of WebGL like really

302
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,730
experimental advanced things under a

303
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,769
samsung grant that seemingly is endless

304
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:44,369
and there are awesome people who also

305
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:46,139
contribute to cart 0 CSS and then cardo

306
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,749
is a company that i used to work for

307
00:12:48,749 --> 00:12:51,059
used to be called card ODB but they now

308
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:52,740
maintain the documentation and have

309
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,139
integrated cardo CSS into their default

310
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:56,910
GUI so those are the companies that are

311
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,819
kind of contributing to to this

312
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:02,249
processing community so if you're

313
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:05,189
editing in it in cardo if you're editing

314
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:07,799
a map in card oh I should say then you

315
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,990
get a GUI interface like this if you log

316
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,939
in you can also use the JavaScript

317
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:14,730
libraries and api's to access all of the

318
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,910
features of post just querying and cardo

319
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,490
CSS but but if you're just a regular

320
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,030
user trying to make a map

321
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,620
on the web in the browser then you can

322
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,660
use this interface which will let you

323
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,050
select different like buttons and colors

324
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,940
and things and then it will generate

325
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,800
curto CSS for you so you don't

326
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,480
necessarily need to know how to write it

327
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,820
but you can also edit CSS directly in

328
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,250
the kind of pull up tree on the side so

329
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,390
it looks sort of like this so you get

330
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,340
some like CSS where you have a sequel

331
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,230
tray as well that allows you to query

332
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,960
the data in your database in your

333
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,270
Postgres database and you can style it

334
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,880
and view it on the fly so the tiles kind

335
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,190
of update on the fly as you're editing

336
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,750
those things so this is the architecture

337
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,000
of that set up and I'm only mentioning

338
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,490
it because people like to know how

339
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,710
things are developed so this is how

340
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,050
cardo works at least they has an editor

341
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,360
interface on the right side and then

342
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,480
there's all of the libraries and api's

343
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,980
and set up for if you were going to

344
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,620
install cardo yourself and you don't

345
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,100
want to use the company as a host so

346
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,290
postgres posts just math neck you'll see

347
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,680
here to torque has its own render it's a

348
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,830
special renderer for time series data so

349
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,090
that's there there's red is for some

350
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,910
other things Maps API and sequel API

351
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,640
allow you to query your data as its

352
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,040
sword in Postgres and pull it into

353
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,690
anything so you could technically pull

354
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,580
it in as JSON and make charts and graphs

355
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,670
to you don't have to be bound to maths

356
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,800
and then the Maps API allows you to pull

357
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,360
particular maps that you've already made

358
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,100
in the GUI for example or that you have

359
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,590
stored and styled and here are a bunch

360
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,170
of JavaScript libraries this that jumps

361
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,640
around your map so you can create these

362
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,360
narratives torque is for time series

363
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,130
data Beck Nick is the vector tile

364
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,180
library that I'm going to be talking

365
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,750
about a little bit and then card ojs is

366
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,430
just the basic library for making maps

367
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,770
and cardo CSS fits somewhere along here

368
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,880
right it also is in the editor but but

369
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,340
if you're using the library's then you'd

370
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,370
want to include it so anatomy of

371
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,060
courtesy of that structuring your styles

372
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,710
courtesy SS is a little bit different

373
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,870
than regular CSS so with regular CSS you

374
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,540
have selectors for elements but with

375
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,100
carlos es su have selectors four

376
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,080
elements and data sets so if you have a

377
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,590
data set

378
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,900
null Island you can call that here and

379
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,640
then you can style particular aspects of

380
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,430
the data set and it allows you to do

381
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,290
nested styles you can create named

382
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,600
variables you can have attachments or

383
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,830
pseudo elements and I don't think

384
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,090
there's one here but I'll show one in a

385
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,410
bit that allows you to create glow

386
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:55,180
effects and it's pretty awesome when you

387
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,790
can kind of write pretty complex CSS

388
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,250
formats so here's an example for the

389
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,080
null island map this is an election map

390
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,420
for Knohl Island so we divided it into

391
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,990
districts and created a mix and another

392
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,690
party and each of those parties was

393
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,360
vying for election writes an island or

394
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,900
vote in el island and here's the CSS for

395
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,360
that it looks a little bit messy but but

396
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,920
it isn't and here's the pseudo elements

397
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,910
that I talked about so you can also

398
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,980
style labels I'll talk a little bit

399
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,540
about the symbolize errs to that you can

400
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,290
access in kurtal CSS I mentioned tidal

401
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,720
mill before it's been deprecated you can

402
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,460
still run it locally and you can still

403
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,530
create batch tiles but if you want to

404
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,000
create tiles on the fly you can use

405
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,790
cardo and they have a more sophisticated

406
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,310
setup now called turbo cardo which I'll

407
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,190
show you in a bit that allows you to

408
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:51,070
create automated ramps for CSS that are

409
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,340
quite sophisticated and I'm very cool so

410
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,620
turbo kardos like this you can create a

411
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,330
simple instead of having message styles

412
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,430
or if then statements like you see well

413
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,170
you don't see me if then but there's

414
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:06,730
lots of CSS there whoops and you can

415
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,350
collapse that into two one or two lines

416
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:12,700
with turbo cardinal so here's an example

417
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,800
to and if you look at the slides and

418
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,740
I'll also share the links at the end and

419
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,680
there's kind of this block that Raul

420
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,959
built that allows you to generate a lot

421
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,270
of different colors and styles and shows

422
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,620
you how turbo cardo kind of makes your

423
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,520
CSS more concise so symbolize errs are

424
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,150
superheroes with special properties maps

425
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,560
are composed of points lines and

426
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,600
polygons mostly if you're applying data

427
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,820
you're either creating countries or you

428
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,410
have points that your marketing or you

429
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,880
have lines like bike lanes or something

430
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,330
and then attached to each of these

431
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,530
symbolizes which have properties

432
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,140
are the geometries that they correspond

433
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,850
with so points lines and polygons or

434
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,890
sometimes raster's which are the image

435
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,800
ones that I mentioned before so you can

436
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,240
also style buildings you can style a lot

437
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,920
of components of your maps or your map

438
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,280
data in interesting ways so here's some

439
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,110
awesome maps let's go over some examples

440
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,300
of what you can do with cardo CSS for

441
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,050
simple styles this is a project very

442
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,090
simple project that I worked on in

443
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,970
Madrid there's an open data portal and

444
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,070
you can download a bunch of things but

445
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,440
they have a different spatial reference

446
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,320
system in Madrid then everyone else uses

447
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,300
and so they give you data but it's kind

448
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,100
of useless because when you load it on

449
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,660
to anybody's base map it's going to be

450
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,030
off slightly and in weird ways like

451
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,950
sometimes it's off this way sometimes

452
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,420
it's slightly moved over so when I

453
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,840
downloaded all of these bike lanes they

454
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,150
were slightly moved to the right and up

455
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,590
a little bit so I had to write some

456
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,810
sequel to move them back down but with

457
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:47,320
CSS you can also allow people to see

458
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,380
kind of glow effects around the biplanes

459
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,120
or at different zoom levels you can

460
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,950
create conditionals that allow people to

461
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,860
see more of the information at certain

462
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,560
zoom levels so what I have here is just

463
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,520
the CSS or the sequel for transforming

464
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,860
all of that data into the correct

465
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,080
spatial reference system and then some

466
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,160
simple CSS with a glow effect so this is

467
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,870
kind of the CSS that you would write for

468
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,460
something like this with red lines and

469
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,050
like a yellow an ugly yellow halo and

470
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,450
it's used in a project it's actually out

471
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,520
of 10 site is called bike storming or

472
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,940
spoke now they've renamed it but they

473
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,060
use glow lines in in their design of

474
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,560
bike lanes in different places this is

475
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,020
New York and you can apply layers of

476
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,960
data but all of their lines glow and

477
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,310
that's because they use those pseudo

478
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:43,870
selectors so base Maps base maps are

479
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,760
very cool stamen designs a lot of really

480
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,980
awesome ones the watercolor base map is

481
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,450
at the top and over here there's a

482
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,460
terrain base map and there's a

483
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,140
toner-based map and base maps are kind

484
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,200
of just like the base layer of of any

485
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,300
map without necessarily applying data on

486
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,980
top of it so sometimes it'll include

487
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,070
labels like the one

488
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,809
the center that has like places labeled

489
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:04,309
and sometimes it'll just include

490
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:06,500
features like the watercolor base map

491
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,090
and toner is the most basic of base maps

492
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,220
kind of like toner that you would I

493
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,779
don't know apply to your skin right to

494
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:16,309
clean the off it's like the most basic

495
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:18,259
and I picked these images from comics

496
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:21,970
because it shows some of the like

497
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,950
complexity of toner as a base map it

498
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,409
allows you to create patterns and to

499
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:30,440
erase patterns in buildings or roads or

500
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,710
whatever so you get different levels of

501
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,659
resolution with your map so for example

502
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:37,370
this one is kind of a little bit of a

503
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,159
hack but because the same and base maps

504
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,960
are built with cardo CSS you can also

505
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,450
use cardo CSS to override their defaults

506
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,009
so in this case you could make the

507
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:47,570
background colors transparent and only

508
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:51,350
save the labels or you could make like

509
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,450
the labels transparent oi that's a typo

510
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,710
but you could make the labels

511
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,600
transparent and only have like the rows

512
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,840
and features and this one is a little

513
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,730
bit more complicated but it's just

514
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,679
applying a pattern to the buildings

515
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,450
because remember buildings or symbolize

516
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,909
errs in cardo CSS so you can apply this

517
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:10,669
little hash pattern on them and you can

518
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,980
specify it as a PNG or whatever you can

519
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,120
also create some pretty interesting

520
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,100
patterns with sequel but that's apart

521
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,870
from caro CSS and here you can see the

522
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,850
zoom conditionals that i talked about

523
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,700
before you can also style on like if the

524
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,100
data if the area that's in a column in

525
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,259
your data set is above a certain amount

526
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:30,799
then you change the pattern or you apply

527
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,809
a different CSS style so you can create

528
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:35,110
this very interesting and complex

529
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,570
situations this is a project at a stamen

530
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,330
that's actually a browser-based project

531
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,429
you it limits you to four layers but you

532
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:45,500
can generate cardo CSS in the browser

533
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,720
and make your own base maps and then it

534
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,220
batch creates the tiles kind of like

535
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,500
what tile mill used to do so you should

536
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,460
check it out if you're interested in

537
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:56,029
that label magic so a lot of times when

538
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:57,379
you're zooming on maps you don't really

539
00:21:57,379 --> 00:21:59,899
think about how everything adjusts so

540
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:01,879
naturally and seamlessly right all of a

541
00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:04,159
sudden labels are appearing for certain

542
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,049
things as you're zooming closer and how

543
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:08,450
does that happen there are lots of

544
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,919
different ways to make it happen these

545
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,200
are a series of base maps that I'll show

546
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,060
that are used for Pinterest

547
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,440
so they have their own map design and

548
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,780
you can write little regex like rules in

549
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,170
CSS to say you know keep or hide the

550
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,810
text name keep it blank at a certain

551
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:32,480
level or in a certain circumstance with

552
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,710
a certain number of characters for

553
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,470
example so if there are too many

554
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,900
characters like maybe if this were a bit

555
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,640
longer and it wouldn't fit or conflicts

556
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,050
with another thing or there's not enough

557
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,150
space between the other two labels it'll

558
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,600
collapse them out and then also for

559
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,460
orientation sometimes there are places

560
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,560
that are a bit longer like California

561
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,900
Chile how are you going to write the

562
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,330
same name as you would for the other

563
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,130
states if it doesn't fit or for example

564
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,590
United States is here Kansas has to

565
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,420
twist to the side so you can create

566
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,370
rules that say like if the characters

567
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,800
are a certain amount twist it a certain

568
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,280
way and that's kind of a hack but but

569
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,040
you can do it composite operations

570
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,990
they're kind of like blend modes like I

571
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,990
think we heard about earlier today and

572
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,610
there are many of them that you can

573
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,350
apply you can create your own base maps

574
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,710
this way by layering data on top of the

575
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,540
regular base map so this is just several

576
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,370
I think it's for data layers with

577
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:32,360
different composite operations and it

578
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,100
creates a kind of bath you metric maps

579
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,070
so you can create depths in oceans based

580
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,260
on scientific information so that's

581
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,870
pretty cool and you should totally check

582
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,120
it out and then this is just an example

583
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,190
of the kind of base map effects you can

584
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,840
do so this is the base map I made very

585
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,610
quickly by just painting the whole

586
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,300
canvas blue applying a layer of polygon

587
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,490
information for countries and then

588
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,770
styling it white and then on top little

589
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,930
Argentina is like here you can see that

590
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,580
it has a little glow around it if you

591
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,170
look closely actually there's like a

592
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,180
blue glow around the so it stands out

593
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,100
from the rest of Latin America and this

594
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,220
is people tweeting about the elections

595
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,920
during the first election of Maori

596
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,020
Samaki and there's their hashtags

597
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,530
cambiemos I feel braver and so there was

598
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,090
an explosion of being lost at the

599
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,560
end

600
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,160
oh and here's the CSS for it so you can

601
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,050
create fills and backgrounds and blurs

602
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,820
so the image filters that you see here

603
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,970
too you can apply in curto CSS so

604
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,040
conditional zooms I talked about it a

605
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,020
little bit earlier so I won't really go

606
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,640
into it but you can create these kind of

607
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,590
conditional rules and you can do the

608
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:43,270
same for zoom levels so for the Madrid

609
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:47,150
cycleways at certain zoom levels lesser

610
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,430
than or equal to 16 for example it's one

611
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,250
color and then at 14 it's a different

612
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,650
color that's a pretty simple basic

613
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,060
example but there are lots of other

614
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,200
things you can do at different zoom

615
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,400
levels that you might want to do like I

616
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,430
said make make the labels disappear or

617
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,980
something and this is an example with

618
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,950
torque it has its own special properties

619
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:11,900
on pseudo properties and this is tweets

620
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,270
about Nepal it wasn't a kind of an

621
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,490
experiment we did to see how we could

622
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,610
maybe make the torque CSS of it easier

623
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:21,410
so I different zoom levels you want the

624
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:26,060
plumes are the offset of the bubbles to

625
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,670
be different because at some Zumba you

626
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,230
might want them to kind of overlap and

627
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,550
occlude each other and that another zoom

628
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,630
levels you want them to get kind of

629
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,210
smaller so they don't totally overwhelm

630
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,130
the screen so this is the kind of setup

631
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:41,360
that you would have for that a color by

632
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,290
category so for the null island election

633
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:49,070
map you would kind of create categorical

634
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,750
rules so there's a type of map called a

635
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,910
chloroplast map that maybe people have

636
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,280
heard of that colors regions or polygons

637
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,130
or points or even lines based on their

638
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,770
numerical value in the data set but for

639
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,660
categorical maps say you have votes that

640
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,570
are like yes or no those are strings you

641
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,160
can't create a claw reply that of that

642
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,540
you have to create a categorical map

643
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,280
which in this case is what happened so

644
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,170
the winning party column in the data set

645
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,940
if it was Nick's or if it was not it had

646
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,130
a different color and the labels were

647
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,370
the same so you can create those kind of

648
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,040
conditionals that style the the map that

649
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,460
way with not so much the SS and that's

650
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,910
then the result

651
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:30,490
so torque tile styling so I'll show a

652
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,080
few examples of what torque looks like

653
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,210
this is a project from info Amazonia in

654
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,840
Brazil they were tracking wildfires and

655
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,270
they wanted to kind of give these glow

656
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,060
effects to the torque points so you can

657
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,830
do this in CSS it's not just like the

658
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,900
plumes that you saw before with the

659
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,440
Nepal map it's a bit more like brilliant

660
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,920
and ensigns a bit you can also create

661
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,160
heat maps so this is a activity of snow

662
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,040
plows in Chicago with a tracker attached

663
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,260
to them and the person who designed the

664
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,720
map wanted to track to see where the

665
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,250
snow plows were going during snowstorms

666
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,340
because maybe an elected official lives

667
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,050
in an area that gets plowed all the time

668
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,940
and someone you know they don't plow the

669
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,410
poor areas because they don't care about

670
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:18,700
them so they ended up finding that there

671
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,410
was like a cluster over here I think

672
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,210
where there's a lot of activity and he

673
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,920
thought oh I bet there's an alderman or

674
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,200
governor who lives there and it turned

675
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,670
out it was just like a little snow plow

676
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,380
car park it was like where all the snow

677
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,230
plows went to bed and so it wasn't

678
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,910
actually a real story but it's still a

679
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:37,300
beautiful map right so this is a project

680
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:41,220
a euro bird portal that allows you to

681
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,260
kind of side by side view the migration

682
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,400
of certain birds as they've been

683
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,370
observed by the community along with

684
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,590
environmental factors like temperature

685
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:52,000
rainfall so you can see as it gets

686
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,180
warmer the birds move north and then as

687
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,880
it gets colder they move south again and

688
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,080
you can apply a bunch of other features

689
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,820
but you can do these the same kind of

690
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,050
things in torque you can do side by

691
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,940
sides you can coordinate them with the

692
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,520
open libraries with card ojs for example

693
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,940
and what else is looking to say about

694
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,430
this oh you can also do custom

695
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,900
projections so this is a custom

696
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,480
projection a group out of Catalunya was

697
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,430
leading this project and they wanted the

698
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,530
projection that makes Catalunya look the

699
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,290
biggest and the most profound so they

700
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:25,690
picked a different projection and this

701
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,400
is a project that layers torque on top

702
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,860
of a categorical map so the CSS rules

703
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,560
would mix between the two and it's just

704
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,050
openstreetmap edits of roadways in nepal

705
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,730
after the

706
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:40,940
after the earthquake so you can see kind

707
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,290
of like little plumes of activity this

708
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,270
is just an animated gif as people are

709
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,850
editing and all of the osm data is open

710
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,160
so you can download everyone's edits I

711
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,720
had to order it according to the time or

712
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,730
like the entry number that is

713
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,380
auto-generated and no sm because they

714
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,360
don't allow you to see the timestamps so

715
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,190
it's a bit of a hack to see where people

716
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,710
are editing over time but but these are

717
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,840
the kind of CSS rules so you have types

718
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,570
of different roadways as they're

719
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:10,940
categorized or tagged in osm and you can

720
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,740
apply colors to them so the CSS rules

721
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,220
would look like this and the sequel like

722
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,210
i said is ordering by the osm ID and for

723
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,010
the torque component it's doing all of

724
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,169
these things so there's a lot of like

725
00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:26,540
special properties on the map element

726
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,630
for torque and mostly controlling like

727
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:32,179
the offset and the how big like the

728
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:35,299
trail is of the plume right now torque

729
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:39,650
is really good for points it's not super

730
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,840
great for polygons or lines you can't

731
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,679
like animate lines in the same way but

732
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:46,850
you can kind of do a hack that I'll show

733
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,400
you in a bit to sort of mimic polygons

734
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,549
with points so map Nick and Beck Nick

735
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:55,040
Beck nick is a vector tile render so

736
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,400
unlike map Nick which relies on tiles to

737
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,900
like forward next to each other and has

738
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,910
this slow load time vector mapping is a

739
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,490
lot more fast and sophisticated it also

740
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:07,940
allows you to the the geometries are

741
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,679
kind of more amenable to interaction so

742
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,860
you can apply like hovers and a lot of

743
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,080
other features that would be kind of

744
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,880
kludgy and difficult to get to render

745
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,760
with a raster map so you can do a lot

746
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,950
more animated things without loading

747
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,980
tiles so you should check out bec Nick

748
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,840
if you're interested so JavaScript

749
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,559
library and torque bubble maps so this

750
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,559
is kind of the hack that I talked about

751
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:35,720
that's sort of related to points so by

752
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,460
changing some aspects of of the torque

753
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:44,540
properties you can make points below to

754
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,549
cording to the data and look a little

755
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:47,600
bit bigger a little bit more like

756
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,530
polygons so it's

757
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:51,560
kind of more artistic interpretation of

758
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,000
what would be the default for torque

759
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,470
which is just everything kind of grows

760
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:59,960
in the same or plumes in the same way so

761
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,670
pop maps cardo CSS and it's compliments

762
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,870
because we're talking about pop art and

763
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:08,270
about comics I think this quote from

764
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,940
andy warhol's pretty good at

765
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,110
encapsulating how we behaved when we

766
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,560
worked on Carlos CSS at cardo there were

767
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,510
a lot of experiments torque was a like a

768
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,210
side project on the weekends a lot of

769
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:23,960
our some our core features were actually

770
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,730
just built over a few days with a few

771
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,950
friends so it's kind of whatever you can

772
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,240
get away with and a lot of the hacks

773
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,290
have been showing are things that

774
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,210
wouldn't necessarily be best practices

775
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,670
in cardo CSS but are definitely a way to

776
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,800
get something done if you need to and

777
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,300
there's a flexibility in what it will

778
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,740
allow to render so that's pretty awesome

779
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,980
so this for example this is not a map

780
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,810
but it's made with mapping software so

781
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:50,840
this is cardo the GUI interface i showed

782
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,700
you before but instead of having a base

783
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,070
map they just load it in a PNG an image

784
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,890
and then use torque to animate an

785
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,540
animated gif of a guide like jumping

786
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,240
over a thing so you can make stuff like

787
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,860
this to you can make web art with

788
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:08,650
mapping software and mapping libraries

789
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:11,990
so just for fun and for the pop art

790
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:16,280
example here's kind of weird map pack

791
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,060
that uses a click events to kind of

792
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,430
create onomatopoeia on a map so when you

793
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,130
click on certain states they kind of pow

794
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:29,270
like that but the cardo CSS for it

795
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,220
applies a pattern to the polygons so it

796
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,490
applies the under layer has this kind of

797
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,350
yellowish Ronald McDonald pattern and

798
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:39,470
then the other one on top is a bit more

799
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:42,380
red and creates like more contrast so

800
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,630
you can see them referenced here as P n

801
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,970
cheese you can do that in cardo as well

802
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,680
and this is the sequel to make it work a

803
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,650
lot it's pretty ugly it's pretty ugly

804
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:57,080
post kiss but on the credits gives us is

805
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,060
easy right let's like super simple and

806
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,040
concise

807
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,050
is kind of like glass but if you want to

808
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:07,280
do map interactive like click events

809
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,610
without using javascript you can do it

810
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:12,920
so I think this is a jiff that will

811
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,180
allow you yeah so you can see it just

812
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,620
like reloads it's not super

813
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,800
sophisticated but um but it does work so

814
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,090
you can do like weird stuff like that

815
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,980
like weird experimental art that isn't

816
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,530
really useful for navigation like we saw

817
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:28,700
before but is kind of fun I also run a

818
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,290
Twitter with a few co-workers called

819
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,330
Cardosi SS ponds that you should totally

820
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:35,270
follow that has a bunch of puns related

821
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:39,290
to cart 0 CSS some political pawns it

822
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:42,290
was one about Nell island somewhere down

823
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:47,930
here oh yeah but yeah display none you

824
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:51,890
should check it out and also I want to

825
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:52,970
plug if you're interested in learning

826
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:55,670
more about courtesy SS something my team

827
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,650
worked on a lot when I was at card ODB

828
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,410
was the math Academy and so we teach you

829
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:03,700
how to write post just functions how to

830
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,650
setup postgres yourself if you wanted to

831
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,600
self host we teach you about JavaScript

832
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,730
for maps we teach you about cardo CSS

833
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,230
and this particular lesson is about how

834
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,970
to make the election map for an

835
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,860
all-island so you should totally check

836
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,630
it out it has a video and a lot of cool

837
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,850
like demos and downloadable code so it's

838
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,910
very easy to approach and then at the

839
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:24,860
Mozilla science lab we also host a lot

840
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,380
of fellows so we have a fellowship

841
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,929
program that supports developers and

842
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:32,720
designers who want to write open source

843
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,970
software for science and this includes

844
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,470
the geospatial sciences like i said

845
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:40,190
before so if you want to make maps for

846
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,290
science or with scientific data then you

847
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,669
can totally do that one of our current

848
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:45,590
fellows worked on a project throughout

849
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:48,650
his fellowship called arial bold and it

850
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:51,590
uses satellite imagery and computer

851
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:55,010
vision to detect letter shapes from the

852
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,100
alphanumeric alphabet in natural

853
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,350
phenomenon like you know maybe a crop

854
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,910
circle that looks like as you know and

855
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,580
oh and then they built a web font arial

856
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,810
bold it's kind of a joke and if you go

857
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:11,570
to their little website you can type

858
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,180
message

859
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:16,050
is in satellite images and then send

860
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:19,200
them to your friends and so this kind of

861
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,140
like mapping hack projects is something

862
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,609
you could totally do with Mozilla

863
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:27,210
funding and we would invite you to do

864
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,520
really cool experiments for scientists

865
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,369
so please check out our fellowships and

866
00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:33,780
come talk to me if you have any

867
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,290
questions about that and I guess in

868
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,900
summary i guess i would say try to make

869
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,690
pop maps as in pop art maps you know

870
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,970
maps that have a lot of onomatopoeia and

871
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,670
a lot of wow because those experiments

872
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,010
lead to sometimes the most awesome and

873
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,680
sophisticated features and aim for

874
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,559
awesome so before when I said that you

875
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:57,359
know maps were not built for all they

876
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,190
were built for navigation and

877
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,109
utilitarian purposes that's totally not

878
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:04,800
true and try to render with reflex which

879
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,030
i guess is more like how your eyes

880
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,180
render right try to think about how your

881
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,460
map is going to process for a user I

882
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,369
didn't talk about browser issues or our

883
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:16,559
support for low bandwidth situations

884
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:18,030
which can be really difficult for torque

885
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:21,270
or certain libraries but you can ask me

886
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:24,150
after if you're interested and so try to

887
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:27,420
do that and that's it

888
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:34,170
[Applause]
