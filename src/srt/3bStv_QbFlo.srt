00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879

I guess I keeping with the title on the

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,740
on the schedule it's a surprise talk

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,200
what I really wanted to sorry so this is

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,250
the first talk I've been given I'm

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,839
giving in a pretty long time in large

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,690
part because I had a baby and I realized

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,380
standing in front of you right now I

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,820
should probably put pictures of my baby

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,350
in the slides did not do that

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,369
great apologies but so it's my first

11
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,590
talk in a while and that has given me

12
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,510
some time to reflect on on some things

13
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,270
and so the the talk was called surprise

14
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,180
talk and I asked a few times the the

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,890
people who run this conference like what

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:38,850
do you want me to talk about and they

17
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,260
said like really whatever you want to

18
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,170
want to talk about and of course that

19
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,250
indeed gave me a lot of time to reflect

20
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,260
on what I should talk about usually it

21
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,719
helps to have some starting point as DHH

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,570
says constraints are liberating but

23
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,770
something happened this week that

24
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,949
actually got me thinking so tom tweeted

25
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:58,320
that he wrote this post asking Google

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,309
for better engagement with web

27
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,260
frameworks in 2016 and this week they

28
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,670
delivered on my entire wish list I'm

29
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,130
truly over the moon and Benedict tweeted

30
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,780
for those of you who haven't checked out

31
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,430
the dev summit keynote by multi-and and

32
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,049
nicole frameworks are considered

33
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,820
first-class citizens now which maybe

34
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,380
would be surprised everyone in this room

35
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,240
who probably uses frameworks like what

36
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,930
does it mean that they're not

37
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,189
first-class citizens that seems like a

38
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,430
surprising piece of news and there will

39
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,920
not be close collaboration between web

40
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,840
platform of frameworks how cool is that

41
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,720
and so I realized thinking about like

42
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,880
how do you explain what it means that

43
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,710
frameworks are now for the first time

44
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,909
considered first-class citizens

45
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,909
according to chrome what does that mean

46
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,159
I got me thinking about like what my

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,649
personal journey was in getting involved

48
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,770
in web standards and I want to start

49
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,930
with a disclaimer there's like a large

50
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,030
number of people who were involved in a

51
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,560
lot of this story that I'm about to tell

52
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,969
you and I could have spent the entire

53
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:59,490
time giving credit and thanking a lot of

54
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,600
people who were part of all those part

55
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,670
of all those moments unfortunately I

56
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,479
only have 25 minutes and I really know

57
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,180
my own like my own anecdotes better than

58
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,650
everyone else

59
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,810
so I apologize up front for the fact

60
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,909
that this is gonna end up kind of being

61
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:19,220
myopic from my own perspective but

62
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,470
hopefully my perspective is helpful or

63
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:28,870
useful in some way so I started

64
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,260
programming in 2005 which was I guess

65
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:39,290
pretty late and I was I was just being

66
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,030
up I was an open source person pretty

67
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,610
early and didn't really get involved in

68
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,410
any kind of like standards work or any

69
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,120
like very serious open source work until

70
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,470
like 2008 or 2009 when I ended up

71
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,629
getting on the rails core team by

72
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:56,030
building a competitor to rails having it

73
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,440
be successful and then us getting

74
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,079
together and singing Kumbaya and merging

75
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,720
the two things together so I was pretty

76
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,430
busy up until that point like trying to

77
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,970
figure out how open-source worked and

78
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,530
for some reason like largely because

79
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,810
jQuery didn't have good Doc's I also

80
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,280
ended up being on the jQuery core team

81
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,129
around the same time period so in

82
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,680
retrospect that was a pretty early time

83
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,690
in my career to be on both of the core

84
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,160
teams but it's just where I was at at

85
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,730
the time and so I was kind of pretty

86
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,859
aware of how open-source worked how web

87
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:30,829
developers did use things like jQuery

88
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:33,139
and Rails but pretty unaware of how like

89
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:35,379
the wider programming ecosystem worked

90
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:40,489
and I started thinking because I've been

91
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:41,690
working on jQuery and I've been working

92
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,370
on rails and you know if you're working

93
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,109
on jQuery you like interact with the Dom

94
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:46,459
a lot if you working on Rails you

95
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,470
interact with like the HTML and the and

96
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,440
the HTTP spec a lot and occasionally I

97
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,699
would go into a spec to try to figure

98
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,769
out like what is it talking about and I

99
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:56,209
would it would be like really hard to

100
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:57,650
understand what's happening and so I

101
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,989
asked myself like why why is it so hard

102
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,970
like why is it that if I want to

103
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,560
understand something it's really hard to

104
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,560
understand and I started asking around

105
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,359
like other people in web standards like

106
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:10,579
hey why like what's so hard and they

107
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:12,410
said well why not like we are very

108
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,849
enthusiastic to hear your feedback why

109
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:16,579
don't you give us some feedback so I

110
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,769
took a look at web IDL which if anybody

111
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,989
is aware of probably not the best place

112
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:23,950
to have started but as I said in my

113
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,480
this is my really my first standards

114
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,950
mailing list post ever I said at the

115
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,140
urging of some folks because people

116
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,670
claim they really want my feedback I've

117
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,230
poked around and I have some feedback

118
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:37,000
and really my first post ever was like

119
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,130
I'm finding it difficult to understand

120
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,020
like I don't understand how to how to

121
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,730
use it and I think there are other

122
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,230
people in the world who are not me who

123
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:49,090
also have that same problem and the

124
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,160
response that I got back in 2009 was

125
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,960
it's a word I said don't we agree that

126
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,910
it's a worthy goal to actually have

127
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,500
aspect that people can understand and

128
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,600
the response I got was it's a worthy

129
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,160
goal but it won't be possible to make it

130
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,200
so everyone who finds it so that

131
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,340
everyone finds it easy and quick to

132
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,930
understand the current syntax is not

133
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,820
familiar to only to implementers but

134
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,260
basically anybody who's already doing

135
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,700
specs already understands it so like

136
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:15,760
sorry you're out of luck so sort of what

137
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,590
I took away from that conversation in

138
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,560
2009 is like specs are for implementers

139
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,740
and they're for specs what they should

140
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,360
do is prioritize being understood by

141
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,150
people who already understand specs

142
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,780
unfortunately this is a bit of a

143
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,520
circular problem it will mean that

144
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,930
people can stick around for a long time

145
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,450
and they will continue to elevate

146
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,340
themselves in the in the group of people

147
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,930
understand specs but nobody can get in

148
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,950
for the first time unless you're like a

149
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,210
dedicating a lot of time to it because

150
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,520
your implement or something and I

151
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,680
realized at the time that there's kind

152
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,360
of a structural problem here which is

153
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,760
that when the web creates a new feature

154
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,620
how does it get introduced in 2009 it

155
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,350
got introduced as a spec and they're

156
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,850
telling everybody like hey you know it

157
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,930
would be great it would be great if

158
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,030
everybody all the web developers gave us

159
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,730
feedback about these specs but then they

160
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,200
also tell you oh but the spec is not for

161
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,190
you you're not supposed to read specs

162
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,570
and we're not even really interested in

163
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,740
making it easier for you to understand

164
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,330
so basically my my summary again at the

165
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,390
time was basically if spec authors

166
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,070
reject the idea of making specs more

167
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,930
accessible to web developers and they

168
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,880
also require new feedback in terms of

169
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,500
specs then we're just cut out of the

170
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,470
process and sort of how I felt about

171
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,740
that in 2009 was like that like it's not

172
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,430
fair and then like maybe little

173
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,130
righteously angry little like this is

174
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,420
really not fair

175
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,220
but I think at the end of the day in

176
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,710
2009 I was like a programmer for four

177
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,250
years

178
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,630
I got enthusiastic idea in the first

179
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,740
place like you should go in and give us

180
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,420
feedback I gave some feedback I was

181
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,770
basically told this whole process is not

182
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,160
really for you so I kind of just like

183
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,770
went away for a bit and I would say that

184
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,480
I it was like oh well I actually do know

185
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,490
how to make rails and jQuery so like

186
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,920
I'll just work on that and I continued

187
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,670
to do that for a little while

188
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,660
another thing that sort of happened at

189
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,430
the same time that was given like a

190
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,810
little bit after that which gave me some

191
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,940
perspective was that John Resig who I

192
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,860
looked up to him was like clearly not a

193
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,380
new programmer at the time who created

194
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,840
jQuery was like oh it's you know would

195
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,550
be great it would really be great if the

196
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,530
Dom was as good as jQuery and there's

197
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,850
just no reason why that couldn't be the

198
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,950
case so he wrote a proposal which was

199
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,040
the Dom node list API that was if you

200
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,210
look at the date on this it says eight

201
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,550
years ago and many parts of this are

202
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,530
still not implemented or even in

203
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:43,930
proposal form and basically me watching

204
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,330
John not really succeed at getting the

205
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,160
spanish process to take this proposal

206
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,960
seriously which if you look at it says

207
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,010
you can run the test suite it has a

208
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,230
thousand plus tests right so like

209
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,700
clearly he had done like really the

210
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,870
maximum amount of work that you could

211
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,360
possibly imagine to propose and it

212
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,680
wasn't really working so I was like

213
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,450
starting to feel like there's the

214
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,680
structural problem might be like pretty

215
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,110
serious it's not just me it's not just

216
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,790
I'm a new programmer but there might be

217
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:10,060
some serious structural issues and like

218
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,310
as I sort of wrapped up working on rails

219
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,620
3 and like poked my head back up again

220
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,330
and like felt like well there's still

221
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,280
not a ton of people involved in web

222
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,970
specs like I kind of like my takeaway

223
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,980
the first time was it's really unfair

224
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,990
but like maybe I'm just overwrought

225
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,360
ating maybe it's like a personal thing I

226
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,310
eat maybe I'm making people upset or

227
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,220
maybe I'm just too green I'm too much of

228
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,290
a noob but like I came back and like oh

229
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,550
it seems like people are claiming that

230
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,200
they're very enthusiastic about it so

231
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,150
probably now that people claim they're

232
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,380
very enthusiastic if I wait a little

233
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,880
while people will actually get involved

234
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,370
but what ended up happening was I waited

235
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,740
a few years finished up my other project

236
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,700
and notice that there still nobody

237
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,310
really involved in web specs

238
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,840
and I should say there are there are a

239
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,310
handful of people who were very involved

240
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,290
I think leav Errol is an example

241
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,210
somebody who I look up to a lot and was

242
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,210
like involved very early and these are

243
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,410
people who basically put up with an

244
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,370
extreme amount of frustration in order

245
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,980
to to participate and I'm not meaning to

246
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,080
take away from their participation I'm

247
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,250
just meaning to say that there weren't a

248
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,360
ton of people involved at the time so

249
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,270
I'm like thinking about this and chrome

250
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,620
actually came out around the same time

251
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,480
right so before chrome there was like

252
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,700
Firefox and ie ie had no standards

253
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,860
Firefox had this like kind of lumbering

254
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,770
old standards participation process and

255
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,750
like kind of a lumbering old codebase

256
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,190
and chrome came out and like looked like

257
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,900
there was some enthusiasm for maybe

258
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,600
doing things differently than in the

259
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,690
past in particular like Paul Irish who

260
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,490
was kind of like a enthusiastic

261
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,930
developer evangelist before he joined

262
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,430
Google joined Google and became

263
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,170
enthusiastic developer evangelist at

264
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,410
Google and like Paul and I were both on

265
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,820
the jQuery team and we talked a lot

266
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,260
about like what can we do about this

267
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,600
like this problem seems bad it seems

268
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,620
like something we should do about it

269
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,970
like what can we do about it

270
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,589
and the first thing we said is like well

271
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:09,270
maybe if we like DDoS the spanish

272
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,370
process with a lot of feedback maybe

273
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,780
they will notice that there is more

274
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,670
feedback than they thought because one

275
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,930
of the things that people said at the

276
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,850
time was there just aren't that many

277
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,680
people who are like really capable of

278
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,210
understanding enough to give good

279
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,950
feedback they would say like oh you guys

280
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,320
are just not really capable of this so

281
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,540
we said well maybe we could just like

282
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,910
show empirically that that's not true

283
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,310
so I tweeted this thing that said like

284
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,140
what is the one browser bug you could

285
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,930
fix know what is the one browser bug you

286
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,070
could fix or feature you can add

287
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,420
significantly to improve what you can

288
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,530
build on the web and basically the idea

289
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,050
was they like the browser vendors and

290
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,029
spec authors their perspective at the

291
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:49,470
time was like you need to understand

292
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,170
very very elaborate things in order to

293
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,850
give feedback but actually this question

294
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,709
is probably the right question to ask if

295
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:57,570
you want to figure out what to do so let

296
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:02,580
me ask that question and Paul wrote a

297
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,110
blog post right afterwards

298
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,670
the feedback end you can see him we got

299
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,400
a great response 230 plus responses and

300
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,260
I was pretty shocked actually at the

301
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,850
time this is like 2009 I don't even know

302
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,080
how many people were on Twitter at the

303
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,230
time or 2011 but that was like a lot of

304
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,530
responses to get and I embedded an

305
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,360
iframe here because I couldn't think of

306
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,250
a better way of giving a sense of the

307
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,620
amount of responses that we got but

308
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,720
there were a lot of responses that were

309
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,440
actually pretty good it's actually a

310
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,150
good list to go back to now because I'll

311
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,590
surprising amount of this is not done

312
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:39,900
I'm still scrolling so anyway we I like

313
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,430
I like this one is this so we were

314
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,050
basically like maybe we can like

315
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,300
illustrate directly that there is a huge

316
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,820
amount of enthusiasm for things that are

317
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,770
just being ignored because basically the

318
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,020
idea that people can't get feedback was

319
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,640
resulting in a lack of representation

320
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,740
from of web developers which was

321
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,110
resulting in web developer interest just

322
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:07,350
not being that considered so I we did

323
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,670
that and like people noticed and I me

324
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,470
and Paul were like well we just we

325
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,430
really need to show up and actually

326
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,150
start like banging the gong but we had

327
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,010
this problem the problem that I said

328
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,980
before which is that if fundamentally if

329
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,190
spec authors are like you were not

330
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,990
willing to make specs more accessible to

331
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,910
web developers and we think that's

332
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,970
actually a bug it's like a non non goal

333
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,400
on the other hand all this all the specs

334
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,770
are coming out as specs all the proposed

335
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,660
are coming out of specs we're cut out it

336
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,830
actually seems like structurally there's

337
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:44,220
a problem so the good news about this is

338
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,060
that thinking back on this like in 2011

339
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,220
I realized that chrome really changed

340
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,520
things among other things like standards

341
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,840
bodies even though they hadn't really

342
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,300
grappled with the consequences of the

343
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,160
problem were like very convinced that

344
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,110
they wanted more developer involvement

345
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,020
and they were still repeating like

346
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,370
developers aren't don't have time for

347
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,990
this kind of grunt work or like people

348
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,340
aren't capable or whatever but

349
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,720
ultimately if you ask them people were

350
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,250
like very enthusiastic about the idea of

351
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,250
getting more help and also another

352
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,870
subtle thing that happened was that the

353
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,259
chrome

354
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:18,869
team brought in a lot of ex web

355
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:22,139
developers so people like like Alex

356
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,239
Russell who worked on dojo was now like

357
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:26,279
a person working on the C++ part of

358
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,959
Chrome so and that there were a bunch of

359
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,179
people doing that so there was

360
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:33,029
definitely a sense in which there was a

361
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:34,199
little bit of representation on the

362
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:36,179
chrome team mostly of people who used to

363
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:37,679
be web developers but there were you

364
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,299
still like remember something about it

365
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:41,729
and there was more motivation to do

366
00:13:41,729 --> 00:13:46,019
something so kind of looked at it and I

367
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,029
was like well I guess it's time to crash

368
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:50,489
the gates basically we were probably a

369
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:51,899
little over enthusiastic about what we

370
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,989
could do but I think we we felt like

371
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:56,910
basically the time is now like we did

372
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,209
this huge survey there's like a

373
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:01,259
surprising amount of things that people

374
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:03,359
want done that aren't getting done like

375
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:04,679
we should try to do something about it

376
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:08,369
and the first thing that we did was we

377
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:11,009
joined tc39 so at the time there were

378
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:13,199
zero people on Tizen 39 who worked on

379
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,539
who brought javascript or web software

380
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:18,479
for a living it was either like I would

381
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:20,839
say academics or theoreticians or

382
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:23,129
implementers of web browsers but zero

383
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:27,569
web developers on tc39 at all and today

384
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:29,489
that's not true and I'll talk about that

385
00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:33,779
as I go on but at the time like one of

386
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,009
the reasons that nobody was joining was

387
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:36,119
that there was a sense like oh you have

388
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:38,429
to pay to join tc39 so like how can you

389
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:39,749
join obviously I don't have the money to

390
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:42,679
join a pay-for-play organization and

391
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,999
turns out that if you look at the rules

392
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:48,989
of tc39 not-for-profit organizations are

393
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,179
allowed to join for no fee and the

394
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:52,829
jQuery foundation which was the group

395
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:54,749
that Paul and I were involved in at the

396
00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:56,459
time trying to do something about this

397
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,589
was a registered nonprofit so we were

398
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:01,399
able to join and we were able to become

399
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:06,149
members now I think ACMA immediately was

400
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:08,159
like oh that seems like a very big

401
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,369
loophole but I think ultimately nobody

402
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,079
wanted to say like jQuery is not allowed

403
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,209
to be on tc39 like we followed the rules

404
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:18,779
and I think that was more or less good

405
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,759
enough for for them and I think that

406
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,769
basically one of the takeaways I had was

407
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:24,359
like really pay attention to when people

408
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:27,059
say you can't do that because XYZ you

409
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:27,910
can't join TZ

410
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,200
because it will be too expensive like

411
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,000
like really investigate whether that's

412
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,640
true

413
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,420
and after joining T's 39 and becoming I

414
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,160
joined with Rick Waldron we became the

415
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,170
first two people who were web developers

416
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,130
of Tizen 39 I ran with a few people to

417
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,240
reform the w3c tag which is like the

418
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,850
steering committee I guess of w3c and

419
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,800
like I said a bunch of stuff it's like

420
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,480
probably cool blog posts to still read

421
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,250
at some point I made jokes about RFC's

422
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,860
but and and after running we won so for

423
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,460
four people ran on the idea of actually

424
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,830
getting more involvement about the

425
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,950
regular day-to-day so tc39 had problems

426
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,020
but the w3c at the time was full of

427
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,640
people who thought that the web the job

428
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,440
of a web standards body was the Semantic

429
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,850
Web which has nothing to do with the web

430
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,950
as we in this room understand it so

431
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,280
there was a big project there of like

432
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,020
resuscitating the w3c s core

433
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,870
architectural ideas around web

434
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,910
architecture and not around semantic web

435
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,650
architecture which only is the same

436
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:40,720
thing only in name only and like one of

437
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,340
the things I noticed when we joined was

438
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,920
like the tags phil was using CVS at the

439
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,890
time not not SPN like some of us might

440
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,390
remember hats they were literally using

441
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,860
CVS so I had to get like a CVS

442
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,980
accountant whatever and one of the first

443
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,810
things that we did was like just put the

444
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,240
tag on github and like you'd be

445
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,130
surprised at how controversial that was

446
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,500
but it was actually a big deal because

447
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,660
it may amend that there was a way that

448
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,640
people understood how to participate in

449
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,310
the process like get up issues and pull

450
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,100
requests that people found familiar that

451
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,870
was now how you also interacted with

452
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,710
what was frankly a pretty stodgy

453
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,430
organization that had nothing to do with

454
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,260
your needs right but if the only way to

455
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,700
participate before was like mailing

456
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,740
lists and CVS like good luck but if you

457
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,700
can file issues that helps but there was

458
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,090
still this problem so sort of the idea

459
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,160
was like we need to we need first we

460
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,540
need to have representation so like we

461
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,520
can if we want to reform any of the

462
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,690
structural problems we actually need to

463
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,250
be there and like in the place where

464
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,820
you're supposed to be to

465
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,490
we make the proposals but there was

466
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,980
still this issue of like functionally

467
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,299
this is not a rule anywhere but

468
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,429
functionally the way the web standards

469
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:51,679
feedback loop worked functionally cut

470
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,500
out web developers and I realized that

471
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,389
because of them the moment that we that

472
00:17:59,389 --> 00:18:03,169
that was in we were able to we were able

473
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,960
to really change how we thought about it

474
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,580
and I think if you think about it today

475
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,320
that problem doesn't exist anymore and

476
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,350
one of the big watershed moments was I

477
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,960
decided to reach out to all the people

478
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,210
involved in web standards who shared

479
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:20,090
basically a view of this problem and I

480
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,730
wrote this extensive web manifesto which

481
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,980
was then signed by a lot of people which

482
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,350
I'll show in a second but the key thing

483
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,059
that the extensible web manifesto said

484
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:31,669
was it's actually pretty bold it says we

485
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:32,870
want to change our web standards

486
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,639
committees create and prioritize new

487
00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:36,830
features and importantly we want to

488
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,850
tighten the feedback loop between

489
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,169
editors and web standards and web

490
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:41,000
developers so that if you if you ever

491
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,830
heard of this like it's probably worth

492
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,139
going back and reading but the key thing

493
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:47,059
was we said we have a manifesto that

494
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,620
says that we need to fix the structural

495
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,799
problem and like a cool thing about it

496
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:55,039
was a lot of people signed it so again

497
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,379
because the moment was ripe for getting

498
00:18:57,379 --> 00:18:59,179
agreement on something a lot of people

499
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,649
signed something that fundamentally said

500
00:19:00,649 --> 00:19:02,000
that the old structural problem was not

501
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,710
okay anymore so that that happened in

502
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,889
like 2013 and I could spend like another

503
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:11,629
hours talking about all the things that

504
00:19:11,629 --> 00:19:12,830
happen in between because because

505
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,500
frankly once we got to a point where

506
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,000
there was a more appropriate feedback

507
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,620
loop I wouldn't say it was perfect by

508
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,389
any means but there was like web

509
00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:22,100
developers are structurally allowed to

510
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,440
be in the conversation a lot of the next

511
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,700
like the story of the next five years is

512
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,769
like doing work like actually doing work

513
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:29,210
and I think things like service worker

514
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,000
actually landed and that like the chrome

515
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,169
team gets a lot of credit for that

516
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:35,139
but so do all the web developers who

517
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:37,669
push back against app cache not working

518
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:41,299
so well and really pushing hard on on a

519
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:43,700
new feature and like helping people who

520
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,110
are motivated to do it

521
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,720
convince their colleagues right so a lot

522
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,129
of the work of the next few years it's

523
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:52,340
really just like doing work but I wanted

524
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,419
so I'm gonna sort of skip ahead like

525
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:57,239
boring doing work part and just talk

526
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:01,529
about like by the by the by the numbers

527
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:03,509
basically so first of all I want to say

528
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:07,070
we thought a lot of work to do like

529
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,289
sorry in part in part because just like

530
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:11,940
there's a lot always a lot more to do

531
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,639
but and also in part because the problem

532
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:16,440
of under-representation and tech is not

533
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,999
limited to web developers there's a lot

534
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:19,679
of groups that are underrepresented and

535
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,320
the benefits that we got from include

536
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,940
increasing the number of web developers

537
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,149
in standards bodies is are also the same

538
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:28,499
as the benefits that you get from

539
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:29,789
increasing participation of any

540
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:32,039
underrepresented group for all the

541
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,149
reasons that the previous talk was

542
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,009
talking about so there's still a lot of

543
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:36,690
work to just actually continue to

544
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,730
increase representation in standards and

545
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,799
it and I don't want to sugarcoat where

546
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,710
we're at so I want to say that but

547
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,230
overall the sentiment that we have right

548
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:50,369
now is much healthier and part of what

549
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:53,879
that means is that we now try very hard

550
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:55,649
at least in tc39 to co-locate our

551
00:20:55,649 --> 00:20:57,600
meetings with community events like J's

552
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,659
coffee you so that we can hold things

553
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,999
like this this what was this thing

554
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:09,509
called it was called a panel so we can

555
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:11,399
hold panels and like basically everyone

556
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:14,460
at J's coffee you got to ask committee

557
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,080
members what they thought about various

558
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,999
in-flight features and like the general

559
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:20,460
process and the group of people on the

560
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,720
stage here are actually pretty

561
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,139
representative of tc39 and largely are

562
00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:28,080
people doing day-to-day JavaScript work

563
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,919
and I think that's pretty great that I

564
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,249
also just need to call out if I'm gonna

565
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:39,210
call it anybody here computer computer

566
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,570
okay dan has been doing a huge amount of

567
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,159
work to try to just increase the amount

568
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,080
of feedback that tc39 gets so this is

569
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,179
like him giving a talk on like we want

570
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,840
your help to make the next guest but

571
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,279
really what this what has been about is

572
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,169
dan has been has poured a ton of time

573
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:57,629
into creating community groups so

574
00:21:57,629 --> 00:21:59,820
there's an educator group a framework

575
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,859
group a transpiler group that is

576
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:03,749
basically just getting feedback from

577
00:22:03,749 --> 00:22:05,340
groups of people that maybe don't have

578
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,470
time or money to join tc39

579
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,360
to travel but who have very useful

580
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,549
feedback and having regular meetings

581
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:13,350
where those groups of people can give

582
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,789
their feedback about proposals and

583
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:16,380
actually bring that feedback back to

584
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,070
tc39 doing more of that has been

585
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,330
invaluable I think that's kind of the

586
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,159
next frontier at least 42:39 is like

587
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,559
just making more of these not in the

588
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,750
committee groups of people just to get

589
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:32,280
feedback funnels working and remember

590
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,380
when I joined T's 39 in the first place

591
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,600
there were no web developers working on

592
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,030
tc39 there was the best we had was

593
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,710
people who used to be web developers or

594
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:44,330
on Tizen 39 but now today there are

595
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,260
JavaScript developers who work day to

596
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,549
day on JavaScript from big companies

597
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:49,620
like Google and Facebook for small

598
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,720
companies like the one I work at Cavalia

599
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,340
and boku there's people who represent

600
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,929
frameworks there's people who represent

601
00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:56,490
libraries there's people who represent

602
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,830
compiled to JavaScript languages there's

603
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,330
people who represent transpilers like

604
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,360
Babel there's now node joined and p.m.

605
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,309
join right so now we have like it used

606
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:09,360
to be zero in 2011 and now in 20 in 2018

607
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,330
it's really a very very robust group of

608
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,799
people representing a whole bunch of

609
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:17,130
different parts of the ecosystem and it

610
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,419
just goes without saying that when you

611
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:22,159
have this many groups of people involved

612
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,900
the kinds of objections that people have

613
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,220
when they just don't have JavaScript

614
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,419
developers in the room just don't go

615
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:29,490
very far right so you could say you used

616
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,720
to be able to say like oh I don't know

617
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,460
if anybody uses function declarations or

618
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,770
whatever and now if you say like people

619
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,240
like there actually was an argument that

620
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,590
like oh we should just switch to like

621
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,120
some other thing because no one uses

622
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,250
that feature or like AMD is good enough

623
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,780
to nobody we don't need Center modules

624
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,150
or whatever and like these days

625
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,100
there's enough JavaScript developers

626
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,409
like frankly we we argue amongst each

627
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:51,179
other like we have so many people that

628
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,280
now like our now the the group of

629
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,100
JavaScript practitioners is we're

630
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,630
actually able to have debates amongst

631
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,250
ourselves without feeling like like

632
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,620
we're too small right so now there's

633
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,850
just a huge amount of JavaScript

634
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,320
developers representing a huge amount of

635
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,030
different interests on the committee and

636
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,950
I think this has been like really the

637
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:12,960
I'm very proud of this result going back

638
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,620
to the beginning of the story here

639
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,210
beginning of this talk so one thing that

640
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,159
was kind of sad that I skipped over in

641
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:20,690
between

642
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,420
2013 and 2018 is that browser developers

643
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,010
didn't always see web developers as

644
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,860
allies and part of the reason for that

645
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,980
is that as mobile took off and browser

646
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,380
vendors got squeezed for performance

647
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,880
browser vendors would go look at like

648
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,860
why is the verge calm very slow and

649
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,510
would say oh your javascript is terrible

650
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,680
and you're using this like terrible

651
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,780
framework with these terrible tools and

652
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,490
like if only everybody just hand wrote

653
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,750
everything by hand everything would be

654
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,930
better and like that is a thing that

655
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:51,560
people that is a thing that people would

656
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,530
say so Alex in 2016 who co-signed

657
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,330
extensible of manifesto and like points

658
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,860
this out in this thread basically says

659
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,600
like seriously folks it's time to throw

660
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,890
out your frameworks and see how fast the

661
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:03,830
browser can be right and basically not -

662
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,340
not to say anything about Alex but there

663
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,400
was definitely even though we like got

664
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,400
agreement across a lot of people about

665
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,550
the extensible web manifesto what

666
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,110
started like there was a period of time

667
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,120
where there was just not a very strong

668
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,610
alliance between browser vendors and web

669
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:23,870
developers especially framework

670
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,790
developers again I think a big part of

671
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,220
that had to do with mobile squeezing

672
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,660
browser vendors for performance they're

673
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,250
hearing about it from people who say why

674
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,480
is your browser so slow and they're

675
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,390
trying to figure out how to explain it

676
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:38,060
and so that's why this thing that

677
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,320
happened this week was so important so

678
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,500
Nicole got up on stage and said it's not

679
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,670
that you should throw out your framework

680
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:46,130
framework sometimes make apps lower but

681
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,360
they're also our best hope to make them

682
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,410
faster and multiple who made amp said

683
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,970
that's a bold statement and she said yes

684
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,520
that is a bold statement but the I think

685
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,470
the point is we're finally coming to the

686
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,600
end of the story here where we're

687
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,030
finally coming back to us actually all

688
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,210
being in it together which I think was

689
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,980
we had it for a moment in 2013 and I

690
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,330
think we've kind of gone around the

691
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:12,110
block a little so another thing just to

692
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:15,680
just to give them credit is they're now

693
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,360
including frameworks like the popular

694
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,470
frameworks in the intent to implement

695
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,820
process so the intent to implement

696
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,920
process is like how chrome announces

697
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,030
like we're gonna implement this feature

698
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,610
that is a standard and like people can

699
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,510
come in and be like oh that would be

700
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,160
really hard to implement or like that

701
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,510
would require a Ryoka texture of the

702
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,180
entire blah blah blah system so sorry

703
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,100
they're basically now involving frame

704
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,990
authors like myself in the process of

705
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,030
like deciding what to do and I should be

706
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,860
clear like chrome is not the web and

707
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,020
there already is a standard process that

708
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,520
web developers are already involved in

709
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,559
like because of all the work that people

710
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:49,010
have done so this is not like chrome

711
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,630
doesn't get to involve web developers

712
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,640
but there was a problem which is that at

713
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,710
the end of the day browser vendors have

714
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,210
a lot of control over what goes what

715
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,470
happens in the process because they're

716
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,150
the ones who get to ship so a big

717
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,830
browser saying like we're involving

718
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,990
regular web developers in the decisions

719
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,210
about shipping things really makes a big

720
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,620
difference in terms of like where the

721
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,150
leverage comes from in this in the

722
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,130
standards process so that's really

723
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:13,580
exciting and in general like that the

724
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,650
ballpoint 3 is like a very vague thrinng

725
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,960
thing but in general chrome has spent a

726
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,669
lot of effort in the past year more or

727
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:22,220
less of really involving web developers

728
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,659
more in their own process so like I said

729
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:28,130
I could I could give a whole talk on

730
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,330
like how to get involved but I'll give

731
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,970
you like my quick hits here so first of

732
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,070
all like if you're interested in doing

733
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,840
technical work and you want to do

734
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,090
something with standards like go ask

735
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,679
your favorite framework author like hey

736
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,570
you probably have standards goals like

737
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,250
what could I help with and there's

738
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,380
actually a lot of stuff like as much as

739
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:49,510
I made fun of the testing thing before

740
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,830
you could write tests you can do a whole

741
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:56,210
bunch of stuff so I'm just delegating to

742
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,460
your yes I see I'm almost out of time I

743
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,669
have like three slides left this thing

744
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:02,990
is the thing a lot of people don't know

745
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,419
about so this is like a really

746
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:06,440
well-organized

747
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,940
dashboard that tells you like where

748
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,909
every single tc39 proposal is by stage

749
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:15,230
each one of them links to a tc39 links

750
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,600
or repository which has regular issues

751
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,030
and regular pull requests and does

752
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,010
things the usual github way and it tells

753
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,440
you like what the progress is so

754
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,370
definitely check this out if you're like

755
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,840
I wonder what the status of that feature

756
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,580
is or how can I help move this feature

757
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:34,909
over the finish line you can also try

758
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:36,530
features out with Babel I put a star

759
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,000
there because there are some like ornery

760
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,370
tc39 members who get angry when you say

761
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,900
like oh people try it out with Babel and

762
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,610
now we shouldn't do something different

763
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,679
because people liked it I think

764
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,510
increasingly those people are not

765
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,230
winning but

766
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,840
there is definitely a sense that like we

767
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,250
shouldn't feel beholden to whatever

768
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,660
happened to ship in Babel and I think

769
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,669
like as a user trying to things out in

770
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:59,690
Babel you should realize that like I

771
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,770
said it's a big deal that things aren't

772
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,600
get out like just go to like if you're

773
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,309
wanting to talk about decorators or

774
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:05,419
optional chaining or pipeline or

775
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:07,610
whatever just go to the go to the repo

776
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:08,960
look for an issue that you're interested

777
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,600
in open an issue help write explain or

778
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,610
as facts whatever people really love the

779
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:18,679
help and I just want to close by with

780
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:20,390
the part of the extensive web manifesto

781
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,410
this is what the extensible web

782
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,169
manifesto closed with and what I

783
00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:26,840
basically said was you know the open web

784
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,480
is seen as always being behind the

785
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,100
walled garden competitors like open web

786
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,200
is seen as being worse than iOS or worse

787
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,320
than Android and there's a real good

788
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,440
reason why that's not true which is that

789
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,850
Android and iOS comes down from a

790
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,470
mountain every year and they hand you

791
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,880
the things that their developers came up

792
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,710
with and so the feedback loop is really

793
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,870
slow and when things are working well on

794
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:51,380
the web we have a path for good ideas

795
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,940
from web developers to become a part of

796
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,070
the infrastructure of the web and what I

797
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,350
said in the extensive web manifesto that

798
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,809
got so many so many signatures is we

799
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:01,220
have to enable web developers to build

800
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,290
the future of the web and I think more

801
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:05,570
than ever now that's possible and I so I

802
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,040
would encourage everyone here to help

803
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,809
build a future of the web thank you very
