1
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,720

yeah here to introduce you to unify

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,900
unifiers nice little framework we have

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,570
created and I first must say that I'm

4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,880
really happy to be here because it's a

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,580
pretty complicated thing to release open

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,070
source software and such a big company

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,680
I'm I'm really really happy that we have

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,380
worked it out finally so it was quite a

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,600
process about half a year of work maybe

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,440
but finally it's it's done and I'm

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,890
really happy to share it with you today

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,990
so some words about me I'm software

13
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,650
developer at Deutsche Telekom in yeah

14
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,220
near Frankfurt a city called darmstadt

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,350
and I will lead developer and initiator

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,490
of the unified framework some of you may

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,280
know me from cooks too which was a

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,799
framework I worked previously on so one

19
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,880
thing we had at our company is the

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,530
issues that we need to create mobile

21
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,679
applications and mobile applications for

22
00:01:14,679 --> 00:01:17,770
a lot of different platforms so we have

23
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,060
some kind of fragmentation issue and I

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,530
think as many of you might already know

25
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,450
about it because there's so many

26
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,429
different systems and nearly every

27
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:29,079
system has another programming language

28
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:31,990
and technology on it so you can't easily

29
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,710
port one application from one platform

30
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,329
to another platform and even if it's not

31
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:43,329
yet sure how the market with your

32
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:47,590
continued to evolve we finally see that

33
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,859
there will be more of them than one

34
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:52,869
platform this is really sure for the

35
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:57,009
moment so but there's one major contrast

36
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,409
which is really interesting that you

37
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:02,609
have a more operating system and more

38
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:05,340
system fragmentation in the future but

39
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,880
WebKit is an web engine which is seen on

40
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,640
more and more smartphone platforms which

41
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,730
is really quite cool because there seems

42
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,090
to be some some joint venture going to

43
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,160
WebKit where all the major windows are

44
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,080
too so our idea was to use web

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,680
technologies I like many people use them

46
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,550
as well together as html5 css3 and

47
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,120
JavaScript and build a unified

48
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,760
cross-platform environment to develop

49
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,720
applications so ideas to basically have

50
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,270
one code base which is deploy to

51
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,550
application stores like the itunes store

52
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,610
or to a typical web browser where you

53
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,380
can have a mobile web browser on a

54
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,290
smartphone or just a desktop web browser

55
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,960
or even have a widget on your desktop

56
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,180
using technologies like adobe air or

57
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,290
titanium or such things the benefits are

58
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,920
easy to list so basically we are talking

59
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,400
about reduced costs and we are a lot

60
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,100
faster so we basically improve our time

61
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,980
to market it's really marketing sling

62
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,420
here but okay yeah we have the right

63
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,580
platform support because web is

64
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,260
basically supported everywhere at the

65
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,840
moment and yes huge number of developers

66
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,940
at conferences like Jays convert seems

67
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,459
to even be increasing every year so it

68
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:43,070
seems to be really a new focus area at

69
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,140
the moment so and the technology is

70
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,370
quickly improving one goal which is

71
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,440
maybe different from other solutions we

72
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,630
have seen or might now already is that

73
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:57,830
our goal is to create real application

74
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,920
fear not just a better mobile website or

75
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:07,959
something like this so we really have a

76
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,430
zing which we try to solve is that we

77
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,620
have some kind of product manager at our

78
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,310
company which simply say yeah it's

79
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,169
pretty cool when you are more efficient

80
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:23,390
but it's not so cool if it looks not

81
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:28,090
like a native application so it will in

82
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,979
so really after this year to have the

83
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,260
same level of user experience on our

84
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,100
applications like on

85
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,220
native developed applications so this is

86
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,710
basically a quite challenging task one

87
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,410
thing for sure is that we might that we

88
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:52,140
make a massive use of JavaScript so we

89
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,030
created with interfaces and stuff

90
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,520
completely out of JavaScript directly on

91
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,570
the client to make this all possible we

92
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,170
basically have pretty strong

93
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:07,800
requirements thing is that this hardware

94
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,750
stuff is really improving year-over-year

95
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,510
so basically any moment it seems that

96
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,420
some of the stuff is only for as a top

97
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,790
notch of smartphones but in a year later

98
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,690
so on we really have a lot of devices

99
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,970
which are in the area to be supported by

100
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,080
this technology we are currently

101
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,100
regarding smartphones we are currently

102
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,580
only supporting touch screens yeah Wiz

103
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,470
do a three inch screen resolution and

104
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,450
here in something like this and we

105
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:43,050
really require a go to html5 and css3

106
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,140
support so oh it internet explorer's or

107
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,910
something like this it's really nothing

108
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:55,130
we can be care about this is ok because

109
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,950
the most applications we ask it for item

110
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,530
moment for iPhone and Android so this is

111
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,050
really the market most product managers

112
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,070
are looking at the moment so we are

113
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:11,100
increasing our platform support in next

114
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,820
month's but for the moment this is what

115
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,510
most product manager assets for so let's

116
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:22,630
give a small overview of the features

117
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,400
one thing is that we want to have a

118
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,950
professional workflow which basically

119
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:33,510
means that we want to bring JavaScript

120
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,990
some kind of professional development

121
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,880
style where you have fully

122
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,160
object-oriented to totally event-driven

123
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,890
all the stuff and you really can develop

124
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,600
your applications and your local browser

125
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,750
which is pretty efficient

126
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,140
compared to doing it on the smartphone

127
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,170
every time and have with the requirement

128
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,050
to push it to the simulators or

129
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:02,130
emulators every time we have built an

130
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,080
generic HTTP proxy witches used to

131
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,800
bridge the cross domain limitations for

132
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,870
some generic services like Twitter and

133
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,900
so on so we can basically talk to these

134
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,440
external services even if the

135
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,730
application runs on the local browser

136
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,480
which is quite limited sometimes and one

137
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,020
thing which it's really nice as well as

138
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,780
that we have worked on automating these

139
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,560
native rappers so basically you have

140
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,240
heard about phonegap already and they

141
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,450
created a built for gap com platform

142
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,960
where you can upload a zip file and just

143
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,710
build a phonegap na bit version of your

144
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,169
web application something like this was

145
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,990
our original ideas well we are not as

146
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,419
far as them at the moment I think I'm

147
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:58,950
not sure but we have at least some kind

148
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,229
of preparations for these native

149
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:03,720
applications so you basically write your

150
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,030
web app tested in safari on your own

151
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,390
machine and then just say generate me an

152
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,630
Xcode project out of it something like

153
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:19,290
this regarding the UI interface I said

154
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:25,280
that we have idea that we really need to

155
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,390
bring native feeling to the to the

156
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:34,440
smartphone so we don't try to be some

157
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,010
kind of better website so what we

158
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,530
basically have is that we in unify we've

159
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,500
created a lot of components or controls

160
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,410
which are optimized for smartphones and

161
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,440
touchscreen usage which perfectly try to

162
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,620
emulate the native stuff we found on

163
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,230
iphone and android and so on things like

164
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,790
animations and destroy view things

165
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,900
might have seen other where I on lips

166
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,740
like sprout car and Yui as well also

167
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,960
included and here full support for touch

168
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:18,400
events is just one thing as well one

169
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,960
thing we have also built in as a will

170
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,750
navigation stuff on most smartphones you

171
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,910
basically have a layered approach where

172
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:31,300
you a go deeper and navigate back then

173
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,390
so each time only one layer is visible

174
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,910
and you just drive down and up and

175
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,710
something like this this is completely

176
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,810
automated and you basically only right

177
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:45,010
links to other sub views the world

178
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,960
system makes use of the browser location

179
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,000
so basically all the stuff behind the

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,660
hash we have the will and irrigation

181
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,050
structure supported to behold in the

182
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,790
browser location so basically we can

183
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:03,160
store this will information in some kind

184
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,950
of local storage so at restarting the

185
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,470
application we basically just go to the

186
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,780
original location yeah one thing also

187
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,460
included is some kind of data handling

188
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,990
where you have some automated

189
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,300
client-side caching integrated

190
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,400
accelerator Jason converter oil stuff

191
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,710
which really improves a usability and

192
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:29,910
efficiency of the developer and we

193
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,990
unifies basically some kind of

194
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,210
integration project where we use a lot

195
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:38,230
of existing components so we thought

196
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,900
about that the application developer

197
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,030
basically should not need a lot about

198
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:46,900
the infrastructure needed to create the

199
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,360
native applications so basically there's

200
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,970
an Xcode project skeleton and an Android

201
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,250
project skeleton which you can basically

202
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,410
just use and create your own application

203
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:01,570
from there's also a lot of tooling

204
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,720
integrated so some kind of automatic

205
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,020
dependency detection and stuff and you

206
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,320
can really optimize for each platform so

207
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,350
and your final code for Android

208
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,810
basically has no information about

209
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,120
iphone stuff it's it's really compiled

210
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,560
out so there's the world code from other

211
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,390
platforms is completely removed in

212
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:30,070
removed in one of the distant of the

213
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,850
office of the target builds we have some

214
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,410
some pretty amazing CSS tooling built in

215
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,630
modular turns us later and here and you

216
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,510
really have application API viewers and

217
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,720
unit testing stuff also integrated so

218
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,590
basically you have the world stuff

219
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:54,100
offered by components we are using so

220
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,720
let's have a look at the foundation one

221
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,160
thing we headed SN requirement was that

222
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,260
all of my bosses said that we shouldn't

223
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,540
really start from scratch everywhere so

224
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,370
basically we looked out what we can use

225
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:15,040
and what makes sense for us so basically

226
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,780
at the moment we say cook stew is a

227
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,960
brilliant JavaScript framework for these

228
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,120
things like tooling and such stuff but

229
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,580
is a but at the moment it's quite

230
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,450
optimized for the desktop so there's not

231
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,640
a lot of mobile stuff but still it's a

232
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,040
good foundation then we thought adobe

233
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,320
air might be a good solution to bring

234
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,810
applications to the desktop phonegap is

235
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,260
good solution to bring applications to

236
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,950
mobile devices at the moment so you can

237
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,840
deploy your web application as a native

238
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,780
application to android and iphone ends

239
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,490
us i'm not sure how many people know

240
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,480
about it it's some kind of improved CSS

241
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,170
where you basically have a preprocessor

242
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,360
for CSS which allows you to have

243
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,160
includes mix and all this kind of stuff

244
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,530
which is really amazing which really

245
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:13,140
feared some kind of 20 years ahead of

246
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:18,310
something you write at a moment so just

247
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,730
have a small peek on the road map of

248
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,180
unify at the moment we are at

249
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,510
10 so basically we at the moment support

250
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:31,620
three platforms which is iphone OS or

251
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,700
iOS android and webos and these are the

252
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,830
three platforms currently supported for

253
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,110
smartphones we also support Windows

254
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:45,360
Linux Mac for the desktop part and we

255
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,580
really plan to support more platforms in

256
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,110
next year so a blackberry or 66 really

257
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,610
seems like a nice upgrade from the guys

258
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,310
at rim as it really brings web

259
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,370
applications to the same level as native

260
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,410
applications with the same API access

261
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,190
and stuff and regarding these nokia

262
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,440
platforms really hopes they get their

263
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,580
cutie based web runtime ready so we can

264
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:18,950
build up on this and have access to the

265
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:24,360
native stuff as well for windows phone i

266
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,029
really hope they bring ie9 as fast as

267
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:31,080
possible to the mobile stuff and Windows

268
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,180
Phone it really seems to be a decent

269
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,630
phone but yes bras I the moment is not

270
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,550
as good as it should be so I really hope

271
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:45,170
yeah with the success of i90 bring it to

272
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:50,700
the Windows Phone platform so one thing

273
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,420
we have is that we will sing is

274
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,640
published as MIT and do a license with

275
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,500
apache version 2 we thought about what

276
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,800
license to choose apache seems to be

277
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,410
quite preferred by google at the moment

278
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:16,079
and MIT is basically used by yeah a lot

279
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,480
of JavaScript projects at the moment so

280
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,329
basically every stuff I see it edge it

281
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:23,339
up at the moment seems to be MIT so the

282
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,459
best solution for us might be to just go

283
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,920
MIT as well so you can basically just

284
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,450
copy it to your stuff or

285
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,700
ya ever look at it and keep inspired by

286
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,990
it so one thing you have made seen is

287
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,090
that we have some some flyers around

288
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,930
here and yeah singers basically it's

289
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,390
nothing of this regarding coat is at a

290
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,740
moment public so it's just in internal

291
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,320
repository at the moment so basically I

292
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,020
thought it might be a good idea to bring

293
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:05,180
it live today so edgy top we had a

294
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:09,140
moment have a private repository Freddie

295
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,480
decent platform for source development i

296
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:17,050
know i think you know about it so i will

297
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:21,760
take the switch now to make it public i

298
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,280
hope this works so never done this

299
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:31,130
before so if all worked well then you

300
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,830
should now have access to jet hub com

301
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:38,060
unify / unify unifies our github name

302
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,180
and unifies also the project name you'll

303
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:47,240
find a little bit of other code as well

304
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,900
there so we have some Fox of a phonegap

305
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,270
for example where we have some minor

306
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:58,730
things added or fixed for our project

307
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,310
and we also have a fork of cooks too

308
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:05,420
which just contains a few things more or

309
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,720
less and so original one and here you

310
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,560
might have a look here as well and just

311
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,470
give you just give you a little peek on

312
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,170
how such applications look like you

313
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:22,490
might have a look at our video on the

314
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,850
homepage we basically I thought it might

315
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,770
be a good idea to start it here as well

316
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,830
so you might have a look this was one

317
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,750
application we created for the soccer

318
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,640
championship something like this in the

319
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,820
last year so it's not a really recent

320
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,720
version of unify but

321
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,049
you get an impression what it's done

322
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:47,220
yeah what's possible with this

323
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,000
frameworks I'm not sure how well it's

324
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,520
seen there so it's pretty pretty dark

325
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,799
style yeah this is a custom-made your

326
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,169
scissors elastic scroll views and other

327
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:04,169
stuff and basically the real component

328
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:15,630
system and yeah so you have segmentation

329
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,220
controls and such things so you have

330
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,950
basically the typical iphone like

331
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:24,539
navigation but you also have as with

332
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,400
animation stuff and you can click around

333
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,159
in these applications and straw it's for

334
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:36,840
them one thing which is really automated

335
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,210
here is the will sing like data loading

336
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:43,320
and stuff so basically if you start the

337
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,350
application again you basically started

338
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,750
same position as you were as you left it

339
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,580
even if there's some dynamic data

340
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,340
involved so basically every information

341
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,140
is kept in local storage and so on so

342
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,169
yeah you might get some further

343
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:03,960
information on our rent mini new

344
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,850
homepage it's at the moment it's still a

345
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,210
redirect to some github page which is

346
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:14,880
pretty easy to create and so we are not

347
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,309
sure how how long it will be hosted

348
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:19,500
there but for the moment just enter

349
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,780
unified project arc or just go directly

350
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,510
to the jetta page and get an impression

351
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:31,559
about what we have done so far yeah so

352
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:34,020
i'm basically done with my presentation

353
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:45,969
are there any questions yep

354
00:19:45,979 --> 00:20:12,230
yep

355
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,370
not really i'm singers at deutsche

356
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,480
telekom is a pretty huge company we

357
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,400
basically have a lot of separate

358
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,460
divisions there says one part which is

359
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,549
t-mobile which is also known in the US

360
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:30,760
and so on and they basically decide what

361
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,980
handset say bye or create contracts with

362
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,520
our stuff is basically from the App

363
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,860
interest so we have also a few portraits

364
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:49,210
which are key in Germany available so

365
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,970
like emo Scout or such things and these

366
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,000
are asking us for applications and this

367
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,010
is a completely different story so this

368
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,900
is not really involved with the handset

369
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,030
stuff so it's really a separate seeing

370
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,100
where we just look how to make

371
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,880
applications for the most prominent or

372
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,380
successful other platforms we already

373
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,039
own so it's it's not that connected to

374
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:17,620
each other

375
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:23,280
and no no no and we have some internal

376
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,270
software development and it's completely

377
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:33,890
a separate thing but it's closed for the

378
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,680
company only it's not available for

379
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,840
contracting and such things so yeah any

380
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:54,090
other questions

381
00:21:54,100 --> 00:22:10,270
so

382
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,549
and since that it's a huge movement at

383
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:17,429
the moment so basically every framework

384
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:20,460
which is already existing like sentra

385
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:25,650
maybe this yes origins in X J's and some

386
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,470
some frameworks like sprout car also

387
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,510
support touch strings and cooks itself

388
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:35,160
also improves as well so I'm not sure

389
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,679
how this will evolve in the future and

390
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,659
there are some different EDL's for sure

391
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:45,600
so basically jQuery Mobile has really

392
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,840
the idea of supporting a broad range of

393
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,039
devices while unify basically only tries

394
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,470
to bring native look and feel to the

395
00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:00,750
devices which have power to support this

396
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,990
so basically we are not trying to

397
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:08,190
support Sumi NSA s60 at the moment so

398
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,010
basically it's just not powerful enough

399
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:15,539
and we have communicated this internally

400
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:18,059
already so basically our ideas to really

401
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,880
bring native like applications to the

402
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,740
smartphones because this is what our

403
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,940
product managers asked for and this

404
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,620
might be different and some other

405
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,960
solutions out there and we really try to

406
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,480
have pixel perfect iphone style

407
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,429
applications nothing where something is

408
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:38,070
offset or something like this it should

409
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,650
really look like a native applications

410
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,510
and feels like a native application as

411
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:47,010
well
