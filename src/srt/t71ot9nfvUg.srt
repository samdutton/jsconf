2
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,859
bacon but i'm gonna get straight to the

3
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,380
point this time i am that bacon gether

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,960
he saw a talk in the guy milano hey that

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,090
bacon guy over the weekend which is

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,189
awesome there's something he said for

7
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,550
that but you know bacon it's beautiful

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,000
it's delicious nutritious but i'm not

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,980
going to talk about baking today sorry

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,790
because I'm right now one first of all

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,050
how many people are having an awesome

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,399
time this weekend's it's been amazing

13
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,559
right this is my first time in Berlin

14
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,180
and I really want to thank everybody

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,899
who's uh put me in a cab so yeah I but

16
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,640
in general i'm excited about javascript

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,050
but i'm really excited about something

18
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,329
else more excited than bacon if you can

19
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:05,280
believe it and he likes it like so

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,770
freakin excited i spent like the past

21
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,479
two weeks trying to make this demo

22
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,060
didn't quite work but i got almost there

23
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,400
but I was like I've you know I'm working

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,409
this is not my full-time job full time

25
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,090
i'm i'm working on a different article

26
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,070
real company and I've been like sneaking

27
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,530
away hours from actually writing company

28
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,960
code to write some stuff here this is

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,939
going to be on the internet I probably

30
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,079
shouldn't say that so anyway let's flash

31
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,229
back for a second I wanted like some tie

32
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,509
dye hear but I I couldn't find like a

33
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:37,650
good ty dice

34
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,070
so this is good enough September 2009 so

35
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,120
long ago I'd give a talk at jquery comp

36
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,570
right pretty soon after I least Sam me

37
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,660
and some people started using it first

38
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,770
of all how many people have ever used

39
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,470
Sammy in the room how many people know

40
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,320
what it is okay how many people were at

41
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,690
Frank's talk on thursday at berlin j/s

42
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:04,260
ok cool all right anyway since Amy's a

43
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,900
simple library that I rode i'm going to

44
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,460
go more into describing it later but

45
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,090
basically and I guess that's a year a

46
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,900
little over a year ago I gave this talk

47
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,790
of jQuery confer and I wrote a blog post

48
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,950
to you that got on hacker news and I had

49
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,780
to fight off some trolls and the basic

50
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,980
premise was that I wanted to envision

51
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,970
not that I was the first one to do it

52
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,910
but I felt like we had tools now where

53
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,000
we could envision this world where you

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,680
weren't writing server-side code anymore

55
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,959
really like front end the difference

56
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,670
between front-end and back-end would

57
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,620
just be divided you'd write your

58
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,320
application logic you'd have sams or

59
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,360
some other controller logic and a dom

60
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,220
framework and they would sit on top of

61
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,830
some kind of rest service like CouchDB

62
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,950
or some other really simple rest service

63
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,150
that you're on you're on your own on

64
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,890
Sinatra but if we really really

65
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,030
lightweight and all it would do is

66
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,430
basically spit JSON back and forth or

67
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,209
some other martial data format back and

68
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,720
forth between between javascript and and

69
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,880
the server and the debt layer would be

70
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,800
really thin and then all your weight

71
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,570
would be in you're basing your client

72
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,910
side code because now it's actually the

73
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,930
browser's fast enough that you can

74
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,850
actually do that so flash forward to two

75
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,920
weeks ago everyone saw this right so

76
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,209
when I saw this and I heard about it I

77
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:28,920
kind of knew i had heard things in the

78
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,540
works about it but i didn't know exactly

79
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,480
to what extent it was going to be and

80
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,580
you know i mean i didn't take care I

81
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:35,940
can't

82
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,770
getting credit for this but if you see

83
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,290
new Twitter all it is it's an API JSON

84
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,360
sits on top of it they have a controller

85
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,620
layer they're using some open source

86
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,020
technologies it's awesome and this is

87
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,510
all just HTML Javascript all the server

88
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,190
side code is completely separated and

89
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,010
capsulated away from the client side

90
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,020
code which is just JavaScript and

91
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,960
actually i think jquery too so not

92
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,310
saying I told you you know but it's it's

93
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,440
like told you so but after seeing all

94
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,360
those hacking to use trolls it's pretty

95
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,710
sweet validation bruh two to get people

96
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:10,230
actually like twitter twitter i mean

97
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,310
come on using something the same kind of

98
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,160
api structure and system that I've been

99
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,120
thinking about for a while and

100
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,750
implementing too so but what I want to

101
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,940
get out of that is that that's not

102
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,560
Twitter didn't just come up with it I

103
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,270
didn't come up with it and you can also

104
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,620
do something like this and I think it's

105
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,450
a really Twitter if nothing else as a

106
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,470
proof that this thick front-end thin

107
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,420
back-end can actually work and work at

108
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,930
scale too so I want to talk about same

109
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,150
j/s this is a new logo which I'm pretty

110
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,000
psyched about get the little hash tag

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,700
and the microphone so Sammy Jas is just

112
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,410
a simple client-side framework that I

113
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,250
wrote based on jQuery it's small its

114
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,060
core minimizes 15 k which is growing a

115
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,140
little bit it actually used to be a

116
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,280
little smaller but we've added some

117
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,960
things but it also has a plug-in system

118
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,690
so anything you don't need that's not in

119
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,460
the court is usually in plugins or you

120
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,750
can write your own plug-in and plug them

121
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,930
in but that's of course sitting on top

122
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,580
of jQuery which isn't that small but

123
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,140
assuming that you re have Jake where

124
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,030
near effort in your couch or whatever

125
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,400
it's going to it's pretty small it's

126
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,990
also pretty powerful or at least I think

127
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,900
so I've written some pretty significant

128
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,340
apps on it I know a couple other people

129
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,190
who have to it gives you this plug-in

130
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,510
structure it gives you template

131
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,449
rendering

132
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:36,610
it's really the controller layer on top

133
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,949
of which you know your code sits and

134
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:41,229
contains is contained and try to be

135
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:43,990
organized and it gives you a lot of

136
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,330
extra little bonus beats which I'm going

137
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,539
to go into intersect it's also really

138
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:52,150
simple or at least I think it is too it

139
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,089
really has a como API especially if

140
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,559
you're coming from Ruby are coming from

141
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:58,839
some other language where you're used to

142
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,879
kind of restful structure it should just

143
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:03,539
be pretty easy to grasp and understand

144
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:06,819
so okay i'm going to attention now so

145
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:09,089
API application programming interfaces

146
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:12,969
I've love ap is like seriously love them

147
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:16,900
I love writing them I love dissecting

148
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,360
them but most of all I feel like I'm an

149
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,349
API designer I even at my day job where

150
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:24,699
I'm working in Ruby and working in

151
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:26,649
JavaScript and Sammy and working with a

152
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:28,539
team of developers and not just might by

153
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:31,599
myself the way I usually work as I

154
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,460
sometimes just my favorite part is

155
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,949
designing the API designing how other

156
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:38,080
developers and other tools will interact

157
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,810
with this code and then you know that

158
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,210
actually implementing it I get some

159
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,439
thrill out of that but really it's

160
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,909
making something clean and beautiful

161
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:49,569
that I'm really psyched about so to

162
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:52,509
express that encode and code for me cool

163
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:54,759
clear is greater than cool and

164
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,310
compressed and specifically something

165
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,110
that's fun at least API design for me

166
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,029
and it's and working with a code that a

167
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:04,330
clean API that's well design is way more

168
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,459
nice and more fun and much rather do

169
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,959
that then working some with something

170
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,240
that's maybe not the cleanest or not the

171
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,779
most standard but it's super fast so

172
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:17,050
does anyone know who that is max yeah

173
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,139
that's that's you can hear matsumoto

174
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,449
he's the creator of Ruby how many people

175
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:24,699
here right Ruby at all our do a little

176
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:31,659
bit of Ruby cool so met max to this mess

177
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,470
created

178
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,690
me like 10 years ago or actually more

179
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,620
like 12 or 15 now and he is he's from

180
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,230
Japan and he used to be a pearl and

181
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,240
cobol programmer and he took what he

182
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,620
thought were the best parts of purlin

183
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,750
and small talk and all these other

184
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,640
languages and made something that he

185
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,890
thought was you know beautiful that was

186
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:54,580
his that was his goal he said I'm

187
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,120
paraphrasing but he he he says he wants

188
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,100
to optimize for developer happiness

189
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,140
that's what his goal as writing Ruby is

190
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,460
which is very different than other

191
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,730
languages goals other language is often

192
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:09,040
optimized for speed on the server or

193
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,040
optimized for you know speed of

194
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,290
development like cogeneration tools he's

195
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,780
really into just making code fun to

196
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,550
write and he thinks that if you're going

197
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,320
to sit at a computer and write code all

198
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,370
the time you'd better be having fun

199
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,710
which I really appreciate and I kind of

200
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,190
I kind of follow that same methodology

201
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,820
so that's the intention so maybe that

202
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,110
gave a background on to what I'm going

203
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,729
to talk about which is Sammy's API so

204
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:36,130
this is a really really brief example of

205
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,690
what I say any app looks like probably

206
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,300
the simplest possible example so and

207
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,860
also this is the latest Sammy that I

208
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,490
just pushed like two weeks ago now so

209
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,920
you initially salmon which is an app and

210
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,920
it takes a function and the function has

211
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,080
a bunch of different API lies within it

212
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,760
or that an application has a bunch of

213
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,589
different API is in it specifically it

214
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:58,990
has the main API which is routes or what

215
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:04,660
you call roots in Europe and you are you

216
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,230
an honest when the context of the Sami

217
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,030
function which you're passing is the

218
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,930
same application and inside there you're

219
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,610
calling defining these routes or around

220
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,710
is basically a restful route it responds

221
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,920
to HTTP verbs like get post put delete

222
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,570
you can't actually do delete because

223
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,339
it's a reserved one John sup so it's del

224
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:28,450
but just so you know so when you define

225
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,889
a you're giving it a pass

226
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:32,529
and then the verb which is get and then

227
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:35,350
the actual route context itself are the

228
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,350
call back here which inside of that is

229
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,449
an event context which is another nice

230
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:43,869
little little piece of code and what

231
00:09:43,869 --> 00:09:45,790
that does is it abstract some of the

232
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,160
things that you will do working with an

233
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,290
app like redirecting logo templates yeah

234
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,109
changing the location I'm trying to

235
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:58,660
think what else Oh basically anything

236
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,189
that manipulates the state of the page

237
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:02,529
so they see what happens is when you run

238
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:05,799
this it'll run it'll go to pound / our

239
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:09,730
hash flash and then when that event

240
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,309
happens or when it goes that route

241
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:14,859
salmon will pick it up and then run this

242
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:17,319
callback so in this case it's going to

243
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:19,389
run this callback in this event context

244
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:20,949
and then inside of the event context

245
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:22,660
we're using this new thing called render

246
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,579
context what render context does is

247
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:28,689
abstracts the template manipulation that

248
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:30,009
you often have to do in these single

249
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:31,449
page applications so I'm going to go

250
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:33,519
more into that but what do you guys

251
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,519
think it's pretty simple right I mean

252
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,779
maybe I didn't explain it very well but

253
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:39,489
if you go there's good documentation you

254
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:41,470
can go check it out but in general the

255
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,389
API is pretty clean i'd say like it

256
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:46,689
looks a lot like jquery it's pretty easy

257
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:48,790
to read you have a pretty good sense of

258
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:53,199
what your context is all the time and my

259
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:54,279
main goal is trying to encapsulate

260
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,619
everything possible into these routes or

261
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:59,860
into events so you can actually you know

262
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,049
as a developer who didn't write the

263
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:03,939
original piece of code he can go back

264
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:05,470
and look at this and instantly

265
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,350
understand that when i go to pound /

266
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,290
it's going to do this below as opposed

267
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,789
to having kind of a mess of events or

268
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:19,089
bindings and stuff like that it's pretty

269
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:20,709
simple so right now we just I just

270
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:23,579
released Sammy 061 which is like a

271
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:26,600
actually release that today or yesterday

272
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,579
six KO two weeks ago and the big thing

273
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:29,930
who layer was what i was talking about

274
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,949
to render context so a render context

275
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:35,720
the biggest complaint that i got from a

276
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,430
lot of developers working with Sammy was

277
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,560
you know especially when you're dealing

278
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,779
with getting data and then getting

279
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:43,639
templates and having to interpolate and

280
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,130
render templates you have this kind of a

281
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,449
lot of people have been talking about

282
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:49,870
this all day but the pyramids or the

283
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:55,250
nested callback structure so here you're

284
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,430
getting a partial and then inside of it

285
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,019
you're swapping out some HTML then

286
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,420
you're getting some JSON and then taking

287
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,339
another template and interpolating that

288
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:07,759
here with mustache right so for and for

289
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:10,610
each of those for each of those items

290
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,709
rendering it and appending it to a list

291
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:15,709
so the new way here let's just can flip

292
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:19,310
back and forth sexy right so the new way

293
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:25,569
is very heavily inspired by promises and

294
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:28,240
sexy J s which is a really cool library

295
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,029
and a bunch of other tools that abstract

296
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:34,910
this kind of nested callback style into

297
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,540
changing and into kind of an event queue

298
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,290
so what happens here is render actually

299
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,839
right here is actually a asynchronous

300
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:47,540
call it goes in it hits the gets the

301
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,490
mustache template from the server then

302
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,009
it replaces the main object with set

303
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:54,350
previous content then it renders this

304
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,300
items not json thing which means it just

305
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,610
takes the JSON and turn takes a JSON

306
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,949
file and turns it into actual JavaScript

307
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:03,319
object then with each of those objects

308
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:05,810
it goes in gets the mustache template

309
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:10,740
and then appends it to the UL so

310
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,459
basically it abstracts working with a

311
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,889
synchronous or asynchronous doing

312
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:17,600
something than doing a callback and then

313
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,970
you just get it back as content to the

314
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,920
next call basically it's not it's not

315
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,389
blocking this whole thing isn't blocking

316
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:25,150
but this call

317
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,380
even though it gets put into a queue

318
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,860
won't actually be executed until that

319
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,220
mustache template gets back which is

320
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,420
pretty nice and you can do some pretty

321
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,460
complex stuff of this and still keep the

322
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,340
code really clean that's pretty small

323
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,700
but you can go and check it out but this

324
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,340
is the entire render contacts API you

325
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,250
can then and next and weight are kind of

326
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,890
the basis of it then add something to

327
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,110
the queue or add something to the to the

328
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,600
render context neck skips in the next

329
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,150
context wait blocks until and next is

330
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:02,500
called mode and interpolate and render

331
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,430
all take not only strings which refer to

332
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,980
files on the file system or remote files

333
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,840
but they also now which is this is

334
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,900
really exciting take jQuery objects or

335
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,240
Dom objects so that means which I'll

336
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,590
show in a little bit you can have your

337
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,840
templates already on your page and

338
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,670
script tags or and hidden elements and

339
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,070
then just pull them out and place them

340
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,420
somewhere else and do the interpolation

341
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,400
without having to make all these

342
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,380
asynchronous calls to the server but

343
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,840
they behave in exactly the same way and

344
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,350
the chains look exactly the same between

345
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,850
doing it asynchronously and not doing it

346
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,110
and doing it doing it synchronously so

347
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,490
we're about apps everyone wants apps

348
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,190
these days so saving Jas and CouchDB

349
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:48,040
we're like best friends boys Michael

350
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,960
he's my boy yellen he's not here

351
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,800
probably but he's my boy too he's here

352
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,340
he's in the back but yeah so jess and

353
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,300
CouchDB have had a long not traumatic

354
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,460
but fun relationship together we've gone

355
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,430
to parks you know taking a swim it's

356
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:14,960
been nice so anyway but was it yeah

357
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,760
okay anyway sorry so anyway a while ago

358
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,120
actually Alex lang whose access

359
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,019
conference and he's a Berliner he and he

360
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:29,170
runs coop he started working on a couch

361
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,430
app which at that point I hadn't even

362
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,310
heard of to using Sam ejs and he

363
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,870
actually presented last year at Jazz

364
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,339
comfy you and showed off some of the

365
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:37,450
stuff that he's working on and he's

366
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,060
going to be talking in I think in our

367
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,010
upstairs and showing off on his cool

368
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,170
slide slide application to which is

369
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,740
built with couch and Sammy so anyway

370
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,660
they're best friends because if you're

371
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,890
looking at that model that we looked at

372
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,920
before couchdb can be this restful

373
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,529
datastore to Sammy JSE's front-end

374
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:59,800
controller in front end logic so an

375
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,540
example of this is swinger so I'm just

376
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,050
going to exit out of here but this slide

377
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,000
application it's a little cut off here

378
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,230
but this is this is actually a Sammy

379
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,750
application all just doing actually is

380
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,610
there's like a little markdown screen

381
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,449
here and i can type in and it will

382
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:21,670
preview there and then when i say this

383
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,500
it actually saves all the slides to

384
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,199
CouchDB and there is no server side code

385
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:29,199
in zero zero percent it's all safe then

386
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,390
catch to be even the application like

387
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,199
all the application logic the CSS the

388
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:37,360
HTML it's all on couch TV which is

389
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,790
awesome so Michael talked yesterday

390
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,360
about couch apps and he went into the

391
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,550
node side of that stuff which is cool

392
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,209
here let me certainly start this up

393
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:53,019
again that's all open source too and

394
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:54,820
there's actually it's online and you can

395
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,730
actually play with it and check it out

396
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,000
but anyway so Michael talked about it

397
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,649
yesterday and basically how many people

398
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:03,790
here to know what a couch app is

399
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,380
relatively or was that we're at

400
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,549
Michael's talked yesterday but yeah

401
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:08,319
basically it's just a design document

402
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,169
and design

403
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:11,659
it's just a JSON object and that JSON

404
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:14,239
object is just as big blob of all this

405
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,489
data as attachments which are just

406
00:17:16,489 --> 00:17:20,689
basics t 4 encoded you know binary data

407
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:22,789
like your HTML and like your JavaScript

408
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:24,679
and then they're more than that they're

409
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:26,299
the views the stuff that you get used to

410
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:30,259
query the database and there any custom

411
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:32,059
logic you want to write into couchdb but

412
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:33,499
they're all encapsulated in a single

413
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:35,690
JSON document and the beauty of that is

414
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,309
that you can take that JSON document

415
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:39,230
just write it to disk you can replicate

416
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,580
it from another server you can do

417
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,249
whatever you want with it so writing

418
00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:44,840
couch apps should be really easy right

419
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,080
it's just a JSON blob you should be able

420
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,809
to just build that blob and push it and

421
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:53,929
do whatever you want with it and it is

422
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:56,720
pretty easy but there's a tool called

423
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,840
couch app which is which is written in

424
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,710
Python and benoit who's here wrote it or

425
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,909
maintain the original version maintains

426
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:08,359
the version and works on still and i

427
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,999
love couch app and i love the idea of

428
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:13,730
couch apps see capital and a capital

429
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:17,470
which doesn't come across on this but

430
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,330
but I mean the Python tool is awesome

431
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,739
and I really like it and I've used it

432
00:18:21,739 --> 00:18:23,509
swinger is written with the Python tool

433
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:26,090
but it didn't fit my needs my needs were

434
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,129
a little different I like the way couch

435
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:31,149
F worked but I didn't want to have

436
00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:33,139
different directories that map directly

437
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:35,239
to JSON objects I wanted to have my own

438
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,879
/j s directory and I wanted to use the

439
00:18:37,879 --> 00:18:39,789
tools that I was used to working with in

440
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:43,149
developing back-end services like

441
00:18:43,149 --> 00:18:45,769
compass or blueprint how many people

442
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:48,559
here have you heard of compass so yeah

443
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,230
so compass is a ruby tool it's a it's a

444
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,690
for writing style sheet it's a style

445
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,460
sheet framework so it gives you a really

446
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,619
base level of style sheets and it

447
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:01,100
generates out this awesome like you can

448
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,809
just start off and have basically a

449
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,789
working style sheet with blueprint with

450
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:06,830
whatever else and it's written with SS

451
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,779
too and I love working with it and I

452
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:10,900
wanted that and I also want a gym

453
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,610
is this JavaScript install managers

454
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,320
thing that I wrote instead of jam it's

455
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,450
Jim and I wanted to use like other

456
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,640
little Ruby tools or other any kind of

457
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,260
tools and have them kind of hook into

458
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,070
the whole process too so I created Sokka

459
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,740
which I'm calling set Sokka Sammy on

460
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,300
couch app it's a horrible name but I

461
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,010
couldn't think of anything better if you

462
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,420
have a better name tell me i'll rename

463
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,290
it so Sokka is a ruby tool for making

464
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,720
salmon ajs on couch to be easy that's

465
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,820
really the point and not just not just

466
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,130
uh any JavaScript framework but

467
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,510
specifically sandy but you can really

468
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,030
use anything with it so another tangent

469
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,550
I know you're only looking to Ruby it's

470
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:52,780
written it's a ruby tool but seriously

471
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,670
it's not that serious you guys gotta

472
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,100
chill out that's 50 cent I don't know if

473
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,590
you can see that but anyway I'm a

474
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,420
polyglot I like writing in a lot of

475
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,760
different a lot a lot of different

476
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,760
languages and I like Ruby I love me I

477
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,090
love JavaScript and in the end I know

478
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,680
there's a lot I've written a lot of Ruby

479
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,280
tools that work on JavaScript tools that

480
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,590
work with Ruby yada yada the point is is

481
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,240
that it doesn't matter we're in an age

482
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,590
where that shouldn't matter I mean

483
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,780
obviously Ruby doesn't run on a server

484
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,420
but Ruby runs on your machine it's on

485
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,250
your laptop right now if you're on a Mac

486
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,280
it's already there and it's made for

487
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,660
writing these scripts I don't want to

488
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,460
have to write a nested callback node

489
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,740
script even though I could for this but

490
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,930
it's it's a synchronous operation I'm

491
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,220
just doing stuff and pushing it to a

492
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,410
server it should it's okay if it's Ruby

493
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:45,070
so anyway that was that I'm so Sokka so

494
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,990
also if it does is it generates a simple

495
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,580
it has a generate tool that generates a

496
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,920
simple structure you write all your

497
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,800
JavaScript CSS HTML using Sammy compass

498
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,490
or any

499
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,610
you live or javascript lib you build the

500
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,290
JSON document and then you push it to

501
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,080
your couch so this is this is the basic

502
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,290
workflow of making a soca app so you so

503
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,390
could generate my app you CD into your

504
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,809
app you edit the app j/s you push it and

505
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:12,820
they open just opens it in the browser

506
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,270
really simple so the applications

507
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,920
themselves are just standing apps but

508
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,200
with access to couch TV and they're just

509
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,790
like swinger and new Twitter than one

510
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,950
hundred percent clients that are really

511
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,630
basically a hundred percent time so

512
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,830
let's install let's just have a look

513
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,990
here I'm going to try to do some live

514
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:33,429
demo and we'll see how it goes so I said

515
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:38,610
this okay so this is a soca app that I

516
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:41,230
my first demo app that I've been working

517
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,260
on I'll give you guys a peek at what it

518
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:48,640
looks like sorry it's ice creams a

519
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,429
little small but uh yeah it's like a

520
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:54,429
really simple it's a little cut off it's

521
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:58,960
a really simple to-do list thing but

522
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,800
it's a little more than that it lets you

523
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,990
write these things it stores it all on

524
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,420
couch TV obviously all your tasks so

525
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:14,460
like let's talk about Sokka in front of

526
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,809
board audience okay so i hit enter i

527
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:21,460
just posted to the server now saved in

528
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,550
couch what I'm trying to actually do

529
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,809
though which is a little different

530
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:27,370
because I thought I've been true this is

531
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,990
probably my fifth do list manager that

532
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,460
I've written he's written a to-do list

533
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:36,130
app whoo so when I started realize was

534
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,630
breaking I'm not going to go deep into

535
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,670
my thoughts about why I wanted to do

536
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,679
this specifically but basically what is

537
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,940
trying to do is actually parse out the

538
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,950
important information from what you're

539
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,320
saying and then turn it into actual

540
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,360
meaningful tasks so here talk is the

541
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,400
verb so if you hit talk it'll just show

542
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,990
you all the things that you have to talk

543
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,510
about if you hit right it'll show you

544
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,380
all the things that you have to write

545
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,240
about and you can see the URL changing

546
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,399
this is the same amp so it

547
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:01,259
doesn't actually reload the page ever

548
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:04,289
it's just it's just using Sam and you

549
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:06,330
that I have to email roid rage and ask

550
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,609
about coffee places and call wife and

551
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:10,080
tell her awesomeness well I finish this

552
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,049
so close that but it's a really really

553
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:14,639
really basic app there's a lot more to

554
00:23:14,639 --> 00:23:16,200
do in it I wanted to actually do a lot

555
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,210
more before before jazz comp but I

556
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,789
didn't have time but anyway the point is

557
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:22,139
I'm running out of time so the point is

558
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:25,080
is that it's a it so this is all in

559
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,879
couch everything in the couch the idea

560
00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:28,649
would be in the demo that I tried to do

561
00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:30,389
but I couldn't get working in time was

562
00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:31,769
you write your to-do list on your

563
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:33,960
machine you login you take your

564
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,879
soon-to-be iphone hopefully or your

565
00:23:35,879 --> 00:23:37,710
Android you go on your couch you just

566
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,269
hit a replicate button and it will

567
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:41,549
download not only application but all

568
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:43,289
you have to do is to and then you get

569
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:44,460
home you get back online did you

570
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,499
replicate up it goes back up to catch me

571
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:48,539
that's the beauty of couch apps and

572
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:52,169
couch TV in general so let's just look

573
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:55,499
at what a soca app looks like so here I

574
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:58,200
just have all my JavaScript here here's

575
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,570
my app so the app is actually really

576
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:04,589
simple change the colors oh god it's

577
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:12,450
dark okay sorry hold on yeah is that

578
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,710
better okay it's transparent which is

579
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:21,149
sweet I know long classic classic text

580
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:26,190
me okay is that better okay cool so you

581
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,899
start your app you're loading all your

582
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,759
you're loading all your plugins there's

583
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,729
some simple helpers here this stuff is

584
00:24:32,729 --> 00:24:34,080
just to build that cocaine and

585
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,580
JavaScript which is a little ugly but

586
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,509
it's not not crazy I'm binding to events

587
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:42,179
here I'm just starting at my app and I'm

588
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,909
loading a template from the actual from

589
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:46,349
a jquery object which you can see there

590
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:49,710
so if we go up here the next I eh no

591
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,390
actually has the templates directly in

592
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,490
the in the code I didn't i'm not

593
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,690
actually ever fetching them from the

594
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,330
server so when this app comes down it's

595
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,550
just a single HTML page i only am making

596
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,960
remote requests for data and not for

597
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,680
templates which is nice so let me just

598
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,280
show you some of the cooler stuff so so

599
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,560
if i go in here i'm in action let me

600
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,640
just make sure we're not doing this

601
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,580
already so there's another command here

602
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,040
which kind of what Michael was talking

603
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,720
about yesterday where's an auto push

604
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,550
even throw Z a little growl thing saying

605
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:26,320
that it pushed so but basically all it's

606
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,840
doing is it runs these hook files so

607
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,430
that was the after push it's literally

608
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:33,160
just showing out to growl notify but

609
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,450
then I'm including these plugins like

610
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,340
Jim encompass I'm not going to go into

611
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,960
gym but basically what it does it's like

612
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,240
a bundler for javascript so here all the

613
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,040
files that I'm requiring and then it

614
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,170
actually goes in and bundles it all up

615
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,180
into this default j/s which is a single

616
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,240
file which is better and or this

617
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,680
production is where it runs it through

618
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,100
google closure compiler too so then just

619
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,620
to show you how cool working with this

620
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,340
is SAS or SPSS so this is kind of what

621
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,260
compass generates and it's a I'm not

622
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,790
going to talk about also not going to

623
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,950
talk about how awesome sasses and

624
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,690
compass but it gives you all these

625
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,460
helpers and make CSS a little a little

626
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,010
easier okay I'm seriously running out of

627
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,990
time but this was pretty much the end

628
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,480
anyway so what let me just show you what

629
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,640
working with even though this is this

630
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,340
scss what doing this would look like so

631
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,740
okay so see how you can't really see the

632
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,600
the dates are really like they're hard

633
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,730
to see so let's say when you hover over

634
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:32,980
that metadata it's going to make it a

635
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,760
little darker so SAS is awesome you get

636
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,680
variables and also basically functions

637
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,440
and includes in the end it just

638
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,290
generates the SS which is sweet so let's

639
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:50,740
see color dark grey ok save it and I

640
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,690
should get a notification that it

641
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,060
bundled and pushed everything up ok so

642
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:59,010
now if i refresh this cool there it is

643
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,320
really simple

644
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:07,450
the idea okay so that's okay action to

645
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,070
this app is open source and I pushed it

646
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,510
to github so you guys should check it

647
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:13,929
out and help me make it even better the

648
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:17,740
parsing is kind of gross but that'll get

649
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,279
better ok so just exit of that let me go

650
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:28,899
back to the slides okay so cool all you

651
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:31,750
have to do is that if you have a Mac you

652
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,340
can do this right now and it shouldn't

653
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,429
work there's a bunch of more good stuff

654
00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:38,740
coming Sammy da couch which is actually

655
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,840
the wrapper around the couch TV stuff

656
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,909
that I put up there it's in part of soca

657
00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:45,039
now but I haven't written test for it or

658
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,169
done the awesome stuff i also just

659
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:49,720
wanted to show you that a Sammy also has

660
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,659
a really awesome test suite so that's

661
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:53,830
why you should use it more than anything

662
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,230
else it's grain and it has like all

663
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,779
these tests for all the different things

664
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:01,330
that it does and all the plugins so let

665
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,640
in qunit too so you can go in there and

666
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,179
hack on it as well but anyway that's

667
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:09,159
about it I'm really really excited about

668
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:11,140
this and I don't people will just play

669
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,059
with it and give me feedback because

670
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,190
it's really really fun the applications

671
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,580
that you write are really small and

672
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,840
there's not that much you actually have

673
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,640
to do to get something running on couch

674
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,409
and be able to access this data access

675
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:25,620
its data and use samia's this kind of

676
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,789
controller framework logic and in

677
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,890
between I'm sorry there's no bacon and I

678
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:42,989
know it's late in the afternoon so

679
00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:45,049

really that's all right one minute

681
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:55,759
anyone question quick SAS has compass I

682
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:58,460
like compass yeah I mean compasses

683
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,109

684
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:02,090
and you can just literally you should

685
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:05,450
see how it'll look a little SCSS i wrote

686
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,479
to get all those styles it's awesome and

687
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:10,729

688
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:14,419
