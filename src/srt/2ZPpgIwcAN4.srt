00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,380

anything one evening I'm getting a

2
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,060
little head of myself so quickly of

3
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,390
course react ISM our reveal jazz always

4
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,650
messes up for me here we are so like

5
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,810
Ryan said my name is Gor tanner I am the

6
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:36,040
co-founder and CTO at bit hound so last

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,800
year I gave a talk in track be I was the

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,329
only person to release a religion called

9
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:45,670
for ism on my talk on distributed

10
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,289
computing so this year I'm going to talk

11
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:49,059
a little bit more about something that's

12
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:51,250
a little closer to what I care about a

13
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,800
bit count what we do a bit hound we

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,760
analyze code to look for quality and

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,420
maintainability and it's trying to

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,149
figure out what objectively and suitably

17
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:05,259
is good code so um what I'm going to

18
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:09,130
talk something that happened at our

19
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,270
company is the concept of adding new

20
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,880
people we had a we had two new

21
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,240
developers coming on board and their

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,399
same day and we are doing our kind of

23
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:24,670
intro that first for our kind of chunk

24
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,729
of the day where I was getting their

25
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:30,160
machine set up talking with them giving

26
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,349
an overall architecture of overview of

27
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:35,679
how bit hound works and something kind

28
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,229
of cool happened that by lunchtime even

29
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:40,539
with talking we had both of their

30
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:42,729
laptops which were just freshly opened

31
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:45,640
at 9am out of the packaging had our

32
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,970
entire software stock up and running and

33
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,009
they were comfortable enough that we got

34
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:52,929
a couple simple pull requests from them

35
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:58,149
within that first like day and it really

36
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:00,390
got me thinking about the concept of

37
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,330
onboarding new people into our projects

38
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,750
and just that cart like how to bring

39
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,220
people on board to have them be

40
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,849
contributing and be productive quickly

41
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,510
so another thing that um that is

42
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,400
important is that this I'm going to be

43
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,590
talking a lot about my experience with

44
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,269
our clothes source project or our

45
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:24,400
application but a lot of this

46
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,819
information that I'm sharing

47
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:28,129
so works in trans files really nicely to

48
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:31,040
the the open source community we're in

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,170
an open source community new people

50
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,090
coming on board of your to your project

51
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,329
is in a largely asynchronous fashion you

52
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:40,249
don't necessarily have interaction with

53
00:02:40,249 --> 00:02:43,000
someone who finds your project on github

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,889
clones it down reads it and tries to get

55
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:48,019
up and running to add add what they feel

56
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:51,109
as value to their project so there's a

57
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:53,299
little bit more of a upfront cost with

58
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,329
an open source project versus we're in

59
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:57,919
traditional closed source or like a

60
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,840
company project you have a face-to-face

61
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,629
or at least an engaged communicate

62
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:06,319
dialogue between the yourself and the

63
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:12,079
new developers so the key is is as I was

64
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:15,230
trying to figure out what exactly the

65
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,079
topic of this how to convey it the one

66
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,939
key thing I kept circling around to is I

67
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:21,439
was doing the hallway track with

68
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,480
everyone here and trying to explain when

69
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,010
they're like what exactly you talking

70
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,290
about is that nothing what I'm going to

71
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,769
say is new there's not going to be a

72
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:34,340
giant beam of knowledge transferred down

73
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,819
where I'm going to blow your mind we all

74
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:40,009
know this we all have this gut feeling

75
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:43,519
of where where our problems are on our

76
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,319
code base how hard it is get running

77
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,509
those little gotchas that have tripped

78
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:51,739
us up in the past so another thing as I

79
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:53,629
was putting together my my slides was

80
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:56,239
that there's not a lot of JavaScript in

81
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,750
it and that was unfortunate but don't

82
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:06,379
boo me off the stages yet so welcome to

83
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,530
the team I want everyone to like close

84
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,739
your eyes and think about that first day

85
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:15,229
on a job that first time pulling down

86
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:17,479
the code base to an open source project

87
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:19,849
you want to contribute and i'm sure i'm

88
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:21,590
going to give you an experience of mine

89
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,020
i came into a company I that I was

90
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,050
really psyched about and they kind of

91
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,060
gave me my computer and they said all

92
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,440
right set it up here's the wiki for how

93
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,750
to set it up so i went to the wiki which

94
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,870
the last edit of this document of new

95
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,710
developer machine

96
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,940
setup was about a year ago and I'm going

97
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,710
through the steps like step one like

98
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,010
install this version of sequel server or

99
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,770
whatever it was and no one had that cee

100
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,950
anymore so I'm downloading the copy and

101
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,740
you can't find that version it was a

102
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,030
step upon step of frustration failure

103
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,360
and just misinformation that it ended up

104
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,490
it was almost like a week before i even

105
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,750
had something running and so one of my

106
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,540
Jobs was during that first day is to

107
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,090
update that document all those problems

108
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,800
use you have or you're setting this up

109
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,380
can you just like add it to the document

110
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,260
so every company ends up with this

111
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,680
amazing document written by people with

112
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,780
about two to four hours of experience

113
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,900
with the code base on how to set up a

114
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,840
code base for someone who has 0 to 1

115
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,580
hour experience with the code base and

116
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,280
if you were to like think of any piece

117
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,910
of your project that is as important as

118
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,080
this that you would give that much

119
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,400
experience to you you probably want

120
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,710
someone to like at least has like a day

121
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,580
and a half experience I mean let's so

122
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:00,350
let's go back to the condo like git

123
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,280
clone your team your project now what

124
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,640
that is that is the entry point into our

125
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,620
project and realistically first

126
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,180
impressions matter so like we're talking

127
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,590
these are your new these are your new

128
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,480
evangelists these are your new teammates

129
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,530
and realistically this experience this

130
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,960
onboarding experience those that first

131
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,770
day does set the tone and the context

132
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,090
for your relationship with that person

133
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:37,220
and you cannot do that over again the

134
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,990
impression that they're going to make

135
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,030
during setting up your project on your

136
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,280
first day of your of their job with you

137
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,170
on their first time trying to contribute

138
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,020
this is going to set the tone of their

139
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,600
perceived quality of your of your code

140
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,390
and something that we always seem to

141
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:53,689
forget

142
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:56,059
at about when when we're at brings

143
00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:57,619
League like this is these are usually a

144
00:06:57,619 --> 00:07:01,489
new machine or a machine that has isn't

145
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:03,259
configured exactly like everyone else

146
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:05,479
has been working on this project for six

147
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:08,929
seven months or a year or so and the key

148
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,819
is we want to set we want to set people

149
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:14,119
up for success we want to want to set

150
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:16,219
them on the right direction we want to

151
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:17,629
make sure they don't find those little

152
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:21,009
caveats we want to guide them into

153
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:24,409
helping us because new people that's

154
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:26,149
what you want you didn't join the

155
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:28,189
company because you thought it was

156
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:30,259
horrible he didn't want to contribute to

157
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:31,639
this project because you didn't believe

158
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,849
in its goals so there's an enthusiasm

159
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:37,099
there that you want to keep and foster

160
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:41,409
into active in worthwhile contributions

161
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:44,989
so the first thing I'm going to talk

162
00:07:44,989 --> 00:07:49,969
about is documentation I'll wait for you

163
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:54,909
to leave documentation not not a really

164
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:58,999
exciting topic but extremely extremely

165
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:02,749
important and something that happened in

166
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:06,289
the kind of github the the bit bucket

167
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:08,689
the newer the newer code hosting

168
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,909
platforms that was really subtle but

169
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:13,459
actually a really awesome transition is

170
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:18,289
that the readme file became front and

171
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,300
prevalent on the first page we all

172
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,829
remember back to our older source

173
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:24,469
control systems whether online there

174
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:26,269
were some documentation but it was

175
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:28,909
always hidden in a folder or is on a

176
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:31,819
wiki or somewhere but now at least with

177
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:34,399
with github with bitbucket with some of

178
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,500
the with all these online but the readme

179
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,990
is there front and center and that is

180
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,219
your entry point into working with these

181
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:45,259
new developers so if you're an

182
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:48,019
open-source developer and you're open

183
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:50,389
source project usually read mia's kind

184
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:53,569
of the how to install it as a user how

185
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:56,870
to use this API but don't forget that

186
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,220
you have the other half going in as

187
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,209
contributors and that's where the

188
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,240
concept of hacking file or contributing

189
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,340
but at least link

190
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,610
to it from you read meat because it's

191
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,770
you want to contribute us the healthy

192
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:17,510
metric of a successful project now this

193
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,000
is where I sorted the verge a little bit

194
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,090
from open source to close source so one

195
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:27,320
of my favorite slides love Flashdance so

196
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,140
the whiteboard session that first few

197
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,320
hours sitting down this is where

198
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,310
documentation and experience really kind

199
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,320
of diverge we all have those idea of

200
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,240
that mental map of our system those

201
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,850
little boxes we draw every time the

202
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,330
arrows going back and forth that's in a

203
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,880
very important session to have with the

204
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,640
new contributor to your project can't

205
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,550
quite do it in an open-source way but at

206
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,800
in in your environment in your in your

207
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,480
workplaces having that time to walk them

208
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,300
over the high level architecture is

209
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,520
invaluable and I always say for that

210
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,430
documentation I never want it written

211
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,670
down in a permanent place because it's

212
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,410
going to be out of date by the time I'm

213
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:20,840
done doing the whiteboard session so so

214
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,520
next with with where your kind of help

215
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,550
and documentation go are our command

216
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,520
lines so at bit hound I have this kind

217
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,890
of idea where we I kind of throw around

218
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,140
I call like command line driven

219
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,650
development I'm a terminal person I love

220
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,750
building together almost that unix feel

221
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,240
of smaller tools that chain together to

222
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,810
do something good and it's very

223
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,990
important that they are documented so

224
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,120
you actually find I would show it up

225
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,250
here but no one in the back would see it

226
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,730
but like all of our command line tooling

227
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,460
forbid hound from deploying to adding

228
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,350
jobs of the queue to checking status of

229
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,600
servers to provisioning new servers all

230
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,870
have internal help documentation built

231
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,450
into them not like like reams of

232
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,770
documentation but enough that you can at

233
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,360
least figure out what the command would

234
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,220
do and the arguments you need to pass to

235
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,250
it and those all get put into our

236
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,730
read me and but it's it's actually

237
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,440
generated from another script that we

238
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,650
have that has documentation that you can

239
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,660
just run and it scrapes all of our

240
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,150
command line tools builds it up throws

241
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,160
it into the command line markdown

242
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,930
documents so that people have an idea of

243
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,750
where commands are and how to use them

244
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:45,210
and what is available so next next on

245
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,840
the last kind of bigger topic of

246
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,420
documentation is code comments and this

247
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,950
is this is something where I'm going to

248
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,810
say things and it might sound like I'm

249
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,370
incredibly smart but everyone in this

250
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,770
room knows it and I'm just kind of

251
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,450
saying what smarter people have told me

252
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,910
is that there are a couple ways to

253
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,060
comment your code you can comment what

254
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,180
your code does or you can comment why

255
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,540
your code does that and we've all kind

256
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,280
of seen those comments that kind of

257
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,640
reference what the code is doing but

258
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,320
there's a better way to do that and it's

259
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:25,020
called code so you you know you can you

260
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,000
can stop doing that we have its self

261
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,220
documented least try to name that's

262
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,020
where naming of your variables naming of

263
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,600
your functions trying to have an

264
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,750
expressive form of coding is a much

265
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,690
better way of documenting in code but

266
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,640
with that being said what that frees

267
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,400
your code comments to do is to talk

268
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,620
about the the part that is really

269
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,710
missing is the why we can all look at

270
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,270
code you can kind of look and go okay

271
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,830
that's a darating over X and blah blah

272
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,020
blah and then you call off to this

273
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,230
little section over here but and and I

274
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,700
new developer coming in will be like oh

275
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,410
well I don't need to call over there

276
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,850
that's an efficient and bought and then

277
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,020
you realize that the only reason you

278
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,900
were doing that was six months ago that

279
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,570
like server like how i got over

280
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,560
overloaded and like let's just like

281
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,360
throw it off here so we can load balance

282
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,050
it that informations sometimes lost so

283
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,900
try to keep those little fugly places of

284
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,900
your code document it about why it's

285
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:27,440
fugly now any talk kind of about this is

286
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,540
i have i have a new bestie project is

287
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,100
vagrant

288
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,230
I can't extol the virtue of this project

289
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,970
as much if you've heard about it it's

290
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,880
great if you've used it I'm sorry if you

291
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,949
used it wrong because it's not a it's

292
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:48,980
not a welcoming project you're going to

293
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,529
have people like me kind of tell you

294
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:53,420
about in your me like this is amazing

295
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,089
and you're going to start using it and

296
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:59,300
it's not going to feel amazing and what

297
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,589
vagrant does it gives you easy to script

298
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:05,149
virtualized environments for your

299
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:07,100
development environment so rather than

300
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,389
having your laptop or your desktop or

301
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:14,259
whatever operating system whatever like

302
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:16,790
permutation you have bad ground allows

303
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,680
you to have a standardized virtual

304
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,160
environment that your code is hosted in

305
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,779
and something that actually happened

306
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,170
that bit hound that was really

307
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,389
interesting was we we do a very largely

308
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:32,089
distributed platform so all of our code

309
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:33,680
that gets analyzed as we're processing

310
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,589
your code gets sent out to a bunch of

311
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:39,829
worker machines and handled and messaged

312
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:42,110
back and forth um and we were working on

313
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,480
this for a while before we launched at

314
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,630
last ge'ez comp and i was working it on

315
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,089
my laptop and then we deployed it and we

316
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,709
came here like hey let's start letting

317
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:53,480
people on and I realized very quickly

318
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,889
that what works well on one machine

319
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:59,630
doesn't necessarily work the same when

320
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,480
there's two three four hundred machines

321
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,040
so some of those assumptions that I made

322
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,959
in my configuration when I'm working

323
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:09,439
here didn't quite scale when I was

324
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:10,939
working in the distributed environment

325
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:13,060
so what this allowed me to do was

326
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,980
virtualize a mini version of what

327
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,380
production is down to the exact

328
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,449
operating system that we're running to

329
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:22,730
the fact that even with our local

330
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,670
development we're running node in a

331
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,310
multiple servers service instances

332
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:31,880
behind the engine X caching layer with

333
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,209
its hosting self-signed ssl certs so

334
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:37,759
exactly what's happening on production

335
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,490
is what our local developers are using

336
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,000
and the job when a job it's cued it goes

337
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,279
through the same idea through the

338
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,120
messages to

339
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,950
a bunch of machines so all those

340
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,320
assumptions that we make that obviously

341
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,230
this message will be handled by the

342
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,640
machine that also handled this message

343
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,650
so we can share things which in a

344
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,950
distributed environment is never true

345
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,770
now there's a key to using bagman this

346
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,220
is kind of where where my experience

347
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,790
lies is as awesome as it is you want to

348
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,950
hide the fact that you're using vagrant

349
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,370
the only thing that should really be

350
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,320
evident when you're using bad grain is

351
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,690
when someone comes you and says my

352
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,360
machine stopped working you and say run

353
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,670
vagrant destroy and vagrant up and they

354
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,950
can create a new one and you can ask

355
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,870
does it work and they can say yes and

356
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,080
you can let let them go back to what

357
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:39,900
they were doing so the way to do this is

358
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,920
using port forwarding is the first thing

359
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,140
so yeah I will hit localhost 8080 air I

360
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,830
can use the tools that I'm familiar with

361
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:54,790
also whenever you're using vagrant

362
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,990
you'll have people say oh well yeah

363
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,860
vagrant up and then vagrant SSH into the

364
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,189
Machine and run this command and run

365
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,709
that over here while you're developing

366
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:10,220
or run the build that's where it starts

367
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,569
to get a key that's where those bad

368
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:14,510
vibes you get from backgrounds so this

369
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,220
is something my dev ops guy kind of

370
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,740
showed me that is good so obviously

371
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,350
those at the back can see exactly what

372
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,929
this says but what this is is a little

373
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:26,870
proxy script we have where we basically

374
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,120
run a command that it looks exactly like

375
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,880
I'm running it on my terminal and

376
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,340
standard in and standard out goes to the

377
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,440
first machine so those just very

378
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,130
important bagger and ssh that such

379
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,690
command and in quotes will execute the

380
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,059
command and if I go back to the first

381
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:45,920
one there's a little little secret here

382
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,140
just for those at the back there's a

383
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:53,800
dollar sign this one dollar sign and

384
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:59,870
there's a star dollar sign star that is

385
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,830
what is called

386
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,070
a splat or some people call it some

387
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,890
other things but what that does is allow

388
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,380
all the arguments that you're passing

389
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,809
into the one command just to be like

390
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:14,690
funct right on to the other into the

391
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,559
command that your ssh into it kind of

392
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,309
really changed how we were doing our

393
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,149
environment so I got rid of all that

394
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:25,820
crazy stuff so now when you want to

395
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,679
develop and bit out if you want to run a

396
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,539
command you're just running it in your

397
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:32,090
shell on your host machine and it's

398
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,730
executing on whatever virtual machine it

399
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:38,510
needs to as well as if I wanted to run

400
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,070
other commands that would interact with

401
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,639
logs or other things so going through

402
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:46,850
this this is kind of fun I was going

403
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,080
through our provisioning because it's

404
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,360
all hidden if you actually ever come

405
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,090
work at bit houndour or whatever you'll

406
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,330
see that all of our entire setup you

407
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,149
clone the repository and you're on dot

408
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:01,610
slash configure and it just sets

409
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:04,220
everything up and that's it and

410
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,230
eventually you have a thing and in our

411
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,090
deck right underneath like you r and r /

412
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,539
configure hit local host port 4000

413
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:13,429
because everyone forgets to tell people

414
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:17,450
what portree hosts things on and I was

415
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,130
going through finding all those cases

416
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,440
that would have tripped up so this is

417
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,130
kind of airing my dirty laundry but you

418
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,389
might you might have experienced some of

419
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:28,370
these so the first thing that was

420
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:32,029
interesting was MongoDB setting up a new

421
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:33,950
Mongo instance how many of you know that

422
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,380
when you install Mongo it doesn't allow

423
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:41,149
remote connections so the the rest of

424
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:44,870
you would be screwed so that all this

425
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,080
does is installs Mongo and does a little

426
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,960
perl script to comment out a single line

427
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,880
in the config and restarts Mongo and

428
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,010
suddenly it allows remote collections

429
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:58,330
because all of our workers are remote so

430
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:03,409
so next I was mentioning the the concept

431
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:06,350
of vagrant is sometimes slow so everyone

432
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,260
will like install vagrant and put their

433
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,460
code in it and they're running it and

434
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,580
like wow it's really slow well vagrant

435
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,330
is

436
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,730
it kind of saying like beggar and Oslo

437
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,350
is like complaining that like your

438
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,049
minivan is slow I mean you're kind of

439
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:24,350
missing some of the point but what we

440
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,360
can do with the background because reads

441
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,679
are slow on the standard like neared

442
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,880
folder you use something called NFS and

443
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,730
so what this is NFS comes installed by

444
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:41,750
default on OSX but not on Linux so the

445
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,190
Internet in our provisioning scripts we

446
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,450
is hable if you're running you linux

447
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,360
will install NFS and it all just kind of

448
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,070
magically works that we have performance

449
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,549
again another bug that that was

450
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:55,820
interesting was we hit this weird limit

451
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,559
with get a lot of our commands or just

452
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:59,450
kind of working with the get command

453
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,100
line or the get kind of porcelain

454
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,860
commands and well we hit up this weird

455
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,130
like HTTP POST post buffer limit and it

456
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,740
was just it only sometimes happens when

457
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,269
we're cloning or doing something with

458
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:14,659
larger projects and it returned with

459
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:17,269
like not a very helpful error but we

460
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:19,399
throw it in our in our provisioning in

461
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:21,230
our setup script so that no one else

462
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,600
ever has to worry about that like what

463
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,190
usually happens is about six months

464
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,870
after someone will start using our code

465
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,070
base and playing around with it they'll

466
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,860
see this line with like a comment above

467
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,740
it explaining why it's there and it's

468
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,690
kind of know like why are you so angry

469
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:40,730
that you had to put this in next next

470
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,519
actually is an interesting one um is 0

471
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:46,840
off one has this really interesting

472
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,370
quirk is when you're working with an

473
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:53,240
oauth provider clock time is very

474
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,299
important so if your clock starts to

475
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:58,370
drift from your OAuth providers clock

476
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,799
you can suddenly all sound like an OAuth

477
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,330
application that's working really well

478
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,760
locally and you close your laptop open

479
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,889
it like four or five hundred times also

480
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:08,389
and everything stops working and you

481
00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:10,490
think it's that code you just edited and

482
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,490
you're like how did I break author

483
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,019
authentication with like this change

484
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:17,029
over here you didn't it was your clock

485
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:21,230
drifted so in our setup we just update

486
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,049
everyone to use a standard and like that

487
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:27,590
I'm server things like that's that's the

488
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,100
things

489
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,669
never make it into those documents and

490
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:34,010
then lastly is this is something I don't

491
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,320
even know the thing but there's a per

492
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,860
file user / limit of how many files you

493
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,600
can have open how many handles you can

494
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,700
have so we would hit this every once in

495
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,280
a while so we have our own configs where

496
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,590
we just dump them over so our processes

497
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,660
can open it like an obscene amount of

498
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:56,120
files so lastly we all know developers

499
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,460
are are never wrong and they always um

500
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,350
they always follow instructions to the t

501
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,990
and so I'll set up this amazing

502
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,870
virtualized environment this amazing

503
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,070
place where they can work and it all

504
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,780
works the same as easy to set up and

505
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,690
then it changes and we have to add in

506
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,760
New dependencies and we have to add in

507
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,130
other ways of doing things where we

508
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:22,520
switch the caching layer but like Jimmy

509
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,159
the developer over there just updates

510
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:27,020
his virtualized environments once every

511
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,080
six months so what this does this is

512
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,400
just you can't really see it but this is

513
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,230
our start script so this we have a bin

514
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,120
start which goes and starts all the

515
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,610
services can figures them all up so that

516
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,350
the app is running on your local

517
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,970
environment and it actually checks a

518
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,169
bunch of stuff it checks a lot of these

519
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:43,700
problems that we had it looks like a

520
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,150
unit testing framework it's in bash but

521
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,820
I feel like this one's actually refusing

522
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,179
the start because the version of your

523
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:56,720
virtual environment is too old and it

524
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,659
just forces them to keep that bit rot

525
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:02,210
from happening those older dependencies

526
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,730
they last time they ran like NPM install

527
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:09,080
was like I don't last Christmas but it

528
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,820
tries to keep everyone working on the

529
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:17,179
same environment so another thing that

530
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:18,770
this is starting to get a little a

531
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,650
little more opinionated is is live

532
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,390
reload how many to know what live reload

533
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:27,470
is how many people use a live reload for

534
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,120
those of you don't so there's bunch of

535
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,270
ways to do this the concept is is you

536
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,770
edit your code in your breath in your

537
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,169
editor and when you save it there's file

538
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:38,809
monitors and OH restart the services

539
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:41,460
that are affected by that

540
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,760
so we use a combination of a few there's

541
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,250
no daman there's live reload they can

542
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,190
integrate with grunt or gulp and all

543
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,649
this does is allow you to just edit your

544
00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:54,899
code and it automatically will refresh

545
00:24:54,899 --> 00:24:57,149
your browser or automatically restart

546
00:24:57,149 --> 00:25:00,539
services and it just gives you a really

547
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:03,149
nice ability so you don't end up with

548
00:25:03,149 --> 00:25:05,399
people confuse at all I edited this

549
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:07,260
source file but i forgot to restart that

550
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:14,880
like background processing job so so

551
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,970
this is this is an interesting one so we

552
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:21,049
all have unit tests we all have

553
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:23,100
acceptance as we all have smoke tests

554
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,570
and those are the ones we say to a new

555
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,850
developer coming on oh yeah I just run

556
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,279
the tests and all the always all pass

557
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:34,740
right so what we forget to instill on

558
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,570
them is how to actually test the system

559
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,549
so this is a this is almost an extension

560
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:43,770
of a whiteboard session where you

561
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:46,350
actually show them how to use all those

562
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,559
tools all those tricks that you've

563
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,549
gathered over the course of working with

564
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,549
this project on how to test it how to

565
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:56,850
use a system as a user and how to use

566
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,649
the system as so on developing the

567
00:25:58,649 --> 00:26:00,120
system there's all those like hidden

568
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,080
places so we have like dashboards that

569
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,610
are available that we can watch the

570
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,460
status of jobs we have special command

571
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,100
line arguments that we can pass in to

572
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,970
simulate edge cases or to like shrink

573
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,450
jobs so rather than trying to like

574
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,730
process a large repository in waiting

575
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:23,070
three hours for the process or whatever

576
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,200
on a local environment we can tweak the

577
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,789
job a little bit to shrink it down so

578
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:28,860
it's a little more iterative in one

579
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,770
minute like time to from start to finish

580
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:34,470
and though that's not necessarily

581
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,700
documented anger but that's something

582
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,590
you want to pass on or else they're

583
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,240
gonna you're going to find that like

584
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,770
that feature that you thought would only

585
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,870
take a day for them to write it's like a

586
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,700
week and a half and you that when you go

587
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,409
to ask them why is it taking so long

588
00:26:46,409 --> 00:26:48,480
like oh well every time I run this

589
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,029
command I wait six hours and you're like

590
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:57,420
oh just pass in dash dash don't do that

591
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:02,090
so the last thing is is always keep

592
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,070
learning you're going to the reason we

593
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:07,190
bring new people into our projects is to

594
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:11,960
learn from them your team doesn't have

595
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,330
all the answers your team has a very

596
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,130
interesting view of your project on how

597
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,800
to run with it so bringing new people on

598
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,280
board is a great way to learn a great

599
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,640
way to bring experience and tooling and

600
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,220
thoughts to help make this better for

601
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,560
the next people that are coming on board

602
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,140
and I'm not talking about that first

603
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,380
four hours if anything sit back and

604
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,770
think about how hard it is to go from a

605
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:42,470
brand new machine to working on your

606
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,130
project and try to make that easier for

607
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,580
the next person and hopefully we can

608
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,770
just end up with a lot more cool

609
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:56,800
projects so lastly in my shameless plug

00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,280
