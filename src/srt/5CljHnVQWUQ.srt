1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,629

hello welcome my name is Alton Hill and

2
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:07,649
we have worked together on a few

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,240
interactive installations and yeah like

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,240
was introduced we are the art - oh stop

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,439
Billy it's somewhat like our band name

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,039
or something yeah I mean search talking

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:31,080
English I'm gonna begin by telling you a

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,440
little bit about myself I have a

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,410
bachelor's degree in computer science a

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,530
PS in CS or a degree in

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,690
counter-strike like I like to call it

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,399
and I work as a freelance audio and an

13
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,489
art programmer but also to my fair share

14
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,199
of websites and whatnots my second job

15
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,449
is as a musician I compose music and I

16
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:02,820
also am in a band called seeker which

17
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,040
you should totally check out if you

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,840
haven't already and then I also

19
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,450
collaborate with other musicians

20
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,400
currently with all our art nerds on a

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,950
new generative robotic piano project

22
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,549
some of my work is most notably the POC

23
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:21,689
Apollo

24
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,700
it's a generative music piece and it's

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,710
written in JavaScript it uses the photos

26
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,610
taking during the moon landings back in

27
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,000
the 60s and 70s as an input to a musical

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,229
engine and creates a sort of soundscapes

29
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,869
for the images so you can flick through

30
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,570
the images in a random order and listen

31
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,329
to ambient music that is being generated

32
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:56,250
in the browser and another project is

33
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,710
the infinite string quartet which is

34
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,000
modular string quartet written by my

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,549
brother Wilbur Alto who is a composer

36
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,500
and we created like a interactive

37
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,150
version of it that runs in the browser

38
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,530
and you can

39
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,440
selects modules or clips from the string

40
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,270
quartet and arrange them in a 3d space

41
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,370
around you and create your very own

42
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,540
version you can play for hours and

43
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,940
creating creepy string quartet music

44
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,040
with this and yet then the project I'm

45
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,380
working on with only here we are

46
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,090
contemplating how to make it sound more

47
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:42,000
like a flower now artists and yeah there

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,190
is being released very soon

49
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,870
I am foolish I am a merely a developer I

50
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,390
also have a ph degree but no joke about

51
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,380
it I work for the local contracting

52
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,200
company called Kirk and I'm also going

53
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,330
to use the opportunity to talk about

54
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,010
some of my projects since I have this

55
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,620
platform one recent one I did this is a

56
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,709
weakened Chrome extension whoo so it

57
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:12,750
basically takes all non-vegan words

58
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,150
meaty words and replace them here we

59
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,830
have bacon and that gets replaced to

60
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:27,080
Kermit's wife of 40 years then recently

61
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,209
just earlier this month we did me and

62
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,640
Hunter we did another heart pop project

63
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,290
using the facade outside this was done

64
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,320
for the foundation go rat and this

65
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,709
basically a giant heart projected over a

66
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,070
deck where the input is users heart beat

67
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,720
heart rate yeah so let's talk about

68
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,200
paint splatter it's an interactive

69
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
installation where you can participate

70
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,450
on your phone and the simplest way to

71
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,570
describe it is that it's a giant shared

72
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,930
digital canvas made out of Harper's huge

73
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,140
led facade and anyone with access to

74
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,750
Internet and a smart device or a

75
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,870
computer can interact with this canvas

76
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,780
by splashing virtual paint on it which

77
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,850
then trips straight down or sideways

78
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,320
depending on wind direction and force

79
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,849
take it away third

80
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,580
so when you're creating interactive art

81
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,590
it's really important that the user

82
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,129
input is simple and rewarding in this

83
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:37,050
piece we utilize the fact that most

84
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,199
people like vandalizing especially

85
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,009
without many consequences so anonymously

86
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:46,879
splashing paint on Iceland's most

87
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,919
expensive building seemed like a pretty

88
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,729
rewarding and simple way to be an outlet

89
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:56,879
for that kind of behavior for the first

90
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,009
few days we had thousands of visits both

91
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:01,830
from people all over the world and some

92
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,550
people standing out sight and the storm

93
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,069
splashing for hours the reason why it

94
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:10,199
became so popular is how interactivities

95
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,539
the fact that by pressing a small area

96
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,909
on your phone results in a giant blob

97
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:17,099
visible to all participants from all

98
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:18,840
over the world it's the key to making

99
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,229
this all work it's also pretty visibly

100
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:24,569
pleasing on the props of a well-defined

101
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:26,819
look and the user input is greatly

102
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:29,460
limited this way we could avoid making

103
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,620
this look like a giant shared Microsoft

104
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,800
Paint document we could also avoid

105
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,990
mankind's most drawn figure on any

106
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:44,240
shared platform the phallic symbol and

107
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,139
how we pissed this thing the design

108
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,960
process was very straightforward it just

109
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,879
started with conceptual sketches on

110
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:58,800
paper like all good ideas start and the

111
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,319
whole concept was then thoroughly

112
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,569
determined before we started coding

113
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:06,479
anything so that helped us really keep

114
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,330
things in scope and we did one thing

115
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:15,270
well I believe next step was doing some

116
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,490
web mock-ups just to get our gist of how

117
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:26,370
the animation would look like and I'm

118
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:33,670
going to show you a code pan I did here

119
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,699
no this is this is my home this is where

120
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:44,259
I lived I used to keep this on my screen

121
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:48,130
yeah here this here's the first like

122
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:53,300
some how crappy interactive and with

123
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,720
input parameters what would leak yeah

124
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,240
just to get our sense of the rendering

125
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,630
and and main obstacles this took like 30

126
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,120
minutes to do so and and it was so good

127
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,260
to have this with the project proposal

128
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:17,000
okay back to the presentation the

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,500
biggest unknown factor in the whole

130
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,900
project was how to render stuff on the

131
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,150
light facade of harpa but fortunately it

132
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,400
had been done before so it just got

133
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,270
access to some node.js rendering server

134
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,530
code written by Owen Hindley which we

135
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,180
could fork and adapt to our tests and

136
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:42,080
the networking part was also pretty

137
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,389
straightforward we just used socket IO

138
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:48,289
and set up a small up on an Heroku

139
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:51,080
instance that handles all the events to

140
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,050
and from users like you press and make a

141
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,599
plop and it sense the event to all

142
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:59,780
connected participants and it also

143
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,870
contains some rudimentary game logic and

144
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,020
input sanitizing and even throttling

145
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:12,139
like you would to so yeah when we said

146
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:16,180
hola we faced some real-world problems

147
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,470
since the render server had to be

148
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,630
located in the basement with the rest of

149
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,599
the lab controllers that meant we had to

150
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,500
go up and down up and down endlessly in

151
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,500
our feedback loop and this is a video of

152
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,430
one of those times but it was a great

153
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,399
physical exercise good contrast and we

154
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:40,430
also got the lost few times like there

155
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,610
are thousands of it's half price like

156
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,970
Hogwarts School

157
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,510
it's almost always changing and I think

158
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,830
there are a lot of people like stuck

159
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,280
down there

160
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,230
yeah probably is like a small population

161
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:58,230
by now yeah and since this was already

162
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,840
online we wanted to allow more people to

163
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,800
participate so we decided to set up a

164
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,980
live stream and with a very limited

165
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,960
budget to be part of the phone and we

166
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,410
kind of duct taped it to the ceiling of

167
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:17,210
the hotel lobby next across from ARPA

168
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,380
this worked out great we got a lot of

169
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,660
traction on at it but pretty soon people

170
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,700
started complaining about the tourist

171
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,020
bus that was always blocking the view

172
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:29,690
like every half hour or so and also the

173
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,520
staff at the hotel they weren't that

174
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,290
pleased through this unidentified phone

175
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,760
that at some point was maybe possibly

176
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,930
broadcasting their conversations through

177
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:45,180
the internet and we also encountered

178
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,610
some problems with deploying the renter

179
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,430
server here in Harper because we had to

180
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,130
connect our computer to six unmarked

181
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,020
Ethernet cables through a selection of

182
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,750
routers and adapters which had to be in

183
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,380
done in correct order for it to work it

184
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,720
was most definitely not a very atomic

185
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,510
deployment process and first almost like

186
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,600
programming the ENIAC or or making punch

187
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,860
card programs so yes we had already we

188
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,390
had also become like our small TV

189
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:22,050
station yes we had to fulfill our duties

190
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,960
as a 24/7 live TV station

191
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,930
did you already mention the the main

192
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,320
complaint from the reddit users what's

193
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:31,680
that

194
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,170
so there was a tourist I saw her purse

195
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,880
yeah you're not even listening to me and

196
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,080
then we got spammed it was bound to

197
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,630
happen somebody found a way to

198
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,420
circumvent the rate-limiting Oh No and

199
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,710
why am I even telling you this all

200
00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:00,010
programmers sent and JavaScript

201
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:06,370
and then we got like properly hacked now

202
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,600
this is actually a very funny story

203
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,740
because somebody found a way to override

204
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,780
our color scheme we had like a very

205
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,830
limited color scheme you could not draw

206
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,440
black for instance so you could not like

207
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,990
clear the screen or or or something like

208
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,400
that but somebody found a way to

209
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,790
override it and was suddenly able to

210
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,480
draw arbitrary buffers of images by just

211
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,250
swatting paint very fast with the for

212
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,380
loop and we knew this was a possibility

213
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,570
from the start but didn't have the

214
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,110
resources to prevent it and except for

215
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,770
some basic rate limiting and

216
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,310
exponentially increasing pack of periods

217
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,430
but this was actually a very fun

218
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:57,280
challenge and war was upon us Iceland is

219
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,860
very small and the company communities

220
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,040
here are even smaller and the proof for

221
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,880
that is that I just got on messenger and

222
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,030
guessed who the hacker was and this was

223
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,190
not a penny before the hacker started

224
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,880
writing his name on the facade and I was

225
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,420
right

226
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,610
the hacker was my former computer game

227
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,220
programming teacher at the University

228
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,970
and he is also a programmer at CCP and

229
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,670
the only person in Iceland I knew that

230
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,450
would be able to do such a thing and

231
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:35,560
invest the time to do it properly so we

232
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,290
could immediately recognize his way of

233
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,390
doing the hacking because it was very

234
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,300
professionally done we approached him

235
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,670
and after a few hours of negotiations he

236
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,590
surrendered and told us all about how he

237
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,050
did it and he even sent us all the code

238
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,740
and a lot of comments on our code which

239
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:58,750
was very hard to read so he was able to

240
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,850
like draw arbitrary buffers with paint

241
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,460
and this is from his coat various like

242
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,260
neatly organized his name in a proper

243
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,769
two-dimensional array

244
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:14,269
he wrote the whole rendering service

245
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:16,910
that was running on his computer that's

246
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,730
pumped our server with paint blob events

247
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,209
and enabled him to do this so he was

248
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:26,660
like rendering on a rendering server on

249
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,180
a rendering server because we all like

250
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,370
rendering servers right but we made it

251
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,939
harder for him we just increased the

252
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:41,930
race rate limiting a bit and added some

253
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,980
extra throttling and without degrading

254
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,529
the experience of the normal non

255
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:53,839
spamming user and this fight was ongoing

256
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,139
throughout the duration of the display

257
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:02,959
he also was able to avoid because the

258
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:08,059
paint leaks and if you draw something it

259
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:11,230
won't stay there forever because it gets

260
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,389
the paint leaks and somebody else paints

261
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:17,300
over it but he added the skewing factor

262
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,939
he could tune to his taste too yet to be

263
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:26,149
able to create like very straight images

264
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:34,930
and then we added random noise to it to

265
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:39,019
decrease the resolution of what this

266
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:43,519
hacker was able to draw and this is

267
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,620
still in the code you see it if you if

268
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:50,000
you press the half power if you if you

269
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,230
splat paint you can see that it

270
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,480
dominates enter like yeah it doesn't

271
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,670
come exactly in the center of where you

272
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:04,670
clicked and also it's totally on concept

273
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,259
because it's plotting paint like with

274
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:12,210
with some paint plot that's very

275
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:18,369
unprecedent

276
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:20,540
if you spend some time in Iceland you

277
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,889
quickly learn that the weather here is

278
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:24,470
quite unpredictable

279
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,209
and when we did this the first time

280
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:29,390
which was in 2016 there was basically a

281
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,430
crazy storm throughout the whole time it

282
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,120
was up and that was a great way to show

283
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,770
off the feature that you know we were

284
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,050
using the wind force and wind direction

285
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,910
to to render so we just looked on the

286
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,440
bright side there weren't a lot of

287
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,320
people like outside trying a lot more

288
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,220
people on the Internet

289
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,399
but the year after we set it up again

290
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,100
and the weather was way better

291
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,130
just nice weather and almost no wind at

292
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:01,690
all which proved problematic because

293
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,830
every time there was absolutely no wind

294
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,070
our renters are requests because we were

295
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,720
somewhere in our calculations we were

296
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,399
tape dividing by a zero and for the

297
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:16,040
first time this happened me and doctor

298
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,080
we were gonna be on live television and

299
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,940
this happened like five minutes before

300
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,450
that happened and as you can see in this

301
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,839
picture here's the mayor in 2016 lots of

302
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:28,490
wind you can see his hair it's it's

303
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,570
crazy and 2017 this is like a frozen

304
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,360
under server absolutely no end and me

305
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,709
and alt or somewhere in the back having

306
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:40,130
a panic attack but we somehow got

307
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,230
through the interview with like

308
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,120
demonstrating how this worked without it

309
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,880
actually working at all and nobody

310
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,730
seemed to notice which is a pretty good

311
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,680
thing yes we learnt a few lessons

312
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,820
through this whole process first being

313
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,170
that we should avoid at any means any

314
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,000
ribbon-cutting ceremonies by politicians

315
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,140
with like huge scissors especially when

316
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,350
it's on live television secondly you

317
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,910
should always allow for the weather even

318
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,339
when you're writing code even if it has

319
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,230
nothing to do with well as we should you

320
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,020
should do it especially here in Iceland

321
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,750
and it's always fun when your work is

322
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,569
worth hacking at least when it's not

323
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:30,920
done maliciously and yeah while it well

324
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,790
it's entertaining this

325
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,640
Pease revolves around the concept of

326
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,850
vandalism and that everybody gets their

327
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:45,930
say everybody can participate so

328
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,000
programmers with the programming skills

329
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,410
they can of course participate but if

330
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,720
you intend to do so please behave

331
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,960
yourselves we don't have the money to

332
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:05,820
fight you so thank you so much for

333
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,560
listening and the piece is accessible at

334
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:18,470
paint j/s Khan is or just paint dot is

335
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:23,750
it's been a pleasure talking here and we

336
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,970
would like to know if any of you had any

337
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:35,790
questions we are happy to answer yeah

338
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:47,570
the question there yeah

339
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,790
the insights of how many users and how

340
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,710
many user apps at the same time have

341
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:58,080
used this the night when it went live on

342
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,250
reddit

343
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,880
we got like I think 7,000 hits over a

344
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,070
short period of time and that was after

345
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,420
we set up the live streaming cam so even

346
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,400
if you were abroad you could splat paint

347
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,740
and see a live stream of it actually

348
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,780
happening yeah for some reason that

349
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,810
wasn't like a huge spike at one point it

350
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,660
was like pretty even I don't know why

351
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,420
yeah and the log file from the server

352
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,180
was around 300 megabytes if that tells

353
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:36,810
you anything any more questions

354
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:52,680
oh yeah yeah we did one a couple of

355
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,920
weeks ago which we told you about

356
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,930
briefly it saw we connected a heart rate

357
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,620
sensor to heart animation on front of

358
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,800
Harper so you could come up to the

359
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,260
second floor and make it sense your

360
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,680
heartbeat and then rayful's would form

361
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:20,230
that planted nicely on the light facade

362
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,930
yeah and we allowed for zero but no one

363
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:32,430
had zero heart rate

364
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:40,970
sorry no I was I was thinking on the

365
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,850
webcam was taken down because the hotel

366
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,710
manager thought we were spying on some

367
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,499
guests yeah hotel and our friend needed

368
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:51,350
this phone back as well yeah poor guy

369
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:56,509
