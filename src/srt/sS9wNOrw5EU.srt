Thomas Drach
KATIE: hello? There we go. That's me. Good

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,760
morning. Whoo! Is everybody ready? Yeah. We
have a really, really cool talk to start the

4
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,760
day with. Thomas Drach is here. And when I,
you know, he gave me some fun facts. But actually

5
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:13,085
we had a really fascinating conversation just
now that I'm gonna share with you. So, back

6
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:14,085
in the '90s, the first two CDs that I ever
bought. The first was DJ Jazzy Jeff and the

7
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:15,085
Fresh Prince, the rapper, parents don't understand,
which was amazing. And I bought a Rick Astley\hCD

8
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:16,085
with a famous song on it that people use to
Rickroll each other. And Thomas said his first

9
00:00:16,085 --> 00:00:17,085
tape was Nsync. Clearly his musical taste
is much better than me. Let's give it up for

10
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:18,085
Thomas Drach.
[ Applause ]

11
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,085
THOMAS: Good morning. Thanks for being here
early for this talk. I want to give a huge

12
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,085
thanks to JSConf for having me. They have
been awesome. So grateful to be here. I also

13
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:23,400
want to thank any open source contributors.
Because I feel like I'm using cheat code sometimes,

14
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,900
just like using someone else's code. If you're
anything like me, I may have squirmed a little

15
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:36,289
bit at this AI acronym. And that's good. We're
going through that today. But just your willingness

16
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:42,469
to be here, shows you're open to the ideas
and pushing the boundaries. I think that's

17
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:49,280
commendable. Thanks for being here. Okay.
My name's Thomas Drach like we talked about.

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,209
Thomasdrach on Twitter if you want to bug
me there, please do. I consider myself a designer

19
00:00:55,209 --> 00:01:02,589
and a bit of a hacker. Not in the sense of
this awesome movie. But in the writing bad

20
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:10,450
code sense. I'm really good at that. I have
a little design studio called Subtract where

21
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:15,880
I make what I hope are useful products. One
of which we'll go through today. And I have

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:25,320
a product called Cleverstack too if you want
to check that out. So, I want to start with

23
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:32,480
a man called Paul Thomas. He had a little
garage in Phoenix called the Thomas Brothers

24
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:47,020
Garage. Today people might call him an entrepreneur
or a founder. But he was actually an inventor.

25
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,130
He filed for over a hundred patents and I'm
still trying to track most of them down. I

26
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:56,060
found about a dozen of them. Most reminded
me of the Rube Goldberg machines. I don't

27
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:02,229
know if you have seen these before. They're
simple machines that create this weird trap

28
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:08,969
like mechanism. All the patents I found from
him were complex machines like that. Like

29
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:13,540
nothing you would actually use. It's kind
of hard to see here. But the name of this

30
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:19,239
one is panel manufacturing method. And it's
basically a patent for this giant machine

31
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,400
that creates these like brick and concrete
slabs and then we're supposed to ship them

32
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,859
to job are sites for people to build houses
with them. Kind of made me sad a little bit

33
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:34,640
because it just seemed like a crazy person
was documenting and patenting all of these

34
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,959
things. But the machines that get built. This
is the one that we were just talking about.

35
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:49,650
The manufacturing machine to make the giant
slabs. And they actually had to design and

36
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:56,329
patent these, like, semitrucks to ship them
to job sites. They had these weird little

37
00:02:56,329 --> 00:03:03,371
trucks that would like transport like these
palettes of bricks everywhere. And clearly

38
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:09,980
they didn't invent the screw or the lever
or the racket pinion or these things, but

39
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:17,030
they combined something to make something
new and useful. And it's especially interesting

40
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:25,109
to me because this man was my great grandfather
and my namesake. Some of you might be familiar

41
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:31,849
with this Henry Ford quote. The funny thing
is, Henry Ford never said this. I did research

42
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:40,260
and the first time it was attributed to him
was in 1999 in the cruise industry news quarterly.

43
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:46,430
And other people started using it and now
people say it on stages like this. Sometimes

44
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,430
it's paired with like the Steve Jobs quote
and kind of create this is genius complex

45
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:58,129
of, they didn't know what they want. We have
to show them or whatever. But I think there's

46
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:02,730
something that people miss about this quote
in particular. I think it resonates for a

47
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:08,290
reason. But my interpretation of this quote
is, big progress isn't necessarily just like

48
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:14,269
an iteration of the last thing, but it's like
a mutation of something that happened before.

49
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:24,390
Maybe a little bit like this. We could accidently
combine a few unrelated things to find something

50
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:30,480
new. This is Tim Berners Lee talking about
inventing the Internet. He said I just had

51
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,150
to take the hypertext idea and connect it
to the TC P&D NS ideas and can be ta da, I

52
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:48,090
had the World Wide Web. There's an old LinkedIn,
his profile page, it just said like web developer.

53
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,850
But he goes on this interview, and I recommend
listening or reading interviews from him.

54
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:59,490
He goes on just to attribute all these other
inventions and says if these didn't happen,

55
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,710
the Internet, at least I wouldn't have created
it at that time. I don't know what would have

56
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:11,420
happened. So, the definition of mutation in
the dictionary is the changing of structure,

57
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:20,580
resulting in a variant form that may be transmitted
to subsequent generations. Hendrix famously

58
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:27,400
took right handed guitars, flipped them upside
down and then eventually changed music. And

59
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,551
he did so in part because it was before Les
Paul invented the electronic guitar. They

60
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:42,170
didn't invent it to invent it, but because
they wanted the acoustic guitar louder. And

61
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:47,670
Grace Hopper, is one of the inventers of what
we now call programming. A big reason we're

62
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:56,100
here today. And she started with knobs and
switches on the Mark I. All of these were

63
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:06,210
mutations. Like it was different enough. Hopper's
was a mutation. And I think AI is a built

64
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:12,070
of a mutation, at least how we talk about
it today. There's much more data, advances

65
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:16,550
in machine learning, compute power thanks
to Moore's Law. And it kind of created the

66
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:25,040
opportunity for something like AI to work.
This is what I get when I search "AI" on Google.

67
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:31,510
I don't know about you. But this isn't very
helpful for me. So, I'll ask a little bit

68
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:36,560
different question today. I want to ask, what
are intelligent machines? We might be able

69
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:46,700
to define this. Just intelligence + machines.
So, let's define intelligence. This is a quote;

70
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,490
I'm just going to read it really quick. People
generally distrust the concept of machines

71
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:57,210
that approach and thus why not pass our own
human intelligence. I think a lot of people

72
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:02,820
feel like this today. And this quote was actually
written in 1970 in the book called the architecture

73
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:10,370
machine actually by the person who founded
the MIT Media Lab. And it goes on to say that,

74
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,810
machines must be aware of their context in
order to be intelligent. So, you can't have

75
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:21,000
like a machine without using the context,
interacting with the world. It's not intelligent

76
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,550
in that case. There's no lack of context in
the new Tesla roadsters. So, for our purposes,

77
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:36,140
and I'm just gonna say intelligence means
using context. So, now we can define machines.

78
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,950
This should be pretty easy. We go to the dictionary
and find a mechanically, electronically, or

79
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:51,020
electrically operated device for a task. Sounds
good to me. Okay. So, with intelligence and

80
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:56,880
machines defined, I would like to introduce
you to the concept of somewhat intelligent

81
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:03,700
machines. And this is what we're gonna build
today. And this is just something that uses

82
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:10,450
context and rapidly completes something that
a human could not. And we're gonna do all

83
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:19,860
of it in JavaScript. So, this is the actual
machine instrument, musician, AI, whatever

84
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,280
you want to call it. This is what we're gonna
build today. I'm going to walk through how

85
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,810
to generate drumbeats using pre trained machine
learning models, APIs, libraries, stuff like

86
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:35,520
that. We're going to piece it together. And
I find it a little bit hard for me to follow

87
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:41,700
tiny code so it's gonna be a little pseudo
codey. Like I said, the first thing we needed

88
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:49,860
were a couple libraries\hwe're going to use
Magenta. If you haven't heard of Magenta already,

89
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,580
please check it out. It's incredible. A couple
of people have talked about it already here

90
00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:01,410
at JSConf. And then we're going to use Tone,
which is actually a dependency Magenta which

91
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:10,071
gives us an easier to code interface for musical
stuff. All right. Let's play some drums. This

92
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:16,990
is what the data structure for the drums will
look like. You can set up a step sequence,

93
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:24,770
but this is a step sequence in Magenta. There's
a pitch, there's an attribute that tells it's

94
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:31,560
a sample based pitch, not a tonal keyboard
like thing. And there's quantization info.

95
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:38,760
There's a method that does that for you so
you don't have to worry about it. Okay. So,

96
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,940
all we need to play that note sequence is
two lines of code. We're going to create a

97
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:48,820
new instance in the Magenta music player.
And I'm going to call it player.star on that.

98
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:54,470
And we're gonna get something like this.
[drumbeats]

99
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:01,750
This is just our basic pattern that we plugged
in. Right? It's not that exciting. We kind

100
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:07,680
of want something a little bit more like this.
Like feed it in and we'll get something better

101
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,140
in the material. All right. But in order to
do that and do super quick ML crash course.

102
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:20,080
I am not the one to go in depth about this.
But let's all get on the same page. Okay.

103
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,630
So, usually write functions something like
this. We want something, we put something

104
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:31,320
in, we want something back. Machine learning,
it's a little bit more abstract, right? We

105
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:39,120
don't know abstractly like what we\h how we
would get there. Like, is this image a dog?

106
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,220
Here's the image. I don't know. Some of you
might see\h

107
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,580
[ Laughter ]
Memes like this. This is one of my favorites.

108
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:54,790
Chicken fingers and the goldendoodles, I think.
I don't know how dogs and cats became like

109
00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:02,620
the hello world of machine learning. But I'm
not mad about it. So, here's what we call

110
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:08,110
training data. If it was training data, it
was probably labeled. So, this is a dog. I

111
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:13,770
probably should have said like fried chicken.
That's not an actual chicken. So, you feed

112
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:18,660
all that to the machine. The machine says
all these are dogs. They have this weird odd

113
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:25,460
thing on their face. We call that a feature.
That feature to us looks like a nose. The

114
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,140
machine goes, okay, there's a nose. It's probably
a dog. So, we feed them the image and it's

115
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:38,290
gonna guess, dog. All of these are just like
probabilities. For our purposes, we want to

116
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:44,290
give it some drums and we want some better
drums in turn. So, that's where Magenta comes

117
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:50,640
in. Magenta has a couple different models
available. All of these are super cool and

118
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,960
it seems like they're coming out with more
every week, every month. So, there's a MusicRNN

119
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:04,740
model, a Music VAE and a Piano Genie. Right
now the Piano Genie is a VAI as well. Just

120
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:13,120
quick, RNN stands for recounter neural network,
a bunch of nodes. It's like one of those.

121
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,980
But it loops through itself. And a VAE is
a variational auto\hencoder. If you're familiar

122
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,550
with encoding and decoding, it works similarly
to that. For our purposes, we're going to

123
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:32,120
use the MusicRNN models just in the context
of Magenta. They have a little bit better

124
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,300
support for like individual instruments like
drums. And this is kind of what that might

125
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,691
look like. So, if you have nodes on the network,
you have it looping through itself and you

126
00:12:42,691 --> 00:12:47,400
have an in and an out. For us, we're going
to put in our initial drum beat and we're

127
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:56,331
going to expect a generated drum beat in return.
Okay. So, we picked our MusicRNN models. This

128
00:12:56,331 --> 00:13:02,190
is what the actual checkpoint is. So, this
is like a pre trained model. Trained with

129
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:07,890
millions of drumbeats and it has a sense of
what drumbeats are. There's a kick on one,

130
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:14,510
there's a snare on two or something like that.
So, these are the three lines of code that

131
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:20,790
we need to generate a new drumbeat. So, you
just create a new instance of our MusicRNN

132
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:26,210
model, the checkpoint that we had. We initialize
the model, it loads\hitself up. And then we

133
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:31,420
call this method continue sequence. We feed
it in our note sequence, feed the number of

134
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:38,000
steps which is kind of arbitrary. Could be
16, 32 or whatever. And then we feed it a

135
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,070
number from zero to two. We'll go over the
temperature a little bit letter. So, after

136
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:50,940
we do that, we just get a sample in return
and we play the same way we played the other

137
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:57,320
one. So, this is what that looked like. This
is gonna be generated beat with a temperature

138
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,590
of 1.5.
[[drumbeat]

139
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:17,529
And if you generate it again, it's going to
come up with now beats that we've never heard.

140
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:22,150
Cool. So, yeah.
[ Applause ] all right. That was cool. But

141
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:27,100
it was a little bit of a blackbox. So, I want
to go through what happens when we call them

142
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,970
with a continue sequence. We call it here
in the three lines are of code. All we're

143
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,830
gonna do here is what's happening behind the
scenes is we're gonna convert the note sequence

144
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:43,710
which is that drum thing. We're going to convert
it to a Tensor. And then we're going to encode

145
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:47,930
the tensor to match the model, the checkpoint
that you have. If you're wondering what a

146
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:56,490
tensor is, you probably already know. If you
remember municipal math, is scalars and vectors.

147
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:04,060
A tensor has three dimensions. That's why
you hair the word shape when talking about

148
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:15,459
machine learning. And especially TensorFlow.
These are all\h but the last is tensor. And

149
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:23,779
then there's an internal method called sampleRNN.
The inputs go into the TensorFlow library

150
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:30,140
and generates the next notes. If you want
to get into the nitty gritty, TensorFlow.JS

151
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:36,300
is a great place to actually get your hands
dirty there. It helps me to visualize like

152
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:42,529
this. Once more, the continueSequence. And
the note here, the noteSequence, convert it

153
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:52,290
to a model, call the sampleRNN and get the
new drums. I told you we were gonna talk about

154
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:57,580
temperature. It's interesting to me because
it's one of the few inputs we have available.

155
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:02,800
Restructure train it with different drumbeats,
which is kind of cool. But temperature is

156
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:09,890
like the level of entropy in the system. So,
the lower the temperature, the more predictable

157
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:16,620
result we're gonna get. The higher, the less
predictable it will be. So, just as an example,

158
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,110
and drop it down here to 0.2.
Sounds like really similar to the original

159
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:33,420
drumbeat. And if we keep generating it, it's
pretty much like the same, right? So, now

160
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:43,980
we're gonna try cranking it up to 1.5.
[Drumbeats\h ]

161
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:58,100
So, a little bit more exciting, for sure.
This is the temperature I like. More fun.

162
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:05,480
And after we do that, we just have like a
little demo button here. It will generate

163
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:11,799
a new file. And then sometimes what I will
do is I will drop it in this, garage band

164
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:17,510
and use it as a musician for my band. If you're
wondering why there's no audio right now,

165
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:23,630
it's because we're not judging my music skills
today. We're talking about JavaScript. Okay.

166
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:32,220
So, that was cool. It was like almost somewhat
intelligent. I wanted to take it one step

167
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:38,710
further. So, I wanted to give the machine
a little bit of motivation with applause.

168
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:47,190
So, depending on how much you applaud it,
the machine would then generate a new temperature.

169
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:54,299
Here we go. The machine would generate a new
temperature based on like the average amplitude

170
00:17:54,299 --> 00:18:02,200
of a couple seconds period of time. I wanted
more context to have a better definition of

171
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:09,400
our somewhat intelligent machine. So, I literally
injected more context into it. So, this is

172
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,410
pretty simple. I'm just getting the user's
microphone. And I have this little method

173
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:21,530
here called analyze sound. I'm going to use
create script processer and just take the

174
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:29,270
average volume over a couple seconds. Okay.
And against my better judgment, we're gonna

175
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:44,620
do a live demo. Okay. So, this is the drumbeat.
That's the normal drum beat we programmed

176
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:58,270
in. Then we can generate one. Drop it down
a little bit. So, this is like pretty cool.

177
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:08,460
Generating a new one every time.
Okay. Now I need your help. So, I've created

178
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:15,700
this little perform feature. When I click
the button, it's going to wait for applause

179
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,960
for a couple seconds and then it's gonna take
that average amplitude over that period of

180
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,710
time, decide on what temperature to play,
and then generate the beat based on that.

181
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:33,380
I promise I'm not trying to manufacture applause
for myself. Maybe a little bit. Okay. So,

182
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:42,770
let's try this. On the count of three, be
like nice. But loud. I'm\h on the count of

183
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:47,080
three, start applauding. I'm going to hit
the button right after you start applauding

184
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:54,670
and then we'll see what happens. Live demos
always work. So with, this should be great.

185
00:19:54,670 --> 00:20:00,110
On the count of three, one, two, three.
[ Applause ]

186
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:14,030
Yeah! All right. So, that's that. So, it actually
goes from like zero to 2. It goes up pretty\h

187
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:24,500
it still is morning. But you're being considerate.
I'm fine with that. Cool. So, that's that.

188
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:31,510
That is our somewhat intelligent machine.
So, did we use context? I think so. We put

189
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:39,750
in our drumbeat. We took applause. We told
it the steps we wanted. It definitely rapidly

190
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:44,169
completed something that we couldn't do on
our own, right? We can generate like a dozen

191
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:52,130
or so drumbeats just in a couple seconds.
So, I think we did it. Other people have created

192
00:20:52,130 --> 00:21:00,270
some really cool things. This is called a
neural computer. Usually play a couple notes,

193
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:06,919
an arpeggio, bounce back and forth. But this
will take the temperature into effect. It

194
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:17,150
uses the improvRNN model from Magenta.
I really like it. The Magenta team created

195
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:24,070
kind of like what we just did, but inside
of able10. If you use it, you can do what

196
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:36,090
we just did, and generate right inside. And
the Flaming Lips actually created this thing

197
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:42,010
called the framing\h the Flaming Lips and
Magenta created this thing called Fruit Genie.

198
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:50,141
And it was fruit, but it would say like orange
and it would feed the model. And then they

199
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:55,690
created like these giant pool toy type things
that had censors on them and then threw them

200
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:02,340
into the audience and asked people to feed
it into the same model and create this, like,

201
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:08,120
melody. This is a little clip of what that
looked like.

202
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:13,230
>> Written this song especially for tonight's
occasion.

203
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:21,710
THOMAS: So, they threw out these things into
the audience. And people\h and you could hear

204
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:26,870
it in the melody like cycle back. There's
not like\h

205
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:34,679
>> Apple\h
THOMAS: So, all of these things, all the stuff

206
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:42,380
we just talked about. All of it was just Tone.js
and Magenta and we created our own as well.

207
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:49,170
We used a couple other previous inventions,
sure. But that was kind of the point, right?

208
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:55,230
Combining these simple machines to kind of
create something more complex. We didn't reinvent

209
00:22:55,230 --> 00:23:02,910
the wheel, by any means. We didn't have to.
We just created something a little bit smarter

210
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:09,179
than it was before with the tools that I had
at our disposal. I think we can keep doing

211
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,549
this. We can keep like flipping our tools
and creating things that are new and useful

212
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:20,110
for people and helpful and interesting. And
hopefully the inventions that we piece together,

213
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:27,010
the sum will be greater than its parts. This
is such an exciting time to be building stuff.

214
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:30,304
And I can't wait to see what we all build
next. So, thank you.

215
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,304
[ Applause ]
KATIE: Wow. Oh, my gosh, all right, I'm gonna

216
00:23:31,304 --> 00:23:32,304
gush for a second about the Flaming Lips.
They're one of my favorite bands. I've seen

217
00:23:32,304 --> 00:23:33,304
them live four or five times. If you haven't
seen them, even if you don't particularly

218
00:23:33,304 --> 00:23:34,304
love their music, it's an amazing experience.
You should go and do it. I'm going to stop

219
00:23:34,304 --> 00:23:35,304
gushing about the Flaming Lips and now I'm
going to gush about Thomas. That was really

220
00:23:35,304 --> 00:23:36,304
cool and I really love his message that, you
know, like he's not some kind of crazy genius.

221
00:23:36,304 --> 00:23:37,304
He's just like a person who is really into
music and really wanted to try something cool.

222
00:23:37,304 --> 00:23:38,304
And that we all could do this with JavaScript.
It's like amazing, right? Anyway, so, coming

223
00:23:38,304 --> 00:23:39,304
up next we have Sophia Shoemaker is going
to talk about building a PWA that had to work

224
00:23:39,304 --> 00:23:40,304
off the grid in an African country which I
can't remember which one, but we need to be

225
00:23:40,304 --> 00:23:41,304
back here at 10:30 for that. So, you have
a couple minutes to go out and switch rooms

226
00:23:41,304 --> 00:23:42,304
if you want. But you shouldn't. You should
stay here. All right. Thanks, everybody.
