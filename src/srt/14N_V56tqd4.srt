1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,570

thanks everybody for coming out today so

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,089
my name is Adam for those of you who I

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,200
have not gotten to meet in person and

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,759
yeah I don't know what the title of my

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,009
talk would be other than things I've

6
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:16,800
learned about CSS over like ten years of

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,279
typing it sometimes so when I went to

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:27,230
college this was one of my cool alright

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,699
this was one of my favorite quotes and

10
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,329
my chemistry professor gave this to me

11
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:35,040
to kind of make us less afraid of

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,730
learning and trying to break down things

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,440
that already existed and I think that

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,840
this is really true in the world of

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,489
front-end development because it's

16
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,320
really really a very baby discipline

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,610
hasn't the internet hasn't been around

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,649
that long chemistry has been around

19
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,870
forever right and we're still learning

20
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,809
about chemistry constantly so I think

21
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:59,730
that it's really important to remember

22
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,920
even if you've only been typing CSS for

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,510
a couple of months that there's a lot of

24
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,129
work to do there's a lot of stuff that's

25
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,470
broken there's a lot of stuff that's not

26
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,659
fun about typing CSS or front-end

27
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,420
development right now in general so yeah

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,159
I try to keep that in mind that it's

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,930
part of our responsibility to fix it a

30
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,380
little bit so a quick couple things

31
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,030
about me I come from this state which is

32
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,119
in Maine it's very cold there home of

33
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,799
the Maine Coon cat if you're unfamiliar

34
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,799
it's a pretty majestic beast I'm a

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,689
definitely a big cat fan if you did not

36
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:32,759
know I went to college in Ohio

37
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,579
another cold cold place and I studied

38
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,500
studio art there and then I moved to

39
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,360
this wonderful state of California

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,460
places much further south called Los

41
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,799
Angeles because I got a job designing

42
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,960
amusement parks which most people think

43
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,680
is like this but I didn't get to design

44
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,590
any rollercoasters at all that's smart

45
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,119
people who do physics and engineering

46
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,100
and things like that but they did let me

47
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,300
color pictures in of amusement parks

48
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,700
but it was great training as a first

49
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,979
design job because designing amusement

50
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,110
parks is kind of crazy you have all

51
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,599
these things to think about like a

52
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,400
family waiting in line for four hours

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,230
for one ride and you don't want to put

54
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,030
the two most popular rides next to each

55
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,800
other because then they're gonna wait

56
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,360
back-to-back you want to spread some

57
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,370
stuff out you've got to tell stories

58
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,140
along the park and you don't know which

59
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,760
direction people are going to go in and

60
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,230
you want the story to make sense the

61
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:35,340
whole time but the biggest thing I think

62
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,690
oh sorry so I start designing amusement

63
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,900
parks and got a little bored with the

64
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,549
fact that they're still working on

65
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:46,019
building stuff I was designing eight

66
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,299
years ago and on the web you can build

67
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:49,830
stuff up in like an afternoon and tear

68
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,330
it down and probably most of the

69
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,739
websites I've ever built don't exist

70
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,060
anymore which I actually kind of think

71
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,580
is cool uh-huh so I went to work for

72
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,400
this company and they called me and they

73
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,440
wanted me to come work on this print

74
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,540
platform where they were going to do

75
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,209
data visualizations of people's energy

76
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:08,430
usage and mail it to their houses to get

77
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,470
them to use less energy and this sounded

78
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,510
so crazy to me I was like why don't you

79
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,030
make a website and they said we have a

80
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,100
website and nobody goes to it but we

81
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,890
print these reports and we save tons and

82
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,780
tons of energy and that sounded pretty

83
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,160
neat to me I was kind of a dirty hippie

84
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,959
in college and there weren't a lot of

85
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,880
other web jobs where I could save energy

86
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,609
but this platform that I had to work on

87
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,350
the reason I bring this up is it was a

88
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,959
print platform and it was completely

89
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,500
built with HTML and CSS and we had a lot

90
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,430
of problems that didn't exist on the web

91
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:46,109
like there's no hover States right so

92
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:48,390
there's no animations there's no

93
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,880
interactive stuff everything's kind of

94
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,380
done in place you can't mess up printing

95
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,690
you can't print something get a mistake

96
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,060
mail it to somebody's house you can fix

97
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,889
your website right and like maybe nobody

98
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:04,410
noticed when you mail 750,000 or

99
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,850
something to somebody and it's got the

100
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,879
wrong word in it or you know the text is

101
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,560
off the page that's not good for anybody

102
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,299
it's not good for your users and it's

103
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,299
not good for your cuffs

104
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:18,600
so when I worked at Opower I got to work

105
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,430
with a really talented group of software

106
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,590
engineers that taught me a lot of really

107
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,680
awesome things just about typing code

108
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,120
that helped shape the form of how I

109
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,729
think about authoring CSS so this guy's

110
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:31,830
name is Dave Copeland he's big in the

111
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,710
Ruby community but one time he

112
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,570
challenged me and he said Adam who do

113
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,979
you think is the best in the world at

114
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,860
CSS and I don't actually think there's

115
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,289
one like CSS Overlord that rules us all

116
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:45,720
or anything I don't really think there's

117
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,520
one person who's good at CSS but I

118
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,430
understood his question and I gave him

119
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,410
some names about people I thought were

120
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,690
pretty good at CSS and he said what

121
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,190
would it take for you to be the best in

122
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,949
the world and I started to answer that

123
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:01,770
would be impossible which I realize is

124
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,620
like a horrible attitude to have if you

125
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,940
even though I don't think I could be the

126
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,100
best at CSS in the world I started to

127
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,050
wake up and think like what would it

128
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,090
take like what is there left to learn

129
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,850
like what things can we discover how

130
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,280
would you become the best at CSS and

131
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,010
this guy is absolutely as crazy as this

132
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,030
photo looks this guy's name is yoni and

133
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,860
I was explaining this really convoluted

134
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,449
thing I wanted to build to him one day

135
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:30,090
and he looks at me and goes dude this is

136
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,550
like so trivial and I was pretty

137
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,229
offended and taken aback because I was

138
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:36,060
like really complicated I've never done

139
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,620
anything like this it goes but so many

140
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,479
people have I was like yeah I've never

141
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,669
done it and he said you shouldn't be

142
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:43,710
entertained by doing stuff a million

143
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,210
people have done before he said in

144
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,039
mathematics if somebody's done something

145
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,349
it's trivial and if nobody's ever done

146
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,539
something it's impossible and I'm only

147
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:54,630
interested in possible tasks and I

148
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,159
thought that like blew my mind right I

149
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,690
was like I'm just trying to get this box

150
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,560
like on a page like your advanced

151
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,909
electrical engineering degree doesn't

152
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:05,130
apply to me here but I did think it was

153
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,260
a wonderful frame of mind to be and when

154
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,750
we try to approach problems and so I'm

155
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,070
going to talk about this stuff and I'm

156
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,330
starting to talk about some technical

157
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,479
things so I went to work at Salesforce

158
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,630
and we did some business things there I

159
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,490
actually have these slides that order I

160
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,900
went to work here first

161
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,730
so I get here

162
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,360
[Music]

163
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,180
and this is what drives everything

164
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,190
empathy right like CSS is my empathy

165
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,380
medium I know that probably sounds weird

166
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,080
but like I don't care about clean code I

167
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,330
don't care about code in general I'm a

168
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,050
designer

169
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,240
I just want my users to like have a

170
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,120
better life I know that sounds really

171
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,940
freaking silly but like that's my mom

172
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,730
and she's awesome and like I've seen her

173
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,650
use her phone and be frustrated by

174
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,180
trying to use a service and it just

175
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,340
doesn't work and it's like and these are

176
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,110
my grandparents and my grandmother uses

177
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,910
the Internet like all the time

178
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,130
and she calls me to complain about it

179
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,180
and she's like I understand what this

180
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,790
works what browser are using nowadays

181
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,250
but those are people that use the stuff

182
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,290
that we build and I care about their

183
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,780
time I care about their frustration

184
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,710
levels so brings me to this topic of the

185
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,780
veil of ignorance so there's this guy

186
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,980
John Rawls who brings up this concept of

187
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,200
like say you could change anything about

188
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,210
the world we live in right like you

189
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,040
could make completely new systems with

190
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,610
completely new laws what would that look

191
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,660
like

192
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,970
but the the catch is that when you wake

193
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,390
up tomorrow you're not gonna be you like

194
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,280
you might be a woman you might be a man

195
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,910
you might be 105 you might be 12 you

196
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,370
might be really rich you might be really

197
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,070
poor and the point is like to think

198
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,600
about all the stuff you don't have to

199
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,160
think about this veil of ignorance we

200
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,260
live in all the time right and I think

201
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,510
this is true like beyond CSS in our

202
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,630
crazy country right now and I think all

203
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,480
of us live in like so many different

204
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,800
veils of ignorance --is where we don't

205
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,280
think about what other people go through

206
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,780
and I try to think about that at every

207
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,820
level when I write CSS I try to think

208
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,650
about like you might not have a fast

209
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,930
connection and I don't mean some person

210
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,130
in a third world country like have you

211
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,630
gotten lunch at the Ferry Building in

212
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,190
San Francisco like I have like a

213
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,320
brand-new phone I'm like in the building

214
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,810
across from major tech places no

215
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,610
internet cannot get text to load my

216
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,130
phone so like performance matters your

217
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,740
device matters so I try to I try to

218
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,270
embody that I try to think and meditate

219
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,280
on all the stuff that my users are gonna

220
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,229
have to go through and I try to write

221
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:38,550
CSS that in here

222
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,769
things and doesn't take away from the

223
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:43,050
experience but as somebody who's written

224
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,510
CSS for like 10 years now this is kind

225
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,700
of how I feel every single day no matter

226
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,880
how much I learn no matter what other

227
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,260
people teach me no matter what cool

228
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,690
frameworks come out so so I worked it

229
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,930
like this

230
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,459
yeah this print platform and I had to

231
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,860
make sure nothing ever broke ever which

232
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,649
was an interesting task and performance

233
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:09,209
really mattered because it's print and

234
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:11,399
they've got to rip these PDFs and like I

235
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,839
could make performance changes that

236
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,310
saved like hundreds of thousands of

237
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,130
dollars a year in print costs and I come

238
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,660
to the web and I started asking

239
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,399
questions for these feedback loops I

240
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,860
have on this like wonderful print

241
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,390
platform I say that slightly

242
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,390
sarcastically and I'm asking questions

243
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,670
like well what's better for architecting

244
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,110
your media queries this or this and

245
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,790
people like I don't know and I'm like

246
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,829
well I don't know how much is like too

247
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:36,660
much CSS for a website like I haven't

248
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,940
built websites in forever I'm people

249
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,620
like I don't I don't really know I'm

250
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,120
probably asking the wrong people I but

251
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,829
if I'd known any of you at the time you

252
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:47,990
would have given me awesome answers so I

253
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,730
kind of like as I get back to the web I

254
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,110
start really questioning like what is

255
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,060
good CSS I don't really feel like I can

256
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,600
answer that question like that and I

257
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,920
think the first thing is like stuff

258
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,200
works right I for me like I just want

259
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,620
I've only ever been paid to solve two

260
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,500
problems on the Internet which is one

261
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,140
getting people to consume content right

262
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,670
like they might be reading words they

263
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,470
might be watching a video they might be

264
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,360
looking at images but like no matter

265
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,279
what it is like it needs to be on a

266
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,959
canvas right I think if it's off the

267
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,640
canvas they can't solve that problem

268
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,500
with consuming the media and the other

269
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,089
thing is like I need to get people to

270
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:25,649
type into a box and hit submit

271
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:27,240
and I'm just trying to not those

272
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,029
two things up right like so I think that

273
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,470
this is important and I think that

274
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,390
there's no bounds to this at all I think

275
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,160
like these watches are probably gonna

276
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,990
break all the websites that I've ever

277
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,449
made but when I start testing on watches

278
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:42,060
I want it to work there so these are a

279
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,320
couple of things that I believe to be

280
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,779
true and I don't really have much

281
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,670
willingness to compromise them at this

282
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,260
point I think that everything should be

283
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,029
readable on any device and I mean that

284
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:52,350
like while you're walking down the

285
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,120
street or bouncing up and down in the

286
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,490
back of a cab lawyer slightly tipsy I

287
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,579
mean that like if you're dyslexic you

288
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:01,050
should still be able to read things we

289
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,730
should think about the typefaces we pick

290
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,770
I think everything should be as

291
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,230
performant as possible like I don't

292
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,819
think the bar is high enough there right

293
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:10,949
like a thousand milliseconds after that

294
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:13,500
you're losing money and people's

295
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,730
attention but you're also wasting

296
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,319
people's time and a thousand

297
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:18,420
milliseconds isn't that long like every

298
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,370
single millisecond counts so when people

299
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,410
say CSS performance doesn't matter I get

300
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,740
really sad I think that designing in the

301
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,270
browser should be easy and we should

302
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,220
have systems that promote that and I

303
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,230
think that doing one thing extremely

304
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,390
well promotes reusability and I know

305
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,640
that that's been said a million times

306
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,810
before but you think about something

307
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,699
like nicholas Gallagher's clearfix class

308
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:41,970
and it's just this one thing that does

309
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,949
this other thing perfectly and almost

310
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:46,800
everybody uses it and its canonical at

311
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,079
this point and like we need more of that

312
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:50,760
we need more small things just just do

313
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,990
one job really well so if I didn't know

314
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,089
better I would think that this quote by

315
00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:01,770
Douglas Adams was about CSS authors at

316
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,110
least the ones I hang out with and write

317
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,270
code with so and I would put myself in

318
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,670
this camp in that I just constantly felt

319
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,230
as I was coming back to the web that I

320
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,089
was doing the same stuff over and over

321
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:14,880
and over and over again and so I decided

322
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,529
to when I was trying to answer this

323
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,779
question like what is good CSS I was

324
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,339
like you know who might know is like the

325
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:24,480
top 500 websites so I read all their CSS

326
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,100
and I'm not kidding about that I read it

327
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,560
line by line by line because I was

328
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,480
interested in why systems breakdown

329
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,940
right and CSS is kind of weird that it's

330
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,800
people always tack stuff on at the

331
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,319
bottom so you actually get this linear

332
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:40,470
view of how systems get up and

333
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,529
and like because I'm empathetic to those

334
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,569
users my first priority is the people

335
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:46,980
who actually use the products we build

336
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,440
but I also write CSS that I expect other

337
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,420
people to use and so those are my users

338
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,310
and I care about them and this is all I

339
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,529
see this is what I see front-end people

340
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:57,959
do here's the myth about CSS that

341
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:01,949
everybody sells you is like do me inline

342
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,120
Styles are horrible

343
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,810
right dude if you run a class you could

344
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,880
change it and it'll propagate everywhere

345
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,860
on your website this sounds like a

346
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,010
nightmare oh my god I don't know if

347
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,990
everybody has a different job than me

348
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,029
but normally I need to change like three

349
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:20,430
things on one page as quickly as

350
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,470
possible and get the out and like I

351
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,000
don't want stuff to propagate to the

352
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,250
thousands of pages that I can't see if

353
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,630
you've worked on Salesforce as main app

354
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,279
it's not like you can just like run

355
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,540
through and like do some visual

356
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,279
regression testing like they have so

357
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,600
many modules that get embedded

358
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,220
everywhere right and I think that's the

359
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,290
state of development but you constantly

360
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,480
see this which is really just some this

361
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,490
seems like a lot of work to reset margin

362
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,160
padding to me and it seems unlearn able

363
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,510
like I'm not going to remember this the

364
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,779
next time I have a project and I feel

365
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,310
like if I was a cat and I saw that code

366
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:54,330
I would look like this and and this is

367
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,130
this is another example this is a

368
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:00,029
different website like I'm lazy I know

369
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:01,650
you guys don't really know me but I'm

370
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,480
really lazy and it seems like an

371
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,060
incredible amount of work to put ten

372
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,220
pixels of margin on the bottom of an

373
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,839
element yeah this is this is my internal

374
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,779
catalog and like what I'm seeing these

375
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,370
things I'm like you just really want

376
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,930
that Lego block like you want this Lego

377
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,120
block that does margin bottom ten pixels

378
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,270
and this is how I think about building

379
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,040
the majority of UI not all of it

380
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,540
but I think it's really just these like

381
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,190
small Lego blocks that I want to like

382
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:33,480
throw on HTML really fast so this is

383
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,490
another this person like I would have

384
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,900
left this job I would have gotten like

385
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,670
halfway and man text-align:right got it

386
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,980
yeah so but I start seeing this and like

387
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,930
I asked this question that you know I've

388
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,400
been typing CSS at this point for like

389
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,779
six years and I'm wondering to myself

390
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:55,020
like like how big is CSS right like I

391
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,630
like so much of CSS you just use one

392
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,790
line things that just like how many

393
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,529
other times using in the system they set

394
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:04,740
background color to ie right I mean

395
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,180
that's cool and then like look at the

396
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,519
classroom right gray wall

397
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:11,249
you know like because they're just

398
00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:12,660
trying to change this one thing and like

399
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,489
I don't think this person's bad at CSS

400
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:16,739
like I think they were trying to do

401
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:19,259
something that are in a time crunch and

402
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:20,639
this is their understanding of like how

403
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,129
to traverse the Dom I got nothing but

404
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:26,809
love for that ah that's my happy cafes

405
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:31,799
so yes yes this is like 20 kilobytes and

406
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:32,819
you're probably like what does that mean

407
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:36,029
and so there's some kind of limits this

408
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:46,439
ooh so sorry so CSS is like finite for

409
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:48,600
the most part right like I mean you can

410
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,039
do a bunch of crazy stuff too but it's

411
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,689
not JavaScript it's not Ruby it's not

412
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:53,639
like open-ended programming thing like

413
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:56,100
most of what you're trying to do and the

414
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,410
web has already been done before and

415
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,989
like they're just a set amount of string

416
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:04,109
values so let me give you a good example

417
00:16:04,109 --> 00:16:06,779
here I don't actually know that much

418
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:08,489
about animations background repeat'

419
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:10,549
right like these are your only options

420
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:13,649
so I wondered to myself yeah like if you

421
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:16,350
just kind of dumped everything into one

422
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,720
file as single purpose classes how big

423
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,189
would that be because I'm looking at

424
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:21,600
websites like why enjoying Salesforce

425
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,839
they have like a megabyte of CSS and

426
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,419
like that sounds crazy to me but I was I

427
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,559
don't know they've been around 14 years

428
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,999
maybe that's a completely reasonable

429
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:32,879
amount of CSS to have so when I say 20

430
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:35,429
kilobytes I mean I have like 140 colors

431
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:37,350
set to border color right like that I've

432
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,299
never built a website doesn't need of

433
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,429
this many border colors so I tried to

434
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:43,379
like really blow this experiment out and

435
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:45,779
put as many possible things in there and

436
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:50,339
I put a bunch of scales in there but the

437
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:52,289
point is is like 20 kilobytes that's

438
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:53,819
minified in gzip by the way that's not

439
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:56,519
just like a raw uncompressed file but 20

440
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,139
kilobytes is pretty small and it's an

441
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,539
interesting baseline to me and it makes

442
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:01,769
me look at other websites like

443
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:04,110
Kickstarter right it has 793 kilobytes

444
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:08,250
they did this morning anyway that is a

445
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,679
lot and there are two factors there

446
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,659
right like you're sending that file to a

447
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:14,189
client that somebody's got like download

448
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:16,139
on their phone or their desktop but you

449
00:17:16,139 --> 00:17:17,909
also are giving all this work for people

450
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:21,779
to like memorize or sift through later

451
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:23,849
and so much of it it's just these little

452
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:27,779
little Lego blocks anyway so that is all

453
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:29,969
of CSS in one file it's kind of like a

454
00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:31,590
running experiment I have I don't think

455
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,789
that your codebase shouldn't necessarily

456
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:34,830
look like that was not what I'm saying

457
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,279
at all

458
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:38,219
but I think I was kind of flabbergasted

459
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:41,099
that I never asked myself what are the

460
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:44,820
limits here so that's my happy cat

461
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,489
there's only 20 kilobytes so if you

462
00:17:47,489 --> 00:17:50,070
actually take those single purpose

463
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,200
classes and you wanted to target a

464
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,749
multitude of media breakpoints you could

465
00:17:54,749 --> 00:17:57,059
namespace those classes to only target

466
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:58,499
three different breakpoints

467
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:00,419
so you're essentially got the CSS

468
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:02,669
language times four right I don't know

469
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:04,950
if you're following me here and that is

470
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,200
only 42 kilobytes or something like that

471
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,659
so this is kind of blew my mind when I

472
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:12,989
started to put this together and I think

473
00:18:12,989 --> 00:18:14,639
that right now we're starting to see

474
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:17,399
this move towards more in line style

475
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:19,169
stuff

476
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:21,359
I know react there's a talk right now

477
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:23,669
going on about react where inline styles

478
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,019
are like the future of the Internet and

479
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:26,639
I could not be more of a proponent of

480
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,710
this I totally think there's a place for

481
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,509
like component based classes and stuff

482
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:33,330
like that but I think that you know I've

483
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,919
been running these tests on websites and

484
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:36,149
I don't have the internet right now so I

485
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:38,489
can't show you my numbers but you know

486
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:41,339
you can't like 40% of most websites just

487
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:43,559
breaks down to floats display colors

488
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:47,039
order styles background colors and

489
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,809
positioning right it's just structure

490
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:52,219
and skins there's like 40% of your CSS

491
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:55,080
so I want to give a big thanks to this

492
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,839
guy who has been working on this website

493
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,239
called CSS stats comm with me which is

494
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:03,119
this little thing that he and I built to

495
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:05,549
start to try to answer some of these

496
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:07,499
questions that we were constantly having

497
00:19:07,499 --> 00:19:09,719
like yeah how much is too much CSS when

498
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:12,570
we refactor a large code base how much

499
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,399
is just redundant like where our biggest

500
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:15,839
bang for the buck if we want to abstract

501
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,330
things out so check that out if you ever

502
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,339
want to kind of get like a little living

503
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:22,200
style guide and see what your code base

504
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,349
looks like CSS stats calm this is my

505
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:29,639
info but I want to leave you with

506
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:32,849
basically a call to put that back up a

507
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:34,980
call to arms to like expect

508
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,140
more of ourselves and to push ourselves

509
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,320
more because I think that our users are

510
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,390
important and I think sometimes I've

511
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,190
worked with engineering teams and we're

512
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,780
trying to solve problems and we get away

513
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,010
from the actual problems that we're

514
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,600
trying to solve which is that like we

515
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,770
just want to chip away at making

516
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,380
people's lives better with technology we

517
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,850
want to you know solves problems

518
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,740
creatively but the most important thing

519
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,720
to me is our users and making sure that

520
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,490
like we respect their time so anyway

521
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,750
thank you very much
