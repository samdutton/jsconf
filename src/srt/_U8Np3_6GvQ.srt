1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,770

hi I'm Rachel I'm oh ho everywhere on

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,080
the Internet ask me what it means later

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,580
and the answer is nothing but I'll

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,389
explain it um so yeah I am going to tell

5
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,870
you so many things about me from when I

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,570
started developing and all the horrible

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,580
things that I've done on the internet to

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,300
people and that I've had done to me so

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,340
it should be fun and we're going to

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,320
start at the beginning and hopefully

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,849
some of you will recognize some of the

12
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,079
stuff that I'm talking about if not

13
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:39,059
sorry uh so yeah I've always been kind

14
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,800
of weird um I started getting into

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,010
computers and when I was like three or

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,410
four through video games um does anybody

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,760
know what this is oh yeah so this is a

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,770
video game system that got put out in

19
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,859
1988 by vtec it is an educational

20
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,930
learning system and it's called Socrates

21
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,589
and it would teach you how to do like

22
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,080
CAD like stuff so you could draw and you

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,119
could do interior design and you could

24
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,479
do like it was really cool especially

25
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,450
for like a four-year-old and yeah so

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,810
this was my first video game system /

27
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,659
computer and so it pretty much all went

28
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,030
downhill from this moment there's some

29
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:34,500
more weird stuff so AOL was pretty much

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,900
the start of when I made websites and

31
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,729
got involved in online communities I

32
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,729
used to take place in if you know what

33
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,600
muds are so like text based rpgs don't

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,610
clap yet they were for professional

35
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,040
wrestling

36
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:56,110
so I was on a hoe well I was really into

37
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,900
wrestling and I would like I was in like

38
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,760
email groups where we would have matches

39
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,460
and we would like right stuff and do

40
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,330
that and when i was on a while i got my

41
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,149
first taste of any kind of development

42
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:14,050
or i'll say development i'll say bad

43
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,850
things you'll know if you recognize the

44
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:20,320
next slide oh wait no that's me that's

45
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,300
me and my stepsister on the computer on

46
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,550
AOL which i would also like to mention

47
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,920
my parents put a password on so that

48
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,270
they wouldn't let me on the computer so

49
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,740
i put a keylogger on it to get the

50
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,360
password so i could go on when i went

51
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,090
there so this is familiar to you your

52
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,610
parents probably hate you and everybody

53
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,480
on a wall probably hates you so our AOL

54
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,660
account was controlled by my dad and so

55
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,240
he had the main like parental account if

56
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,790
you did anything to violate a ltos as

57
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,730
like a child account it would go to him

58
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:00,910
so these are all AOL where's or Prague's

59
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,800
whatever you want to call them and they

60
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,830
were the lamest hacking that you could

61
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,050
possibly do and it was just basically a

62
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,690
big annoyance to people my favorite one

63
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,970
was to spam chat rooms with like porn

64
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,470
links and then if people clicked on it

65
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,830
it would cut them off from AOL and like

66
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,120
mess with their dial-up and they would

67
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,489
have to get right back on um so I

68
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:24,730
recently I recently told my dad maybe a

69
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,920
couple months ago hey Dad remember how

70
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,390
you used to get all those emails and it

71
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,840
was like your Europe whatever my email

72
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,180
or whatever my AOL account was has been

73
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,830
posting spam links I was like we must

74
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,480
have gotten hacked I don't know how that

75
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,280
could possibly happen i'm a perfect

76
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,620
angel i would never do that and i told

77
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,670
him that it was me and he was like

78
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,480
Rachel that's not funny at all I still

79
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,920
think it's pretty hilarious and then I

80
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,500
found this great site uh this site's

81
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,690
been around for over 10 years maybe way

82
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,970
way more than 10 years uh it's where I

83
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,569
learned how to do HTML see

84
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:07,560
ss I say gifs and I will not apologize

85
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,659
right you can hate me and may just do

86
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:12,459
like fun stuff we had to get like stars

87
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:15,579
trailing behind your cursors and stuff

88
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:17,019
like that and this is pretty much what

89
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,870
got me into making fan sites I also made

90
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,180
fan sites for wrestlers but then I

91
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:29,139
started getting into pop punk and so I

92
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:30,580
found these girls that lived here in

93
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,120
California they had pressed contacts so

94
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,250
they have like PR people for bands and

95
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,320
they were like you know how to make

96
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,699
websites so let's make a website

97
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:42,820
together and I'm like 14-15 at this

98
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,220
point and so we made a fan site for

99
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,190
teens for people that like music and we

100
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,050
would contact the band's PR people and

101
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,690
be like we want to come interview you so

102
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,180
the first concert that I ever went to

103
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,280
was warped tour when I was like 14 years

104
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,789
old with a VIP press pass to interview

105
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:06,910
good charlotte and i was in Florida at

106
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,889
the time and I'm a very pale person and

107
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,440
I didn't think to put sunblock on so I

108
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,570
got like a third-degree sunburn and my

109
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,490
face was blistered and then I had to go

110
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,099
interview them looking like Freddy

111
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:23,320
Krueger pretty much mrs. uh one of the

112
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,690

113
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,300
that's New Found Glory um some other

114
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,780

115
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,030
injected sum 41 good charlotte bad

116
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,949
religion flickr stick who's that band

117
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:39,970
that one like the vh1 got tons of other

118
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,509
people um uh everybody that i was

119
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,860
friends with online thought i was like

120
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,720
the coolest person ever and everybody

121
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,380
high school really hated me um they they

122
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,759
thought I was a groupie apparently

123
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,139
because 14 year olds do that and this

124
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:58,360
was my own personal site so after those

125
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,800
girls tried to get a little bossy and

126
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,849
they wouldn't give me the good bands

127
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:02,680
they like wanted me to they wanted me to

128
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,719
interview really bad stuff so then I

129
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:06,729
made my own and this is from archive.org

130
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:08,919
which is why there's broken images it

131
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:11,949
wasn't cashed well enough but the whole

132
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:15,940
left side is little Elsa gifts gifts

133
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,740
that move a little bit and

134
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,449
started doing my own interviews and

135
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:22,150
getting sponsorships and I'm from Long

136
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,590
Island even though I grew up in Florida

137
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,180
so I interviewed like taking back sunday

138
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,680
and brand new when they were just

139
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,380
getting started so it's really weird to

140
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:35,130
me how big they are now so from here is

141
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,440
when I really started doing stuff on my

142
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,720
own I don't remember what order the

143
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,069
slicer and so we'll just see what

144
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:48,310
happens oh there's me and sum 41 so I

145
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,169
started meeting people online through

146
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:53,080
making the fan sites and the website for

147
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,970
bands and then I started moderating

148
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,610
message boards and the way that the

149
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,740
communities work then is sort of similar

150
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,389
to how they were now but they were much

151
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:03,430
smaller and you had to seek them out it

152
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,610
wasn't as easy to like find things and

153
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,520
so I ended up moderating message boards

154
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,400
for like the starting line and I was the

155
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,169
leader of the brand new street team for

156
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:16,000
all the street the state of Florida and

157
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,919
then I made friends with people that ran

158
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,699
street teams so I would enter contests

159
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:23,500
to win things which means they would

160
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,280
just give them to me for free um oh

161
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,039
that's me an else know if you like

162
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:33,969
wrestling you you get that oh so this is

163
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:37,960
one of the contests that i won this is a

thanking me for getting them on TRL I

168
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:57,900
didn't do steve-o from jackass oh

00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,130

this is oh this is the one this is a

178
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,090
livejournal community that I made that

179

has over 6,000 numbers we're not going

180
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,150
to talk about what it is because it's

181
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,710
embarrassing but there was a lot of

182
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,979
people in it and I was in charge of it

183
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,060
this is the

184
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,039
first big community that I was a part of

185
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,510
online where it was it was easy to find

186
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,270
it was called indie it was a place

187
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,469
where people could go online and like

188
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:44,020
fine indie music and talk about bands

189
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,120
and it was before pitchfork so we

190
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,500
weren't that douchey except to each

191
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,370
other and yeah actually there's a

192
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,140
there's a really big gossip community

193
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,089
website called oh no they did it and

194
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:58,420
that is run by members of indie folks

195
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,200
and yeah a lot of people did stuff from

196
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:09,210
there also IRC I used to go into

197
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,400
channels on ethnic for like punk and use

198
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,470
xdcc box because that was the best way

199
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,820
to get music if you don't know what it

200
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,550
is it would take a RAR file and split it

201
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,260
up into a ton bunch of tiny smaller

202
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,060
files you could get it really fast and

203
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,440
this was like the best way to get music

204
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,050
before like soulseek or any like

205
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,910
peer-to-peer type stuff was happening um

206
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,300
I also met a ton of people that I'm

207
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,370
still friends with today on IRC

208
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,290
including one of my friends who was like

209
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,760
now the head of some like team at

210
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,440
Salesforce but it's weird does anybody

211
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,390
know what this is yeah this is a blog

212
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,150
publishing software that was made in

213
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,850
November of 2000 by this guy named Noah

214
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,850
gray it's written in perl and there's no

215
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,130
database is all local storage every time

216
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,960
you write a post it would rewrite your

217
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,960
HTML files um and it was awesome this

218
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,850
was I started having my own domain names

219
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,530
I started designing stuff I started

220
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,270
writing my own blogs which i'm going to

221
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:11,270
show you what you're really embarrassing

222
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,360
so this is this is one of my vlogs um i

223
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,250
was really into julian casablancas i

224
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:23,020
guess it was on my own domain name and

225
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,820
if you can see like the names of people

226
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,680
here I'm still friends with all these

227
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,990
people today like this guy had a

228
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,520
Kickstarter for a watch that he made

229
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,160
that was then sold at moma and then this

230
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,200
girl lives in georgia and she came with

231
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,120
me to a comic-con and then this girl

232
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,680
ended up living in like the next town

233
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,209
over for me in high school we became

234
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:42,370
friends so the Internet's really weird

235
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,710
and here's another one of my

236
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,530
so I discovered grunge brushes and

237
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,070
really likes them grunge brushes and

238
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,460
like silk screen pixel fonts and it was

239
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,840
really cool Ellen this is a this is like

240
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,280
the last one that I had right before I

241
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,380
went to college as you can tell by the

242
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,720
hair and the pink and the daughters and

243
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,760
hardcore music and stuff that's an

244
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,200
iframe and yes so now I'm going to stop

245
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,200
because between then and now I've done a

246
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,510
lot of dumb stuff on the internet I like

247
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,330
to fight with people a lot

248
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:25,240
unapologetically only because it's fun I

249
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,730
guess so um everybody knows what

250
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,550
twitches right so before twitch was

251
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,000
twitch it was justin TV and justin TV

252
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,160
when it was in its beta i was one of the

253
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,410
first 20 people on it so i was like one

254
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,000
of the first life casters and I would

255
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,100
play wow and stream it so I guess I was

256
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,570
kind of one of the first people that did

257
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,720
twitch the problem was i Justine was

258
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,430
also on there and she's really cool and

259
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,590
really nice except were vastly different

260
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,300
people so everybody tried to get us to

261
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,360
fight I would have my email spoof to her

262
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,160
she would have her spoof to me people

263
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,530
like who is my domain names and called

264
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,540
me and like would fight and it was crazy

265
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,340
and so from that I now have this

266
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,560
wonderful encyclopedia dramatica article

267
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,410
about myself which is them calling me

268
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,140
mean names and the video which it's just

269
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,700
an image so I can't play it it's

270
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,230
basically me reading it and thinking

271
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,400
it's hilarious that somebody thought

272
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,840
this was important enough to write an

273
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:26,790
article about but um what oh god no

274
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,240
um yeah so I've always thought with

275
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,360
people that's me and Kevin Rose I was

276
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,820
really into diggnation and then since I

277
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,860
was really into diggnation after that

278
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,710
went away I got into Reddit and here's

279
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:45,060
another great story uh so I was banned

280
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:51,480
from reddit for daxing a guy uh I was

281
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,590
completely valid in doing it I'm I will

282
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,810
stand by that I like to post on a lot of

283
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,310
like makeup subreddits because makeup

284
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,080
and like nail polish is really fun and

285
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,330
this dude went out of his way to come

286
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,650
into the community isn't be like he

287
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,570
women are covering yourselves in slime

288
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,300
and he made like his own subreddit for

289
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,740
really young girls to post pictures

290
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,020
themselves without makeup on so this is

291
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,610
before violent acres in the whole child

292
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,890
porn thing if you know about that if not

293
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,480
google it and then feel disgusted and

294
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,750
take a shower so I noticed that he kept

295
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,280
on posting pictures from his own domain

296
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,230
name and I was like okay so I who was

297
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,970
his domain name and I found his name and

298
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,740
I google searched him and I thought he

299
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,730
was a 60 year old man which no 6 year

300
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,780
olds are cool but not when they're

301
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,330
harassing teenagers so i posted online

302
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,580
and then I got shadow bands and i was

303
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,930
living in st. Louis at the time which

304
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,140
has a really great hacker community in a

305
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,350
hacker space and so Alex Ohanian and the

306
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,430
other guy whose name I can't remember

307
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,220
but his moderator name is karma not came

308
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,950
to st. Louis to do a Q&A so I was like

309
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,160
I'll ask them why I'm banned for doing

310
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,310
something good so it was like me bunch

311
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,130
of guys couple women and during the Q&A

312
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,260
session I was like yeah hi um I was

313
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,840
being harassed and so I outed somebody

314
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,220
and now i'm banned why I don't think

315
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,660
that's I don't that's very you know

316
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,460
right and they were like okay okay we'll

317
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,540
unban you um they didn't and then the

318
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,330
violent a curse thing happens and one of

319
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,370
my good friends is a game journalist for

320
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,530
game ranks and he heard that the verge

321
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,480
was going to write a story about reddit

322
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,180
and about how like it's ridiculously

323
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,770
misogynistic and there's a bunch of

324
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,940
issues and they were like oh you should

325
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,710
talk to my friend Rachel because she is

326
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,750
this thing that happened and then I

327
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,920
heard that they were going to write the

328
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,060
story and then all of a sudden I was

329
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,850
miraculously unbanned because I guess

330
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,499
they didn't want it to get posted

331
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:42,389
see I don't post on Reddit anymore cuz

332
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:45,209
it's gross I would recommend that you

333
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:48,049
don't either but you can if you want uh

334
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:50,699

problem with buying domain names
