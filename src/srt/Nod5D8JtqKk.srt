00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610

hi everyone um just before I get started

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,350
um has anyone ever used processing

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,420
before like show of hands okay close

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,710
some people have that's awesome so I'm

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,730
not talking to people who are like

6
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,370
totally strangers to it so I'm so

7
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,280
excited to be here honestly like I have

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,650
literally been hearing about Cascadia

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,439
j/s for years so it's really cool to be

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,300
here and actually be presenting for you

11
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,029
guys on a topic but I really like uh and

12
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,619
I wanted to just take a moment to

13
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,420
acknowledge all of the organizers who've

14
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,429
put in so much work to organize this

15
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,800
like it's really not easy so if we could

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,239
just give a little round of applause for

17
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,430
them thank you so much so um my name is

18
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,230
elgu sky and apparently I have one

19
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,260
jacket and I included a photo of me so

20
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,789
that you would know that in fact I am

21
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:46,920
NOT an imposter how do I look relatively

22
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,600
similar I think I do

23
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,030
um and today I'm so excited to be

24
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,010
talking to you guys about creative code

25
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,320
in the browser but before I get started

26
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,670
I just want to give you a little bit of

27
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,039
a roadmap of what you can expect over

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,039
the next 20 or so minutes so first of

29
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,199
all hello I'm gonna tell you a little

30
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,090
bit more about me and some of the work

31
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,040
that I do and how I use creative coding

32
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,760
in my process next I'm going to try my

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,729
very best to explain creative coding to

34
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:17,070
you or define it rather and I'm gonna

35
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,530
try to get you guys excited about

36
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,450
potentially using creative coding in

37
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,869
your own projects in the future next I'm

38
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:27,060
gonna talk to you guys about p5.js which

39
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,040
is a JavaScript library that makes it

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,320
really easy to do creative coding in the

41
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,360
browser and I'm gonna tell you a little

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,150
bit more about why I like it and finally

43
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,250
I'm gonna try to do a live demo of some

44
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,689
coding to see like actually the

45
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,840
nitty-gritty of how you get started you

46
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,850
will be impressed by how easy it is to

47
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,299
make cool stuff so who remembers this

48
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,420
this little guy not the pineapple but

49
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,960
rather mspaint I'm not sure about you

50
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,899
guys but I spent a lot of time with this

51
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,549
program when I was a kid probably

52
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,280
because the internet wasn't like

53
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,030
actually available at my house so even

54
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,409
though I knew that wasn't gonna be the

55
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,259
world's first millionaire from selling

56
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,330
my bitmap images I think it was like BMP

57
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,290
it's

58
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,050
um I still spend a lot of time working

59
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,000
on it and as I was doing that I was

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,010
learning new skills so I was learning

61
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,380
how to do things because kids and adults

62
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,750
we learned through exploration and play

63
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,170
and so while I was making these creative

64
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,430
things I was also learning how to use a

65
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,810
mouse I was learning how to work with

66
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,780
color etc etc and I can't help but think

67
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,060
that maybe I'm here today in part at

68
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,160
least and maybe for you guys too because

69
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,950
I had access to creative tech tools when

70
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,920
I was a kid but let me just improve my

71
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,610
skills so um

72
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,400
flash board a couple years actually many

73
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,950
years I grew up and I started working in

74
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,980
the arts and I actually came to coding

75
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,720
because when I was working in the arts I

76
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,360
wanted to develop media arts projects so

77
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,800
I started doing a little bit of stuff

78
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,870
with like max/msp and I was hooked I

79
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,060
really liked it and so I decided to take

80
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,760
a web development bootcamp I worked in

81
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,350
industry for a little while and then

82
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,910
decided that I was not done with school

83
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,280
yet so when I got an opportunity to go

84
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,959
back to school to do my masters of

85
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,549
Science and interactive arts and

86
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:19,560
technology at Simon Fraser University I

87
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,810
jumped at the chance because it meant

88
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,860
that I was going to be able to bring

89
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,620
together sort of my to like main things

90
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,450
that get me excited in life art and

91
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,579
technology and sort of combine them into

92
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:33,209
one so my main research area is actually

93
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:34,920
on child computer interaction so that's

94
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,600
one of the reasons I mentioned mspaint

95
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,299
earlier but I also research tangible

96
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,430
computing and so what tangible computing

97
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,500
means is manipulating digital

98
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,070
information with physical objects but

99
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,660
one thing I'm really fortunate about are

100
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,340
really thankful is that I actually get a

101
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,380
lot of time to be doing creative

102
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,120
projects when I'm at school so in my off

103
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,570
time I do a lot of like sort of like

104
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,730
self-improvement projects by just like

105
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,549
building weird things and I also get an

106
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:03,959
opportunity to work with a lot of

107
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,609
undergraduates and graduate students

108
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:07,890
who've never ever coded before and I get

109
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,769
to introduce them to it so before I

110
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,660
tried to define creative coding for you

111
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,680
I want to show you some of these

112
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,590
projects that I've worked on recently

113
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,120
but I think I would define as being

114
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,180
creative code so this is plant agachi it

115
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,190
is a smart planter I guess is what you'd

116
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,510
call it and it's like a

117
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,550
between at a Medina planter and so

118
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,810
basically when you're about to kill your

119
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,160
plant because you haven't watered him in

120
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,880
a couple weeks

121
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,220
he preemptively turns his eyes to exes

122
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,800
and then you're like oh I should take

123
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,870
care of that this is a brain computer

124
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,390
interface series of lights because you

125
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,220
know everyone sort of always wanted to

126
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,170
power a computer like a light with their

127
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,270
brain so it uses EEG sensors on the

128
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,220
forehead and then it changes the the

129
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,930
color and the intensity of the lights

130
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,760
and the one that looks like a brain is

131
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,250
actually one that it's like a miniature

132
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,990
model of a large-scale project that

133
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,990
we're doing with some other students and

134
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,060
this final example that I'm going to

135
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,920
show you it was inspired by my work with

136
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,860
the Vancouver laptop ensemble and what

137
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,260
it is is it's a laser heart so basically

138
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,700
it's a series of lasers and if you put

139
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,200
your hand in between one of the lasers

140
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,720
they'd ideally be further away I don't

141
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,970
have a good photo of it but you put your

142
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,440
hand in there and then it triggers some

143
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,290
code that's gonna be making music or

144
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,990
maybe not music but noise so I'll get to

145
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,940
the honest truth is that I kind of hate

146
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,010
the term creative coding because all

147
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,530
coding is creative like even if you're

148
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,850
not working on these kind of weird

149
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,460
projects every time you're faced with a

150
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,350
coding challenge you have to maybe think

151
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,820
of some sort of creative way to solve it

152
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,940
so for the purposes of this presentation

153
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,040
however I'd like to sort of define it by

154
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,550
two specific things one is its art space

155
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,380
and don't let that scare you there's

156
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,420
like an academic where you could look at

157
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,650
it and say it's about making something

158
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,120
that's expressive rather than a

159
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,210
functional product not that my laser

160
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,690
harp was not functional it just it was a

161
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,840
bit more on the expressive side so it's

162
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,330
art based but I prefer to think of it

163
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,640
more as being tech that's fun something

164
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,410
that's exploring a new space

165
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,550
something's maybe a little bit

166
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,950
surprising or unexpected or something

167
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,410
that encourages exploration and the

168
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,120
other way I define creative coding is

169
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,100
it's inclusive it's community oriented

170
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,030
and frankly it's how would I put this I

171
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,260
I had a great way of putting it but

172
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,810
basically because it's so built around

173
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,520
being doing explorations and stuff

174
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,379
everyone is welcome to take part in it

175
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:40,000
whether you're a professional developer

176
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,319
like many of you or whether you're

177
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,490
someone who's just getting started in

178
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,889
code it's more about the process than

179
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:47,340
the final product and it's more about

180
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,720
just having fun doing it rather than

181
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,360
having like the perfect code and for

182
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,190
that reason it's a really great activity

183
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,840
for people who are either brand new to

184
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,030
coding coming to coding from a different

185
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,819
field or someone who just wants to have

186
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:04,479
some fun and I would like you guys in

187
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,710
your mind you don't have to do this out

188
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,610
loud because I don't want to embarrass

189
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,190
you but you do not need to be an artist

190
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,240
to be an artist

191
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,280
so repeat that in your brain after me

192
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,900
you don't need to be an artist to be an

193
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,409
artist when you're making art with code

194
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:19,240
what's really awesome is that

195
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,400
you actually just need to tinker and

196
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,870
that's all you need to do to be able to

197
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,340
create some really fun and surprising

198
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,620
things a for loop in your JavaScript

199
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,240
program doing something else might just

200
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,099
iterate through some numbers but in

201
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:31,659
creative coding it could actually make a

202
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:35,590
pretty picture know the examples that I

203
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,389
showed you earlier we're mostly hardware

204
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:39,460
based and I did that for a reason I

205
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,900
showed you hardware based things because

206
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,039
I thought it would be really easy to

207
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:44,080
comprehend how they were kind of weird

208
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,650
like kind of to be honest useless sort

209
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,940
of examples they're cool but like

210
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,440
they're not they're not saving anyone's

211
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,029
life but you can do it with anything you

212
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:58,539
don't need to have hardware you can you

213
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:00,669
are all already JavaScript developers so

214
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:02,680
you can make interactive art in the

215
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,469
browser yourself you don't need to use

216
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:11,289
mspaint you can make ms paint and the

217
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:15,060
other thing that I really wanted to I

218
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,620
had another point on this slide but

219
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,599
clearly it wasn't that important so I'm

220
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,229
just gonna skip over I was like don't

221
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:25,150
forget that one thing and now it's the

222
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,909
one thing that I forgotten no it really

223
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:32,380
it wasn't that important but before you

224
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,000
guys go bursting out the door and

225
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,459
starting to work with the SVG and the

226
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:38,289
canvas elements which are really core to

227
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:41,680
doing creative interactive art in the

228
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,200
browser I just like to point out that

229
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,180
they're not always the most intuitive to

230
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,910
use um so I think it was actually just

231
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,690
pointed out in the

232
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,610
presentation by Shannon that if you want

233
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,080
to do what's up with WebGL which is

234
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,380
based in the html5 canvas you know it's

235
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,780
a lot of kind of crazy code that you've

236
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,160
got to go through and it's not always

237
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,080
super easy particularly if you're

238
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,180
someone who's brand new to coding or if

239
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,410
you're someone who's just doing it for

240
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,000
fun like no one wants to spend their

241
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,410
weekend working on a project and like

242
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,500
having to figure out all this like kind

243
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,880
of code that's really convoluted

244
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,960
especially since other people have

245
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,720
already made libraries and api's and

246
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,460
extensions and such that it's gonna make

247
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,170
it a lot easier to do this sort of stuff

248
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,320
in the browser so some of the libraries

249
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,940
that you might be familiar with are

250
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,020
d3.js which is a really awesome package

251
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,480
for working to do data visualizations

252
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,480
using SVG s another one that got

253
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,040
mentioned in the last presentation is

254
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,350
3GS which is great for doing like 3d

255
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,750
rendering in the browser but for me

256
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,570
personally I really love p5.js

257
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:50,680
and so you might ask why I love p5.js

258
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,300
because it was specifically made to

259
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,510
create art in the browser and so the way

260
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,920
it works is it makes it easy to work

261
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,660
with the canvas element it provides

262
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,330
shortcuts etc that make it really fast

263
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,420
and quick to create interactive data

264
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,060
visualizations games etc so these are

265
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,700
some still some screenshots from a

266
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,340
project that I did over the summer

267
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,500
they're all animated and interactive but

268
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,730
I didn't have time to turn them all into

269
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,820
gifts for you so my apologies but you

270
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,050
can see kind of like some of the pretty

271
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,520
things that you can make in the browser

272
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,730
and so some of you have already like I

273
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,590
had you guys raise your hand and see who

274
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,920
had already who DS processing so p5 is

275
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,130
actually based on processing so

276
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,710
processing is an IDE it's based in Java

277
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,780
and it's been around for almost two

278
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,370
decades now so it's been around for a

279
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,770
while and it is sort of like the go-to

280
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,390
standard when it comes to creative

281
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,980
coding if you do a google search of

282
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,089
creative coding you'll come up with

283
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:48,010
processing and it was really designed

284
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:51,160
for artists and non coders to be able to

285
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,290
create visualizations super fast and

286
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,750
easy without having to learn a lot of

287
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,390
like code that wouldn't be helpful

288
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,580
within that project and the neat thing

289
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,570
about processing is that not

290
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,750
only is it easy for beginners to learn

291
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,390
it also it's robust enough for

292
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,280
professional media artists for

293
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,720
professional developers and for

294
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,960
professional inventors so I just grabbed

295
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,640
a few stills off of their website if

296
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,300
some of like Processing's like gallery

297
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,040
in terms of like what you can do with

298
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,740
that so this is a data visualization

299
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,020
this is some really cool generated

300
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,020
scenes that have been printed out using

301
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,850
ballpoint pens with CNC machines and p5

302
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,380
brings this technology and the core

303
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,500
ideas of processing to the web so a few

304
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,270
years ago Lauren McCarthy worked with

305
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,460
the processing foundation to not only

306
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,700
bring over the syntax of processing but

307
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,220
also to bring over sort of the ethos and

308
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:54,340
by that I mean the it's a very inclusive

309
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,280
organization and so p5 aims to replicate

310
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,490
that

311
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,040
so processing talks about how their game

312
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,780
aim is to promote software literacy

313
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,880
visual literacy and make these fields

314
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,970
accessible and they do a really great

315
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,010
job through excellent documentation and

316
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,130
a fabulous YouTube channel called the

317
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,050
coding train with Daniel Shipman which

318
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,360
has like the funniest videos I think on

319
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,100
how to do computer science contest

320
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,630
concepts from beginning to much more

321
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,790
advanced in a really fun and accessible

322
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,730
way but for me what's really meaningful

323
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,770
and one thing that I hope that you guys

324
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,990
will take away from this talk if nothing

325
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,960
else is that if you are involved with an

326
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,100
open-source organization p5 has a really

327
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,530
obvious welcome welcoming statement a

328
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,060
community statement on their main page

329
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,360
and in that it basically says everyone

330
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,090
is welcome here and this might seem like

331
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,070
just a little bit of text on a website

332
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,600
that no one's ever gonna pay attention

333
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,590
to you but it's something that you

334
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,790
actually see referred to in the

335
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,220
community quite often so for example

336
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,870
we've got some screenshots here of

337
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,970
people who are standing in front of

338
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,520
presentations that have it up and also

339
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,730
it's reflected in the discourse forums

340
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,270
as well as the github pages and for me

341
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,100
this is really personal because I saw

342
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,170
that statement like I'm not necessarily

343
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,250
I'm not from a computer science

344
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,710
background I saw

345
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,060
statement and two days later I made my

346
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,010
first open-source pull request never

347
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,990
done it never considered it but I saw

348
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,370
that and I was like oh this can be my

349
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,860
community as a result of that I actually

350
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,720
applied for and successfully got a

351
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,240
google Summer of Code position working

352
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,250
with the processing foundation so these

353
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,830
words have meaning anyways you're gonna

354
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,200
race ahead do some demos show you how it

355
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,290
works so the way that I'm gonna go

356
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,400
through this is first I'm going to show

357
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,190
you some just how to work with the raw

358
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,080
canvas element without having p5 just

359
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,390
for comparison's sake next I'm gonna

360
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,010
show you how to make a p5 sketch that's

361
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,220
a they're word for a p5 program I'm

362
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,390
gonna show you a little bit about

363
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,250
working with externals and interactivity

364
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,290
and then I'm gonna show you a little bit

365
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,450
about plugging in like extra JavaScript

366
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,750
libraries oh wow you don't need to know

367
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:07,120
that yet okay so just for the interest

368
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,830
of time I've already like I'm not gonna

369
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,010
code this part live for you but when you

370
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,660
work with the canvas element has have

371
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,280
people here worked with the canvas a lot

372
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,190
show of hands so a lot of you have but

373
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,630
for those of you who haven't the way

374
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,830
that it works is when you create a

375
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,170
canvas element on the page you've got

376
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,910
basically just this like blank space and

377
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,320
anything that goes inside of the canvas

378
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,180
is actually invisible to the Dom so you

379
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,790
can't style it with CSS or anything you

380
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,320
have to do all of the styling through

381
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,950
JavaScript so I've got sort of a very

382
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,370
simple example here so first of all I

383
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,890
have to find my canvas element using

384
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,080
javascript next I've got to tell it that

385
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,730
I'm gonna be working in two dimensions

386
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,900
I'm not gonna be trying to do any sort

387
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,890
of WebGL or 3d stuff and then if I want

388
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,780
to make it turn to a different

389
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,480
background color then I've got to

390
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,910
actually create a new rectangle that's

391
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,310
the same size and shape as the existing

392
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:03,330
canvas and before hand I've also got to

393
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:07,690
actually give it the RGB value so if I

394
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,450
hit save and refresh I've got a nice

395
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:14,370
pink block and that's not too hard to do

396
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,270
actually that's not hard to do at all

397
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,560
but it starts to get a little bit

398
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,150
convoluted the more complex the sketch

399
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,820
gets so I've got an example here of how

400
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,160
to draw just a straight line so this is

401
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,340
gonna go from 50 across and 50 down to

402
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,089
100

403
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:30,459
and a hundred down and it requires four

404
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:32,199
lines of code I've got to begin the path

405
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:34,899
I've got to declare the first set of

406
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:37,480
coordinates I have to declare the second

407
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,490
set of coordinates and then I have to

408
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,249
tell it to actually draw that so when I

409
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:53,920
hit refresh here if I saved so look that

410
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,569
wasn't hard you could all do that you

411
00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:57,189
could all follow along you you've got it

412
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,470
but as your sketch is more complicated

413
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,089
that's gonna become a bit of a nightmare

414
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:02,949
and if you are someone who's just

415
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:04,329
learning code or just wants to make

416
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:06,249
something in the end like that's gonna

417
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:08,740
be really frustrating to work with so

418
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,589
that's where p5 comes in on p5 makes

419
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:13,329
this a lot this process a lot easier and

420
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:20,259
a lot more intuitive so p5 so the first

421
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:21,699
thing you've got to do is download the

422
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:23,499
p5 libraries to your computer or you can

423
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:24,790
get them via NPM

424
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,920
you could also use their p5 web editor

425
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,120
if you don't want to download anything

426
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,269
and then what you have to do is there's

427
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:36,100
two main functions in in processing

428
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,769
there is the setup function and there is

429
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:42,279
the draw function we don't have to

430
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,040
declare the canvas inside of the body of

431
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,959
the HTML because that's something that

432
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,079
p5 is gonna take care of us for us so

433
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,319
I'm gonna create a canvas I'm gonna make

434
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:55,029
it the same size as the other one 500 by

435
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:57,670
500 and when I want to change the

436
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,589
background all I have to do is use the

437
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:02,860
syntax called background and fill in the

438
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,970
color that I want so that's already like

439
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,890
one line instead of two and it's a bit

440
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,179
more intuitive because you don't have to

441
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:14,490
build a whole new a whole new rectangle

442
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,649
so if I save that saving the wrong thing

443
00:17:17,649 --> 00:17:21,039
refresh now I've got that pink square if

444
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,020
I want to draw the line I just have to

445
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,110
use the syntax of line again more

446
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,809
intuitive and I need to put the first

447
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:31,059
coordinate so 50/50 followed by the

448
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:34,929
second coordinates so 100 hundred and if

449
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,760
i refresh there we go I've got the same

450
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,710
line again identical but it's a

451
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,400
significantly less code

452
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,120
and because it's got the two chunks so

453
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,830
the setup function happens one time and

454
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,110
one time only the draw function happens

455
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,430
again and again and again and it

456
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,320
continuously rewrites over the canvas

457
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,150
it's actually going to be super easy to

458
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,860
start doing animations and more complex

459
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,140
interactivity so what's actually

460
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,540
happening here is if we were to look at

461
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,660
the p5 like core files that you're

462
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,660
downloading there's this for the line

463
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,300
specifically we have a function that's

464
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,120
already pre-made that basically runs

465
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,740
through that same code that we were

466
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,600
talking about earlier so begin path move

467
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,910
to line two and stroke so they've just

468
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,559
taken care of that they've abstracted it

469
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,790
out to make it a little bit easier for

470
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:23,510
you now if you wanted to start doing

471
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,650
things that were a little bit more

472
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,120
interactive you could add variables and

473
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,429
stuff you could add for loops and that

474
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:30,500
would allow you to do animations so for

475
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,090
example if I do let X equal zero and

476
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,300
then let's make this I want to have it

477
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,670
move by a factor of X every time the

478
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:45,370
canvas is refreshed X plus equals 30

479
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,809
save and refresh and we should have a

480
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:51,200
pretty cool animation going on okay it's

481
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,090
still pretty simple but we can also do

482
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:59,540
different shapes so if I wanted to do an

483
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,050
ellipse and I can also use my mouse

484
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,780
event so do stuff with externals really

485
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,020
easily I could get rid of the outline

486
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,330
that normally goes around an ellipse and

487
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,400
I could give it a some sort of fun color

488
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:20,240
so fill blue that sounds pretty fun and

489
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,590
if I save that now and refresh tada

490
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,720
I have in three lines of code basically

491
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,330
created my own mspaint like right here

492
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,000
right now

493
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:36,450
thank you so yeah that was just like a

494
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,550
two minute exercise I made I made a

495
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,440
mistake but what if we wanted to make it

496
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,660
a little bit more cool than that if we

497
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,570
doubled up on this ellipse for example

498
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,890
the fun thing about code as I mentioned

499
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,630
is that you can just sort of throw in

500
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,120
extra things and see what's cool so if I

501
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,360
try to add another fill ternt none other

502
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,470
ellipse to the page and then maybe I

503
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,670
made the color random so this is gonna

504
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,250
instead of giving me one value for red

505
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,630
it's gonna give me a different one every

506
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,000
single time that the frame refreshes

507
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,130
like all of a sudden I have this like

508
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,020
really satisfying and kind of beautiful

509
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,830
like drawing tool and again this is just

510
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,230
a really simple like sort of example you

511
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,670
could extend on this like really easily

512
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,260
and make some really cool interactive

513
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,520
art pieces four minutes left okay so I'm

514
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,360
gonna just jump right into another

515
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:34,320
example okay so this one I'm not gonna

516
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,240
have a time to walk you through the code

517
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,710
but basically it's using that same

518
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,540
ellipse but instead of using the mouse

519
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,100
coordinates what if I were to use my

520
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,740
face so that's gonna create a new more

521
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,570
interesting sort of interaction with the

522
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:51,930
computer so if I go p5 pose net so this

523
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,670
uses machine learning the machine

524
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:59,560
learning tensorflow das library Posen it

525
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,210
just cuts the load so right now instead

526
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,580
of drawing the ellipse on my mouse I've

527
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,780
actually got it drawing on my nose just

528
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,520
really satisfying and that didn't take a

529
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,030
ton of code I just had to use there's a

530
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,150
really great website called friendly

531
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,010
machine learning for the web it was I

532
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,500
think actually part of ITP which is

533
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,090
related to processing like it's the

534
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,280
school in New York but Daniel Shipman

535
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,990
the person I did that I showed you the

536
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,160
YouTube pages for it I think he's

537
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,560
involved with this project and so all I

538
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,980
had to do was add this plug-in and this

539
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,100
little this little thing that's gonna

540
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,230
loop through anybody's that are on

541
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,610
screen it's gonna be like oh is there a

542
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,050
person there if so give me the

543
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,460
coordinates of their nose

544
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,899
now okay this is still like not the

545
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:50,340
coolest thing but I actually want to use

546
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,919
this like pose net in a real project of

547
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:55,200
mine and so I decided to do some like

548
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,289
messing around with it the other day so

549
00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:01,799
I want to unveil to you my 80s music

550
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:05,549
video generator which I hope it's gonna

551
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:08,580
come up yes it works okay so for the

552
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,519
very first time live in person is my

553
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:13,300
coded music video

554
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,950
[Music]

555
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:29,410
[Applause]

556
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,820
I walk away it gets bored and it turns

557
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:37,040
off and I don't even want to admit to

558
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,710
you how many times I practice that this

559
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:48,800
part of the presentation at home this is

560
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,800
thank you this is just using that pote

561
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,600
that same pose net basically the same

562
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,370
code I just showed you where instead of

563
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,800
doing a circle at the mouse I'm doing it

564
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,510
at my face but I'm also doing it on

565
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,190
other points on my body and I'm

566
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,080
jittering the circle that's around my

567
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,880
head and all my shoulders to make it

568
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,380
look kind of cool the reason there's

569
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,790
sort of ghost artifacts in the

570
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,380
background is because I set the

571
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,240
confidence level of the machine learning

572
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,160
tool to be really low so like it's

573
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,260
basically like could that is there any

574
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,930
possibility like out of like like is

575
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,940
there is like one percent possibility

576
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,440
that's a human so when it sees my wrist

577
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,990
it's like oh that's a person let me draw

578
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,850
a person for you you could set that

579
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,440
higher so you wouldn't have it but I

580
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,630
kind of liked that it gave that sort of

581
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,480
weird psychedelic look so I'm running

582
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,360
out of time here so I just wanted to

583
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,950
reiterate what I've what have we learned

584
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,540
today what have we covered so we talked

585
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,460
about creative coding and how it's art

586
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,020
based and inclusive at least if you ask

587
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,780
me you don't need to be an artist to do

588
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,460
it

589
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,840
p5 lets you bring processing

590
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,150
technologies to the web community

591
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,830
statements are awesome if you want to

592
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,910
get new people involved in your

593
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,580
community and it's super easy to get set

594
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,410
up and running as I demonstrated right

595
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:01,670
here I hope that you guys maybe feel

596
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,290
inspired to try it yourself I remember

597
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,970
what I forgot to tell you earlier is

598
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,190
that you might learn something while

599
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:11,060
you're doing it see though that was

600
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,830
important though is like pivotal because

601
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,390
you're not just sort of like missing

602
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,650
your own I mean you are you're messing

603
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,750
around you're just like playing but at

604
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,520
the same time you might learn how to do

605
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,020
a new leg use something new in

606
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,490
JavaScript you might learn how to use

607
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,080
something like pose knit learn a bit

608
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,710
more about machine learning or you might

609
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:29,240
become more involved with the community

610
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,440
and be able to learn more about

611
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,060
mentorship through helping out other

612
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,830
people through that community oriented

613
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,020
sort of discussion forums and such as

614
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,880
they have so if you do want to try it

615
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,380
you don't have to download anything you

616
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,250
can go to their web
