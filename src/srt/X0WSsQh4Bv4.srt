1
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,730

so the boys start off can I just like

2
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,739
get a like a show of hands who started

3
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,180
programming when they were young or had

4
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,559
wanted to learn how to program when they

5
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:44,680
were young I guess that's cool and hands

6
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,079
up who had the experience of like

7
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:49,210
learning how to program by themselves

8
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,860
and like would break down in tears in

9
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,860
front of a compiler yeah that's it's a

10
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,780
good thing and hands up who can remember

11
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,309
like the most awesome moment of your

12
00:00:57,309 --> 00:00:59,850
life when you're first hello world Ron

13
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,299
yeah so my name is James Walton I'm

14
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:06,159
Irish and the real Irish not the fake

15
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,200
irish like paul irish tries to pass

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,240
office okay i co-founded coderdojo by

17
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,399
trade I'm a web and iOS developer I

18
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:17,170
enjoy commitment and long walks on the

19
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,640
beach and I also won an award for

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,909
appearing in Twilight well one of those

21
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:29,050
was a lie so um coderdojo is this irish

22
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,060
lad global movement of coding clubs for

23
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,250
young people and it's such a unique and

24
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,080
wonderful thing it's very difficult to

25
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,080
encapsulate in words so starting off i'm

26
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,000
going to show you what coderdojo is this

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,800
is coderdojo this is coderdojo this is

28
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,080
coderdojo and finally this is coderdojo

29
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,000
young people come on a regular basis to

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,739
the coder dojos that i don't know how to

31
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,800
code hack create apps games or more it's

32
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,780
all free it's all volunteer based and

33
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,220
think of it like the Boy Scouts of

34
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,399
coding what kids who go to coderdojo

35
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:05,580
have done they've done HTML CSS

36
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,649
JavaScript see some node game

37
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:11,110
development um computer hardware someone

38
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,940
brought along a whole bunch of boxes and

39
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,890
kids have kids had time trials to see

40
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,300
who could d assemble and reassemble

41
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,610
computers the fastest they do blogging

42
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,140
getting guest speakers from various

43
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,670
companies to talk about the technologies

44
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,680
they use their careers and so on and

45
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,510
they also look at you know arduino who

46
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,250
some guy brought in a 3d printer they

47
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,080
did the entire process of modeling to

48
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,629
actually printing it out and a few other

49
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:34,930
languages as well so in this environment

50
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,489
in addition to learning about these

51
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,900
things are being introduced and exposed

52
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,879
they make friends they learn problem

53
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,830
solving skills it's an environment where

54
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,750
they feel that they can ask questions we

55
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,700
get advice and direction show off what

56
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,420
they've done gesh and bounce around

57
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,530
collaborate there is talent is exposed

58
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,610
and nurtured it's kind of like a

59
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,099
co-working space to hack around it so

60
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:56,300
it's completely different to a classroom

61
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,480
and there's an emphasis on open source

62
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,790
free software Good Conduct but most

63
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,400
importantly helping others in the dojo

64
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,450
so at the moment there's a conservative

65
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,130
guess there's about 60 coder dojos in

66
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,530
the space of nine months but this dojo

67
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,120
is constantly opening everything is open

68
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,010
source is a big mentality on it our

69
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,260
framework and so on is up there started

70
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,940
in Ireland in my hometown of cork it's

71
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,220
now spread to the USA to Russia to Asia

72
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,130
and mainland Europe it's 110 percent

73
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,900
free we encourage dojos to have some

74
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,489
spare laptops in the hands to give to

75
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:30,080
the kids that don't have them it's

76
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,910
probably about two and a half thousand

77
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,920
kids now between the ages of seven and

78
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,830
19 who do this on a weekly basis there's

79
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,450
about 200 volunteers who are really

80
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,920
awesome and they do you know they

81
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,090
volunteer and they mentor in the help

82
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,580
out there's major demand in Dublin alone

83
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,410
there's a waiting list of over 200 and

84
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,269
that's what that dojo taking in 90 a

85
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,390
week the wii user event bite for booking

86
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,120
system and we open up the tickets for

87
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,060
like spaces to be reserved on monday

88
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,790
think about half five and when they open

89
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,260
our record for being booked out is under

90
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,480
one minute so thankfully i can say that

91
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,430
we're more popular than Irish Ireland's

92
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,359
favorite boy band Westlife so all of

93
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:09,829
this builds up together to be one

94
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:19,340
kick-ass movement and to aid

95
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,150
so when you have such a movement you

96
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,889
know we try and build tools to you know

97
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,090
make it better and you know bring

98
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,639
everything together so I've built tools

99
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,500
like zen which is an online network of

100
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,570
dojos and people in coderdojo which is

101
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,009
going to build into the online backbone

102
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:35,500
infrastructure of coderdojo and it's all

103
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,850
open source as well it's up and get up

104
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,910
go for cash and there's also kata which

105
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,580
is the first bit of our kind of

106
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,990
repository of information where people

107
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,930
it's a wiki people submit back resources

108
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,389
session plans and more seeing dojos the

109
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,610
two new topics continually going back

110
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,800
and adding to it so new dojo starting up

111
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,419
can learn and it's a great you know

112
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:56,680
community process we're consciously

113
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,500
trying to work and prove these tools I

114
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,960
myself I'm the only person full-time

115
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,139
everybody else's is volunteer on it so

116
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,520
we also have some cool stuff we're

117
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,080
introducing like merit badges who

118
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,690
doesn't love hair patches so real merit

119
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,759
badge is to be to be given out I've got

120
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,380
a test shipment of about 500 of them

121
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,810
coming in next week they're also to be

122
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,479
available in Oakland badge format if any

123
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:21,340
of you are familiar with open Mozilla's

124
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,070
nua initiative for this they're earned

125
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,440
by completing tasks and meeting criteria

126
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,530
and you can get badges in coding in you

127
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,510
know open-source social good building an

128
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,280
app for charity or teaching other kids

129
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,520
how to code and from this spawns belt

130
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,710
rankings so the more badges you

131
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,970
accumulate the higher you go you are

132
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,470
from a white belt to black belt encoding

133
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,389
which means that you can get like a blue

134
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:44,889
belt teaching a yellow belt how to code

135
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:47,169
and so on so altogether there's only two

136
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:50,320
things to say for Jeff there's probably

137
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,550
there's probably gonna be kids watching

138
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,750
this so I can't you just like you know

139
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,229
foul language so what's the whole

140
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:58,030
premise for coderdojo what's the what's

141
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,690
the story behind it well this is me age

142
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,250
12 this is what I refer to as the

143
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,240
Ladykiller years

144
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,870
um I like to think I've changed since

145
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,750
then physically but back then you know I

146
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,430
was an introvert I was very shy in

147
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,340
myself and growing up you know I sucked

148
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,750
in school academically I wasn't good at

149
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,099
sports and it's a bit bullied like a lot

150
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:21,080
of kids I was always interested in how

151
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,430
things work though and I started

152
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,740
learning HTML was nine now my parents

153
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,389
were dentist so that they had no idea

154
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:27,949
what the hell was going on and they were

155
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:29,330
almost at the point of throwing water at

156
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,770
holy water at me like good old school

157
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,330
irish catholics because i was like

158
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,460
taking apart tvs wiring toasters to

159
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,520
motherboards and so on so one of the

160
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,900
things that really frustrated me as a

161
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,099
kid though was that there was no

162
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,690
introduction to computer science up

163
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,639
until you went to university and even at

164
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,840
that there was a seventy percent drop

165
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,409
out / failure age and you know the

166
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,150
maximum exposure you got was maybe Word

167
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,159
Excel but it wasn't it wasn't good

168
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,800
enough so I wanted somewhere to learn

169
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,180
when did some were to you know make

170
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,860
friends and who were interested in

171
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,840
computers to get direction and advice

172
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,300
you know I had no idea if I wanted to go

173
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,190
into like desktop development or if I

174
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,990
wanted to go into web dev whatever I

175
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,520
wanted you know to get help with

176
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,139
problems i was stuck on a lot of

177
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:10,909
childhood trauma was caused by c

178
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:13,250
programming for me I still have

179
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,729
nightmares and and I think most

180
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:18,020
importantly above all these things I

181
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,820
just wanted to find my thing and fit in

182
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,180
so out of frustration for this education

183
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,130
system in my final year of high school

184
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,199
which was I finished high school in in

185
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,979
June i won an award for web dev and the

186
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:32,479
school like all proud schools called it

187
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,789
out of the intercom and afterwards I had

188
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:36,199
a few people from my ear come up and say

189
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,370
oh that's kind of cool well how is

190
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,710
Facebook mater how r iphone apps mate so

191
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,219
um that monday i decided to arrange a

192
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:45,830
small technology meet up for people

193
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,240
interested in this stuff for my school

194
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,069
on the thursday so it's kind of like

195
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:55,840
fight club but with keyboards so

196
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,469
essentially what i thought would be

197
00:07:57,469 --> 00:07:59,300
maybe like four or five people from my

198
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,639
year turning up to this turned out to be

199
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,120
you know 40 so you know for the rest of

200
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,440
the year twice a week i taught these

201
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,419
guys my school javascript and CSS and

202
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:10,729
HTML but i got to the point where people

203
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:11,719
from all the schools we're hearing about

204
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:13,520
this i got requests from you know other

205
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,589
schools in the inner city area from

206
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:17,389
pupils wanting to know could they come

207
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:18,260
to

208
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,410
our coding club after school so then it

209
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,000
got to you know the final few months

210
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,350
before the summer holidays and a lot of

211
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,610
like the younger members in our club

212
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,780
were worried you know what would they do

213
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,130
the during the summer was it going to be

214
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,870
continued then I met this guy called

215
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,880
bill and there's me on the right there's

216
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,440
spill on the left and then there's a guy

217
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,880
who looks like gosh might sound from the

218
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,900
Looney Tunes so I'll just do that and I

219
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,640
met bill and Bill had been an

220
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,340
experienced and experienced entrepreneur

221
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,170
and he'd you know knew the world knew

222
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,720
had a hustle and so on and we spoke

223
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,400
about a lot about this and the knock-on

224
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,470
effects that it might have our end for

225
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,670
example as a lot of problems at the

226
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,320
moment we've got a fourteen percent

227
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,660
unemployment rate yet we have thousands

228
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,860
of vacancies in the technology industry

229
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,660
and it's crazy you know we've got some

230
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,560
of the world's biggest technology

231
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,410
companies Google Facebook no Twitter and

232
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,540
we you know we're very very attractive

233
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,680
place for technology companies to set up

234
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,270
we we spoke a lot about this and spoke

235
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,680
about like a lot of knock-on effects

236
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,720
honest and Bill figured out you know he

237
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,280
knew someone who could give us a space I

238
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,750
knew a lot of kids who wanted to do it

239
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,940
so we set up what we called coderdojo

240
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,770
and the reason we called it coderdojo

241
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,280
was dojo is a japanese term for place of

242
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,420
learning they've been around for a

243
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,220
thousand plus years you've probably seen

244
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,310
them in karate and there's you know it's

245
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,270
a it's a place where it's very

246
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,130
community-oriented where people in this

247
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,860
dojo help out at each other's plus the

248
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,950
domain name was free which always helps

249
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,280
but we you know so we set up this

250
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,740
coderdojo on what started with like 20

251
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,350
and 30 kids coming on a weekly basis in

252
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,940
the space of about three weeks we had

253
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,590
kids traveling three or four hours to

254
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,690
come to now because of the size of

255
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,400
Ireland that's basically the other side

256
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,550
of the country so we eventually you know

257
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,140
with the pleas of parents we decided to

258
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,060
open up this second coderdojo with the

259
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,100
same brand and the same framework in

260
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,780
dublin and we had our first space was

261
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,170
actually in google in dublin and they're

262
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,240
kind of brood of thumb is that for every

263
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,390
five guests you need one Google employee

264
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:20,960
so we had a registered list of 25 but we

265
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,460
didn't actively encourage on the site

266
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,380
for people to sign up prior so we had

267
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,390
about 70 turn up to that first session

268
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,420
really freaked out google security so

269
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,860
and this was that what you know this was

270
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,120
purely through word of mouth some

271
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,910
like small treats between people so then

272
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,680
we just you know we saw a major demand

273
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,330
we got more requests from around Ireland

274
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,020
and we continued to set them up and then

275
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,120
you know knock on a few months as Chris

276
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,770
said I met some wonderful people at her

277
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,770
in a castle called funk off and yeah

278
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,930
who's sitting over there and vited me

279
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,200
too j/s con for you to Berlin after my

280
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,850
talk in the castle he said uh what'd he

281
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,110
do next week and I said oh my go to the

282
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,520
cinema with my friends it was like Jonah

283
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,720
come to Germany it's like I can't get

284
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,870
that far in a raft so they they brought

285
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,940
me over and it opened my eyes to see

286
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,560
that there was more people outside you

287
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,690
know our small island of ireland that

288
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:09,950
were interested in this that there was

289
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,960
more good that we could do outside of

290
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,330
that country and then Cameron mcafee

291
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,760
from github brought coderdojo to America

292
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,310
couple months back now so you can see

293
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,900
here this like a few tweets that you

294
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,520
know we've got dojos now in Ireland who

295
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,080
helped at each other a team traveled

296
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,490
from limerick travels for about an hour

297
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,490
to help another dojo set up we've got a

298
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,100
guy Peter Neubauer who have never met

299
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,560
before just solid sweet there about

300
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,420
coderdojo mom oh and Sweden opening up

301
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,470
next week coderdojo aaron that's a phone

302
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,360
on so i earn more is this Coast off the

303
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,370
is this irish-speaking island off the

304
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,110
coast of Donegal with a population of

305
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,930
400 people we got a request to set up a

306
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,820
coder dojo there now I didn't know this

307
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,890
this island had like running water let

308
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,320
alone electricity and now that they're

309
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,060
asking for mentors with experience with

310
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,910
the corona sdk to help out and then

311
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,070
finally right coderdojo Tokyo is opening

312
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,260
in about four weeks so there's a random

313
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,730
Japanese tweet there about coderdojo

314
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,770
which I've got no idea what that means

315
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,420
I've probably sparked an international

316
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,779
conflict between Ireland and Japan so

317
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:14,540
it's been just really one awesome

318
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,680
explosion of awesomeness so with this

319
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,150
you know what I mean what have been the

320
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,700
results of coderdojo well there's being

321
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,950
kind of like three main things we've got

322
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,140
this social result where you've got kids

323
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,839
who are in my shoes where they found

324
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,180
their thing they're making friends you

325
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,529
know kids who come in with you know a

326
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:34,940
little confidence you know they get

327
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,230
respected for what they do they get

328
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,570
praised for hacking things together yeah

329
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,370
I think but two months ago we had our

330
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,320
first coderdojo relationship where a boy

331
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,240
in a 15 or boy and a 15 year old girl

332
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,560
met each other coderdojo

333
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,270
are now going out so it's kind of cool

334
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,620
and then there's you know this economic

335
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,270
side were you know those kids coming

336
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,190
from social welfare backgrounds you're

337
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,290
coming they're learning you know with

338
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,060
the country with 14 on percent

339
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,200
unemployment rate and if you're not

340
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,520
coming from a background that you know

341
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,440
might not necessarily give you an

342
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,700
opportunity to particularly good

343
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,890
education you could open up a lot of

344
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,510
doors and really change not their life

345
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,330
but their family is life and then

346
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,740
there's also the education science

347
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,839
you're filling this massive void in

348
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:17,240
education and you're helping out a lot

349
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,250
of kids and I mean someone mentioned

350
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,440
earlier on about girls in coding and how

351
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,290
can we encourage this I mean I just saw

352
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,339
this tweet a couple minutes ago an i

353
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:26,960
threw it in but there's like two 14 or

354
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,960
girls there I one's pretty disappointed

355
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,000
that she's missing missing coderdojo on

356
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,950
the sunday and the other one is

357
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,140
consoling her i don't know i never got

358
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:40,130
girls so with this you know this being

359
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,750
coding clubs I've tried to open it past

360
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,640
you know one thing or another has kind

361
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,650
of gone downhill or you know what's what

362
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,210
have we done differently that's made of

363
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,550
work out so well well we kind of had

364
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,560
this thing that you know when we decided

365
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,760
that it should be free and it should be

366
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,160
open there should be like no entry

367
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,440
barrier this thing we came up against

368
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,120
was what if parents users baby singing

369
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,070
servers so we made up this rule that if

370
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,930
you're 12 are under you have to bring

371
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,760
your parent with you so this did a

372
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,020
couple of things this meant that only

373
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,580
the really interested kids who drag

374
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,930
their parents out of bed in a Saturday

375
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,630
morning would come but how to knock on

376
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,839
effect that we didn't anticipate when a

377
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,339
parent brings their kid not only do they

378
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:17,780
like spend time with them they pawned

379
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:22,040
over code but if a kid is doesn't get

380
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,780
something if they don't understanding

381
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,190
understand something that's done on for

382
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,810
the projector they can be often quite

383
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,080
shy and like not ask questions or not

384
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,730
get it and fall behind most certainly in

385
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,070
my case and matts is very it was a lot

386
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,020
easier for me to say that I didn't do my

387
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,430
homework rather then I couldn't do my

388
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,470
homework however for parents is sitting

389
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,700
with them and they see that their kid

390
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,020
doesn't get something they'll have no

391
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,610
problem asking a question to a volunteer

392
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,410
and then this kind of creates this

393
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,910
environment where a lot of questions are

394
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,350
being asked kids then get more

395
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,790
comfortable asking questions because

396
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,740
their parents are doing it so that's

397
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,440
something cool that we found out loose

398
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,200
session a very non intense very easy

399
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,850
kind of self fled learning

400
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,329
it's not we're not kind of we're not

401
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:05,300
scheduled Nazis we kind of look at

402
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,190
different elements of HTML look at

403
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,540
different tags and JavaScript look at

404
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,220
different functions and kids will

405
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,319
naturally asked questions and we'll kind

406
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:13,759
of lead the session themselves when we

407
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,610
started off with you know CSS kids work

408
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,050
and asking well you know actually how

409
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,300
can we like make our background colors

410
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,009
how can we you know set an images or

411
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:23,449
background how can we know like put this

412
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:25,430
here so the session kind of leads itself

413
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,560
now and even you know you find new

414
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,959
topics far out of it some dojos have

415
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:31,250
done like minecraft development

416
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,290
minecraft modding as a result of a

417
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:41,420
requests obligatory water break so with

418
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,920
this relaxed atmosphere you know we have

419
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,940
one rule and it's be cool and you know

420
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,230
we've done some other stuff like keep

421
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,880
money out of it get kids spring their

422
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,079
own laptop so that they have this

423
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:52,370
environment that they can hack way when

424
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,579
they go home you know if because of such

425
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,519
like demand in some places dublin for a

426
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,319
fact they like gave homework this week

427
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:02,269
that any kid who wanted a guaranteed

428
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:04,220
spot for next weekend had to do what

429
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,660
they learned in that python class and

430
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,880
write a program that would draw the

431
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,160
coder dojo logo and like randomly change

432
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,370
the like black bit some color and then

433
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,439
you know at the very end we we don't

434
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:17,209
believe that coding should be you know

435
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,620
the learning experience to be just in

436
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,360
coderdojo show resources like mozilla

437
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,430
stocks or site point at very end so that

438
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,930
they can learn when they go home and if

439
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,459
they encounter an issue that they can

440
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:27,800
ask the next Saturday and get kids

441
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,480
teaching other kids i mean we're all old

442
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,240
i'm 19 now and i'm all time expired it's

443
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,230
um so but what it is is like you know

444
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,350
kids now who are 13 14 16 you know the

445
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,490
context that they're learning and the

446
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,569
environment that they're growing up is

447
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:46,819
different to us and sometimes maybe we

448
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:48,380
find that kids you know if a kid gets

449
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,259
something they might be able to you know

450
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,970
converse and you know illustrate it to

451
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,490
another kid rather than we could I mean

452
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,680
we had like a 12 year old show a 14 year

453
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,029
old how to do a wordpress install last

454
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:03,380
week so it's pretty cool and so what

455
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,030
does it take to start a dojo well it's

456
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,799
pretty easy it's a pretty bootstrap lean

457
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,900
method you just need a space you know

458
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,480
chairs and tables Wi-Fi projector and

459
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,770
some volunteers and mint

460
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,380
and we've got a lot of documents and

461
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,360
resources online to help get you set up

462
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,700
and we've had a lot of advice and a lot

463
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,900
of people in the community who are

464
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,370
willing to help you like hold your hand

465
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,010
through the process so you know who are

466
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:25,850
some of the kids that have come through

467
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,640
it well this is hiring more on on the

468
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,130
left Harry moved from like rural mayo

469
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,110
and ireland's to my hometown of cork

470
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,110
back in back in September he'd always

471
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,700
wanted to learn how to make games but

472
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,010
you never had an opportunity so when he

473
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,410
came to cut her dojo you know we kind of

474
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,560
showed him how to make games and he you

475
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,030
know worked in a game for a solid month

476
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,340
called pizza boss and I got number one

477
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,050
paid game in the Irish App Store eating

478
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,660
angry birds so not sure what a 12 year

479
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,830
old deals with all that money I think

480
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,880
you bought all like the cute girls in

481
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,300
his class chocolate bars or something um

482
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,070
and then there's this kid Allen who's 9

483
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,540
years old and he's he's got a special

484
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,010
place in my heart because his family

485
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,110
moved from Lithuania to Ireland's 12

486
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,610
years ago and his dad died when he was a

487
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,710
toddler now his mom who had two other

488
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,740
kids had to go on social welfare and she

489
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,330
used to just put out on the computer to

490
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,290
keep him quiet and keep him entertained

491
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,000
but unfortunately a couple of months

492
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,580
back you know his computer broke so she

493
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,900
heard about coderdojo and she brought

494
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,580
him along and hay was free you know

495
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,230
there's no risk keeping entertained for

496
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,730
a few hours and there was free coffee

497
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,310
there for parents so a bunch of all the

498
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,140
kids help fix his computer and now you

499
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,550
know that he got started in JavaScript

500
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,660
and for a nine-year-old he's an awesome

501
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,370
JavaScript developer it helps tutor

502
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,800
other kids so you know there's a whole

503
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,910
bunch of things that all the kids have

504
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,020
done and they're happening on a regular

505
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,670
basis I can't keep track of everything

506
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,830
but you know we've had like a 15 year

507
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,600
old who made a physics engine with

508
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,300
canvas 13 year olds who learned how to

509
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,830
make websites and then started this

510
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,050
thing called crannog which plans trees

511
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,940
and stuff and is a whole movement about

512
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,200
planting trees and organizing these

513
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,720
meetups to do so a nine-year-old meeting

514
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,060
a 32 year old with a IA in this

515
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,490
JavaScript or Java library called Robo

516
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,230
code where you program robots basically

517
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,100
just figured out if you did something

518
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,630
really simple by just like hogging the

519
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,430
slides he'd beat all this I complex

520
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,720
stuff six your neural to me

521
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,660
and 16 year old who made like a tic tac

522
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,780
toe and and an AI for it in like

523
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,430
javascript after like seeing it for

524
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,020
learning JavaScript for a week and like

525
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,360
spending every night on it lots of

526
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,760
pac-man cones at variance in some 10

527
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,800
year old start an IndieGoGo fund to get

528
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,830
a mac to make his first game and you

529
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,750
know all this other stuff and we've had

530
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,070
a couple of kids who've even like open

531
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,510
source their stuff and github pages just

532
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,330
to get their page up and I mean this is

533
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,090
a so this is one of my favorite XKCD

534
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,030
comics and I mean the worst thing the

535
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,410
worst thing I've ever seen in coderdojo

536
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,260
was this kid came up running it was

537
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,850
crying and he ran up to me and I said

538
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,320
what's wrong what's wrong and he said

539
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,120
you know through his tears he pointed to

540
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,550
another kid said he dropped my database

541
00:19:53,550 --> 00:20:03,070
so

542
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,060
so sanitize your inputs and stay in

543
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:11,100
school so I mean what it comes down to

544
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,730
was what what makes coderdojo well it's

545
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,410
the community really it's the people

546
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,910
involved it's the people who you know

547
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,710
spend time and you know volunteer and

548
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,480
help out or you know go talk to other

549
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,090
dojos and people who speak in rural

550
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,190
parts of Ireland to Twitter starting one

551
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,480
up now and there's some people who've

552
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,100
moved over to san fran and we're going

553
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,630
to attend that one to help add you know

554
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,760
it's people who work in the resources or

555
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,470
people like Chris who take a chance to

556
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,770
invite a crazy Irish guy over to speak

557
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,150
so really it's just an awesome community

558
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,310
led movement and there's you know

559
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,080
there's it like there's a couple of

560
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,120
people I see here who've been involved I

561
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,470
know Jacob who's speaking afterwards

562
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,630
came to her first one in san fran is now

563
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,410
responsible for bringing it into twitter

564
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,780
so what's the future for coderdojo so

565
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,370
it's nine months old and you know we've

566
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,070
got a couple of ideas so first off

567
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,480
improve the infrastructure and resources

568
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,830
there's a lot more that can be done

569
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,780
there and I stopped my other company

570
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,920
about three months ago to do this

571
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,410
full-time try and you know be in the

572
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,140
embodiment of the open web and you know

573
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,780
get open data from our Zen frameworks of

574
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,880
people kids can hack around with a API

575
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,770
and do stuff with the data by Tojo's and

576
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,750
so on build more tools which make it

577
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,570
easier to manage dojos and so on get the

578
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,460
badges sorted organized national

579
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,160
competitions continue to build a

580
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,620
kick-ass networking community grow it

581
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,510
out and help more kids and also the

582
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,500
establishment of the hello world

583
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,290
foundation which will be used to get

584
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,360
people to not only work on coderdojo but

585
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,850
work another coding education projects

586
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,890
and so on and always keep it keep the

587
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,170
mud John mindset iterate and make more

588
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,200
awesome so what kind of final remarks

589
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,420
would be that with coderdojo there are

590
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,520
ton of kids out there who could really

591
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,650
use this and as developers if you want

592
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,730
to help out to make good use of your

593
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,670
time I really urge you to get involved

594
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,190
set up a dojo volunteer and help out

595
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:05,170
finally be a hero thank you very much
