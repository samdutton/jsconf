00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,590

hi thanks for coming I'm of me and I'm

2
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,400
Chris you may know me from organizing

3
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,500
events such as jazz calm I also

4
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,660
unfortunately have become somewhat of a

5
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,920
community person for better or for worse

6
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,040
and as part of running Jays comp and

7
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,440
being amongst everybody I think it's

8
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,620
vitally important that we try to talk

9
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,190
about and address our issues whatever

10
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,560
they may be and I think that the issue

11
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,220
of diversity in terms of gender and

12
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,470
racial diversity within our community is

13
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,479
a vitally important thing that we don't

14
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:16,920
talk about as much as we probably should

15
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,950
there we did we've tried to make jazz

16
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,680
conf a platform in place that we can

17
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,570
talk about these issues and hopefully

18
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,910
try to change them last year we did the

19
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,310
gender diversity drive where we were

20
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,039
able to donate over $3,000 from your

21
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:36,850
efforts to local outreach programs where

22
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,510
they would teach young kids how the

23
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,400
computing Sciences work in a hope that

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,920
that lasting moment would carry them

25
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,020
throughout the rest of their lives and

26
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,259
they would enter into our field I see

27
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:52,030
this dialogue as a vitally important

28
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,040
thing and something that isn't meant to

29
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,619
be a point in time but meant to be the

30
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:58,450
start of something that we continue for

31
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,579
a longer period of time thanks Chris and

32
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,670
as a woman and I I do appreciate like

33
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,869
Chris's approach to this and attempts to

34
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:13,360
to try to improve it because i've been

35
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,269
working in computer science for 15

36
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:19,989
almost 15 years now I I was 19 when I

37
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:22,239
started developing I was in my first

38
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,670
programming group and I was with all

39
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,650
males and it and I think when you're

40
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,989
that young and you see a lot of women

41
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:33,790
today when you're that young you're

42
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,120
really impressionable and you accept the

43
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,739
status quo because you feel like okay

44
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:42,130
this is what it is and you feel like

45
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,010
okay I

46
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,810
have to kind of live with what the

47
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,360
current state and it's taken a long time

48
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,890
for me to come around to a

49
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,530
transformation in my thought process to

50
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,870
see that yeah maybe I can affect change

51
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,849
maybe I can help increase the number of

52
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:59,480
women or increase diversity in computing

53
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,450
and to realize that I don't have to

54
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,610
accept things when I'm not okay with

55
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,489
them so I that's why this is important

56
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:08,690
to me and that's why I wanted to have

57
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,519
this discussion the last couple of years

58
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:12,680
I've been working with the random acts

59
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,140
of kindness and the Grace Hopper

60
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,569
conference to try to increase numbers

61
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:19,430
like try to get at least twenty percent

62
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,489
at hackathons try to get to get more

63
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:25,220
women coming and participating in trying

64
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,359
and the way we want to approach this is

65
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:34,099
to not look at specific instances we're

66
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:35,239
not looking at instance definitionally

67
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:36,470
want to look at a class definition we

68
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,790
want to look at it more a holistic

69
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,190
approach and see if we can define and

70
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,720
help define help start a discussion

71
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,200
about how to approach this and see what

72
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,230
can be done and with that we don't we

73
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,629
don't think that this dialogue is going

74
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:52,190
to solve anything we don't we don't want

75
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,530
to pretend that what we're hoping is

76
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,280
that it's a long fix but it is a fix

77
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,470
that are a change that does happen it's

78
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,180
a longer-term sort of thing that will

79
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,609
require many discussions and this is

80
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:10,310
just one of those just to start so what

81
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,319
are the benefits of diversity studies

82
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,739
have shown that you know actually less

83
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:17,959
integrated groups do actually function

84
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,079
better so and that's I mean if you think

85
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,160
about it kind of makes sense if

86
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,139
everyone's like you in the group you

87
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,900
think that it would work better it kind

88
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,090
of somewhat feels right but that that

89
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,530
goes against what we're trying to talk

90
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,260
about here but we wanted to if the

91
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,729
research shows that we wanted to sort of

92
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:37,099
talk about that first off right and I

93
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:38,630
think it's a tendency of people like to

94
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,159
be around people who are like themselves

95
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,229
right i mean you kind of have a sense of

96
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:45,910
comfort around people who think like you

97
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,270
and you can actually get a lot done that

98
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,910
way but so so why do this what are they

99
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,130
what advantages does diversity give you

100
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,640
and and what we're fine like what we're

101
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,360
like after Chris and I read a lot we we

102
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,060
found like what you lose is you

103
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,950
basically are you're losing a larger

104
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,420
pool because you have thirty to forty

105
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,560
percent of the population that's

106
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,630
untapped and we need more computer

107
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,430
scientist we need I mean there's so much

108
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,500
work there's so much good stuff that

109
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,080
still needs to be done that we need more

110
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,430
people to do it and by being non-diverse

111
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,400
we lose it we lose a huge segment of the

112
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,570
population it's also a great way to grow

113
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:34,080
your community I don't yeah JS comp is a

114
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,060
crazy experiment that sometimes fails

115
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,550
sometimes succeeds and I would argue

116
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,730
that the more diverse ideas you have

117
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,100
from diverse backgrounds whether whether

118
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,230
it be gender diversity or racial

119
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,140
diversity we all come from different

120
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,580
life experiences in different life

121
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,820
scenarios we all that crafts our view of

122
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,360
life and if we were to be blind to the

123
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,760
other experiences of life we might miss

124
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,010
out on our own experiences that we might

125
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:08,350
be able to have just because we are like

126
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,790
somebody else might mean that we're

127
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,460
missing out on a good deal of life that

128
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,010
we would otherwise be better served to

129
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,730
experience if someone once told me that

130
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,870
ninety percent of the response that

131
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,020
somebody gives you or it like if you if

132
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,040
you tell someone something ninety

133
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,390
percent of the response is based on

134
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,800
their history and ten percent is

135
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,260
actually from what you said and I think

136
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,570
you lose when you don't have all that

137
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,390
history you don't have all that

138
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,240
background you lose a lot of experiences

139
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,710
and a lot of perspectives that you can

140
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,840
you can have into your products into

141
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,410
your market into your into your culture

142
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,500
and studies have also shown like the

143
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,750
reverse which is that when you do have a

144
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,550
woman in management you have a better

145
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,290
retention of your women developers

146
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,320
because they're

147
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,860
it's against the like the you know being

148
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,390
around people you like or being around

149
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,090
people who like you that's not right

150
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,590
being around people who are like or

151
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,210
similar to similar to you and it's it

152
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,310
it's when you when you have that support

153
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,500
in management it allows the developers

154
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,880
to know yet they're okay too and they

155
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,640
have the support from the company or the

156
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,460
community that they need I'm going to

157
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,650
stray away from this for just a second I

158
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,170
would argue that we need to look at this

159
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:29,610
not as we would look at software many of

160
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,130
us are or use almost all of us i would

161
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,750
guess at this point our use at least you

162
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,400
have a phone that is open source

163
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,840
developers where we believe that ideas

164
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,090
should be free and that multiplicity of

165
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,670
ideas is better than singularity of an

166
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,090
idea otherwise we'd all run windows XP

167
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,490
so in that same realm I view that we

168
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,470
should have an open mind about cultures

169
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,570
backgrounds experiences and ideas and

170
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,720
you know it really makes life a lot more

171
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,630
richer all around there is a recent New

172
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,590
York Times article that's that

173
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,560
bilingualism nikki's makes you smarter

174
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,840
so there's that too that's okay

175
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,170
different cultures different

176
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,400
perspectives make a stronger group so

177
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,260
statistically speaking so what are the

178
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,400
numbers and I think and I think to

179
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,630
understand like how we can solve this we

180
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,950
have to look at the current state and

181
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,860
the current state actually has its it's

182
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,580
in in in the corporate world it's

183
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,080
actually twenty five percent women it's

184
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,720
really it's it's you know it's pretty

185
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,570
respectable but numbers are actually

186
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,460
declining because nationally only

187
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,979
fourteen percent of women RCS graduates

188
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,669
and and of course it keeps going down

189
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,070
from there and open sores it's two

190
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,650
percent all right and if you look at

191
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,630
that I think Chris was talking about a

192
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,450
huge aggradation yeah one of the things

193
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,550
that I've been a proponent in discussing

194
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,460
is that we're at a pooling problem there

195
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,400
are less women who go into the computing

196
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,210
sciences as younger individuals and

197
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,670
their that leads to less women in

198
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,180
college curriculum

199
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,530
computer science which leads to less

200
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,020
women in the professional field which

201
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,170
ends up out of various different

202
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,420
conferences having an even lower thing

203
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,660
and as this is going to continue through

204
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,890
generationally it's just going to get

205
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,840
worse unless we try to stop the problem

206
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,840
not at the end but all the way at the

207
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,820
beginning pool if we can increase the

208
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,710
number of people at that beginning pool

209
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,230
it may take a while generation or two

210
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,390
hey I believe we're going to talk about

211
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,470
an exam state yeah it starts young we

212
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,150
have to start we have to fix the problem

213
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,250
at the root otherwise we're looking at

214
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,760
it too short-sighted and it'll just end

215
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,860
up right back where we are yeah and

216
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,440
change is happening I mean we it can't

217
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,940
happen and it is currently happening

218
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,730
like I was looking at this this has been

219
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,740
pretty well talked about that Harvey

220
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,320
Mudd College their president Maria Chloe

221
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,800
she put into place she basically changed

222
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,150
the cs curriculum in order to increase

223
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,310
the number of women in the program and

224
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,800
she attacked like she approached the

225
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,120
gender gap issue by basically offering

226
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,430
three types of introduction to computer

227
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,600
science courses because she kind of

228
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,640
realized that one Java wasn't working

229
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,110
for everyone so she switched to python

230
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,720
and two for the intro for the intro

231
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,110
language and two she realized that a lot

232
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,240
of the guys came into the classes with a

233
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,830
background in programming there's a

234
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,420
class for that but now there's also a

235
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,950
class for beginners and then there's

236
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,960
also a third type of class which is a

237
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,690
class it's called cs4 scientist which is

238
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,890
like a leaning toward biology so too

239
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,660
because they're there is already a large

240
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,500
percentage of women in in the sciences

241
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,540
so she figured well if we kind of tie it

242
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,040
to that maybe that will make them feel

243
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,500
more comfortable and it's worked because

244
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,020
if the numbers have gone from twelve

245
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,910
percent to thirty-five percent and in

246
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,980
2011 the class has forty percent women

247
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,170
so that's a phenomenal change that she's

248
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,580
been able to do I think in like five

249
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,600
years and then I think there are more

250
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,790
examples like that at the boss at PyCon

251
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,410
the Boston Python users group talked

252
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,050
about how they doubled their membership

253
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,459
and went

254
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:17,230
up to fifteen percent women by doing

255
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,660
just one year of workshop and I think

256
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,410
what we I think in in the JavaScript

257
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,240
community I think we are the community

258
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,569
right and I think we need in order for

259
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:31,179
change to happen we need more more

260
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:33,429
action like this yeah and I think it's

261
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:36,269
it seems hard seems almost impossible

262
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:38,800
because the numbers are declining but

263
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,220
let's give a parallel to medicine

264
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,230
medicine in the medical field in 1905

265
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,929
had a four percent female to female

266
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:51,730
ratio to ninety-six percent mail by 1994

267
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,759
it was at twenty-five percent female and

268
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,249
last year it was at fifty percent almost

269
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,709
parity which is impressive it's almost a

270
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:02,319
to generational change and so I would

271
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:04,029
challenge I think both of us would

272
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:07,209
challenge everyone here and ourselves to

273
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:09,819
see if we could get to that to

274
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:12,879
generational change or ideally do it in

275
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,939
less time odd generation it's going to

276
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:18,069
take time it's going to take discussion

277
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:20,139
and it's going to take action and we

278
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,110
have to start that somewhere so how many

279
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,980
of how many of you here know a girl or a

280
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,079
woman in your life that's like either

281
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:33,100
relative or a daughter or a nice or do

282
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,459
you guys have I think everybody has a

283
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:38,470
female some proximity to their life

284
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,949
right if you aren't we have a bigger

285
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:44,889
gender diversity issue it should be

286
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,379
about fifty percent right a 51-percent

287
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:50,829
statistically okay so that's an

288
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:52,990
immediate impact you can have right

289
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,670
there someone who's close to you because

290
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,309
this this affects that you know this

291
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,499
this affects them you want to we want to

292
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:02,589
create a world where it's not like they

293
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:04,209
have to choose computer science but they

294
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:06,040
know that option is there I think that's

295
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,199
the key it's it's that they know that

296
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:09,399
option is there and they're free to

297
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:11,290
choose it and they don't self-select out

298
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,329
of it and I think it's interesting like

299
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:15,549
medicine has changed so much that you

300
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:17,049
know women don't self-select out of it

301
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:19,360
anymore because the culture has changed

302
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,730
but and it's interesting to maybe

303
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,970
discuss why why do women self-select out

304
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,900
of

305
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,090
em fields why do they self select out of

306
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:31,410
computer science and engineering and I

307
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,730
think everyone had every reason is

308
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,400
different but we want to you can make a

309
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,340
direct impact with the people you know

310
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,800
yeah and I think if everyone thinks back

311
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,510
to where they first got that inspiration

312
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,050
that hey computers are cool you're

313
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,730
probably going to come back to a point

314
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,400
where somebody who was older than you

315
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,400
orden you know in proximity to you made

316
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,640
some sort of change in your life made

317
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,610
some sort of reach out some sort of

318
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,600
encouragement it might have been an

319
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,190
apple two gs that your parents bought

320
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,320
you in carmen sandiego and then you

321
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,970
figured out how to hack the rom on it

322
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,610
but there was some sort of catalyst

323
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,070
point that drove you down this pathway

324
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,380
so one of the things that we want to try

325
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,270
to put out there and we've got some

326
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,570
supplies here is to try to be that

327
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,970
catalyst to try to go out and you know

328
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,070
people in your community in your

329
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,500
proximity who are young and

330
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,460
impressionable impress on them to go

331
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,920
into the computing sciences that it to

332
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,040
not self-select out of it essentially we

333
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,770
have do want to tell what we have yeah

334
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,690
you and do it now you doing all right

335
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,540
I've already had my Oprah moment today

336
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,660
all right so we have this is so we have

337
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,090
a hundred html5 intro HTML Remy's book

338
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,510
basically so and you can only have one

339
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,010
if you're going to share it with a with

340
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:59,320
a girl or a woman and or or a or a non

341
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,980
well represented race grouping at a

342
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,860
general tech conference and basically if

343
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,940
you look to your left you look to your

344
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,910
right those are roughly not going to be

345
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,500
the people who we want you to take these

346
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,070
books and teach we want we would we want

347
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,110
to go for that generation that next

348
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,230
generation of change yeah if you're just

349
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,700
willing to share it if you're willing to

350
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,730
share it and and by all means you can

351
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:29,770
use it to impress in purse a you can use

352
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,310
it to get men or boys into computing

353
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,940
science and and that's great but also

354
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,870
try

355
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,150
think to get other people yeah and other

356
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,779
other people we also have 15 Arduino

357
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:46,779
kids this is think 1515 Arduino kits for

358
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,000
you to share and build something we have

359
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,250
10 USBs with the Alice program from CMU

360
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,700
and the scratch program from MIT on it

361
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,620
and those are really great learning tool

362
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,750
learning programming languages for for

363
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,440
kids we're going to hand those out after

364
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,750
this so don't everyone run up on stage

365
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,570
right now acha source we have access

366
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,960
cards yeah I don't know if those came in

367
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,730
then Mozilla is doing a thing called

368
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,560
hack a source which is actually really

369
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,700
cool if you've never heard of hacker

370
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,890
source what they've done is they've

371
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:21,070
tried to make web inspector a fun game

372
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,040
like a learning utility game check it

373
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,779
out I think it's just typing hack

374
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:28,500
asaurus into google or something and

375
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,029
you'll find it and that's a great way to

376
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:34,920
you know if you have a daughter say hey

377
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,560
Virginia in my case going back to my own

378
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,300
personal experience Virginia let's go

379
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,220
play with the web browser and figure out

380
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,350
how to inspect the DOM and that gives me

381
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,560
a chance to spend time with my daughter

382
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,400
which is great she's gonna love dad the

383
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,370
youngest btg author next year yes she'll

384
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,920
be running the conference all of

385
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,860
disappeared but I do want to say is this

386
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,589
another slide oh that that's our

387
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:04,540
challenge so our challenges to take

388
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,750
these items and go and help make that

389
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,329
generational or sector you know to

390
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,699
generational change that if we can do

391
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,559
this we can accelerate it yeah and I

392
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,089
think Chris and I were just discussing

393
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:17,829
right before this which is when you're

394
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,230
at a conference I was telling him about

395
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,970
the Grace Hopper conference which is the

396
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,709
exact opposite of this it's 2,000 women

397
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:28,209
and maybe like 50 men and it's it's a

398
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:30,760
huge difference in the way I feel at a

399
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,610
conference and it was odd because I got

400
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,110
you with some questions that were like

401
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,480
the inverse of what we normally would

402
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,020
discuss and I think the result was to

403
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,520
push each other to go to different

404
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,770
venues yes to try to go to a conference

405
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,400
that made

406
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,530
you you don't you might not be the

407
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,230
majority and also like when you're at a

408
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,730
conference where you are the majority to

409
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,490
reach out to someone you see who who is

410
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,480
not I tend to be more of a Wallflower at

411
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,350
the conferences where I'm not the

412
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,670
majority but I'm totally different

413
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,070
person at the conferences where I am and

414
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,140
I had that experience very recently

415
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,740
where Laura she's a floral designer and

416
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,430
so I attend an event with her and it's

417
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,840
incredibly flipped I would almost say

418
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,460
this is more diverse than those events

419
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,490
and I wallflower died I felt the

420
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,500
awkwardness and I I don't want to say

421
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,740
that I understand by any means how it

422
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,470
feels but it's good for us to push

423
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,300
ourselves as individuals and as a

424
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,400
community to do these events to go to

425
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,870
different events that we normally would

426
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,330
not go to so we can try to get to a

427
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,400
point where we all have some common

428
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,990
level of understanding of what it's like

429
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,100
to be I hate the term but in that

430
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,800
smaller demographic and then by that way

431
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,360
we at least have some level that we can

432
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,270
have intellectual discourse on these

433
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,000
items and I think the last point we

434
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,120
wanted to bring up was that it's like

435
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,040
just to be inclusive and that everyone

436
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,400
makes mistakes think and really it's

437
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,870
just about just acknowledging it and

438
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,330
then moving on because nothing is

439
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,480
irreparable and I think the one one

440
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,640
thing in health care because I work in

441
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,210
healthcare now at mgh and one thing I've

442
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,410
noticed is like health care

443
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,930
professionals always talk about instead

444
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,930
of saying someone is autistic like for

445
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,280
as an example they would say someone has

446
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,680
autism and because when you say someone

447
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,050
is something it kind of permanently

448
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,690
describes them as as having that

449
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,070
attribute versus when you say somebody

450
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,780
has something if a little more temporal

451
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,120
it can change can improve you know can

452
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,550
you know because I can be used by a

453
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,370
wider group so like you could say that

454
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:44,400
some some comment has sexist tones to it

455
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,310
versus calling the individual and and

456
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,610
that as men in this gender diversity

457
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,520
specific component of it we should be

458
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,670
willing to say that comment has sexist

459
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,310
tones to it

460
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,830
because then its temporal and we can

461
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,530
help the the group or individual that

462
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:07,010
set it to change or see the potential

463
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,100
error in how they were viewing it helped

464
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,380
to make the overall dialogue a lot

465
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,840
better and I want to make that point

466
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,800
more as an empowerment to the majority

467
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,470
male group here that it's our

468
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,730
responsibility just as much as the

469
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,580
female responsibility to make those

470
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,400
items known and help try to change them

471
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,880
that it can't just be you know a

472
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,590
balancing act and I think there is a

473
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:40,820
large there it can change I think it can

474
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,350
get better and it will get better I

475
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,240
think there's there's a huge there's a

476
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,830
lot of smart women a lot of smart

477
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:48,620
diverse people dying to contribute dying

478
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,300
to learn and I think we just need to be

479
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,300
a little more inclusive accepting of

480
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,130
them I mean when you're outside a group

481
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,570
you're just learning so I think is just

482
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,370
to just to be accepting and answer their

483
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:03,320
questions and start that way so please

484
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,360
take the challenge please try to show a

485
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,720
girl in your life a girl or a diverse

486
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,920
