long time and the first Cascadia JSI

really stoked to be here today talking

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,930
about a topic I'm really passionate

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,750
about which is mentoring just to tell

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,609
you a little bit about me I've been in

11
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,529
the industry yeah I'm old I've been in

12
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,599
the industry a little over 20 years I

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,079
started off my career as a software

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,380
developer and then halfway in I moved

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,590
over to the product side and I worked at

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,360
some great companies doing product

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,500
Microsoft Splunk

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,200
cloud did a lot of open source really

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,480
passionate about working with community

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,960
and lately I've also been getting really

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,379
involved with stem helping people of

22
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,750
diversity I'm also an advisor for code

23
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,879
fellows and that fits really well with

24
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,129
the topic that I'm going to speak about

25
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,850
today which is mentoring how many people

26
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:11,400
here actually have a mentor just a few

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,090
of you anybody here who is a mentor okay

28
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,220
well if I come back a year from now I'm

29
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,930
gonna try to make sure a lot more hands

30
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:19,680
go up

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,860
I particularly want for people that are

32
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,780
I know we have a lot of folks that are

33
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,850
the scholars that are looking to get

34
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,770
into the tech industry please pay

35
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,420
attention to this talk because I think

36
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,820
mentoring is something that really can

37
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,409
help you and it has really helped me in

38
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:36,840
my own career and for those of you that

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,110
have been around awhile really I'm going

40
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,329
to encourage you also to mentor others

41
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:44,130
and you can give back and you can help

42
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,899
them and a lot of folks today are

43
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,040
concerned about a lot of the barriers

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,899
that we know that people face in the

45
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,329
industry and mentoring is one way to

46
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:53,549
help overcome those barriers I'll talk a

47
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:55,950
bit a bit more about that as we go

48
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,259
forward let's start off we're talking

49
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,899
about what is a mentor so the first

50
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,390
thing that a mentor is is a guide and an

51
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,000
advisor now you'll see here I have a lot

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,369
of mountainous pictures so I've gotten

53
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,319
really into like mountaineering and rock

54
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,270
climbing recently so but

55
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,560
one of the things about mountaineering

56
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,180
and rock climbing is you're trying to

57
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,490
get to some type of peak you're trying

58
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,010
to get to some destination and you need

59
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,660
help to do that and that's really one

60
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,310
one of the things that a mentor does

61
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,010
they're a guide they've been to places

62
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,720
that you haven't been and they can

63
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,540
advise you along the way

64
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,050
generally a mentor is somebody who's

65
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,910
gone out of their way to volunteer

66
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,370
because they want to enable others to be

67
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,280
successful now this could be somebody

68
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,320
who works in your company and they're

69
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,990
paid but still when you look at

70
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,580
different organizations where people

71
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,470
mentor that's generally something that

72
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,150
they're doing because they want to do

73
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,620
that and that's something you should

74
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,930
think about as a mentee that the person

75
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,790
that's doing this is doing this because

76
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:02,750
they want to not because they have to

77
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,260
generally a mentor is going to have more

78
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,790
experience than you do

79
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,680
they're going to be able to help you in

80
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,600
an area where you want to grow so let's

81
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,010
talk about some of the ways that a

82
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,340
mentor can help you many successful

83
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,900
people and there's an article recently

84
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,060
in Forbes magazine about this will tell

85
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,220
you that mentors have been key to their

86
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,209
success why well one of the things that

87
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:31,270
a mentor can do is provide insight they

88
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,490
can see things that you can't see they

89
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,230
can look at things at a different level

90
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,940
that maybe you're not looking at and

91
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,490
they can help you to kind of navigate

92
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,890
difficult types of situations with that

93
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,560
insight that they provide in particular

94
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,260
I found in my own career when I had

95
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,810
mentors that were very very senior to me

96
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,910
who had been around a long time in the

97
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,980
industry they would be able to have that

98
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,140
kind of insight a lot of us are

99
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,450
developers so another place this can

100
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,340
help is like if you're working on a

101
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,560
problem and you have a mentor they may

102
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,180
be able to say oh you probably actually

103
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,459
really want to solve it this way because

104
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:08,590
this is going to have these implications

105
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,020
I know this because of these other types

106
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,000
of systems that we've built in the past

107
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,190
a key thing that mentors can provide is

108
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,300
a safe space so often and a mentor does

109
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,770
not have to be in your company

110
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,500
most of many of my mentors

111
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,360
do not work in the same company that I'm

112
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,400
in and one of the advantages of that is

113
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,980
they can be much more objective I can

114
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,020
talk to them about my situation I don't

115
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,330
have to be able I don't have to hold my

116
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,370
tongue and I can say you know I really

117
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,140
have this problem that I'm going through

118
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,850
I don't know what to do

119
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,280
this person is pissing me off I can't

120
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,680
figure this thing out and they can sit

121
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,280
there objectively and and give you some

122
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,900
advice on how to be able to deal with

123
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,670
that situation they can also really help

124
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,880
you to fill gaps in your skills so they

125
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,340
can say you know you can go to a mentor

126
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,200
and say hey I really want to learn this

127
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,040
thing can you help me and many times you

128
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,630
will find that the answer you will get

129
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,000
will be yes and there's many different

130
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,450
ways that a mentor can help one if it's

131
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,300
at your job you can possibly shadow them

132
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,550
so they can basically say hey come along

133
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,320
and as I go through this thing I'll

134
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,070
bring you with me

135
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,820
so you can shadow and you can learn

136
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,470
other mentors maybe they'll just sit

137
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,820
down with you and they'll walk you

138
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,380
through something I'll give you an

139
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,990
example and let me just point this out

140
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,820
mentoring is something you can find a

141
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,220
mentor at any point in your career it's

142
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,990
not something that you have to be junior

143
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,030
I have many mentors and I've been in the

144
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,370
industry for a long time and in my

145
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,729
current job where I work I I stepped

146
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:50,740
into a role where I had much more scope

147
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,390
and I had to do things that I never had

148
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,000
to do before like dealing with pricing I

149
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,250
never dealt with pricing before I've

150
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,690
written lots of code I never dealt with

151
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,229
pricing so I reached out to our VP of

152
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,840
Finance in the company and said hey can

153
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,210
you help and he was able to do that he

154
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,770
was able to walk me through point me out

155
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,960
literature that would help me to get the

156
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,120
foundation that I needed to be able to

157
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,979
make the types of decisions I was going

158
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:19,060
to have to make another key thing that

159
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,190
mentors can do and which was extremely

160
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,130
helpful for me in my career is they can

161
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,950
connect you to their network they can

162
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,960
make lots of different connections to

163
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,060
people that will help you in your

164
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,440
advancement to give you an example early

165
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,810
on when I joined Microsoft I joined in

166
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,810
one role as a product planner actually

167
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,240
to blog post about this and I realized

168
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,610
that that wasn't really the place that I

169
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,100
wanted to be but I was working with a

170
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,750
lot of different partners in different

171
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,850
product teams at Microsoft and I was

172
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,730
trying to make those connections by just

173
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,550
doing good work and being being reliable

174
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,690
and that led to me basically shifting my

175
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,180
entire career through those connections

176
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,320
because one of the people that I worked

177
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,330
with was on the product side and he said

178
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,639
hey you should consider doing this he

179
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,800
connected me with other program managers

180
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,290
and that had an amazing effect on my

181
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,620
career so I would really advise making

182
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,200
those kinds of connections is really

183
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,880
going to benefit you and there's a lot

184
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,470
of different ways that you can do that

185
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,490
from meetups

186
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,460
to social - in your own work environment

187
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,110
another thing that mentors can do is

188
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,380
they can create opportunities because

189
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,990
you're in the back of the mentors mind

190
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,430
and they're thinking about you whoever

191
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,280
the mentor is when an opportunity comes

192
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,320
up that they think might be a good fit

193
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,390
for you they can actually put your name

194
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,430
in and I've seen this happen several

195
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,500
times in my own career like when I was

196
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,200
at Microsoft I had a mentor who was a

197
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,000
partner at Microsoft he'd been there for

198
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,830
a very long time so I didn't work for

199
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,110
him and he became my mentor because I

200
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,910
approached him and asked him I just said

201
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,680
hey can you be my mentor and he said

202
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,690
sure I'll do that because somebody had

203
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,490
advised me that having mentors was a

204
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,250
good thing and he actually created tons

205
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,020
of opportunity in my career where he

206
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,419
said oh yeah he heard about something

207
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:13,350
that was happening at a different

208
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,330
organization and said that's a good fit

209
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,250
for Glen let's let's get Glen to do that

210
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,570
so let's talk about the different types

211
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,970
of career mentors there actually are

212
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,530
many different mentors you can have life

213
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,590
mentors but I'm gonna I classify career

214
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,169
mentors into kind of three so there's a

215
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:33,390
role focused mentor that's somebody who

216
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,789
really just helps you do your job they

217
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,890
know your job better than you and they

218
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,390
can help you do that and many

219
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,190
organizations have like a buddy system

220
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,640
for example where you join in a

221
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,440
particular role and your junior they're

222
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,050
going to assign somebody to you but a

223
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,490
key thing I would say about mentoring is

224
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,470
you can go after it you don't have to

225
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,420
wait til somebody comes to you and says

226
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,760
oh we have a mentoring program and we

227
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,670
want to match you up you can go out

228
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,709
there and you can find a mentor to fill

229
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,700
the gaps that you've identified career

230
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,360
growth focused so a career growth

231
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,160
focused mentor is kind of like the one

232
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,990
that I mentioned before somebody who

233
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,990
generally has a lot more experience they

234
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,060
may be much more senior than you and

235
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,250
they're looking across a much broader

236
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,589
perspective and they're helping you to

237
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:28,430
see things from a different angle so for

238
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,709
example the person that I mentioned his

239
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:33,410
name was John Gossman I remember when I

240
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,820
was at Microsoft when there were some

241
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,770
things that were going on within the

242
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,690
organization that I didn't understand

243
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,760
and I was able to go to him and say hey

244
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,950
can you explain this to me and he would

245
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,050
look at he would show it to me from a

246
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,910
completely different perspective and

247
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,520
over time I actually started to see

248
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,529
things from that perspective so that's

249
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:54,410
how mentoring really helped me it helped

250
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,079
me to basically orientate my lens to

251
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,910
look at things in a different way and to

252
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,130
start to think of things in a broader

253
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,730
perspective you can also get a mentor

254
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,290
that helps you just with a very specific

255
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,779
skill I talked I gave you my pricing

256
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:11,000
example where I just wanted to learn how

257
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,220
to do pricing and I went to somebody who

258
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:18,980
really knew pricing to work with me see

259
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,000
I think I'm missing a slide no actually

260
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,760
no those are all of them ok so let's

261
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,490
talk about what makes a good mentor one

262
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,560
key thing is that a mentor is more

263
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,339
experienced than you now many people may

264
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:36,500
be thinking well how much experience do

265
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,120
I have to have really to be a mentor

266
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,459
really you just have to have experience

267
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:42,920
that somebody else needs and why I'm

268
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,390
saying that is you don't have to wait

269
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,700
until you have 10 years of experience in

270
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,339
industry for example to be a mentor as

271
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:51,649
long as you have acquired a certain

272
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:53,180
amount of knowledge that you think that

273
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,420
other people need you can actually be a

274
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:01,829
mentor to that to that individual a

275
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,220
mentor should be somebody that you feel

276
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,730
comfortable talking to

277
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,730
they're gonna help you and they're only

278
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,410
going to be able to help you in as much

279
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,480
as you're able to give them the

280
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,279
information that they need to help you

281
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,889
be successful what are your goals what

282
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:18,389
are your desires what are the things

283
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:20,220
that you're actually struggling with I'm

284
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,779
not saying they're a therapist let's

285
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,809
keep it in the work kind of career

286
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:26,759
context but you should feel comfortable

287
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,100
talking to them I often advise people

288
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,259
that are trying to find mentors to

289
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:33,209
really look at this if you don't feel

290
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:34,819
comfortable talking to that person

291
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,989
you're not really going to be they're

292
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,100
not really going to be able to help you

293
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,269
and you're not really gonna be able to

294
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:41,209
find the help that you need

295
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:43,559
trust this goes hand-in-hand with that

296
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,199
as well the whole idea of a mentor is

297
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:48,679
someone that you feel that you can

298
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,939
reveal to them a whole bunch of details

299
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:52,889
in order for them to be able to help you

300
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:54,899
but you're not gonna do that if you feel

301
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,139
you can't trust them so one thing about

302
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:01,109
trust really is confidentiality that's

303
00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:02,910
what that means that the things that are

304
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,100
told to the mentor stay with the mentor

305
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,439
or at least that mentor gets your

306
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:10,439
permission and will say that so I mentor

307
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:11,730
a lot of people and I will say are you

308
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,699
okay if I say so and so I'm not gonna

309
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:18,909
just go go ahead and do it on my own

310
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:21,629
this has certainly been a challenge for

311
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:26,699
me they have to be a good listener the

312
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:28,709
mentor is really there to serve you

313
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:31,259
remember that if you get a mentor it's

314
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:33,059
not that you're there to make the mends

315
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:35,100
who are happy the whole idea of the

316
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,230
mentor is to help you make that journey

317
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,169
if they're not a good listener they're

318
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:42,359
not gonna really be understanding and

319
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:44,220
understanding your problems and they're

320
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,749
not gonna be giving you the space to

321
00:12:45,749 --> 00:12:48,389
really try to work through them because

322
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:50,459
a mentors job is not to solve the

323
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,189
problem for you that's the whole idea of

324
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,319
advice it's to help you see help you

325
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:57,449
look at things in a different way think

326
00:12:57,449 --> 00:12:58,980
about how to get up that trail but

327
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,720
you're the one who ultimately has to do

328
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,459
it consistency and availability is

329
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,889
really important now there's a

330
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:09,839
relationship that builds between a

331
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,519
mentor and a mentee and there's an

332
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,860
agreement that happens and whatever that

333
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,470
agreement is as far as availability and

334
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,869
time that should be something that the

335
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:19,260
men

336
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,350
or sticks to it's also on the menti it

337
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,170
goes both ways but if you have a mentor

338
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,540
that's flaking out who's not willing to

339
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,100
give the time then you should find

340
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,410
another mentor who is willing to give

341
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,910
that time because otherwise you're just

342
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,560
you're just wasting your time and you're

343
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,140
not actually making the progress so I

344
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,460
wanted to give a couple of pointers

345
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,160
about how to find a mentor so one thing

346
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,950
you can do is many companies do have a

347
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:50,820
mentoring program and one thing I always

348
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,080
found kooky just telling a story is that

349
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,460
Microsoft has a mentoring program and

350
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,460
they basically require at the time would

351
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,010
require required that you were an

352
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,650
employee for a year before you could get

353
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,110
a mentor I hope that's actually changed

354
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,880
because what I really needed the mentor

355
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,340
was earliest on so what did I do when

356
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,470
the program wouldn't really allow me to

357
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,020
be in it I just went and found a mentor

358
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,540
on my own anyway so you don't need the

359
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,550
program but if there is a program it can

360
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,220
be a really useful resource to be able

361
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,320
to connect with others you can just

362
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,840
approach a friend or a co-worker tell

363
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,370
your friend your coworker like hey

364
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,050
here's something I really like to learn

365
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,120
I think you have a bunch of experience

366
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,790
that I could benefit from would you be

367
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,250
willing to be my mentor and I have found

368
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,260
consistently that most of the time when

369
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,330
or I would say consistently when I've

370
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,890
gone to people and said to them hey

371
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,110
would you mentor me the answer is

372
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,600
generally a yes once in a while it might

373
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,640
be a no and if they're not at a place

374
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,040
where there will able to give that

375
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,410
commitment then no is actually a good

376
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,480
thing it's saving both of us a lot of

377
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,630
heartache and hardship a key thing I

378
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,760
would say too is that people respond to

379
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,750
honesty and when someone is genuine so

380
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,640
when you go to someone and ask them for

381
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,250
a mentor to be your mentor be prepared

382
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,490
to actually work because every mentor is

383
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,050
going to they're going to get

384
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,600
discouraged as a mentor if they see that

385
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,120
they're advising you or giving you like

386
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,770
they might say a mentor might say hey go

387
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,840
read this book this book is really going

388
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,720
to help you

389
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,820
well if you're not going to do those

390
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,920
things that the mentor is advising on

391
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,960
that's going to help you to learn then

392
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,420
that relationship is probably not going

393
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,780
to work out very well there's lots of

394
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,860
online communities where you can go to

395
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,470
find mentors one that because I come

396
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,330
from the product side one I'll call out

397
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,880
is the mind the product slack so for any

398
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,380
folks here that are interested in like

399
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,390
product management or learning more

400
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,160
about product they have a great

401
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,030
mentoring community there and you can

402
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,330
also use social media so this is my VP

403
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,360
of Marketing at all 0 we call them gonto

404
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,610
and he recently went went on Twitter and

405
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,740
he posted and said hey you know I'd like

406
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,290
to talk to somebody who has experience

407
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,480
in a company our size leading a product

408
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,980
team and that's because he was stepping

409
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,520
into an acting VP of Product role so

410
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,280
this is a good illustration of someone

411
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,530
who is quite seasoned in their career

412
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,660
who's going out there and asking for

413
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,730
help so you're never too old or too

414
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:42,430
experienced to ask for a mentor so I'm

415
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,330
gonna talk about a couple of other

416
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,250
things quickly which is why should you

417
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,470
mentor so there's we talked a lot about

418
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,410
the benefits of having a mentor but what

419
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,960
are the benefits of being a mentor one

420
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,900
key thing is just about do it's doing

421
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,550
good you're helping other people be

422
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,560
successful and if you believe in the

423
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,780
concept of pay it forward that when you

424
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,580
do good things it's going to come back

425
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,949
to you I truly believe in that and have

426
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:08,020
seen that so you are in a place to

427
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,640
really help other people be successful

428
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,750
in the industry and you can help break

429
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,280
barriers and this one has been really

430
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,650
personal for me you know I know for

431
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,920
example as a white male that I have had

432
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,810
a lot of advantages and I tweeted about

433
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,000
this a while ago I said I've gotten

434
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,680
double advantages one being white

435
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,160
another being male in technology and so

436
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,140
that puts me in a place where I feel

437
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,730
like I have a responsibility to help

438
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:34,510
break Briery

439
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,140
blah break barriers for others and I can

440
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,300
do that why because I can help them

441
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,400
introduce them to my network I can

442
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,560
advocate

443
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,450
I can guide them on what are the things

444
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,610
that they need to do in order to be

445
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:52,530
successful I can help the industry as a

446
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,100
mentor why because I'm helping to groom

447
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,800
the next generation I'm helping to make

448
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,510
sure that the people that are in this

449
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,150
industry care and are doing the right

450
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,060
things and I can inculcate in them the

451
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,830
right principles and things to care

452
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:12,810
about mentoring will help you be a

453
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,690
leader if you have aspirations of one

454
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,940
day for example being a manager then

455
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,650
mentoring is really going to help you

456
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,890
because you're gonna get a lot of the

457
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,870
experience a key thing of being a

458
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,630
manager is being able to listen and

459
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,030
being able to advise and you're going to

460
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,030
get a lot of that plus you're going to

461
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,770
understand the challenges that the

462
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,360
people that you're mentoring or going

463
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,360
through and all of that experience is

464
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,910
going to lead into helping you to be a

465
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,770
better leader and manager in the future

466
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,380
and this one is really really important

467
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,880
and and this is one of the reasons why

468
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,000
for myself I focused a lot over the last

469
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,070
number of years on mentoring women and

470
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,070
people of color is to just overcome your

471
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,380
unconscious biases and we all have them

472
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,880
it's not saying you're like a bad person

473
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,490
we all have these biases that we were

474
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,650
born you know that we've picked up

475
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:08,250
through our culture and we act based on

476
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,290
those biases but if you become conscious

477
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,240
of them you can it you can attack them

478
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,080
you can battle them and for me talking

479
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,570
to people that are in a very challenged

480
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,280
position and hearing their challenges

481
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,440
and understanding them and understanding

482
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,050
the things that I shouldn't do or should

483
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:29,010
do to help them has been super valuable

484
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,350
it's made me a better person

485
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,710
so getting close to the end but I have a

486
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,710
special treat coming up but I would

487
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,320
advise you all to go get a mentor and be

488
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,760
a mentor and you can have multiple

489
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,510
mentors so now for the last part of my

490
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,160
talk I've got somebody really special

491
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,350
that I want to bring up I've talked a

492
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,240
lot about how as a mentor you have this

493
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,020
opportunity to help other

494
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,390
and so I'm gonna bring up my friend

495
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,450
Taylor who has an amazing story of how

496
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,630
she went from not working in the tech

497
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:07,110
industry to getting a developer job in

498
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,910
just about a year it's a great story

499
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:19,330
come on up Taylor

500
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,799
can you guys hear me okay how are you

501
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,960
guys I'm really excited to be here it's

502
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,110
my first tech conference and so I wanted

503
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,549
to kind of quickly share with you my

504
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:35,330
story and how I landed a front end role

505
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,610
in Seattle so if he looks to the left

506
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,280
you'll see me January 29th of this year

507
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,880
working at Boston Market as a fast food

508
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,309
server slash cashier and then to the

509
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:51,150
right you see me on my first day as a

510
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,840
professional software engineer so going

511
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,299
back last year was when I started

512
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,370
learning how to code I couldn't afford

513
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:02,850
to go to a bootcamp or go back to

514
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,679
college for a computer science degree

515
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:07,020
and I didn't really have much of a

516
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,850
support system because I don't have a

517
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,610
college degree at all and I didn't know

518
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:15,090
anyone that was in stem and so how he

519
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,860
came across coding was because I watched

520
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,809
a documentary about Aaron Swartz Evie

521
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:21,090
you guys have heard of him he was the

522
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,540
co-founder of Reddit and he really tried

523
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,750
to use technology to impact politics and

524
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,860
that was what I was really passionate

525
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,830
about doing so I learned how to code

526
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,660
online through udemy.com

527
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:38,160
YouTube tutorials egghead and I built a

528
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,690
lot of projects and I'd sweeten my

529
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:43,410
progress every day on twitter using the

530
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,410
100 days of code challenge and i used

531
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,360
that as a way to not only document my

532
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,679
progress and see what I've been learning

533
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,480
like every day but also to connect with

534
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,350
people I started networking online I'm

535
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:59,040
an introvert and so I and I also cannot

536
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,600
like a force that goes like a meet-up or

537
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,740
anything because I was in Orlando

538
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,620
Florida and Orlando is dead when comes

539
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,890
to like tech opportunities so I was

540
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,630
unfortunate to be like in your Christie

541
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,000
aatul or anything like that but I was on

542
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,059
Twitter and I did get a hold of a lot of

543
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:18,450
people who provided like support from

544
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,780
like around the world encouragement

545
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,070
constructive feedback on my projects and

546
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,230
on my work and it really meant a lot to

547
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:29,850
me and so because of Twitter also I got

548
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:30,530
a hold

549
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:33,050
of an employer in Seattle they have

550
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,200
reached out to me and they had offered

551
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,690
me an interview and that is when I

552
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,660
landed my first role and I also wanted

553
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,550
to give like a little bit of advice to

554
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,930
people who are looking for like their

555
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,480
first job what really made me um stand

556
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,950
out to that employer and actually get

557
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,630
touched I was because I did go through

558
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,190
some technical interviews with other

559
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,900
companies and I remember like the

560
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,590
questions they asked me and so when I

561
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,670
interviewed with the lead front-end

562
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,580
engineer I asked him all those questions

563
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,210
that I was asked I was like I was like

564
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:10,190
hey so what design patterns do you like

565
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,190
or what is clean code mean to you I

566
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,170
asked like those kind of questions

567
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,480
um do you do unit testing performance

568
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,060
testing um you know I was just I flipped

569
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,640
back on him to actually show they're

570
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,930
like you know I know what I'm you know

571
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:27,170
like I know what I'm doing and that

572
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,600
really impressed them and so I got

573
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,320
offered the role and I just am now in

574
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,480
the process of wanting to like give back

575
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,850
to people so I'm also like mentoring

576
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,490
online on Twitter helping people out

577
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,020

578
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:47,210

579
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,730
and that I hope that it's helps people

580
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,290
who are struggling because I remember

581
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,030
those like late nights you know coding

582
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,820
like every night I would like work at

583
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,470
Boston Market for like eight to nine

584
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,590
hours a day like sweeping floors mopping

585
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,320
bathrooms and you know dealing with like

586
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,690
micro managers and like it was just like

587
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,840
all that pain and like everything I was

588
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,190
going through because at the time my dad

589
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,440
had died when I start learning how to

590
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,230
code it really really feels like my

591
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,390
energies to learn how to code and select

592
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,040
Larenz like my first like role in tech

593
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,480
and I know it's like when the most like

594
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,890
competitive industries and I know they

595
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,000
can get hard we didn't go into an

596
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,250
interview process but it does get better

597
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:28,700
and there will be a spot for you if you

598
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,800
just keep going and keep trying and just

599
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,750
putting yourself out there and building

600
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:40,680
projects so I hope this
