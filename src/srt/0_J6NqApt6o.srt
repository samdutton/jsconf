1
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,480

hey guys I guess we all get started as

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,920
people coming to the room so this my

3
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,340
name is Andrew my name is things are

4
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,680
going wrong already great things I'm

5
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,809
Andrew Lonnie and this this talks will

6
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,290
hang over that Jess I apologize to

7
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,630
Jonathan Julian who presented on the

8
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,090
with the same title last year I thought

9
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,390
it was a great title so I took it about

10
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,360
me I work at my Toby in vancouver bc i

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,220
have a humorous job title that

12
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:59,460
compensates for my poor salary we are we

13
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,710
make a pro we work on a project for

14
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,839
phonegap for building native mobile

15
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:06,480
applications with web technologies and i

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,940
personally work on a web service called

17
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,370
phonegap build that does the the

18
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,770
phonegap stuff in the cloud but this

19
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,860
talk is not going to be about about

20
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,260
phonegap so if you're not sure if you

21
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,880
want to stay for this talk then here's

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,790
the summary is kind of about code called

23
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,190
e city code is a social problem not a

24
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,100
technical one and there aren't solid

25
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,270
solutions to that there are just

26
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,270
heuristics about about how we can deal

27
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,060
with that this isn't as I say this is

28
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,160
not going to be a technical talk and if

29
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,480
you want to go get some coffee i would

30
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:46,170
not be offended by that yeah sure that

31
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,730
no one in the room gets that joke

32
00:01:50,740 --> 00:02:02,290
Thanks right cool so hangovers hopefully

33
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,880
you all came prepared and brought your

34
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,960
own there's a pretty great book called

35
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,750
everyday drinking which is you can guess

36
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,900
what the subject is and it's that's a

37
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,519
good article in there about hangovers

38
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:18,880
and the rider Kingsley a mess he

39
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,830
distinguishes between a physical

40
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,870
hangover so when you have a headache or

41
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,360
your whole body aches and a metaphysical

42
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,900
hangover he describes a metaphysical

43
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,269
hangover as an ineffable compound of

44
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:34,780
depression sadness anxiety self-hatred

45
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,540
sense of failure and fear for the future

46
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,280
now why would I mention this oh yeah

47
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,310
we're at ojo circumference so it's

48
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,590
possible that some of us have written

49
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,630
all have dealt with other people's code

50
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,299
that would give us a metaphysical

51
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:01,989
hangover or this metaphor is getting

52
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:06,459
really stretched at this point anyway

53
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:07,480
I'll try and make a case I think

54
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,670
javascript is a bit of a self-loathing

55
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,630
language and I guess we'll see how well

56
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:18,730
I goes the next 15 minutes this is

57
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,190
another dumb joke but a if you guys all

58
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,319
know around doll he had this tweet on

59
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,730
the first night of Jess come for about

60
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,609
prom and rains really smart so i'm going

61
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:29,170
to assume this was like really

62
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,799
insightful so I guess chase conf is like

63
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,790
prom for JavaScript developers it

64
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,160
doesn't really work but

65
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,000
so we should all maybe consider runs

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,870
tweet for a moment

67
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:55,810
now move on cool so jess conf is is

68
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,780
pretty fun and what I like about Joe's

69
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,480
company you kind of get a vacation from

70
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,840
application code you see obviously not

71
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,130
this presentation but you see good

72
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,460
presentations which have you know all

73
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,490
these sexy new libraries and open source

74
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,130
projects and frameworks and if you're

75
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,930
like me you think it sounds great I

76
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,400
can't wait to hack on this I'm going to

77
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,050
I'm going to build a new app using

78
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:25,960
Batman or Joe or any of the binary AP is

79
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,220
David planning and talked about you

80
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,810
think yeah i wanna i want to go home and

81
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,910
get them and that's great because all

82
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,130
these presentations are new code bases

83
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,680
and new code bases are great because

84
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,090
they're they don't have much in them so

85
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,770
new code bases i think are a bit like

86
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,490
robert smith during the 1980s they're

87
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,590
very slick they're stylish the sleek

88
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,620
their exciting there sexy and you really

89
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,910
want to keep writing code because it's

90
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,060
such a such a fun time and that's the

91
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,000
feeling I get from attending j/s conf

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,140
then after Jess conf you are you go back

93
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,720
to work and you return to your

94
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,100
application and it's the same shitty

95
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,150
code you've been working on for months

96
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,250
at a time and all through the code base

97
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,440
there are two do comments and fix meas

98
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,630
and there's some crafty code you don't

99
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,420
really want to fix because your project

100
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,290
manager is saying you've got to

101
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,880
implement a new feature and you don't

102
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,950
wanna go behind deadlines so blah blah

103
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,970
blah I think this is the worst slide in

104
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:30,100
the history of juice conf I realize

105
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,100
that's a bold claim but um I think it

106
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,000
stands up to that so an old code base is

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,950
more like Robert Smith in this decade

108
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,790
it's kind of flabby disheveled

109
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:49,480
unmaintained bull embarrassing and you

110
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,610
wouldn't want to work with it or be

111
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,390
anywhere nearer

112
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,050
so we're back to the metaphysical

113
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,390
hangover depression sadness anxiety

114
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:03,420
self-hatred sense of failure and fear

115
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,880
for the future there's a picture of a

116
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:12,510
man looking sad so I've talked about

117
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,790
generalities so I think maybe if I chose

118
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,320
an actual bad code that i don't like

119
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,340
from a project that i work on it it kind

120
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,360
of shows the sort of thing that people

121
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,490
are a bit too lazy to fix because

122
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,990
they're all kind of dependencies in the

123
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,410
projects and and you don't to fix it so

124
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,400
this is probably the worst well the next

125
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,900
slide is the worst one but this is the

126
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,320
second worst function in phonegap iphone

127
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:43,860
and it's called get function name it

128
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,990
takes a function and it returns the name

129
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:51,600
of the function there's John David

130
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,010
Dalton the audience and he can tell you

131
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,530
all the things that are incorrect about

132
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,120
this code as well as it being ugly and

133
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,470
I'm maintainable but essentially if I'm

134
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,020
correct it'll return them if there's a

135
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,640
name properly it will turn the name if

136
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,670
it's anonymous function expression it

137
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,240
will call this an on to name funk

138
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,150
function so this is what this looks like

139
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,690
we have an object called a

140
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,300
non-functioning we have a variable

141
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,400
called a non funk map next ID and then

142
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,080
we have this function a non turn named

143
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,240
funk you guys can stop me at any point

144
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,540
it create it uses this a non funk map

145
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,090
next ID variable to create a unique

146
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,490
identifier for the function and then it

147
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:47,040
creates a new function which is it

148
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,140
applies itself to the original function

149
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,630
and then it deletes itself from the map

150
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,170
of functions and then it returns that

151
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,110
identifier so this is some gross stuff

152
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,900
we've done to try and manage callbacks

153
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,390
coming back from native code into

154
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,520
JavaScript and

155
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,890
it doesn't work in all cases you kind of

156
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,630
have to have a globally scoped function

157
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,420
or you end up with this weird anon funk

158
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,450
man thing but at the same time we've

159
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,190
we'd like to get a 1 point 0 release out

160
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,660
so we're working on implementing new

161
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,210
api's and we don't wanna go and fix that

162
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,050
and that's kind of the the problem with

163
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:32,640
old code bases sorry about so that code

164
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,960
was pretty horrible so here's a picture

165
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:42,000
of a man surfing the web so here's

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,760
another tangent javascript is kind of a

167
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,730
good cop bad cop language so in terms of

168
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,870
the language itself you have a great

169
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,390
deal of expressiveness in the syntax and

170
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,430
semantics and there's a wide range of

171
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,440
freedom and expression you can

172
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,540
accomplish and if any of you guys saw

173
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,190
Andrew DuPont's talk yesterday he gave a

174
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,200
good example of extending built-ins

175
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,620
which is really nice unfortunately you

176
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,230
have the bad cop which is the JavaScript

177
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,720
environment and we have all these best

178
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,370
practices and these recommendations for

179
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,860
performance and compatibility and memory

180
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,260
usage and code sides that mean that all

181
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,110
the time you can't use all the newest ap

182
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,940
is or the newest features of the

183
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,460
language so in jazz community the good

184
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,200
cop bad cop is basically Brendan Eich

185
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,400
and Douglas Crockford Brendan tells us

186
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,780
about the cool new language features

187
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,310
that we can all do to improve the

188
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,900
expressiveness and the beauty of our

189
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,180
code and then we have bad cop Crockfords

190
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,640
who tells us that our our codes not very

191
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,900
good so we should stop trying to be so

192
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,670
clever and we should be worried about

193
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,780
security so I think there's a technical

194
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,450
solution to this problem there's not a

195
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,510
kind of constant time thing you can do

196
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,980
to fix code called it something you have

197
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,160
to follow flow every day and try and

198
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,270
make sure things get better each time

199
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,530
it's a bit like the old joke about how

200
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,020
do you lose weight without changing your

201
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,330
diet or doing any exercise and the

202
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,850
answer is you get a

203
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:13,770
you get a tape one which works which

204
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,570
does help you lose weight but it may

205
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:19,320
cause problems later later on the thing

206
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,260
and the thing with these heuristics is

207
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,190
that there's an obvious question and the

208
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,580
answers are quite well known instantly I

209
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,870
think this image is copyright

210
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:40,470
shutterstock it seemed like a good idea

211
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,830
four o'clock in the morning I don't know

212
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:46,410
so how can you avoid bad code well the

213
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,700
trouble with this is it's kind of like

214
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,920
the diet example or the losing weight

215
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,990
example actually what you should do is

216
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,690
really obvious and you don't need

217
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,770
someone like me to tell you you should

218
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,570
write tests you should write docs you

219
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,430
shouldn't Tran be too clever you

220
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,410
shouldn't be a you shouldn't code like

221
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,750
an asshole but unfortunately because we

222
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,190
have all these external pressures of

223
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,140
whether it's deadlines or the kind of

224
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,290
inertia of these big project projects we

225
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:14,700
don't always follow them so all I can

226
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,710
say is that too to improve the quality

227
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,970
of your code it's really just about

228
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,000
discipline and dedication and rather

229
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,200
than any kind of technique so that was
