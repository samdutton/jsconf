4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,060
Berlin and I want to share with you

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,000
today how I mean how I made my journey

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,650
from Brazil to Berlin and how the

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,949
community helped me to do so so to do it

8
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,949
I will walk through my kind of short

9
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,500
career and try to explain you what to

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,090
give you some context and how things

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,280
went and how all the committee helped me

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,969
to do so

13
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,760
so our first short story my career I

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,320
have just four years career so it's

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,290
really short in the beginning from 15 to

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,870
17 I basically work as a stock developer

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,700
and mainly javascript no frameworks a

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,969
lot of stress and then 18 I went as a

19
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,070
back-end big data developer I shift my

20
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,940
career because of some stress prizes on

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,520
the year before and it all happened on

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,219
the same very same company back in my

23
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,060
hometown in Brazil so in 2019 I moved to

24
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,830
Germany to Berlin actually to work in a

25
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,510
front-end engineer that doesn't have

26
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,380
that much relation with my previous job

27
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,040
and how did it happen in the beginning

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,799
of my career like in the first years our

29
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,860
walls up was I used Khalid are ordinary

30
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,200
developers so I just used to work go

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,869
home study and do things that were good

32
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:29,610
just for the company and not for myself

33
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,770
over something else I didn't know what

34
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,570
conference me top open-source and so on

35
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,610
I was just like working every day going

36
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,720
home and that was it

37
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,329
so how the community helped me in the

38
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,159
past two years so basically it helped me

39
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,170
to not be just an ordinary developer and

40
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,890
do something else above the company

41
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,500
interests work on so how do you help me

42
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,450
to move to another continent so

43
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,970
basically in the beginning I basically

44
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,700
didn't have any reason to keep studying

45
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,100
and putting effort and frontend anymore

46
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,740
once I moved to like back-end and so on

47
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,430
and in fact my last boss

48
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,190
it was jockeyed weird but he told me

49
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,259
that I was wasting my time losing focus

50
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,970
going to meetups conference organized

51
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,100
meetups and so on and that it should

52
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,840
focus on something that really matter

53
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,030
and he said it if I want to do so I

54
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,550
should make money from it I respect his

55
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:23,150
opinion and so on but I didn't agree

56
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,770
with him and so it all started back in

57
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,490
2017

58
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,500
my first contact I started going to

59
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,020

60
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,490

61
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,410

love basically for it

69
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,209
and basically the committee helped me to

70
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,100
push me forward on studying things that

71
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,170
I wasn't even working on touching on

72
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,090
anymore basically JavaScript and voj yes

73
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,150
that I have never had a professional

74
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,800
experience before and so after that

75
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,320
period I didn't consider myself an

76
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,620
ordinary developer anymore and okay

77
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,420
that's all nice but how did I get into

78
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,180
it I mean I was just a kind of a guy

79
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,130

80
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,790
