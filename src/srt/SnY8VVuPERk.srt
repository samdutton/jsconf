introduce me alright cool so this guy

5
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,270
says that apparently you could do no GS

6
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,780
server-side scripting in Photoshop yeah

7
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,220
my name is andy hall i came from adobe

8
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:59,039
japan the file now has a new menu option

9
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,590
called awesome mode because it's awesome

10
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,440
that's why it's called awesome mode so

11
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,100
this without further ado is Alec

12
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:14,190
smacking my cat ow

13
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,960
I'm Alex macaw and actually we're

14
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,760
already off to a good start because in

15
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,330
my last presentation that Jays Kumpf I

16
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,550
actually spelled my name wrong now pay

17
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,440
attention because this is what we're

18
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,000
about to see is I think basically the

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,950
future Photoshop right ok Photoshop new

20
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,300
layer see you do a demo and it doesn't

21
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:47,060
work what happens all right I'm pleased

22
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,700
to see that as soon as anyone puts up a

23
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,160
chat at a conference people try and hack

24
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,040
it with cross-site scripting so goods

25
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,310
good sign for a tech conference oh it's

26
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:06,520
going nuts ok Photoshop ok photoshopped

27
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,170
what is the difference I would just like

28
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,670
to introduce you our next speaker

29
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,240
Michelle budzinski and I work also on

30
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,140
this project called Antarctic Jas and

31
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:24,140
it's maybe it's hard to like uh get this

32
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,090
from the name but that's the JavaScript

33
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,880
conference and Antarctica what is it

34
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:35,320
then ok Photoshop this is crazy hold on

35
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,610
ok Photoshop I've never had it not work

36
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,459
this well one ok I didn't prepare the

37
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:45,290
presentation actually I made a game

38
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,260
because it's more fun to talk about

39
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,010
games while you play game right and now

40
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,050
he's gonna be talking about testing CSS

41
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:00,110
you guys have any problems without it so

42
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,300
oh one more thing even if I'm a game

43
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,459
developer I'm not really good player so

44
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:08,390
I second gaming and like playing and

45
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,820
talking in the same time it's impossible

46
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,760
for me so i will probably

47
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:21,170
yeah I improved this but I improved the

48
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,120
wrists bound algorithm recently so it

49
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,910
should work better it's a pretty strange

50
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,380
world and I don't think there's lots of

51
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,660
solutions out there for that yes as you

52
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,180
said it's a strange world and I'm a

53
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:38,840
strange guy so okay Photoshop why does

54
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,700
not work ok Photoshop this is really

55
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:54,920
strange

56
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:06,189
yeah oh wait okay okay photoshop i do

57
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:07,569
not know why this would happen one

58
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:15,360
moment okay photoshop okay photoshop

59
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,280
this is a nightmare I guess you're all

60
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,719
wondering why is he wearing a bow tie

61
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,449
and I heard it's actually thanksgiving

62
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:25,210
today so maybe that's the reason or

63
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,169
maybe I'm just very happy to be here or

64
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:30,909
well I'm simply a strange guy so maybe

65
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:38,400
that's it okay photoshop okay photoshop

66
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:48,740
thank new layer ah what is it doing yay

67
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,189
okay sorry because i have no idea where

68
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:57,520
my next slide is okay upper platform and

69
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,819
I'm from I'm from Sweden so I I guess

70
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,469
all of you kind of have an idea of

71
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:16,669
Sweden and I bet it's a lot like this

72
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:21,610
okay Photoshop why would that not work

73
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:28,990
ah this is really crazy alright so let's

74
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,969
pretend that demo worked because it's

75
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:32,770
clearly doing something here but it's

76
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,779
it's not like that it's worse it's more

77
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:59,679

83
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,360
called melodic death metal enhancing and

84
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,629

126
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:28,779
hangzhou china okay okay so I built this

127
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:30,850
little demo aware you have to keep

128
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,170
moving the mouse and the more you move

129
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,360
the mouse the more changes the color but

130
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,650
if you stop moving the mouse you don't

131
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,220
touch it it kind of fades out to grey I

132
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,430
stole one of the open source games a

133
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:47,830
example of the impact jes engine this

134
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,180
actually has never failed in the office

135
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,279
it must be the I don't know max anyway

136
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,750
you say okay Photoshop things they

137
00:10:52,750 --> 00:11:04,950
enhance enhance enhance enhance enhance

138
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,590
okay that is the applause of pity but I

139
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,590
will take it I only need a tow for a

140
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,540
message to me are no message at ha so

141
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,260
one messaging one message out if there

142
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,840
are two players in the area how many

143
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,660
message are needed to notify myself and

144
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,180
a notify to another player so to

145
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,370
messaging for message up that feel okay

146
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,340
and the character is always running and

147
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:37,580
it jumps when you scream so let's try oh

148
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,620
yeah alright so this is I'm showing off

149
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,260
the blur um this is something I'm gonna

150
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,940
try this is not going to work so I have

151
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,250
a blur plug-in which I just got working

152
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,430
there about Donna playoffs in one area

153
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:55,370
how many messages Amelia holy no

154
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:11,900
protest can hold this online udaas try

155
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,720
this this is not gonna work hang on but

156
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,020
let's see let's see enhance

157
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:47,750
enhance enhance enhance okay um so so

158
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,700
this is it see you notice the blur

159
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,200
Hannah Nate's which is really cool we

160
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,450
use the scaling of transform node I

161
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,020
won't apologize to Andy so Andy you guys

162
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,400
are all here but for the video I

163
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,260
couldn't get this to work yesterday the

164
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,480
trick Andy is to get it to respond to

165
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:23,670
any words you say so try that next time

166
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:31,460
okay enough you get the idea it's creepy

167
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,000
it's haunted right so if you smack it

168
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,540
like like an old TV he respond i will

169
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,700
just want to reflect a little bit this

170
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,820
was like the first Josh conf in Asia and

171
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,160
the second Jays conference after Jess

172
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,630
camp last year yeah so get like a little

173
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:57,280
subtle head movement from Emma there um

174
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,970
how creepy is that you look this up

175
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:08,300
actually i pre-ordered 450 + what he is

176
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:14,450
saying + 280 more that's a lot of coffee

177
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,640
i actually i was i was thinking that if

178
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,140
I I didn't have time but I wanted to

179
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,820
wire this up to the Web Audio API with a

180
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,170
beat detector and have her doing like

181
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,360
you know

182
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,670
so next year next year and my head

183
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:33,060
