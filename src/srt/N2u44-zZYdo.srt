1
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,010

so this talks about JavaScript and I

2
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,539
want to talk about JavaScript eventually

3
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:24,400
but first I would like to talk about

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,320
English and not English as we know it

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,579
but old English it would be

6
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:32,410
unrecognizable to you or me in written

7
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,300
form or in spoken form but it came from

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,970
the same language family as Dutch and

9
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,059
German and Icelandic and if things had

10
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:41,440
gone differently modern English would

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,960
would resemble those languages much more

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,839
closely but in the 11th century William

13
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:48,220
the second decided he wanted to be king

14
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,079
of England so he gathered an army in

15
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,390
Normandy and he evaded he invaded the

16
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,430
country across the channel and he won

17
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,290
and many of those who had fought in his

18
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,690
army were rewarded with land and power

19
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,280
and they became the new ruling class in

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,769
England and they brought with them a

21
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:05,019
dialect of old French that had a lasting

22
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,540
influence on English vocabulary as Old

23
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,010
English evolved into Middle English

24
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,070
large numbers of French loanwords found

25
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,030
their way into the language and over the

26
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,710
next few centuries as Middle English

27
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,299
became modern English the language

28
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:22,119
borrowed more and more words mainly from

29
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:25,210
classical sources the translation of

30
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,550
theological texts from Latin reveals

31
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,650
gaps in English vocabulary and the

32
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,170
simplest solution was to adopt the Latin

33
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,080
word into English but there were people

34
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,150
who decried what they saw as a

35
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,850
bastardization of the English tongue and

36
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,710
it they call these new words in corn

37
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,590
terms and in corn being a kind of

38
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,100
inkwell and so you know a marker of a

39
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,250
snobbish writer and instead of using

40
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,659
these borrowed words they would try to

41
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:56,050
resurrect archaic words from English

42
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,700
that had fallen out of favor or they

43
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,140
would try to invent new words from

44
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,170
dramatic roots but these words usually

45
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,770
didn't catch on a classical scholar

46
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,960
named John cheek was one of the most

47
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,989
vocal critics of in corn terms and

48
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,220
because he's speaking in metaphor here

49
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,870
it's not entirely clear to me what he

50
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,849
thinks will actually happen if the worst

51
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:21,040
case comes to pass but nearly 500 years

52
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,739
later we can see that English has not

53
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:26,620
declared bankruptcy by any means and the

54
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,969
way I know this is that cheek is running

55
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:30,069
in early modern English yet we can all

56
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:31,069
read

57
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,780
understand his words with very little

58
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,790
difficulty say for the creative spelling

59
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,680
but even at the time the purists were in

60
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,260
the minority George petty sums up the

61
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,639
rebuttal here he says that the purists

62
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,340
apply the label in corn term

63
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,769
inconsistently and only for the words

64
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:54,590
that they don't like he says that half

65
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,819
the words in English are borrowed from

66
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:58,909
somewhere and only the new borrowings

67
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:01,069
get scrutinized because their novelty

68
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:04,250
makes them seem strange he says that

69
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,230
borrowing is healthy for a language but

70
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,700
more than that it's unavoidable it's

71
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,769
something that all languages do I know

72
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:11,719
not how we should speak anything without

73
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:15,879
blacking our mouths with ink so

74
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:18,590
linguistic purism lost the battle for

75
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,510
English and we now know that their

76
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,150
worries were largely overblown but for

77
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,620
funs sake there are some small corners

78
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,909
of the english-speaking world who

79
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:29,290
practice what's called anglish which is

80
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,819
English with as few borrowed words as

81
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:33,230
possible remaining true to its

82
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,229
anglo-saxon roots it's like an

83
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:37,849
alternative history sort of linguistics

84
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:39,199
what if the Normans hadn't conquered

85
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,790
England what might our language sound

86
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,489
like there's a wiki for english of

87
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,079
course and it's called the english much

88
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,939
a mutt being an old word for a

89
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:49,009
discussion and the word they've decided

90
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:51,739
to use to replace wiki being of hawaiian

91
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:54,229
origin and so we can go there to learn

92
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:56,090
some things about our own country in

93
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,560
english the united states of america

94
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,209
would be the Bandit folk domes of a

95
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:02,959
Marik's land and you could learn that

96
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,449
the BFA emerged from 13 British

97
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:07,759
Cycling's who drafted at acknowledged

98
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,840
hood of self dhum in 1776 you learn that

99
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,250
the leader of America's land is for

100
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,109
stood a Barack Obama of the folk Reich

101
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:19,729
mutt band which is way cooler sending

102
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:22,280
than democratic party for citizens like

103
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,050
he should be like like on a horse or

104
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,389
something but like do you see how

105
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:29,199
ridiculous this gets and how quickly

106
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,360
many years ago we have lexical purists

107
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,210
in English and they lost they lost in

108
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,219
part because they were warning of a

109
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:39,919
vague nonspecific doom that would come

110
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:40,460
from

111
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,470
from these evil new words but the only

112
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,880
thing that offended them about the words

113
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,520
was the alien origin they weren't

114
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,500
arguing that the words were unclear or

115
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,389
that they couldn't be used well they

116
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:52,009
didn't like the new words because they

117
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:55,520
were new so now I'd like to talk about

118
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,000
French French is different obviously it

119
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,690
dates back to Julius Caesar's conquest

120
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,819
of Gaul and the first century BC so it's

121
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:07,340
derived mainly from Latin but along the

122
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,550
way French took a different path in 1634

123
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,199
Cardinal Richelieu created a body calm

124
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,139
academie francaise dedicated to the the

125
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:17,560
purification and preservation of French

126
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,870
whereas England had largely ignored John

127
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,550
cheek and the other doomsayers there was

128
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,470
one hugely influential Frenchman who

129
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,440
declared that it was worth it to protect

130
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,940
his language from the influence of other

131
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,490
languages the Academy still exists today

132
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,169
the French government declares the

133
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:34,400
official authority on the French

134
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,909
language there's no equivalent body for

135
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:40,310
English there are people who release

136
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,870
dictionaries and people who read grammar

137
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,389
books but no one who claims to be an

138
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:46,340
authority for all the English spoken and

139
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,139
written throughout the world there are

140
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,659
40 seats in the Academy and members hold

141
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,400
their seat until they die or step down

142
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,830
at which time the other members vote on

143
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,530
a replacement they have uniforms you are

144
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,509
looking at the ceremonial uniform of the

145
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:00,860
members of the Academy you can see they

146
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,159
take this very seriously and they

147
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:05,930
publish the official dictionary of the

148
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,659
French language and they have another

149
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,280
function that opens them up to ridicule

150
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,590
they try to prevent the adoption of

151
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,380
loanwords English language culture is

152
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,139
worldwide and our words worm their way

153
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:20,030
into other languages just as Latin words

154
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,820
once worms their way into ours and the

155
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,919
Academy tries to keep french harmonious

156
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:27,500
by providing French derived equivalents

157
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,570
to English loanwords this isn't much

158
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,880
different from the efforts of English as

159
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,550
linguistic purists except that in French

160
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,719
these efforts are blessed by the

161
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:38,090
government but the Academy lacks any

162
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,370
sort of enforcement mechanism even

163
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,259
within the government so in practice

164
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:44,539
many of these recommendations are

165
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:48,229
ignored by French speakers in January

166
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:50,360
friends Frances general Commission of

167
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,280
terminology and neologisms and

168
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,980
that use of the word hashtag is

169
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,020
discouraged among francophones and the

170
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,760
preferred term is mo diez which

171
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,639
literally means sharp word as in the

172
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,960
sharp symbol from musical notation I'm

173
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,250
going to try to make all of this

174
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,169
relevant to where we are today with our

175
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:13,470
with our own language I've not yet

176
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,830
decided which of these models is better

177
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,560
for describing how programming languages

178
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,940
evolve on one hand they have to be

179
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,010
understood by machines and the best way

180
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,419
to make sure all machines understand a

181
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:28,740
language the same way is to be very

182
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,540
specific about how the language is

183
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,520
designed so we need a top-down approach

184
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,919
we need a standards body on the other

185
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,070
hand standards bodies don't typically

186
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,190
try to specify style our coding styles

187
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,770
aren't shaped by the egg no script spec

188
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,620
their shapes by the code we've read out

189
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,840
there in the real world code patterns

190
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,470
are folk driven solutions to common

191
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,470
problems so we also need a robust

192
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,390
community in which people are writing

193
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,760
their own code and reading the code of

194
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,229
others after years of minimal change

195
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:08,220
javascript is evolving es5 intentionally

196
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,300
did not introduce new syntax so es6 is

197
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,910
the first time in over a decade that

198
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,430
javascript is poised to adopt new syntax

199
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,850
this is going to feel weird it must feel

200
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,250
weird because new syntax has to be

201
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,850
declared from on high some of the new

202
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,490
features are controversial and some of

203
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,800
them are not and as far as I can tell

204
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,080
nearly all the on controversial things

205
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,360
are the ones that add new features Maps

206
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,120
week max week Maps proxies and so on and

207
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,310
in browsers now we've got typed arrays

208
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,360
in support of WebGL and the other API is

209
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,520
the lettuce manipulate binary data and

210
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,610
the concept of a typed array is quite

211
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,530
foreign to how JavaScript usually works

212
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,750
but I've never seen art anyone argue

213
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,030
that typed arrays shouldn't be in Java

214
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,790
scripts because they were necessary to

215
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,310
do the things we want it to do whereas

216
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,720
to me most of the controversial

217
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,069
are the things that merely restate we

218
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:14,490
can already do some of the new syntax is

219
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,170
trying to replace patterns that

220
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,329
individual JavaScript errs have come up

221
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:21,870
with the existing patterns are bit

222
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,089
clumsy and they don't look quite as nice

223
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:26,250
but we invented them ourselves and so it

224
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,639
feels strange to have something come out

225
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,740
to replace all that work it feels like

226
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,660
l'académie française is telling us not

227
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,459
to use the words that we came up with

228
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:41,670
ourselves so the best example might be

229
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,259
the proposal for what's called maximally

230
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:48,389
minimal classes they're called maxim

231
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:49,769
only minimal because the prote the

232
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:52,860
proposed syntax is a very tiny evolution

233
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,870
over how people make classes in existing

234
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,029
JavaScript you can see the existing

235
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,560
syntax on the left and the proposed

236
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,560
syntax on the right they are

237
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,420
functionally equivalent no new features

238
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,629
are introduced there's no confusing new

239
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:08,819
semantics there's no gotchas this is

240
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:11,389
shortcut syntax it doesn't replace

241
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:13,620
prototypal inheritance it's just a

242
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,899
restatement of prototypical heritance

243
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,430
under under the hood it's nothing but

244
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:22,230
prototypes in theory this is about as

245
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,779
unthreatening as new syntax is going to

246
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,809
get it there are a couple new keywords

247
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:29,129
that are introduced but they're words

248
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,740
that were reserved by JavaScript years

249
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,379
ago and if we don't use them they're

250
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:36,959
just going to go to waste and the door

251
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,870
is open for the syntax to be extended in

252
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,509
the future right now there's no built-in

253
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,519
when you do class methods but a future

254
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,170
version of Eggman script could introduce

255
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,230
class methods through new syntax without

256
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:54,000
breaking backward compatibility but I

257
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,939
hear rebuttals there are there are a

258
00:10:56,939 --> 00:10:58,290
number of reasons that you can be

259
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,170
against the the classes proposal but the

260
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,269
one that I read the most is the one that

261
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:07,199
makes the least sense to me class-based

262
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,240
inheritance is a javascript pattern that

263
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,629
has existed for years it's a subset of

264
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:14,250
prototypical inheritance and I know that

265
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,110
because we've been using prototypical

266
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,480
inheritance to emulate class-based

267
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,430
inheritance the strawman used

268
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,760
3gs is the example but you can look at a

269
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,600
backbone or jQuery UI or a half dozen

270
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,950
frameworks that everyone in this room

271
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,120
has used and we can talk about whether

272
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,730
it's a good pattern on the merits but it

273
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,560
drives me nuts when I see simplistic

274
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,450
opposition based on one person's

275
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,430
subjective idea of what javascript is

276
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:49,020
and isn't and even if you think ja that

277
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,630
classes aren't real JavaScript opposing

278
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,250
this syntax isn't going to make them go

279
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,250
away they already exist in half of your

280
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,630
favorite libraries the most common

281
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,190
rebuttal i see is from people who can't

282
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,370
disentangle the idea of classes from

283
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,890
java they see the word class and they

284
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:11,310
get shell shocked and flash back to some

285
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,050
horrible internship where they had to

286
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,060
spend all day in eclipse writing getter

287
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:20,700
and setter methods so yeah this is the

288
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,830
thing I was clearly working up to this

289
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:26,370
is but this isn't just about classes but

290
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,959
classes are the best example if you say

291
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,060
classes will turn javascript into Java

292
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,150
you're a modern-day jean chic you're

293
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,860
attacking the new words because they

294
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,420
come from a different language that you

295
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,720
don't like javascript is not java and it

296
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,900
won't turn into java just because we add

297
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,810
syntax for the classes that people are

298
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,450
already writing the status quo of

299
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,730
javascript the language that the purists

300
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,370
are trying to protect is a language that

301
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,830
has already borrowed half of its syntax

302
00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:01,170
from java and a handful of jobs features

303
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,040
and that's how it'll continue to work

304
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,300
default parameters are coming they

305
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,589
already exist in a bunch of other

306
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:10,110
languages array comprehensions and

307
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,850
generators are coming over from python

308
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,670
es6 is not going is not inventing new

309
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,790
things out of thin air it's taking

310
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,720
things that have worked in other

311
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,060
languages and applying them to our own

312
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,220
we are going to black our mouths with

313
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:28,560
ink no matter what we do so here's the

314
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,310
problem introducing new syntax to

315
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,120
javascript is going to be hard for the

316
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,470
same reason that l'académie française

317
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,420
has trouble getting people to use their

318
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,930
words we're going to have new syntax for

319
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,120
classes and modules but in our world in

320
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,670
our world we already have several

321
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,350
different ways of doing classical

322
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,580
inheritance and several different ways

323
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,180
of modular writing code and it reminds

324
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,770
me of something else that's happening in

325
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,540
English when you want to refer to some

326
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,120
person who is hypothetical or whose

327
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,620
gender you don't know you've got a few

328
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,920
options older grammar books will tell

329
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,490
you that the third person singular

330
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:09,700
masculine can be used to refer to a

331
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,100
person of indeterminate gender but this

332
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,880
is this is falling out of favor it can

333
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,220
be semantically awkward and there are

334
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,570
people who think it perpetuates thinking

335
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,550
of men as the default and women is a

336
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,880
special case so some people have taken

337
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,580
it upon themselves to invent a new

338
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,750
gender-neutral pronoun for English a

339
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,710
mathematician named Michael Spivak

340
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,990
popularized the idea of taking the third

341
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,839
person plural them they and their and

342
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,750
dropping the th to turn each one into a

343
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,670
gender-neutral singular which is pretty

344
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,070
simple and arguably pretty elegant but

345
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,850
the practice is not caught on instead

346
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,810
what's caught on is too is either to say

347
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,300
he or she in each instance or more

348
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,620
commonly to use what's called the

349
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,610
singular vay to read to repurpose third

350
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:07,440
person plural as third person singular

351
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,120
it's not hard to argue that singular vay

352
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,120
is not the most well-designed solution

353
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,650
but that's the thing it didn't win

354
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,330
because it was elegant it won because

355
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,400
it's the solution that is most familiar

356
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,980
to English speakers and because it

357
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,330
doesn't require the teaching of an

358
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,730
entirely new word the singular of a

359
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,470
usage was able to spread organically

360
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,040
through popular use and to bring us back

361
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,490
to JavaScript I think we overlook that

362
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,810
that even though javascript is written

363
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,470
for machines to understand every line of

364
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,120
JavaScript that's written adds to a

365
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,730
giant corpus of code that other people

366
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,560
can read you probably learned English

367
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,410
from a grammar

368
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,240
look or a textbook but you became an

369
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,569
expert at English through reading books

370
00:15:50,569 --> 00:15:52,519
and watching movies and talking to

371
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:56,269
people around you in English likewise

372
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:57,649
you may have learned how to code from a

373
00:15:57,649 --> 00:15:59,269
book but you develop your coding skills

374
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:03,360
by reading the code of those around you

375
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,750
if I were trying to introduce a new word

376
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,660
into English I would try to convince a

377
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,699
high-profile source to start using it I

378
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:13,579
would get it into dictionaries I would

379
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:16,519
make it part of Associated Press style

380
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:18,529
I'd get a major news outlets used

381
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:22,129
regularly time at Time magazine spent

382
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:23,569
most of the 20th century trying to coin

383
00:16:23,569 --> 00:16:26,540
new words of their own and stay they had

384
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,009
more misses than hits but they're

385
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:29,779
credited with inventing words like

386
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:33,410
socialite and intellivision list so it

387
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,720
helps to have major firepower behind new

388
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,699
words but it's no guarantee that they'll

389
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:42,199
catch on ideally people realize that the

390
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:44,540
new word represents something that

391
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,670
deserves to have a name and they start

392
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,319
to use it before they have time to come

393
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:50,180
up with something else but that's a lot

394
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,439
of maybes and if it doesn't quite work

395
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:54,139
out then you end up looking like an

396
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:59,149
idiot you know using this new word that

397
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:00,829
even been that no one understands what

398
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:04,610
it means so if the people in this room

399
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:08,059
wields any influence and I think they do

400
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:10,220
then we're going to be an important part

401
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,179
of what happens when es6 is final if you

402
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:15,319
don't like some of the new stuff that's

403
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,829
fine you can pretend it doesn't exist

404
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,240
you're not obligated to do anything but

405
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,309
if you like the new class syntax or the

406
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:25,459
new module syntax or destructuring or

407
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:27,169
block scope or whatever then you can do

408
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:29,110
some simple things to help them along

409
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:33,320
you can write documentation mdn is

410
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,400
probably going to have this covered but

411
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,600
it's not just the reference

412
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,270
documentation its blog posts it's stack

413
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,780
overflow tutorials code recipes anything

414
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,700
like that no matter how trivial e no

415
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,260
matter how trivial you think it is

416
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,630
because a lot of this will be brand new

417
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,480
to a lot of developers and they're going

418
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,580
to google it and there should be content

419
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,780
there

420
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,360
if you're in an environment that will

421
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,550
get new syntax quickly like node then

422
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:03,800
you don't have much of an excuse not to

423
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,050
to be the syntactic change that you want

424
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,960
to see if you write for the browser it's

425
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,450
not as easy but once es6 is finalized i

426
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,400
hope we can come together around a

427
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,790
canonical transpiler that will that will

428
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,220
let us all right es 6 or some reasonable

429
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,410
subset of es6 and get it transpired over

430
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,250
to es 3 for environments that need it

431
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,630
and hopefully this will be in a near

432
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,700
future when all browsers support source

433
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,260
maps so that we can do it as painlessly

434
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,740
as possible but here's the most

435
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,650
important part be a therapist people

436
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:44,340
fear change we hang around and we talk

437
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,900
about this stuff at conferences and on

438
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,040
mailing lists on Twitter and it's old

439
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,440
stuff to us but when it's unveiled to

440
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,330
the rest of the world there's going to

441
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,580
be a backlash too many people it's going

442
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,800
to seem jarring and strange here they

443
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,390
just learn JavaScript a couple years ago

444
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,550
and right as they thought they were

445
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,690
getting the hang of it there's this new

446
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,280
scary thing that reminds them of the

447
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,620
Java world they left behind I want you

448
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,260
to hug them tightly and whisper it's not

449
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:14,940
your fault over and over again tell them

450
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,010
it's going to be okay tell them they

451
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:22,320
don't have to be scared by new modest

452
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,690
and optional enhancements it's still

453
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,520
going to look and feel like JavaScript

454
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,280
and the next time that you worry about

455
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,050
where javascript is going remember that

456
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,420
500 years later we can still read the

457
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,070
words of John cheek the language you

458
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,370
love is not going anywhere and I think I

459
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:44,610
came in just under time so that's all

460
00:19:44,610 --> 00:20:00,000
for me
