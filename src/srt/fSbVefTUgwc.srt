1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,859

all right wait I think you get muted

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:08,189
wait yeah okay cool we can talk now yeah

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:09,929
and there's both of us and this is

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:11,460
totally not going to feedback or be

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,250
weird at all no yeah I'm gonna yeah I'm

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,780
gonna pretend I don't like you very much

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,199
okay stand over here yeah I'll just move

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,060
over here okay all right hi everybody

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,920
hey so our talk is called monkey patch

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,640
the planet but before we get to that we

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,070
wanted to talk about us a little bit so

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,579
this is an actual picture of forest ania

13
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:38,700
my name is actually Brian fjord it's

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,540
often misunderstood is Brian forward but

15
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,480
and I'm Forrest Norville okay that's the

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,280
best joke we have so let's talk about

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,110
what monkey patching is really briefly

18
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,579
will be coming back to this throughout

19
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,120
the talk so this is just kind of a

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,910
high-level overview it's really easy to

21
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,379
say that monkey patching is like

22
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,000
replacing a function on an existing

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,559
object or something but really that's

24
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,180
not what monkey patching is actually

25
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,310
about what Mike has a lifestyle yeah

26
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,369
it's a lifestyle it's a philosophy it's

27
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:12,990
a religion we get into that more later

28
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,070
on it's to alter the baseline behavior

29
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,159
of your system at runtime in a way that

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,020
is invisible to the code that is running

31
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,140
within it so it's a way of augmenting or

32
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,759
replacing or enhancing existing behavior

33
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,970
transparently very good okay so why why

34
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,549
would you use it oh this is cool so

35
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,920
we're like slightly cut off here plus

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,659
right we can just talk about this stuff

37
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,450
yeah so let's say you have an appt an

38
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,640
asset you hand it off to one of your

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,490
interns to write not that anybody here

40
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,280
did that and it's got a whole bunch of

41
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,899
windows alert calls in that you have to

42
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,759
like keep space barring through write

43
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,310
CSS is hard oh yeah I think that's what

44
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,380
the talks were about yesterday yeah yeah

45
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,060
so rather than do a modal you can just

46
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,030
do this yeah so you want to you want to

47
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,399
get rid of that so you can try to do is

48
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:06,899
or what you want to do is make it so

49
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,340
that it sends that to the console output

50
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,350
instead all right

51
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,020
so you want it to be like I said you

52
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,300
want to use wah console that woke him up

53
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,740
that work yeah it's close enough

54
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,630
whatever but you're gonna for the

55
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,920
coolest life later you're gonna me to go

56
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,990
full screening yeah all right I'll do

57
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,910
that oh and we should hide this thing or

58
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,970
like make it a little small computers

59
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,500
are hired okay keep talking keeps all

60
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,640
right well it's your turn to talk now

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,680
okay we're on to the next slide is that

62
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,870
how this works yeah okay all right so

63
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,760
one of your options for removing window

64
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,640
dot alert is to use this thing said so

65
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,530
you can just replace all of the things

66
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,360
in here right problem solved right first

67
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,040
well not so much hi cuz you know you

68
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,440
might end up replacing a bunch of stuff

69
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,330
that you didn't want to replace because

70
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,610
you might end up just like you know when

71
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,750
you do a global search and replace you

72
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,190
do a global search and replace maybe you

73
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,930
actually wanted that to still say that

74
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,330
it was still window alert even though

75
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,310
you're using console dot log so how

76
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,220
would you deal with that Brian well we

77
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,500
can use this cool module called falafel

78
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,950
that builds up in AST and like parses

79
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,840
the javascript so we know that this is

80
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,360
not a string window alert this is like

81
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,220
legit windowed on alert and you'll note

82
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,900
you have to you have to take care when

83
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,420
you're doing this and these are all

84
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,760
highly endorsed will never get you in

85
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,280
trouble methods for making sure that

86
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,480
you're running the right thing to make

87
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,610
sure that you only call your monkey

88
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,820
patch method when it's appropriate right

89
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,260
so it's still not that great though

90
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,810
because let's say you wrote code like

91
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,810
this because you're smart and you want

92
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,820
to access alert in the smart better way

93
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,860
dynamic languages are very dynamic yeah

94
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,870
so you can call things in all sorts of

95
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,320
ways so that won't work but what if we

96
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,900
were like super smart and used a JSP are

97
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,460
sir even more so we wrote a code

98
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,010
transform that took input like that and

99
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,800
maybe did output like this so like on

100
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,930
every function call we make sure that

101
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,810
the thing that we're not calling is

102
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,120
window dot alert right so this is

103
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,950
actually basically the same code it's

104
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,870
super simple alright just drop that in

105
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,270
your app and no more window alerts no

106
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,730
big deal I sweet there's one small

107
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:23,470
problem with that though you've actually

108
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,350
managed to

109
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,170
completely complicate your build process

110
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,370
because you have to do this source to

111
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,040
source transform you like if you want to

112
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,600
be able to debug this in the browser

113
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,220
because you can't do this at all no

114
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,390
really you're going to need to generate

115
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,620
source maps which is yet another

116
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,510
complication for your build process and

117
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,280
we have literally duplicated the number

118
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,690
of function calls that you're doing so

119
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,790
we've taken something that was probably

120
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,560
reasonably perform it and we've made it

121
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,940
while performance isn't really an issue

122
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,500
in node ever so that's not right you

123
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,630
like by Morgan Peter's right its web

124
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,120
scale yeah it's not horizontally no

125
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,150
problem two desktops you're set oh yeah

126
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,250
there's also this other problem which is

127
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,350
that you know you might end up breaking

128
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,660
everybody else's code and so either you

129
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,310
have to like maintain your own Fork of

130
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,350
the stuff that has your like preciously

131
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,950
built arc is newly created like

132
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,020
transformed version but or you might

133
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,460
want to lose through some sort of

134
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,380
dynamic process where it goes and it

135
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,550
monkey patches your code at runtime

136
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,020
Bryce wouldn't know anything about that

137
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,750
and like there's nothing that can go

138
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,430
wrong with that and there are no like

139
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,530
performance implications that always on

140
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,300
the forest you didn't it okay what will

141
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,310
I said you're selling them on it this is

142
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,260
yeah yeah this is great okay everyone

143
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,770
looks convinced okay so like a better

144
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,990
solution maybe would be just to do this

145
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,210
like window dot alert equals console dot

146
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,680
log fine call this is monkey patching

147
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,070
classic here right so done deal like no

148
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,800
more alerts in your app and kind of as

149
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,200
an added bonus monkey patching is really

150
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,570
funny and just like imagine the look on

151
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,370
the next person who has to maintain this

152
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,160
code space when they see what you did

153
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,050
yeah that's the thing about monkey

154
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,729
patching right it makes people kind of

155
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:06,040
mad and that's kind of awesome so like

156
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,690
that's a good reason to use it right

157
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,650
there all right cool so that's great but

158
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,110
what if we add some cool jQuery widget

159
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,000
onto our page that for some reason needs

160
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
window dot alert for god knows why he

161
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,770
used it to block maybe I don't know it's

162
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,960
a control flow techniques right so we we

163
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,850
want to maybe just monkey patch a

164
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,260
specific part of our app so some

165
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,710
specific context so what you might do is

166
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,760
grab a reference to endure that alert

167
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,740
replace it with console that log do your

168
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,500
thing and

169
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,390
and on replace it right yeah so that's

170
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,220
cool and maybe you want to write a cool

171
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,780
helper like this because we're

172
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,690
functional programmers and take the

173
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,460
function returns a function yeah so this

174
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,020
is another kind of classic monkey

175
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,240
patching thing that you might do like

176
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,650
function not apply and functional

177
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,320
collaery best friends and you can just

178
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,580
kind of sneak additional behavior in

179
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,000
there yeah that's great there's nothing

180
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,720
wrong about oh god async behavior so you

181
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,330
run this code here and it's going to

182
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,280
totally run without your monkey patching

183
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,970
because you did something asynchronous

184
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,200
right if only there was some way to fix

185
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,190
this behavior oh but wait there is you

186
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,840
just among needs a monkey patch that

187
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,530
timeout problem solved see you got the

188
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,690
same we basically do the same thing we

189
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,130
did before only we apply this to

190
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,860
window.settimeout now so now you've got

191
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,750
your patch run your original function

192
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,660
and then unpatch it sweet right also no

193
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,100
only done note the use of the comma

194
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,540
operator in this code sample that's

195
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,650
because I wrote this slide okay but what

196
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,570
about set interval like our app doesn't

197
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,120
do just that one async thing sure monkey

198
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,490
patch that interval keep going all right

199
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,740
cool but like there are other AP eyes to

200
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,590
what about those monkey patch everything

201
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,710
just monkey patch the entire universe

202
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,860
really is that okay yeah that's totally

203
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:07,070
okay ok cool so actually this is what

204
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,660
for us and I have each independently

205
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,280
done in different contexts I wrote this

206
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,350
thing called zone jas which gives you an

207
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,270
API that looks like this that says

208
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,580
monkey patch everything all the time and

209
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,860
unlucky patch it outside of this context

210
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,890
so you could accomplish the same as we

211
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,630
were showing in the previous slides with

212
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,740
a little code snippet that looks like

213
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,870
this and you didn't even have to monkey

214
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,940
patch literally every single a sync API

215
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,400
in the browser so that's a little bit

216
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,390
less work than it would have been

217
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,050
otherwise so I've spent a lot of time

218
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,630
talking about continuation local storage

219
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,580
for the last year or so and I've also

220
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,870
spent a decent amount of time talking

221
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,460
about a sink listener which is what

222
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,830
happens under the hood the cool thing

223
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,990
about this is i talked about how great

224
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,450
these things are and

225
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,640
nobody ever really digs deeply enough to

226
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,800
see and how incredibly grotesque it all

227
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,100
is under the hood yep this is this is a

228
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,560
good test part yes all that stuff's

229
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,730
already happened by the time you get

230
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,800
here and you could have set that session

231
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,560
anywhere and it scoped this particular

232
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,300
continuation change so for each

233
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,610
individual requests that you have coming

234
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,650
in we'd added this behavior the

235
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,750
interesting thing about this is that the

236
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,880
consequences are not nearly as dire as

237
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,340
you might think they are like depending

238
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,190
on what's going on you may see about 0.5

239
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,220
percent to about well okay like in

240
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,720
pathological conditions it's like

241
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,120
ninety-five percent overhead and like

242
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,840
the memory overhead is like 18 times as

243
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,950
much and that's all gross but that

244
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,060
actually doesn't happen because that's

245
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,920
not in code that people actually right

246
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,260
that's purely micro benchmark code so

247
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,970
that's your pathological case so you get

248
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,220
all this interesting async behavior that

249
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,230
is done by basically overriding

250
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,690
literally every acing function in note

251
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,970
right and you only have to buy 18 more

252
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,310
computers to do it yeah and to the best

253
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,750
of my knowledge this I'll just work

254
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:57,190
in I ojs as well so that's great that's

255
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,280
cool okay so you know yeah so this is

256
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,200
the key this is the Cardinal law this

257
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,330
stuff is super fun everybody should do

258
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,220
it in all of your libraries from out on

259
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,710
its aaron here wait he's around here

260
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,540
somewhere yeah you should totally get

261
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,340
more of this into happy going for it you

262
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,810
can totally solve all your domains

263
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,610
problems just by monkey patching the

264
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,210
 out everything but don't break

265
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,460
out everything but don't break
things for other people and the thing

266
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,890
about this is that i have done this

267
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,170
there are literally thousands of

268
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,570
production sites running an entirely

269
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,160
monkey patched environment because

270
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,630
that's how the New Relic monitoring

271
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,650
agent works but you and almost nothing

272
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,390
has gone wrong but when it has gone

273
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,250
wrong it has been bad because somebody

274
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,720
else has monkey patched something that I

275
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,150
need the monkey patch in an incompatible

276
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,920
way and everything blows up and you

277
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,210
can't use those things together and

278
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,280
everybody is sad and it's just you know

279
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,960
do I great for a sad is the short

280
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,150
version no don't that's that's that's

281
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,390
bad okay so here's kind of a rundown

282
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,190
yeah a little bit of this earlier but

283
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,080
you should probably call the original

284
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,880
function that's important because if

285
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,950
some other monkey patch person

286
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,510
in there and must render the internals

287
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,000
of your environment you want to be able

288
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,350
to apply their behavior as well

289
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,700
otherwise you might not clean things up

290
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,710
correctly you should keep the original

291
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,020
context so the value of this you want it

292
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,340
to be the same as if someone called the

293
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,920
original function you should pass in all

294
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,020
the arguments not just you know whatever

295
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,420
the function signature looks like very

296
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,070
important bunch of signatures change

297
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,930
yeah you can't rely on anything

298
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,180
JavaScript that's a feature and

299
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,950
especially because certain platforms

300
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,620
like issuing new major versions about

301
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,620
once every I don't knows how many how

302
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,650
long that's responsible like seven to

303
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,740
ten hours day is that do we know anyone

304
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,320
that works there and maybe I don't know

305
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,990
okay so yeah and then you should return

306
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,490
something that looks like the original

307
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,220
return value you should prefer modifying

308
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,900
the return value to like making a

309
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,490
totally new object because again some

310
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,750
crazy person might have gone in there

311
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,690
and magic properties but the kind of

312
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,600
like brain about all this stuff is

313
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,100
that when you are monkey patching things

314
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,600
you should be assuming that everybody

315
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,550
else's monkey patching things at the

316
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,220
same time it's like it's the whole the

317
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,610
Hippocratic oath first do no harm we all

318
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,930
said something in there about like

319
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,600
Smokey Bear and oh the doubts earlier

320
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,940
about yeah better than yeah that was any

321
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,620
whatever was anyone a Cub Scout like

322
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,060
isn't there a thing where like you know

323
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,350
you're supposed to clean up afterwards

324
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,090
and they have a nice concise saying yeah

325
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,560
all i can remembers will be loyal scouts

326
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,050
yeah and then don't start forest fires

327
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,970
yeah i thought that was thought good to

328
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,770
you I like always be prepared but I

329
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,060
think that's the communist youth

330
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,640
tomorrow so whatever okay and the last

331
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,880
thing is you should test your code

332
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,860
because like that's a good way to deal

333
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,910
with hater so when people look at your

334
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,930
crazy thing and they're like there's no

335
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,520
way this will work you'd be like boy

336
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,260
have I got a surprise for you and you

337
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,330
show them your test cases and they're

338
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,550
all green and they're like well you know

339
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,910
you wrote crappy code but it works and

340
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,010
you should try and run your tests or

341
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,400
your your patch your monkey patch code

342
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,410
against lots of other people's code and

343
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,020
so I actually built something called the

344
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,700
intermediately sized Hadron Collider

345
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,070
that automatically does this for you so

346
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,960
the Large Hadron Collider is a particle

347
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,550
accelerator I'm not smart enough to make

348
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,620
that so I took the lesson dishes route

349
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,259
which is right a testing tool

350
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:18,959
but with what this does is like you give

351
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,119
it some patch and it'll run it against

352
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:23,549
like really commonly use libraries and

353
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:25,079
make sure that their test cases pass

354
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,809
even in a monkey patch environment so

355
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:29,339
you can have some level of confidence

356
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:31,499
that this works so it's kind of like a

357
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:34,109
like poor man's integration test from

358
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:35,939
reading monkey patch code so you can

359
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:39,929
check it out it's on github so kind of

360
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:41,459
in summary like right terrible code

361
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,649
prove that it works like laughs in the

362
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:48,159
face of your haters it's pretty good oh

363
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:51,199
and then yeah we have a slide on this

364
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,499
right for us this is your forte yeah you

365
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:59,279
know yeah welcome I'm not gonna dance

366
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,559
for you guys I'm really sorry it's not

367
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:04,410
really my thing but there's actually

368
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,939
actually I think we need to move on to

369
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:08,339
the next slide okay well i can say some

370
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:10,229
abstract philosophical things okay right

371
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:11,519
so like usually when you want to make

372
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,839
new behavior the way that you do it is

373
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,879
you like extend some existing class or

374
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:17,699
like write a new API but the cool thing

375
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:18,869
about this is that you don't have to

376
00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:21,149
touch any of the existing code like you

377
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:22,470
can just introduce new behavior all over

378
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,449
the place and that's kind of powerful

379
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:27,839
like you see for instance polyfills or

380
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,269
even prolly fills how many people here

381
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,669
know what a prolly filler is okay all

382
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:35,189
right okay yeah so ask your neighbor or

383
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:36,359
just listen to me because I'm gonna

384
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:39,569
explain right now the idea is like when

385
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:41,369
when you're trying to come up with a new

386
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:43,529
feature for JavaScript or for the

387
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:45,869
browser like you try and implement it in

388
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:47,850
JavaScript inside of the current

389
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,129
environment and then you can use this as

390
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:51,989
a way to try and you know figure out if

391
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:54,839
the API is good or not so there are lots

392
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:56,160
of examples of this and actually can

393
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,470
kind of think of zones or continuation

394
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,220
local storage is probably fills yeah the

395
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,179
kind of go back to what I was saying at

396
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:05,579
the beginning of the talk the cool thing

397
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:08,039
is you can extend the properties of your

398
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:11,339
platform for all the people using it

399
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:13,139
without actually forcing them to write

400
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:14,609
any additional code that's the real

401
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:17,519
power of monkey patching is that you can

402
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,439
add new capabilities remove existing

403
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:24,179
capabilities alter all kinds of crazy

404
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:26,159
stuff for a particular runtime

405
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,289
environment without requiring people to

406
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:30,120
actually opt into your API sore

407
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,220
even necessarily to learn anything like

408
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,500
the you know an example is that with the

409
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,450
new relic agent you just require this

410
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,950
thing you don't even need to assign that

411
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,200
to a variable and all of a sudden you've

412
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,580
got performance metrics coming out of

413
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,250
your appt you know in with in the case

414
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,230
of zones it's used by angular to handle

415
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,029
a lot of their their kind of magical

416
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:49,620
scoping and data binding behavior

417
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,540
someday someday it'll do that right now

418
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,150
it just sits up on github sweet someday

419
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,760
yeah wait there's one other cool thing I

420
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,760
was going to say what was it okay we're

421
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,070
going on the next time we rehearse this

422
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,710
a lot yeah well I mean we did yeah this

423
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,390
is kind of like that time one of my

424
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:09,660
favorite people in computers said time

425
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,890
monkey patches all things yes really I

426
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,380
don't know what that means yeah but

427
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,240
really we're all changing like we're all

428
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,950
interacting with each other as time

429
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,890
passes and we're all changing aspects of

430
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,110
each other as time passes in this this

431
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,210
very mysterious and hard to observe way

432
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,430
so really over time we're all being

433
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:35,070
monkey patched by each other right that

434
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,800
was really good thanks I want to point

435
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,529
out by absolute favorite thing about no

436
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:42,360
continuation local storage is its name

437
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,700
because its name is super concise and

438
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,380
easy to type every time I need to

439
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,180
install it yeah that's so the name of

440
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,830
this module is actually the inspiration

441
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,930
for the length of the name of the thing

442
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,520
that I talked about earlier then

443
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,560
immediately sized Hadron Collider see I

444
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,470
it's descriptive it doesn't necessarily

445
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:02,270
tell you what it does but it's long

446
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,500
right okay so

447
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,780
there's also some cool things on github

448
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,000
that show how you can use monkey

449
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,209
patching to crazyville things or crazy

450
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:20,839
good things yep and yeah good luck have
