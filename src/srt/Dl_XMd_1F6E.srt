[Music]

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,710
hi everyone Wow

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,190
thank you for having me III have to say

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,060
I'm not a I'm not a front-end developer

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,740
I've been switching back and forth

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,390
between front-end and back-end

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,630
currently I'm in my back-end face and

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:33,200
the presentation is not loading wait

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,739
turn Wi-Fi off there we go hopefully but

10
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,780
one thing I did notice both in Jing's

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,500
presentation and in Jason's is this did

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,500
everybody knows that they were both

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,129
showing us how responsive the things are

14
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,670
and I was thinking to myself oh wow and

15
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,250
they were like it this is simple true

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,449
but what if I change the CSS that that

17
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,580
that that's problematic because I have

18
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,409
to check it every time time and time

19
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,030
again hi I'm a guilty our testing is is

20
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,640
what is it's been my passion since about

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,939
2000 I'm a developer advocate and a

22
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,830
software developer mostly software

23
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,240
developer at applitools

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,070
and what we do is we specialize in

25
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,570
visual testing tools and I want to talk

26
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,009
about fear definitely fear and we'll

27
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,290
talk about fear of what in a sec but

28
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,110
first I want to talk about web

29
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,560
developers first let's start with the

30
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,350
back end developers back-end developers

31
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,020
have been there since before the web and

32
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,570
I'm a back-end developer right now they

33
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,909
use words like you know thread pools and

34
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,579
message queues and Scala's and you know

35
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,130
they're back there and without them come

36
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,560
on we wouldn't be able to do our front

37
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,110
end so round of applause there you go

38
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,250
what about front and front end is

39
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,340
divided front and let's talk about

40
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,110
front-end JavaScript with developers

41
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,270
they're wizards they deal with things

42
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,600
like JavaScript and angular and react

43
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,170
and state management and Dom and and all

44
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,330
that kind of stuff and they're really

45
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,610
wizards and the way they handled things

46
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,420
what about front-end CSS developers

47
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,390
fronting CSS developers are beautiful

48
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,420
that's for you come on a round of

49
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,320
applause for you

50
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,200
there we go not only are you all

51
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,840
beautiful you create beautiful things

52
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,170
using CSS and I'm constantly amazed by

53
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,510
these things and how you manage to work

54
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,880
with them so you deal with responsive

55
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,110
design media queries and flexbox

56
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,320
and something has wonderful is happening

57
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,090
in the web development world a really

58
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,209
wonderful thing and what is it

59
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:02,830
developers are starting to write tests

60
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,630
that test their own code this has been

61
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,230
true for something like five years or so

62
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,000
obviously a lot of people be testing

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,280
before that but it's become slightly

64
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,370
mainstream this night last five or seven

65
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,269
years but why why are developers writing

66
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:27,549
tests the word I use is a go programa

67
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:30,070
phobia anybody know what a go programa

68
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,980
phobia is probably not given that I've

69
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,070
just invented it it's fear of one's own

70
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:41,560
code okay it's and I'll explain that you

71
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,480
know the manager he says you know just

72
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,880
add that feature and and the way they

73
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,580
think about it is just you know adding

74
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,590
that Lego to the existing code and when

75
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,470
we're done the truth as we all know is

76
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,880
something like this that's fear the fear

77
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,560
of doing that kind of thing doesn't

78
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,750
always happen usually doesn't but when

79
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,989
it does out removing code we want to

80
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:07,650
refactor this is especially true in CSS

81
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,209
we think about it as just you know

82
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,900
removing that one single line or in CSS

83
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,640
just

84
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,980
need that rule that rule shouldn't be

85
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,260
there let's just take it out but we all

86
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,170
know what happens in the real world when

87
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:26,340
I take out that CSS somewhere some page

88
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:33,419
is gonna break yeah

89
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:36,360
refactoring I really want to refactor I

90
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,310
really want to refactor that JavaScript

91
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,940
but I'm afraid this will happen to me

92
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,120
and it doesn't matter whether our code

93
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,250
is a horribly written pile of spaghetti

94
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,210
or a wonderfully beautiful crafted set

95
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,500
of loosely coupled modules we really

96
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,680
fear our own code which we fear changing

97
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,040
it because changing code may mean

98
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,710
breaking the app and web developers as

99
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,500
all developers have have discovered that

100
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,160
developer testing or testing in short

101
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,640
removes the need for this manual testing

102
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,120
after code changes and developer testing

103
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,790
is writing code that tests your own code

104
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,340
as part of writing the code itself so

105
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,890
it's not QA automation engineers doing

106
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:29,370
that for you it is you doing that for

107
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,300
yourselves and testing abolish is that

108
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,080
fear it makes that fear mostly go away

109
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,050
because you code and then you write the

110
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,820
test for that code and it doesn't really

111
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,440
matter whether you're writing it before

112
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,300
you write the code TDD style or after I

113
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,000
don't read here and you know you run

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,100
those tests and they break and you fix

115
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,760
the pods etc and it works and once you

116
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,070
change your code you just run the tests

117
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,160
again and you're done testing abolishes

118
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,640
fear that is the most important thing

119
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,770
testing abolishing the fear of one's own

120
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,950
code who's writing tests who's

121
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,490
abolishing that fear

122
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,630
well back-end developers have been

123
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,890
writing tests for quite some time

124
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,220
they've had that methodology even before

125
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,919
the web the methodologies and tooling

126
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,960
are mostly established they've been

127
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,270
working on it for quite a while

128
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,310
front-end JavaScript developers well the

129
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,980
Weber's is young in terms of

130
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,170
methodologies it's not totally there yet

131
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,330
it's slightly confusing nobody really

132
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,940
knows exactly what it's but the tooling

133
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,430
is almost there it's happening it's

134
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,140
happening we've been happening for quite

135
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,860
some times a lot of mentors and teachers

136
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,380
can't see das just in serials Kevin Lamb

137
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,900
pain Gleb ajamu Tov Shai Resnick and

138
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,660
others hopefully including me we are

139
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,400
slowly building for JavaScript

140
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,680
developers a methodology based on unit

141
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,690
testing component and multi component

142
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,970
testing using JS DOM and things like

143
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,200
Cypress and selenium and webdriver IO

144
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:11,559
what about you you're sad

145
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:18,060
no tests for you you don't know and why

146
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,539
why is that well I'll explain a second

147
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:22,860
front let's talk about front-end

148
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,050
JavaScript tests they're functional

149
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,449
let's say I have a function you put an

150
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:29,430
input it does its thing you grab the

151
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,659
output you check that the output is

152
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,129
correct you're done you've written your

153
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:34,919
unit tests what about the you know UI

154
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,449
tests not a problem

155
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:37,979
you open the browser using also

156
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,379
automation tools you write you do the

157
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:41,759
click click clicks and the type type

158
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,550
types and then you check that this field

159
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,289
is the correct value in that field is

160
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:47,610
the correct value and this field is the

161
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,219
great value same stuff and that nothing

162
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,639
changed but how do I functionally test

163
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,569
something like this I could check the

164
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:59,729
width of the columns when I you know

165
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,560
when I do the responsive design it's

166
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,900
possible but it's a huge amount of code

167
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:09,169
and you are not testing everything and

168
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:11,939
you're saying quite rightly we can't do

169
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:14,189
functional testing and you're right you

170
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:17,550
can't I tried a few years ago right wigs

171
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,419
we did I was my front end face and I

172
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:24,330
tried writing functional tests yeah whoo

173
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,490
it worked not no problem the tools in

174
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,289
tooling as I said is there and then I

175
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:30,599
tried to do visual testing couldn't

176
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:34,589
succeed testing CSS and testing visuals

177
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:39,209
is a hard problem you're not why because

178
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:41,699
it's visual not functional anything to

179
00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:47,160
do with vision is problematic but don't

180
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,980
believe the rumors writing tests for CSS

181
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,890
is possible and the point is not the

182
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,140
writing test is for CSS as possible is

183
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,070
that you should be starting to write the

184
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:04,250
tests for CSS it is time for that how

185
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,290
I've been doing a lot of talks on this

186
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,910
issue and talking to a lot of people

187
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,070
people think the developers think it

188
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:11,910
goes like this

189
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,459
you navigate to a page using web

190
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,350
automation tools like the selenium or

191
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,870
Cypress take a screenshot and then you

192
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,970
tell the tool whatever library you're

193
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,810
using for testing

194
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,529
does this look good right they really

195
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:30,240
think that or or maybe does this conform

196
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,410
to a certain design system okay this is

197
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,110
my design system does this UI conform to

198
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,910
it and the answer is no unfortunately

199
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,240
we're not there are machine learning

200
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,709
algorithms in our AI

201
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,470
and we need AI for this type of stuff is

202
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:54,660
just not that good yet but right now so

203
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,740
how does it work

204
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,749
we're not actually doing visual testing

205
00:09:57,749 --> 00:10:00,089
we're doing visual regression testing

206
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:02,999
what chain we're checking that what has

207
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:07,170
been still is okay that nothing has

208
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,660
regressed or changed and this is a

209
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,319
typical visual test it's that simple I'm

210
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:15,930
using a Cypress I love Cypress it's my

211
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,689
go-to automation tool but there are tons

212
00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:20,939
of other selenium-webdriver i'll test

213
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:23,249
cafe all of them support visual testing

214
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:26,759
to once at one point or another first of

215
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,579
all we set the viewport because setting

216
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:31,379
the viewport as we all learned and we

217
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:33,449
all know in responsive design is crazy

218
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:36,360
important then we use Cypress to visit

219
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,250
and then it opens that you know browser

220
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,459
to whatever site we want then we do the

221
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:43,439
typing and the clicking to get to

222
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:45,509
whatever page in whatever state of the

223
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:49,589
UI we want and we call the tool with

224
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:52,649
visual testing tool just call it and it

225
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:54,240
does its magic this is where the magic

226
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,959
happens

227
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,269
and what is that magic the tool first of

228
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:59,930
all takes a screenshot of the app it

229
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,459
compares the screenshot with a baseline

230
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,620
that was previously given and I'll

231
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,230
explain what when it was given it checks

232
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,120
for differences if there are no

233
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,910
differences good your test pass if there

234
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,639
are differences it doesn't know whether

235
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,860
that difference is a bug which it

236
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,740
usually is or a feature I've just added

237
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,809
a button I've just changed the styling

238
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:25,350
so you need to check manually accept or

239
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,600
reject that difference and where does

240
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,879
that baseline come from that baseline

241
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,769
comes from a previous test the first

242
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:34,439
time this tool runs it accepts all the

243
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:35,580
screenshots the

244
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,620
and ask anything that's the baseline

245
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,280
when you accept a difference because

246
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,130
it's a feature not about that becomes

247
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,560
the new baseline and so on and so on

248
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,700
this is visual testing in a nutshell

249
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,110
that's how you test your CSS thank you

250
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,730
very much questions now just joking I

251
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,530
wish there's an elephant in the room

252
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,720
because it's visual it's hard it's not

253
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,040
that easy for elephants in the room

254
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,110
let's talk about elephant number one I'm

255
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,090
good

256
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,740
we've seen dogs we've seen cats now we

257
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:29,370
have elephants first of all taking a

258
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,990
screenshot is hard it's actually the

259
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,560
smallest elephant but it's still there

260
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,930
are you using Cypress that's easy

261
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,510
taking a screenshot in Cypress is great

262
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,570
Cypress runs under chrome chrome has

263
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,450
great screenshot taking facilities you

264
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,040
want only the viewport only the window

265
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,350
fine you want the whole full page fine

266
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,110
you want a specific region or a specific

267
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,990
element we're good we don't always need

268
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,110
the full page sometimes want to take a

269
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,300
specific segment of that page otherwise

270
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,550
if you're using if your JavaScript

271
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,230
developers are using selenium or

272
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,320
webdriver IO or others that's a problem

273
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,950
ouch you can only do window how do you

274
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,020
take a full page when you can only take

275
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,830
a screen shot of a window so what if my

276
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,780
JavaScript if our JavaScript developers

277
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,120
use selenium we just you know I won't do

278
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,830
visual testing I'll just do this

279
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:26,190
manually all day and the answer is no as

280
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,400
I said don't believe the rumors taking a

281
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,470
screenshot is possible if you're using

282
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,540
Cypress you're done if you're using

283
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,510
selenium or others one there are open

284
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,670
source and commercial

285
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,370
tools that know how to do it in weird

286
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,890
and wonderful ways basically take a

287
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,200
screenshot viewport of the viewport then

288
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,630
CSS transform the body up take another

289
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,730
screenshot sisters transform the body up

290
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,640
etc etc until we stitched all the

291
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,710
screenshots together and we're done

292
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,440
so tooling knows how to do that just

293
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,020
look for it that's the easy part

294
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:05,960
elephant number two I think this is the

295
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,900
biggest one but comparing the

296
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,580
screenshots is hard so you have your

297
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,890
baseline screenshot and you have your

298
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,170
current screenshot how do you compare

299
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:18,110
them most open-source tools and others

300
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:21,260
do pixel by pixel just check pixel by

301
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,300
pixel to see whether anything has

302
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:29,090
changed that's easy to do but look at

303
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,000
this these are two screenshots of a

304
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,410
certain page from 2004 I think this is

305
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,120
the my Windows machine and this is I

306
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,490
will use Mac but nothing more this is

307
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,010
what the top one is my machine and the

308
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,040
bottom is my friends machine they look

309
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,990
exactly the same but notice they're not

310
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:55,390
why is that why is the same machine same

311
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:59,450
Chrome or Firefox or whatever same well

312
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,820
Windows operating system giving us

313
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,650
different results and the answer

314
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,600
incredibly enough is graphics drivers

315
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,780
graphics drivers graphics a car graphic

316
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,120
cards etc the difference are really

317
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,500
slight but they are there let's do

318
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,170
another one this is a picture from

319
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,290
Chrome we found it out during the move

320
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,900
from chrome 67 and 68 it blew my mind

321
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,740
this is chrome 67 this is chrome 68 same

322
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,960
JPEG look exactly the same right nope

323
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,330
this is the difference in the pixels

324
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:39,470
yeah most of the pixels are different

325
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,780
basically it's probable they probably

326
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,850
change the library that they used to

327
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,150
render the JPEG or something I don't

328
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,819
know but there is

329
00:15:48,819 --> 00:15:51,819
the difference remember the testing

330
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:55,269
bookstore will see a demo shortly this

331
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:57,519
one written on the same and this what I

332
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,859
was doing while while preparing the talk

333
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:02,470
I found that out using a pixel-by-pixel

334
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,600
Maya library the same one same machine

335
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,799
5-minute difference between the two

336
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:11,199
these are the two screenshots you can

337
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,839
see zero difference right nope really

338
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:19,989
slight I have no idea why really I was

339
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:22,209
actually surprised and somebody who

340
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:24,339
deals with these pixel differences a lot

341
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:26,410
I have no idea why there was a

342
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,929
difference there but there was like in

343
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:33,399
one of 10 times I ran the tests which is

344
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:37,329
why all the tools have this it's a

345
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:42,339
slider which says do you want it do you

346
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:43,779
want false positives or false negatives

347
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:48,100
it's it's basically it's basically

348
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,879
saying how much percentage of error is

349
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:56,079
okay if you say no percentage of errors

350
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,169
you'll get a lot of false negatives if

351
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:01,629
you move that slider to the right you'll

352
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:03,939
get a lot of false positives or the

353
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,439
other way around I can never figure it

354
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,429
out but you have to tweak it constantly

355
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:16,659
and per page as I said that's it and

356
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:17,949
that's the biggest problem because we

357
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:19,899
don't want to constantly manage our

358
00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:22,959
screenshots nope it's not the same

359
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,970
because a lot of these tools employ

360
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,919
advanced screenshot comparison

361
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:30,159
algorithms AI machine learning just

362
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:32,799
really really complex algorithms what

363
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,340
they do is they don't look at the pixels

364
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,820
they try and find the elements in the

365
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,039
page and look at the elements and

366
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,779
compare them if there are slight

367
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:45,700
differences there they just ignore them

368
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,970
they're actually seeing as a human would

369
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,389
see or at least trying to do that so no

370
00:17:52,389 --> 00:17:54,759
false positives no false negatives if

371
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,470
you're using advanced comparison

372
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,269
algorithms it is possible and that is

373
00:17:58,269 --> 00:17:59,760
the biggest advance and

374
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,590
testing that we've seen in the last few

375
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,020
years and all of these if there are

376
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,120
commercial tools they all have free and

377
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,150
OSs plans so go ahead and use them

378
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,890
elephant number three managing those

379
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,780
comparisons is hard okay so we've got a

380
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,090
difference and it's like we're doing a

381
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,910
hundred screenshots and a lot of them

382
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,100
let's say I change the header all of

383
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,310
them have changes there that's the part

384
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,780
where you accept or reject the

385
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,190
difference you have to do that manually

386
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:36,330
and as I said hundreds of comparisons is

387
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:40,260
that a problem let's see one way to deal

388
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,110
with it is we're doing deltas

389
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,380
small Delta's so a lot of times it's the

390
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,080
same difference in all the screenshots

391
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,890
so I just use the tool and say yeah fine

392
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,950
update update the baseline they're all

393
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,960
fine because if it's a bug there is no

394
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,000
problem I don't need to do anything but

395
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,460
if it is a feature if there's an

396
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,720
addition I just acceptable go away the

397
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,410
other way is taking like dragging from

398
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,990
the folder that has the current

399
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,100
screenshots dragging it to the baseline

400
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,740
screenshots and dealing with that every

401
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,690
way looking at the day of saying okay

402
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,190
this is above this is a feature this is

403
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,140
about this is a feature and dragging

404
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,050
whichever way you want other tools

405
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,230
mostly commercial deal with it using a

406
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,240
dashboard where you can accept or reject

407
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,680
the differences as you wish it's

408
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,050
basically a salt problem each tool in

409
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,110
its own way but you have to think you

410
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,820
need to manage those screenshots and

411
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,420
this comes to this one the big one

412
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,890
testing all those responsive wits and

413
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,130
browsers we're talking 1024 retina iPad

414
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,680
we've seen that and it's getting more

415
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,790
and more interesting because more and

416
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,460
more sites are becoming responsive not

417
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,170
only that it's not just responsiveness

418
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,900
its Chrome Firefox Safari etc etc

419
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,210
different pixel density

420
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,039
we're talking different pixel densities

421
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:17,129
also do we abandon ship because oh my

422
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:20,240
god how do we do that

423
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,480
one solution is just run the test

424
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,299
multiple times I have a 4h on the test

425
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,730
on all the sizes I want I phone iPad etc

426
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,580
on each I run the test multiple times

427
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,409
and change the viewport accordingly and

428
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:36,299
take the screenshot and we're done

429
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:37,769
definitely doable

430
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,470
the other solution well that's the

431
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,659
solution but it takes a lot of time if I

432
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:45,240
have a hundred tests now I have 500

433
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,879
tests the other solution is do the same

434
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:51,450
but paralyze the testing that takes a

435
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,340
lot of infrastructure but it's

436
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,320
definitely doable and a lot of companies

437
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,649
do that solution number three is let a

438
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:02,190
cloud provider do that for you send over

439
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:06,049
not the screenshot but sent over a

440
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:09,779
snapshot of your Dom in your CSS etc and

441
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:12,869
then run all those tests all those

442
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:18,899
screenshots on a lot of browsers in the

443
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:21,840
end it really is as easy as this I want

444
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,460
to show a demo because I do have some

445
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:31,840
more time No let's see a demo

446
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,150
let's let's start with the application

447
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:40,280
under test this is the application under

448
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:44,180
test I can filter right here test and it

449
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,600
filters it obviously it's all responsive

450
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,050
but you've seen that already now let's

451
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:54,160
look at the test let's look at the

452
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,480
regular OSS tool as I said it's just as

453
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,220
it were but viewport visit get type type

454
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,560
the testing and we're done I will be

455
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,950
using an apple tools eyes where I have

456
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,100
to open the test and close the test but

457
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,770
it's basically very simple simple I run

458
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,140
the actions and then do a check window

459
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,980
very similar same tooling as I said they

460
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:28,370
are all the same let's run the test we

461
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,950
can run it non interactively but Cypress

462
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:42,520
is really cool so let's do that

463
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,380
there we go the test is running

464
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:49,340
hopefully are we good yes Wi-Fi is

465
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,280
working at least the ethernet is working

466
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,230
it's running it did the check window but

467
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,900
now it's waiting for the answer from

468
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,020
from Apple tools from eyes and let's go

469
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:06,740
to the dashboard and there it is we've

470
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,440
just passed notice that it doesn't give

471
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,690
one screenshot although we did give one

472
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,730
screenshot it's running for tests in

473
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,980
Chrome and one test in eye 11

474
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,740
this is actually an iPhone X emulation

475
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,520
so you get the responsive design as I

476
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,100
said we're give we're letting the cloud

477
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:30,500
do our work for us okay now let's break

478
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,380
something sorry about the artificiality

479
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,750
of it this is it no that's not the

480
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,500
extent of my CSS I know it better but

481
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,770
okay so let's change the title to read I

482
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:54,480
will close it

483
00:23:54,490 --> 00:24:01,480
there we go and we'll run it again so

484
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,400
it's running now you can you can see

485
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,040
that the testing book store is now red

486
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,580
and it's running it's throwing over

487
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,250
those dumb snapshots to the cloud and

488
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,690
waiting for the results of those tests

489
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:19,120
let's go to wherever I need to go and we

490
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,930
have an error in all the pages okay as

491
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:27,400
you can see it's this error I'll show it

492
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,660
like this okay now we need to say

493
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,730
whether this is a bug or a feature let's

494
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,170
say that it's a feature we wanted to

495
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,510
change it to red sorry my design

496
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:40,270
abilities are really low what I can do

497
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,990
is I can group all of them and approve

498
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:47,620
the two that it grouped on and save the

499
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,420
changes I won't save the changes so

500
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,640
maybe if I give the talk another time I

501
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,060
can do that again so basically this is

502
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,150
the level of sit it's it's basically

503
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:03,310
that easy remember just write the code

504
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:07,330
that uses the tool does the visits does

505
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,430
the clicks wherever you want to take a

506
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:12,490
screenshot you use the tool to take that

507
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,040
screenshot and then you do have the

508
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:24,600
managing of the screenshots so

509
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,970
as I said it really is as easy as that

510
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,250
as long as you take care of those four

511
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,150
elephants that's important I'm in

512
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:37,630
summary so do we believe the rumors no

513
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:41,230
writing tests for CSS is possible and so

514
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,460
join the backend and the front-end

515
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,950
JavaScript developers start testing your

516
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:48,790
CSS you can cure your CSS ego programmer

517
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,450
phobia it's a hard problem don't don't

518
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,220
worry it is a hard problem because it's

519
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,290
a visual one and visual stuff is always

520
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,750
hard taking the screenshots managing

521
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,100
those screenshots comparing the

522
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,020
screenshots and take testing across

523
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,820
various browser widths and Heights and

524
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:07,420
and platforms is really really difficult

525
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:10,210
but it is solvable with open source and

526
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,320
commercial tools so who knows what this

527
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,570
is come on raise your hands anybody read

528
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,770
do you and thank you by Frank Herbert

529
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:22,930
we're gonna get a movie soon I must not

530
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:25,900
fear we're talking about fear fear is

531
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,750
the mind killer fear is the little death

532
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,960
that brings total obliteration I will

533
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,380
test my CSS I will permit it to pass

534
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,990
over and through me and when it has gone

535
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,960
past I will turn the inner eye to see

536
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,720
its path where their fear has gone where

537
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,080
the fear is gone there will be nothing

538
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,500
only my tests will remain thank you very

539
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,040
much

540
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,440
[Applause]
