00:00:02,929 --> 00:00:06,899

okay hi guys um so here to talk to you

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,650
about SVG and more specifically like

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,630
some of the weirder stuff that maybe you

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,580
didn't know was kind of hiding inside

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,539
all that weird XML code so I won't go

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,520
into too much on like what we typically

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,289
use SVG for just like a little primer

8
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:26,609
lots of good resources that I can point

9
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,710
you to if you want like a beginner intro

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,610
but the basics of why SVG is catching on

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,620
in the community is first of all its

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,140
resolution independent so you have

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,510
graphics that are defined by a vector

14
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,879
path rather than a bunch of pixels so we

15
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,950
can scale them up and down and that

16
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,770
means they're really good for responsive

17
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,890
design icons and logos people are using

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,840
SVG a lot for they come out nice and

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,590
crisp wherever you're using them and

20
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,079
because they're XML based it's like code

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,699
if you look into the graphic you can

22
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,800
actually understand the code there you

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,500
can have really easy like like

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,060
manipulating States with SVG like a

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,369
one-line CSS rule can give you a hover

26
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,290
State on an icon without having to use a

27
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,090
sprite or anything so if you dig into

28
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,299
that little heart for example this is

29
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,729
kind of just like some typical SVG code

30
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,659
where you've got an SVG elements most

31
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,860
shapes are going to be this path element

32
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,240
and it's just a bunch of coordinates

33
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,460
that draw out that shape in vector space

34
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,820
and then you'll have like presentational

35
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,890
attributes like fill and Stroke that we

36
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,780
can fill out as well

37
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,790
something you might notice here that's

38
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,439
really important is there's no like

39
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,470
pixels or anything on anything in here

40
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,720
we are gonna actually everything all

41
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,100
these coordinates you see are all

42
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,159
relative to that view box attribute to

43
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,890
up at the top so that's 0 0 100 100 is a

44
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,140
hundred by a hundred like like canvas in

45
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,689
SVG light and so important thing to keep

46
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:09,660
in mind as we're moving around the view

47
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,060
box is like super super important when

48
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,410
you're dealing with SP

49
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,450
and you want to kind of scale everything

50
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,760
related to that and that's going to

51
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,100
ensure kind of ultimate responsiveness

52
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:26,790
and flexibility as we work with SVG so

53
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,410
what I want to talk about though is that

54
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,870
SVG is way more than just simple vector

55
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,260
shapes if you check out like some

56
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,990
resources on SVG barely even see that on

57
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,790
the screen I had to shrink it there are

58
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,130
80 valid SVG elements that you probably

59
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,340
didn't know about most of them 20

60
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,570
minutes doesn't give me time to cover

61
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,400
them all but these are a few of my

62
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,290
favorites that I found useful that we're

63
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,960
gonna look at there's even a switch

64
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,400
statement in SVG like that I found out

65
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,960
haven't found a use case for it but it's

66
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,190
there

67
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,820
okay so first example I wanted to move

68
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,040
through is SVG is really good at doing

69
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,860
editorialized text so what I mean by

70
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,550
that something like this where you know

71
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,530
you've got very specific placement and

72
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,090
sizing of of fonts that's something that

73
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,540
is kind of tricky to do you know with

74
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,120
just CSS to get that like right on and

75
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,010
the way that that's gonna work is like

76
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,200
we just have all these like SVG analogs

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,720
of stuff so there's a T span that acts

78
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,340
like a span to control individual

79
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,920
elements and you've got positioning

80
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,320
coordinates XY DX and dy and then the

81
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,270
love there to turn it a different color

82
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,000
you just throw a class on any SVG like

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,610
sub component to effect it with CSS and

84
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,540
say change the fill color so code looks

85
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,640
like that I won't go into like super

86
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,880
great details on the code examples but

87
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,410
these are kind of here for reference if

88
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,340
you guys want to look at the slides

89
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,350
later but you can kind of see what's

90
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,730
going on there there's a text element

91
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,860
and there's these T spans for every

92
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,120
single line the great thing about this

93
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,700
is that it's totally responsive because

94
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,549
we've sized this into the view box text

95
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,770
I find is one of like the most annoying

96
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,479
things to deal with when you're like

97
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,210
doing responsive stuff so if you have

98
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,070
something that's really specific like

99
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,120
this it's going to

100
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,220
well and it's better than an image

101
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,830
because SVG text is still like there on

102
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,360
the page and is still totally accessible

103
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,000
to search engines screen readers that

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,889
kind of thing so how do we make it

105
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:41,970
responsive remember the view box size

106
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,229
everything in your view box and then

107
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:44,520
you're just gonna put it in a flexible

108
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,800
container and let the container handle

109
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,960
at the same way like image max width

110
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,449
100% works another example of

111
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:56,970
editorialized text is text on like a

112
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,370
curved path you can do really easily

113
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,449
with SVG so the way we did this is I

114
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:06,030
just traced out a path like druid and

115
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,860
illustrator overtop it's kind of hard to

116
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,240
see there's a really faint red line

117
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,289
there you can really easily get SVG code

118
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:16,169
like by exporting it as SVG from vector

119
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:21,120
editing software and then so path this

120
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,419
path ID arc is what defines the that arc

121
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:30,389
and then what you're gonna do instead of

122
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,250
just using a text element here there's

123
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,010
this thing called text path and text

124
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:38,130
path is going to let you fit the text

125
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,050
along whatever vector path so you can do

126
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,990
pretty crazy stuff with that and another

127
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,590
kind of common pattern we're gonna see

128
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,229
path has an ID and then it's been linked

129
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:53,039
with this X link href equals hash arc so

130
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,570
we're linking these two SVG things

131
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,169
together another really important thing

132
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:01,440
that's going to come up often in here is

133
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,520
this depth

134
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,180
element so this you notice that that arc

135
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,620
doesn't actually get rendered on the

136
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,630
page anywhere so that's because we've

137
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,490
put it inside depths which is just a

138
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,340
place to define like reusable components

139
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,720
that you're gonna reference elsewhere

140
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,849
it's really handy yet combining

141
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:22,979
different SVG things together another

142
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:25,710
thing I have been really a fan of with

143
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:31,110
SVG is interesting fills so SVG has its

144
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,599
own gradient syntax nothing too crazy

145
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:37,080
they're different from CSS you're just

146
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,760
going to define your stop colors as

147
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,650
their own

148
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,430
kind of elements here and you can

149
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,050
control the direction with the X&Y

150
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,820
coordinates here we've got it going on a

151
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,000
gradient nothing exciting here when

152
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,500
you're just talking about putting it on

153
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,419
a rectangle what I think is cool is if

154
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:58,580
we're gonna put that gradient inside a

155
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,100
def settlement again so we're saying

156
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,479
we're not gonna just let this gradient

157
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,340
it actually won't do anything on its own

158
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,690
and then we're gonna link it to like

159
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,449
another shape you can start filling like

160
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:13,820
really weird unconventional shapes not

161
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,470
just like rectangles or what you're

162
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,080
limited to in CSS so like anything you

163
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,770
want can have a gradient field guys

164
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,770
another cool thing you can do in the

165
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,930
same vein you can fill any shape with an

166
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,080
image how cool is that

167
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,490
cropping images into weird shapes is

168
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,729
like kind of shitty as like far as like

169
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:37,280
labor overhead goes and also it's

170
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,840
expensive if you've got an image with

171
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,220
transparency on it so this one's a

172
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,380
little more like complex but it's gonna

173
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,389
use a lot of the same things we're going

174
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:49,039
to learn about a new element here called

175
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,410
pattern so it's kind of a bit of a hack

176
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,389
getting an image in here but what

177
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,760
pattern normally does is turns any SVG

178
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,830
element into like a tileable pattern so

179
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,970
if you were gonna like fill something

180
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,639
with polka dots in the background but i

181
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,860
think it's the most fun with using the

182
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,000
SVG image element and more specifically

183
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,160
i think it's the most fun when you start

184
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,440
putting gifts inside things you can fill

185
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:18,680
anything with a gift so code for that

186
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,150
looks like this we're just sort of

187
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,699
building up again again inside that

188
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:26,360
depths and then inside a pattern and

189
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,860
then you're just linking them together

190
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,199
with the idea again so the fill for this

191
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,570
path that heart-shaped path is going to

192
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,099
be filled with the image that was

193
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:36,860
defined as a pattern fill it's a lot to

194
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,390
kind of keep track of but it's all there

195
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,930
a few things to keep in mind when you're

196
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,060
working with images because it's

197
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,950
supposed to be a repeating pattern it

198
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,079
can sometimes be tricky to get the image

199
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:50,680
to completely fill your shape properly

200
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,920
but remember your view up

201
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,560
sighs everything to the view box if you

202
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,870
match the width and height of the

203
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,420
pattern so notice you can't see the view

204
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,680
box here but it is a hundred by a

205
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,690
hundred and the width and height of both

206
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,790
the pattern and the image are both set

207
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,459
to the entire view box space and then

208
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:12,269
this last preserve aspect ratio oh sorry

209
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:13,410
one more thing before you get to that

210
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,170
this pattern units user space on use

211
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,110
says size it to the view box not to any

212
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,610
like shape that's inside of it not just

213
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:29,579
to the thing it's filling SVG because

214
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:33,029
it's XML kind of quirky sometimes make

215
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:35,639
sure your images have both a width and a

216
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,769
height if you don't specify it's gonna

217
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:39,779
assume it's zero and then it just like

218
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,240
poof disappears so always specify a

219
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,910
width and height attribute and then

220
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,510
there's this cool preserve aspect ratio

221
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,920
attribute that you can do to kind of

222
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,269
it's sort of like a background size

223
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:54,300
cover one of the ways that you can set

224
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,269
it for SVG again to insure so this is

225
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:59,430
like if I didn't apply it see how it

226
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,339
doesn't fully fill the heart so it's

227
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:03,709
nice you don't have to worry about

228
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:05,940
cropping your image to the exact size

229
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,120
preserve aspect ratio if you give it the

230
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,940
right values um there's a link here to

231
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,079
check out it'll just fill it

232
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:17,730
automatically for you okay let's combine

233
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,730
two things that we've learned so far so

234
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,760
how about editorialized text and

235
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,920
gradient fills you get gradient text

236
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,630
awesome right that's something that's

237
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,050
been kind of tricky to do before most of

238
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,360
the examples I saw we're using this

239
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,220
WebKit background clip to make a

240
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,029
clipping path out of the text not super

241
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:44,490
cross browser friendly gradient text is

242
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,769
going to work almost across the board

243
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:49,949
with the exception of anything less than

244
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:54,510
ie 9 as a caveat to all of this SVG is

245
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,240
not going to do anything there hopefully

246
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,990
you're like on to supporting ie 9 and

247
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,620
above by now okay that was fun stood

248
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,810
again ready how

249
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:13,990
editorialize texts plus a gift bill what

250
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,090
s mean you can do that like I think

251
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,710
that's that's madness I've never seen

252
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,210
anything that can do that before and it

253
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,040
it's pretty straightforward

254
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,200
so I don't know exactly what you would

255
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,520
do with that on like a production

256
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,770
website but I really hope one of you

257
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,380
finds a use case please tell me if you

258
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,970
work that into a project so one other

259
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,810
area I wanted to cover too is

260
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:42,870
interesting image effects so we'll start

261
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,690
out with as an example of something you

262
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:50,760
can do with SVG these are my cats they

263
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,680
kind of hate each other sometimes and

264
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,570
fight so only way to get them in a

265
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,820
portrait together was to like do the

266
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,310
portrait studio thing but this is

267
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,200
actually using a few different SVG

268
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,720
techniques here so it's that image

269
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,960
element that we saw before combined with

270
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,390
a radial gradient to do the sort of

271
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,640
vignette shape and then something called

272
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,380
a mask so like who works in Nord knows a

273
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,820
bit about like you know Photoshop in

274
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,700
that area okay so a few of you so like

275
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,589
you might have encountered the concept

276
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:25,650
of a mask it basically kind of works

277
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,810
like a cookie cutter you can take one

278
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,110
shape and like stamp out any other thing

279
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,100
so in this example we've used like a an

280
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,410
elliptical shape and an oval shaped mask

281
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,830
to kind of stamp out that image and the

282
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,839
cool thing about a mask there's also

283
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,670
this thing called clip path which also

284
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,620
works like a cookie cutter but it'll

285
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,110
just stamp it out with hard edges with a

286
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,550
mask you can put gradients in to kind of

287
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,010
fade out the edges so a black fill is

288
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,839
going to give you an opaque mask a white

289
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,910
fill gives you a transparent mask so

290
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,650
this is really powerful with gradients

291
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:05,190
you put a basically it's an oval with a

292
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,180
radial gradient in it and that creates

293
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,360
the mask to cut out the image so again

294
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,209
sort of notice here with deaths we've

295
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:19,470
included two different like we defined

296
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,610
both the gradient

297
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:26,600
and the mask and then the mask is

298
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,119
referencing the gradient and then I've

299
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:33,029
messed up the yes sorry right here the

300
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:34,559
ellipse is actually being filled with

301
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,129
the gradient and then the image is using

302
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:42,629
the mask as a mask here so you can

303
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:44,939
really start like combining all these

304
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:46,709
SVG pieces together to get it super

305
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:51,329
creative and again look into like these

306
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:53,970
interesting attributes like object

307
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,249
bounding box mask units that help you

308
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:59,919
size things properly

309
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:02,699
another thing that SVG is pretty good at

310
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:06,540
is filter effects so here's a cool

311
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,309
example where they've got this sort of

312
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:12,569
like ios8 like gradient overlay thing

313
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:14,759
going on where if you take a look at

314
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:17,819
this on the live example it actually

315
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:19,470
like blurs the background as you scroll

316
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,610
down the page which is super cool so

317
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,679
there's an entire filter element and

318
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:32,579
this one's using a blur filter and also

319
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,369
like an RGB filter to alter some stuff

320
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:37,439
and then just as I've been showing you

321
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:40,049
guys primarily just linking stuff up

322
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:42,779
within the SVG directly but just just so

323
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:46,709
you know you can usually access most SVG

324
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:49,410
attributes from your CSS so in this case

325
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,149
it's being applied to every single

326
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:53,879
section element so if you don't want to

327
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:57,179
have to like you know repeat that in

328
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:00,179
your your markup you can sort of combine

329
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:02,879
defining things in SVG hooking them up

330
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:08,279
with HTML or sorry CSS rather usually

331
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,230
the attribute names just like the CSS

332
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:14,759
property if you go crazy with filters

333
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:17,399
you can essentially do like SVG

334
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,249
Instagram there's a whole filters get

335
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:21,839
kind of complex and you need a bit of

336
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,319
knowledge of image manipulation and how

337
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:26,819
that works but there's some good

338
00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:30,059
tutorials here so the example that we're

339
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:32,789
looking at is like a combination of

340
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:34,529
there's a turbulent

341
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:36,779
filter and that creates like noise

342
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,810
effects the blur we saw already is going

343
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,779
to make a blur component transfer is one

344
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:45,930
that you can actually you get sub

345
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,350
elements to change our G and B

346
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,879
separately so you can kind of change the

347
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:53,100
color balance on stuff and then there's

348
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,290
actually like light source effects even

349
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,819
that you can do so you can do like

350
00:15:56,819 --> 00:15:59,579
shadowing and and some interesting stuff

351
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,980
there if you if you dive into filter

352
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:07,949
effects another thing SVG is pretty good

353
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:14,309
at is animations so this is a really

354
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:16,230
popular thing that's been happening a

355
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,089
lot lately we've seen this before they

356
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:20,670
like line drawing thing okay so like a

357
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,620
few of you it's starting to show up more

358
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,319
and more and that is SVG down at the

359
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,629
bottom so if you like take a peek its

360
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:30,209
SVG's that essentially draw themselves

361
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:33,749
so this is actually I say almost like a

362
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:35,790
bit of a hack to with some interesting

363
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:40,050
attributes so this is going to rely on

364
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,959
you having a path with a stroke so

365
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,519
rather than a filled in shape and

366
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,970
there's these two attributes that all

367
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,980
SVG that you can apply to strokes one

368
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,199
called stroke - array and one called

369
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:54,839
stroke - offset check out the reference

370
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,699
for like an in-depth explanation it's

371
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,259
kind of beyond the what I have time for

372
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:02,160
but stroke - array allows you to specify

373
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,919
basically like a dashed line pattern but

374
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,819
be really precise with like the length

375
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,380
of the dashes and the lengths of the

376
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,679
gaps and then stroke - offset just sort

377
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,169
of shifts that around so you can control

378
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,730
where the dashes start so we're gonna

379
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,299
hack it by making basically a dash and a

380
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:23,189
gap that are both as long as the entire

381
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:25,110
shape and then we're just going to shift

382
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,579
it and it gives you that animation

383
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,919
effect so here's a really simple example

384
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,580
of just one line so we have a hundred

385
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,830
unit long walk like line and it has to

386
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,679
like - components each as long as the

387
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:41,970
line itself and then you just kind of

388
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,860
move it along you just move along the

389
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,630
gap and the filled in part

390
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,710
and you might notice here that I'm

391
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,140
animating this right inside the SVG SVG

392
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,750
actually has an animated element that

393
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:01,890
you can animate almost any SVG attribute

394
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,780
you might wonder though why not just

395
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,180
like animate with CSS or JavaScript

396
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,460
typically those are better and probably

397
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,490
more performant tools for achieving this

398
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,230
in the case of the line drawing that's

399
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,730
probably what I would have gone with

400
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,830
just kind of wanted to show you guys the

401
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,770
possibility there there is one case that

402
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:24,820
I've found that SVG animate is like like

403
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,630
kind of way better and like gets the job

404
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:36,010
done faster and that's tweens birthday

405
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:39,360
alright thank you didn't fashionable

406
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,110
wish I was that cool when I was between

407
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:47,530
so yeah SVG can like pretty easily morph

408
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,340
shapes from one to another so I think I

409
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,650
have time to show you guys this example

410
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:59,340
that I just kind of went to town with

411
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,550
these are just like a bunch of little

412
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,260
SVG shapes there's one circle that gets

413
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,960
like cloned with JavaScript but the main

414
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,990
animation of one-quarter morphing into

415
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,090
like an opposite shape quarter is all

416
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:16,540
done in SVG and then you can like play

417
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,090
around with it in j/s to get it to go

418
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,150
kind of like kaleidoscope II so that was

419
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:28,600
kind of fun yeah so a simpler example of

420
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,010
this the way that the morph works is

421
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,610
remember going back to that heart shape

422
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,190
how every single path was defined by a

423
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,610
series of points in coordinate space and

424
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,050
it's the D attribute I think it's like I

425
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,160
can't even remember what D stands for

426
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,200
right now but the path like definition

427
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,250
if you basically what you see here under

428
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,800
we're saying I'm going to animate

429
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,250
the D attribute and then the values that

430
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,250
I want to animate it kind of to and from

431
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,140
it's actually just to but in order that

432
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,420
it kind of like goes forward and

433
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,250
backwards nicely I've repeated the first

434
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,320
value but these are just two sets of

435
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,380
like coordinate points that SVG handles

436
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,620
the tween and the morph between one

437
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,810
shape and another so that's something

438
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,160
that you can't really do without like an

439
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,970
external library in in J s so kind of

440
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:34,560
neat that SVG can do that so there's

441
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,880
still like way more that I haven't

442
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,090
covered these are just some of like the

443
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,980
weird things that I've found hiding in

444
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,550
there and thought we're pretty cool so

445
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:48,210
you know sort of in the the vein of this

446
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,390
morning like just yeah go exploring make

447
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,140
stuff up like there's just so much that

448
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,580
I don't think like a lot of people

449
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,070
realize but it's all documented it's all

450
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,700
there these are some good resources that

451
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,070
I found helpful and you know I honestly

452
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,170
just been be reading through these and

453
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,960
say oh like there's that element like I

454
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,030
can do this sort of thing and go play

455
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,460
around with it and like produce some

456
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,770
some pretty cool results so I'd

457
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,260
encourage you guys to go try and do the

458
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,990
same and you know in a wider sense like

459
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,060
don't take any technology kind of for

460
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,580
granted don't you know really just like

461
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,400
dig into the details and and go

462
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,070
exploring and see what you find that's

463
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:36,320
all thanks
