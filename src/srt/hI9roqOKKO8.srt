00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,480

hello everyone thank you for being here

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,980
I guess I should start by introducing

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,010
myself I know II called it a good job

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,070
but I should at least pronounce my last

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,960
name correctly so my name is Sara Sweden

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,790
this is how it's pronounced

7
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,040
I come from Lebanon all over in the

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,670
Middle East there isn't really much to

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,419
say about me anyway

10
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:34,489
I'm just a freelance front-end developer

11
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:37,100
I love CSS I love teaching I love

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,039
writing and so I've combined both into

13
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,899
writing tutorials and articles most of

14
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:44,539
which have been about CSS like CSS

15
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:47,030
regions yes shapes a lot maybe some of

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,920
you know some of my articles I've

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,440
written two for Alastair part recently

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,260
and I also write them where I write them

19
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,719
on my blog obviously my very simple blog

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,690
I also write for code drops where I'm an

21
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,530
author a team member as well and that's

22
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,360
pretty much it there is a really

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,759
something else to say I guess I should

24
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:09,140
also add that this is my first

25
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,600
conference talk ever

26
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:17,390
thank you so I'm really excited to be

27
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:22,729
here really nervous and yeah I guess I

28
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:24,799
should just remember to breathe it's

29
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,600
really really awesome you know what's

30
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,240
really great about this is I finally

31
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,670
have the chance to talk to someone or to

32
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,590
a bunch of people about something that I

33
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,299
wrote that I do and that I'd really like

34
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:37,600
and they're going to be to actually

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,789
understand every single word I say

36
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:43,189
yeah I'm sure most of you if not all of

37
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:44,210
you have been through it talking to

38
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,979
someone with an op tech savvy about Web

39
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:50,090
Design and alike and sometimes they're

40
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,420
like and then just move away it happened

41
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,149
it actually happened so it's really

42
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,880
great to be here on the subject of

43
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,350
understanding every word I'm going to

44
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,439
say I think I should give you a heads up

45
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:06,499
we as Lebanese tend to use certain words

46
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:08,360
that have no equivalent in English and

47
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,909
one of these words is the word and no

48
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:12,890
I'm giving you a heads up because it

49
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:13,170
just

50
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,270
happens sometimes involuntarily and if I

51
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,130
do say one of these two words I'm going

52
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,959
to mention you can either ignore them or

53
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,360
just know their meaning the first word

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,510
is end no it actually has no meaning

55
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,970
candle we just put it in there and the

56
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,340
sentences and it's mostly used in the

57
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,319
context when you're saying something an

58
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,819
idea and you want to elaborate on that

59
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,209
idea and you don't know how to do it so

60
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:42,339
you just or you do do it but in order to

61
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:48,450
okay the way to connect the idea to its

62
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,340
explanation you just throw an endo and

63
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,040
and in between now you may not realize

64
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,690
it you might not you may not notice it

65
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,950
but if you do in order so just know that

66
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,840
I'm going to be elaborating on something

67
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,390
and explaining more another word is best

68
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,569
best is the Lebanese word for but but

69
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:06,780
with a single T not - okay yeah

70
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,660
so if I do say bus just translate to but

71
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,519
and you should be fine as long as it's

72
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,330
well but okay so I'm here to talk to you

73
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,040
today about styling and animating

74
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,230
scalable vector graphics with CSS and

75
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,570
now scalable vector graphics as defined

76
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,030
in Wikipedia are an xml-based vector

77
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,680
image format for two-dimensional

78
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,660
graphics with support for interactivity

79
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,680
and animation they are basically just

80
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,690
tags that render images and these images

81
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,040
have support for interactivity and

82
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,730
animations

83
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,430
now the interactivity and animations can

84
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,590
be added using javascript maybe using

85
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,600
some back-end language I'm not sure

86
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,730
because I'm I'm I totally start with

87
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,920
back-end stuff and you can also add it

88
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,079
using using CSS and that's the part that

89
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,150
I'm interested in for this talk and just

90
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,220
like many talks about s videos I should

91
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,829
go over why s videos are really awesome

92
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:58,680
because they really are SVG's are

93
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,510
accessible they are accessible to screen

94
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,579
readers if you make them accessible I

95
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:04,019
have a slide about this at the end of

96
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,209
the talk they're accessible in a sense

97
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:08,250
that they have a very accessible Dom API

98
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,859
and they're accessible to us developers

99
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:13,980
through the inspector or the web the dev

100
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,540
tools of whatever favorite browser

101
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,780
you're using you can inspect SVG nodes

102
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,729
just like you would expect HTML elements

103
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:22,500
they have very good browser supports

104
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,419
starting ie9 for most of the SVG

105
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,310
features and all modern browsers

106
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,469
because SPG's are basically text they

107
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,999
can be gzipped and therefore have

108
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:33,520
smaller file sizes vendor PNG and JPEG

109
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,979
counterparts they have built-in graphics

110
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:37,569
effects like blend modes filters

111
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,400
clipping and masking among others so

112
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,469
basically just Photoshop in the browser

113
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:42,909
which is awesome

114
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:45,370
they are interactive installable part

115
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,840
that I'm going to be focusing on and

116
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,969
they have tools there are tools for

117
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:50,979
creating SPG's animating SVG is

118
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:53,439
manipulating SPG's optimizing SPG's

119
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,870
three of the most popular tools for

120
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,520
create creating them are Adobe

121
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,460
Illustrator which works in all four all

122
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,250
platforms but it's not free a very

123
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,740
decent and fairly popular alternative is

124
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,039
Inkscape and sketch is also an

125
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,900
alternative from what I hear is really

126
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,090
good but it's Mac OSX only so if you're

127
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,379
stuck on Windows like me you're not

128
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:17,800
going to be using that so no matter what

129
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,529
SVG editor you use none of them exports

130
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,650
really optimized and clean code most of

131
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,999
the code that is exported usually

132
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:30,159
contains editor metadata comments empty

133
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:32,110
groups and empty elements and stuff like

134
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,029
that and basically just a bunch of junk

135
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:35,770
that you can remove safely without

136
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,229
affecting the rendering of the SVG so

137
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:39,580
it's usually so it's generally a good

138
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,949
idea to use a third-party stand-alone

139
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:44,770
optimizing to to optimize the code for

140
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,990
you because you know before I'm talking

141
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,520
about this because before you want to

142
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,199
start actually styling and animating as

143
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,550
we do you want to have something clean

144
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,099
to work with so there are many tools out

145
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:56,800
there to optimize SVG's I'm going to

146
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,300
mention two of them one of them is the

147
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,550
SVG editor by Peter calling bridge it's

148
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,680
an online tool it allows you to either

149
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,439
important SVG file or just copy/paste it

150
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,110
it offers a lot of options that allow

151
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,029
you to optimize your spgs and clean up

152
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:12,399
the code and what's really nice about it

153
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,430
is that whenever you check an option an

154
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,379
optimization option you get to see the

155
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:19,120
result of applying that application to

156
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,330
that optimization to the SVG directly

157
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,520
live in front of you so it helps you

158
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,050
make better choices on what

159
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,830
optimizations to make and what not to it

160
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,520
can help

161
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,219
slash your file size by a lot for

162
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:35,409
example this very simple path that I've

163
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:39,159
that I've optimized the original file

164
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,630
size is highlighted

165
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,850
one point one kilobyte it's very small

166
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,670
file but it was slashed down to 0.6

167
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,280
kilobytes so optimizing your SVG code

168
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,410
code is a really good idea if you don't

169
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,910
want to use an online tool you can use

170
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,730
this SVG Oh SVG o stands for SVG

171
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,420
optimizer it's a node.js based tool with

172
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,800
with a very simple and nice actually

173
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,130
very simple API dragon no not API a very

174
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,500
simple drag-and-drop GUI so if you're

175
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,580
not going to if you don't want to use an

176
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,080
online tool you can use this one it's

177
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,190
really nice this is a very quick example

178
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,070
I think yeah it's the same path that I

179
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,010
showed in this slide I exported it from

180
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,780
s from Adobe Illustrator now Adobe

181
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,880
Illustrator gives us a lot of options to

182
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,440
optimize and customize the code and

183
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,830
clean it up kind of clean it up but even

184
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,330
after cleaning it up and Adobe

185
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,850
Illustrator I I was left with the code

186
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,620
on the left and after optimizing it and

187
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,450
Peters tool you can see how much the

188
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,000
file size is a lot smaller a lot cleaner

189
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,990
more readable in general now after

190
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,000
you're done with you know optimizing the

191
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,250
code you're probably going to want to

192
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,740
clean up a little bit more some manual

193
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,520
stuff and give classes to your to your

194
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,820
selectors or elements if you're

195
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,590
exporting the code from from Adobe

196
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,570
Illustrator and you're separating the

197
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,390
styles from from the mark-up in SPG you

198
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,730
can add styles to an to SVG in different

199
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,110
ways I'm going to go over them in a

200
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,330
minute but when the styles are separated

201
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,340
you have well inside the stylesheet

202
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,680
you're going to have to set a selected

203
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,360
target and SVG element and of course

204
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,860
you're going to use ID selectors class

205
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,000
selectors etc the generic names produced

206
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,150
by Adobe Illustrator or any other SVG

207
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,490
editors usually look like this st 0 st 1

208
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,070
SC 2 they make no sense whatsoever so

209
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,570
you're going to want to change the class

210
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,110
names and do more semantic ones so now

211
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,240
that we have some clean code to work

212
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,880
with it's time to talk about adding

213
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:46,030
styles to SPG's now the dividing line

214
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,040
between HTML and CSS is clear

215
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,320
HTML cares for content and structure and

216
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,950
CSS cares for the looks however an SVG

217
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,810
the line is blurred to say the least and

218
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,270
SVG is an image that is marked up and

219
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,860
that has tiles so things are just mixed

220
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,680
up into one thing you see SVG 1.1 did

221
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,720
not require any CSS and therefore it was

222
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,240
necessary to present the styles using

223
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,030
what is known as SVG presentation

224
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,340
attributes presentation attributes

225
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,320
basically provide a shorthand way for

226
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,600
applying a CSS property to an SVG node

227
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,150
in the form of an attribute for example

228
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,920
you have this fill stroke stroke with

229
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,450
among many others you can set the

230
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,850
opacity like this as an attribute

231
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,000
transforms apply transforms etc now a

232
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,300
subset of all these present SVG

233
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,280
presentation attributes can be set using

234
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,590
CSS however not all of them can be set

235
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,060
for example you cannot if you have an

236
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,700
SVG node inside an SVG file and you want

237
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,320
to change its height and width you

238
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,960
cannot do that via CSS you're still

239
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,640
going to use presentation attributes for

240
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,610
width and height but a subset of all SVG

241
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,970
attributes can be set using CSS some of

242
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,280
these are shared with CSS there are CSS

243
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,620
properties equivalent to the

244
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,010
presentation attributes and there are

245
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,620
loops sorry and there are some

246
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,750
presentation attributes that are SVG

247
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,300
only the table shows a list of all

248
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,890
presentation attributes that can be

249
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,310
represented and applied using CSS as CSS

250
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,760
properties now because many of the

251
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,650
presentation attributes are implemented

252
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,710
as CSS properties you can set them using

253
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,570
either inline Styles just like you would

254
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,390
any other CSS property using document

255
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,640
Styles embedded or using external style

256
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,590
sheets if you're going to embed them

257
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,480
using inline Styles it's going to be

258
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,150
inside a style attribute so instead of

259
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,340
using the full stroke and stroke width

260
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,530
as presentation attributes in this

261
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:45,250
example I've used them as CSS properties

262
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,260
inside the style attribute you can also

263
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,650
use style tags inside an SVG document

264
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,900
and that the styles and the styles will

265
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,490
be just like normal CSS there's a

266
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,470
selector there's a style and you just

267
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,960
apply it now and note about the C data

268
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,710
block that you can see that you see here

269
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,260
it's not always recommended but because

270
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,760
some of the

271
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,649
selectors and CSS like a child's like

272
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:10,209
the children selector which is an arrow

273
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:12,459
or a chevron I don't know if it's the

274
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:16,870
correct thing to say yeah so that arrow

275
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:28,480
can well it could basically cause

276
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,389
problems with the XML parser okay so

277
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:33,040
sometimes it's recommended that you use

278
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,480
it but you don't always have to use it

279
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,279
if you if you optimize the code using

280
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,490
using Peters SVG editor it's it's

281
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,230
automatically removed so you don't

282
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,329
always need it you can also embed the

283
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:45,070
Styles inside a style tag outside the

284
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,910
SVG in an html5 or XHTML document as you

285
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,339
see here this example and you can use

286
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:53,079
last but not least an external

287
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,850
stylesheet if you have an SVG document

288
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,190
and you're going to import an SVG

289
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,779
stylesheet you're going to have to use

290
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:01,690
the XML stylesheet element or attack to

291
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:06,360
do that style Cascades now because

292
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,190
because SVG presentation attributes are

293
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,519
implemented as CSS properties they do

294
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,230
contribute to the style cascade and CSS

295
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,389
but presentation attributes count as

296
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:18,459
low-level author style sheets and are

297
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:20,410
overridden by any other style definition

298
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,000
external style sheets document style

299
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,160
sheets are inline Styles the example

300
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,199
here the circle I've used the fill

301
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:29,290
attribute with the value blue to give it

302
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,089
a blue background and then I've used it

303
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:32,680
as a CSS property inside the style

304
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,860
attribute and the the pink color inside

305
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,660
the style attribute overrides the blue

306
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,579
one outside the diagram on the right

307
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:41,199
shows the order of the styles and the

308
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:43,449
Cascade styles lower in the diagram

309
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:45,279
override those above them and you can

310
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,810
see that presentation attributes are up

311
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,899
above the only stylesheet that does not

312
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,880
override presentation attributes is the

313
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,319
user agent style sheets okay now inside

314
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:58,930
any style sheet it just a note about the

315
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,720
talk I'm going to be focusing about

316
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,940
concepts and stuff you should know or

317
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,829
would want to know if you're going to

318
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:08,860
apply styles and animate animate SVG's

319
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,510
you're not going to see any really

320
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:14,769
impressive demos or effects so inside

321
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:17,279
the style rules rules

322
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,569
okay the selectors that you can use in

323
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:20,190
CSV

324
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,769
not all CSS selectors can be used to

325
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,839
select SVG elements this is really

326
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,720
important because I've tried using for

327
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,250
example the direct at the direct the

328
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,870
direct sibling selector to select an

329
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,759
element in SVG it didn't work I tried

330
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,440
adding just for demonstration purposes

331
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,779
while I was preparing the slides I tried

332
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,220
using the before-and-after studio

333
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,199
elements to add generated content it

334
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:43,050
doesn't work so these and these

335
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,000
selectors and the slides all of them

336
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,519
work maybe possibly some extra selectors

337
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:53,399
could be added later however if you want

338
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,990
to know more details you can always

339
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,720
visit the specification the link at the

340
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,389
end of the slide links is goes to the

341
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:02,790
specification now a very simple example

342
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,490
I got from the iconic icon set it just

343
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,160
shows you that you can style an SVG and

344
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,470
apply a transition to its to its

345
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,029
properties just like you would with a

346
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:15,060
CSS applied to an HTML element in this

347
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,550
example the light bulb is made up of

348
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,480
grey dashes or strokes or paths and when

349
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,699
they are hovered the stroke width

350
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:27,149
increases the color increases the stroke

351
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:29,100
color and not increase the color does

352
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,860
not increase the color changes and the

353
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,660
background color fades in giving it an

354
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,279
effect of lighting you know getting lit

355
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,630
so and you can see how in the dev tools

356
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,360
you can inspect every single line of

357
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,240
these lines of the light bulb and down

358
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,949
at the bottom I've highlighted the

359
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:49,680
before and on hover Styles you change

360
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,939
you change them just like you would

361
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:54,509
change any other CSS property now

362
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:57,600
embedding SVG's there are different ways

363
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,880
to embed in SVG and in a document and

364
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,279
this is relevant to the subject of this

365
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,529
talk because the technique that you use

366
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,360
to embed your SVG determines whether or

367
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,430
not this any external Styles

368
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,040
interactivity and style ability will be

369
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,319
applied to this video or not depending

370
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:15,059
on the technique some of the stuff that

371
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:17,279
you apply may not work and you may get a

372
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,600
headache trying to forget out if you

373
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,449
don't already know that I know I did so

374
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:23,519
there are different ways to embed an SVG

375
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,829
the first one is using an image tag just

376
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:28,410
like you would use any image using an

377
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,120
image tag you can do that with SVG as

378
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,970
well for security reasons many

379
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,560
browsers are going to be to disable

380
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,529
external styles interactivity and

381
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:39,930
scripting on an SVG when it is embedded

382
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,970
using an image tag the same thing

383
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,949
applies to the sixth one I should have

384
00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:45,899
reordered these by the way but it's okay

385
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,970
I kind of like jumping back and down up

386
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,480
and down so this the when you're when

387
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,339
using an SVG as a background image using

388
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,589
CSS which is number six at bottom the

389
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:57,060
same thing applies just like with an

390
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,189
image tag no external styles will be

391
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:01,170
applied no interactivity no CSS

392
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,079
animations you can also embed an SVG

393
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,560
inline that's number five inline using

394
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,389
an SVG tag I think this is one of the

395
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:11,790
most popular ways to that we're using

396
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:15,180
today SVG the SVG tag using an iframe

397
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,220
and using an embed tag and using an

398
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,490
object tag which means that two three

399
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,990
four and five are going to preserve

400
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,209
style ability interactivity and CSS

401
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:26,910
animations now the most the most

402
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,899
suitable of all these four techniques I

403
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:33,689
wouldn't say the most suitable but the

404
00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:36,629
SVG inline embedding SVG inline is

405
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,519
really nice if you're willing to drop

406
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,430
some backwards compatibility the the

407
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,949
iframe is okay but if you use an iframe

408
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:47,100
then controlling your SVG from the main

409
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,870
page where you're aware you're embedding

410
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,970
it is going to be a little hard the

411
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,300
embed tag has never been part of any

412
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,730
specification so but it's wyman

413
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,959
supported because it's used for

414
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,509
embedding some some kind of content that

415
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:02,759
rely on it on a plugin like a dope like

416
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,470
Adobe Flash and the object tag the

417
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,140
object tag is is one of my favorites it

418
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,510
is my favorite because it allows you to

419
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,939
provide a fallback image between the

420
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:17,339
opening and the closing object tag so if

421
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,020
the if your SVG image cannot be rendered

422
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,610
for any reason the browser is just going

423
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,010
to render the fallback in between okay

424
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,880
so this table shows just which the

425
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,830
techniques and whether or not each one

426
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,100
supports or preserves links external

427
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,350
Styles interactivity and CSS animations

428
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,419
there is a note here that if you're

429
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,600
going to use an image to embed an SVG

430
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,669
the CSS animations applied are not going

431
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:43,140
to work however if you use SVG

432
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,450
animations they are going to be

433
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:45,820
preserved

434
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,430
so I have an example here a very simple

435
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,040
example it's bear CSS with SVG it's

436
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,170
basically a bear with a fish in his hand

437
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,830
very happy it's going to be eating it so

438
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,170
I've added an animation just to animate

439
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,030
the fish a little it's trying to it's

440
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,250
not it's trying to you know get away

441
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,930
because no one likes to be eaten by a

442
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,030
bear of course so I've added the

443
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,530
animations in the first example using

444
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,990
CSS animations and then I embedded it as

445
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,750
an image the one on the left and I've

446
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,610
used the one on the right embedding it

447
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,610
as an object tag the CSS animations are

448
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,530
not preserved on the Left they are

449
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,510
preserved on the right and I've added a

450
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,340
hover interaction to the image the

451
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,930
helper interaction is preserved if

452
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,210
you're using an object tag and it is not

453
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,980
preserved if unity if you're using an

454
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,380
image okay

455
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,630
then I've recreated the same example but

456
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,550
instead of applying instead of using a

457
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,710
CSS animation to animate the fish I use

458
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,350
the anim transform element which is an

459
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,020
SVG animation and then I embedded is

460
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,450
that embedded it as an image again here

461
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,060
on the left the SVG animation is

462
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,490
preserved but any other interactions on

463
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,620
hover are not preserved so this example

464
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,350
the takeaway here is that CSS animations

465
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,760
are not going to be preserved if you use

466
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,060
an image tag but SVG animations will be

467
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,410
preserved but without any interactions

468
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:09,130
next up responsive fine SVG s now SVG is

469
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,050
usually when you export them from an SVG

470
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,390
editor and SVG has a height and a width

471
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,240
and any element it would be at HTML or

472
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,950
SVG or whatever if you specify a height

473
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,810
and width it's not fluid anymore so

474
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,070
featuring this section is a really nice

475
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,250
owl it's a very happy owl I'm not a cat

476
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,720
person so you won't be seeing any cats

477
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,630
in my presentation sorry about that

478
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:36,040
yeah so I have this SVG of an owl when I

479
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,810
exported it it had a width and a height

480
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,190
so the first step to special

481
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:44,020
responsibility and the height and to add

482
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,610
the view box if you don't already have

483
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,800
it the view box is very important

484
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,380
because the next step you're going to

485
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,120
want to preserve the aspect ratio of the

486
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,970
SVG as you as you resize it as as it

487
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,980
shrinks or expands you want the aspect

488
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,840
ratio to be preserved however without

489
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,790
the view box attribute the preserve

490
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,400
aspect ratio has no effect so you need

491
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,770
to have both now the preserve aspect

492
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,720
ratio can take one of many values and

493
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,450
the value that you're most likely going

494
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,730
to be using is the x-men why men with

495
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,920
the keyword meat basically what this

496
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,990
value means is that the browser is going

497
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,840
to resize the image while preserving the

498
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,050
aspect ratio expanding it enough so that

499
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,440
the entire view box of the SVG is

500
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,270
visible within the viewport and it's

501
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,650
going to be expanding it as much as

502
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,540
possible while while preserving the

503
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:36,720
other two options are no restrictions

504
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,000
okay after okay now that we've said all

505
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,890
the SVG attributes remove the ones that

506
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,300
we don't need and other the ones that we

507
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,340
do need we're going to embed and drop it

508
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,290
in a container now because this is just

509
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,540
a wrapper and no it doesn't it doesn't

510
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,800
really have any semantics we were

511
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,780
probably going to be using a div I've

512
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,240
given it a class of my SVG containers

513
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,370
now SVG's as I mentioned before can be

514
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,410
embedded as object image or inline SVG

515
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,270
the technique this technique is

516
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,280
responsive fiying technique by the

517
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,160
responsive I should totally be a word

518
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,470
yeah yeah I mean if selfie got into the

519
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,520
generate then yeah so you can use any

520
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,350
embedding technique and this is still

521
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,800
going to work okay so after you've

522
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,720
wrapped it in a container you're going

523
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,370
to apply the padding hack on the

524
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,290
container now how many of you are

525
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,770
familiar with the padding hack oh not

526
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:30,370
not a lot okay so basically the padding

527
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,220
hack allows you to give an element's a

528
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,260
width and a height it is a hack however

529
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:40,090
you're going to see that it is a like

530
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,130
really hack it's not a technique that

531
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,230
well we should have a standard way in

532
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,690
CSS that the idea behind it is to give

533
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,180
the element a height and the width while

534
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,730
preserving a specific ratio of the

535
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,770
height to the width now the way this

536
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,590
works is the height is given the element

537
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,380
is given a height zero because we want

538
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,630
to be able to give it a height that is

539
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,170
risk that is relative to the to the

540
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,970
width the first so first we're going to

541
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,770
give it a height zero we're going to

542
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:11,920
position two giving it to give it two to

543
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,160
give

544
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,470
it a position relative this is going to

545
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,240
create a positioning context for the SVG

546
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,210
we're going to talk about the snacks now

547
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,340
the width can be anything you want

548
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,930
depending on where you want to put it on

549
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,460
the page you want to give you want to

550
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,170
give it a full width half worth whatever

551
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,660
the width is anything you want and the

552
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,410
padding top is the SVG height the one

553
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,540
that we removed before over the SVG

554
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,420
width time the times the width value of

555
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,460
the container that you can set to

556
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,370
whatever value you want now the reason

557
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:45,850
behind using padding top to expand the

558
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,550
element is that the padding top is set

559
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,530
relative to the when you're using a

560
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,630
percentage value to specify the padding

561
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,510
the top and the bottom padding the

562
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,220
percentage is set relative to the width

563
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,140
of the element not relative to the

564
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,600
height so when you're specifying a

565
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,580
padding beat a top padding or a bottom

566
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,120
padding or a bottom bottom padding using

567
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,210
percentages that padding and that height

568
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,710
that we're going to get is going to be

569
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,720
relative to the width and so you're

570
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,220
going to be able to maintain a specific

571
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:20,470
ratio now the idea is to give the SVG

572
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,260
container a ratio of high to its that

573
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,510
that is the same as the ratio of height

574
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,270
and width to of the SVG oh my god I'm

575
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:32,890
totally ok so in this for my example for

576
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,310
owl that SVG the padding top is 300 over

577
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,050
300 because the height and width are

578
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:41,230
both 300 times 100 which is the width

579
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,790
I've given it I've given it a full width

580
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,820
and you get a 100% padding top however

581
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,770
if the width of the container is for

582
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,750
example 60% if you don't want to give it

583
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,660
if you don't want to expand it to the

584
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,430
entire width of its container the

585
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,290
padding top is going to be 300 over 300

586
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,900
times 60 which gives us 60%

587
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,780
now if the owl now in this case it just

588
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,760
happens that the out the owl image is a

589
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,920
perfect square height equal width but if

590
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,750
they are not equal for example if it has

591
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,840
a 250 width and a height of 400 pixels

592
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,760
the padding top would be calculated by

593
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,750
dividing 400 by 250 times 100 and that

594
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,990
would be 160 percent it's all just

595
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,300
basically it's basically just math you

596
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,120
use the padding hack and give

597
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,039
values depending on the height on the

598
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,529
width of the SVG that's just it's very

599
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:31,080
simple and then you position the SVG

600
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,700
inside the container we've given the

601
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,880
container a position:relative because

602
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,039
well the height has been collapsed the

603
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,419
container has been collapsed and we've

604
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,760
given it a padding so the sqg is not

605
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,950
going to be and where you expect it to

606
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,539
be it's going to be pushed down by the

607
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:47,130
amount of padding that you've given the

608
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,260
container so in order to push it up

609
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,779
again you give it you use an absolute

610
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:55,020
value no you use position absolute and

611
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,299
just put it at the top left corner of

612
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:00,450
the element now with 100% of for the SVG

613
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,130
is only required if you're you if you're

614
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,710
embedding it using an image tag so it's

615
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,480
basically just math and then a padding

616
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,059
hat and then you just resize this is my

617
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:10,049
favorite part

618
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:12,419
I do this for almost every website that

619
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:14,490
I visit I have to resize that that's the

620
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:17,610
first thing that I do yeah it's really

621
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:18,260
fun

622
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,169
so animating SVG's with CSS now that we

623
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:24,149
know how to style as VG's how to add the

624
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:28,380
styles and how to embed them we're going

625
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,299
to you're going to choose if you're

626
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:31,740
going to apply CSS animations you're

627
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,110
going to choose as CSS an embedding

628
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,399
technique that allows you to preserve

629
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:38,730
these animations now most of our

630
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,710
animations like the real impressive ones

631
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,240
are going to have some kind of

632
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,570
transforming transformations and it's so

633
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:47,850
SP SPG's respond to the transform and

634
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,399
transform origin properties just kind of

635
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:52,620
just like an HTML element would would do

636
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,490
but there are some vertical differences

637
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,110
first to be the first one is that the

638
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,020
transform origin on an HTML element and

639
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,020
an SVG an SVG element is different if

640
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,059
you have an HTML element it has a box

641
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:08,940
model so it has a padding margin it has

642
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,559
a box model by babban but an SVG does

643
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:17,490
not so that transform origin the default

644
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,470
value for the transform origin on an

645
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:24,120
HTML on an HTML element is 50% by 50%

646
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,919
which is the center of the element which

647
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,559
is what you'd normally expect however if

648
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,570
you have an SVG element like a circle or

649
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,330
a rectangle the transform origin is set

650
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,330
to 0 0 it's used 0 0 is the top-left

651
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,320
corner not of the

652
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,110
itself but of the SVG canvas of the

653
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,450
entire SVG canvas so if you're going to

654
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,149
rotate an element this is most this is

655
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:47,490
usually obvious the transform origin is

656
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,750
mostly obvious when you're rotating an

657
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,259
element so if you had a div and HTML

658
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:54,090
element and you have an SVG rectangle

659
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,179
and you rotate apply a transformation

660
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:59,940
rotate it by 45 degrees the HTML element

661
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,470
is going to be rotated around its center

662
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:04,080
but the SVG element rectangle is going

663
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,149
to be rotated around the top left corner

664
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:10,110
of the SVG canvas so in most cases you

665
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,080
will want to change the transform origin

666
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,970
of an SVG element and place it at the

667
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,279
center of the element you'd think that

668
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,309
this is very simple but it's not

669
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:21,419
first of all setting the transform

670
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:24,210
origin on SVG well it is simple in a

671
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,769
sense technically it is simple but

672
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,570
because we're now living in a perfect

673
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,220
web world and because of all the bugs

674
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,879
that we get that's well it sucks it

675
00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:35,370
basically sucks so you can set it

676
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,679
transform origin on SVG elements using

677
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,600
percentage values or using absolute

678
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,730
length values like pixels for example if

679
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,039
you set them using percentage values the

680
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,870
value is set relative to the elements

681
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,179
bounding box which includes the stroke

682
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:50,429
used to draw its border if you're using

683
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:52,320
absolute length values the origin is set

684
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,929
relative to the SVG canvas pretty simple

685
00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:58,590
now so if we're going to if you if we go

686
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,539
go back to the same example we have a

687
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:02,610
div and HTML element and a rectangle in

688
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,429
SVG and we set the transform origin to

689
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:09,509
50% but by 50% 50% on the rectangle and

690
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:11,580
side the SVG it is rotated around its

691
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,679
own center okay because we're using

692
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,519
percentage values heads-up this is the

693
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:19,740
first part transform origin issue and

694
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,590
Firefox basically setting the transform

695
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,870
origin and percentages and Firefox on an

696
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,450
SVG element does not work it is a bug it

697
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,610
has been filed it should not be a

698
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,289
problem if you're not rotating anything

699
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:34,679
but it will be a problem if you are so

700
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,289
you will want to currently at the time

701
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:38,970
being just use absolute values to set

702
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,519
the the transform origin on an SVG

703
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,889
element this is a very simple example a

704
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,019
pinwheel I don't look at it too much I

705
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:48,659
don't want you getting dizzy on me so in

706
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:50,580
order to write two rows

707
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,240
it I use a percentage value for a chrome

708
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,279
or for WebKit to set the transform

709
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,260
origin and I've used absolute values to

710
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,390
set the transform origin and to make it

711
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,059
work in Firefox okay so this looks

712
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:05,159
simple just use percentage values and

713
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:09,029
absolute values for Firefox however five

714
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:10,380
days ago when I was working on the

715
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,990
slides and I was preparing this demo I

716
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,000
was zooming in and out I was doing out

717
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,279
because I wanted to take a smaller

718
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,080
screen recording to add to this slide

719
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:26,830
and as I started zooming out I got this

720
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,309
the element is not transforming around

721
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:32,820
its own center anymore in chrome if

722
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,370
you're using transform origin and chrome

723
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,799
with percentage values which do work

724
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,809
try not to zoom the page in and out

725
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:41,659
because it's going to mess everything up

726
00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:45,059
yeah this is also a bug I talked to jerk

727
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,190
shoulder from Adobe and he filed a bug

728
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,720
he said that it should be fairly simple

729
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,740
to solve and that it may may be solved

730
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,929
fixed not sold fixed before my

731
00:29:54,929 --> 00:29:59,190
presentation but I think it didn't so

732
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,049
yeah zooming in and out in WebKit blank

733
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,460
does not maintain the transform origin

734
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,110
at the center of the rotating element

735
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:07,019
and it's a book and Firefox it does not

736
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:08,399
happen because you're using absolute

737
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,260
values and the the transform origin is

738
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,820
set relative to the entire canvas

739
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,039
zooming in and out causes no problems at

740
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:17,220
at all so for the time being just use

741
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,260
absolute values till all the bugs have

742
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,000
been fixed

743
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,320
another heads up is hardware

744
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,330
acceleration and chrome when you're

745
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,639
applying CSS 3d transformations to an

746
00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:28,320
HTML element they are automatically

747
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,710
hardware accelerated and Chrome however

748
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,360
if you're applying these transformations

749
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,220
to an SVG element they're not just that

750
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,169
in chrome they are not Firefox does

751
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:43,470
apply some kind of hardware acceleration

752
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,230
for transformation CSS transformations

753
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,139
on SVG elements but and chrome it

754
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:51,240
they're not hardware accelerated so if

755
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,480
you do see some a world you know

756
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,669
flickering and all that it's it's normal

757
00:30:56,669 --> 00:31:00,360
just they're not hardware accelerated my

758
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,450
last section animating SVG paths I can't

759
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,470
believe I made it this far no honestly

760
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:10,770
okay so animating SVG paths there are

761
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,750
different effects that you can create if

762
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,440
you're going to any to animate SVG paths

763
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,389
actually SVG paths are one of the most

764
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:21,179
powerful features of SVG you can create

765
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,429
some really impressive effects by

766
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:26,220
animating them one of the most popular

767
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,100
recently effect is by creating an

768
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,279
animated line drawing using using CSS

769
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:36,360
now you can do it and CSS but in order

770
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,970
to animate an SVG path as if it were

771
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,620
drawing you know as if you were drawing

772
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:44,159
itself has have many of you seen the X

773
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,309
Box I think it was the X Box website I'm

774
00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:49,620
not sure just ignore it okay to animate

775
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,039
an SVG path and a Kathak like draw

776
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,350
itself you need to know its exact length

777
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,480
if you know its exact length it becomes

778
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,309
very simple you just set the stroke -

779
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:01,409
array and - offset to the path length

780
00:32:01,409 --> 00:32:04,380
which you know already apply transition

781
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,659
and for and then on hover or click or

782
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:08,940
whatever you just set this stroke -

783
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,649
offset to zero and the line is going to

784
00:32:10,649 --> 00:32:12,809
animate itself it's going to start with

785
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:14,190
no line and then it's going to be

786
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,779
animated as if it as if you're actually

787
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:19,159
drawing it this is a very simple example

788
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:24,980
now in this case I downloaded this SVG I

789
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,620
just started trying different values

790
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,120
because I didn't want to use JavaScript

791
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,770
to animate it so I just started drawing

792
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,270
different values and it turned out that

793
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,360
the value 4000 was enough so I just

794
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,090
applied it the stroke - array and -

795
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,090
offset I gave them the 4000 value added

796
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:45,659
a transition and on hover the cities

797
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:48,929
just lit up and then the the lamp is

798
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:52,230
animated the full color of the inner

799
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,659
lamp changes and I've added a gradient

800
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:58,139
which transitions animates very smoothly

801
00:32:58,139 --> 00:33:06,629
of course the light lighting the lamp up

802
00:33:06,629 --> 00:33:09,120
happens after the line animation where a

803
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,730
finishes so there is a transition delay

804
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,170
applied and the

805
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:17,750
and a lamp animation transition is and

806
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:21,960
six seconds oh yeah six seconds so I've

807
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,250
waited till the animation of the line

808
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,570
was finished and then I've lit the lamp

809
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,670
up well like I said there isn't really

810
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:29,100
any impressive demos here however there

811
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,780
is one impressive demo I found online

812
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:35,430
which is this one I found it on the GD

813
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,940
studio it's I think it's a French studio

814
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,890
the really nice thing about it is the

815
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,770
the flame is first turned off you click

816
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,510
it and then an image and animation

817
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,490
starts now you can recreate this

818
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,530
animation using CSS if you know if you

819
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:52,590
know all of the length and you just play

820
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:55,920
with the values of the delays and it's

821
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:02,190
really it's very possible yeah so the

822
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,410
animation is very slow on PowerPoint I

823
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,120
think yeah it's an issue with the

824
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,770
PowerPoint okay now in most cases if you

825
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,300
want to create an animated line drawing

826
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,700
effect you may not know the length that

827
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,409
the absolute length of the path so you

828
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:18,120
will want to retrieve it using

829
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,360
javascript there is there is a method in

830
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,760
JavaScript to retrieve the path length

831
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,090
it is path dot get total it is get total

832
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:31,830
path get total length okay that's the

833
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:34,740
method and then you just use JavaScript

834
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,050
to set this tractor or - array and -

835
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,870
offset just like we did earlier so the

836
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,730
whole idea is just to know the path

837
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,980
length and then that set the stroke -

838
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,690
array and - offset to that length and

839
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:49,800
animated okay so if you want to know

840
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,240
more about these techniques about the

841
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:56,280
how-tos and how it works yeah I suggest

842
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,780
that you read this article by Jake

843
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,610
Archibald it's a really excellent one

844
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:02,190
you it has an interactive demo in it and

845
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:05,460
it's very very simple you just recommend

846
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,840
you read it if you want to know more

847
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,810
about this now another way to animate

848
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:12,780
SVG paths is by morphing paths where you

849
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,210
start with the one shape and you finish

850
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:18,120
with another now you don't need to know

851
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,240
any path lengths in this case you just

852
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,160
need to know the starting shape and the

853
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,810
finishing shape and you just animate

854
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,280
them however this is

855
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,440
possible in CSS there is no way n CSS

856
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,360
that you can specify a beginning part

857
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,950
and finishing path and possibly even

858
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,680
intermediate intermediate parts too and

859
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,630
then animate them there is no way I

860
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,430
think there should be a way so I hope

861
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,280
that someday we get a way to do that

862
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,740
this this effect that you can see is the

863
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,170
Mac OSX uni effector created by Manuela

864
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,850
from code drops it's one of my favorite

865
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:50,610
SVG path animation effects it's really

866
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,530
great so you see you start with an arrow

867
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:55,410
shape and then it morphs into a full

868
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:59,820
width just rectangle so yeah the idea is

869
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,660
to create an SVG path with one part to

870
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,130
morph and to morph it into another one

871
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,930
you only the first path the second path

872
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,760
and possibly intermediate paths if you

873
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,820
want your animation to go through

874
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,460
specific shapes in between and there is

875
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,620
no way and CSS to an image one SVG path

876
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,830
into another at the time being okay so

877
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,780
in order to do that if you want to be

878
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,030
able to manipulate SVG paths I recommend

879
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:27,060
you use this snap SVG library it's very

880
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,550
it's awesome at the website describes it

881
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:33,240
as being it makes dealing with SVG nodes

882
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,850
as easy as jQuery makes manipulating the

883
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:38,160
Dom easy okay

884
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,130
and now animated SVG's can be used as

885
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,110
gif replacement this is one of my

886
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:47,310
favorite things I this code this code

887
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:51,990
nut code this code I found it on the oak

888
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,810
website the oak studio and in this

889
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,910
article the link to the article is at

890
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,190
the bottom the writer says that by using

891
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:02,280
animated SVG's instead of gif s we were

892
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,950
able to reduce our page size from 1.6

893
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:08,700
megabytes to 389 kilobytes and reduce

894
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,730
our page load time from 8.75 seconds to

895
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,190
412 milliseconds that's a huge

896
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,070
difference it's it's really great so if

897
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,040
you ever can use SVG s for simple

898
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,080
animations instead of using a gif then

899
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:26,370
by all means go for it and before I

900
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,740
finish my talk it's really important not

901
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,570
to forget don't forget to make SVG is

902
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:33,690
accessible SVG's are images and every

903
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,550
any kind of content that you're going to

904
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,960
use in web page you have to make it

905
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,180
accessible if you can do it

906
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,580
one of the best articles my favorite SVG

907
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,890
articles is this article by Leonie

908
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,720
Watson written for the side point

909
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,620
website

910
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,690
