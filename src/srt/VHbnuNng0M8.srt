00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,460

it's my first time here and it's just

2
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,340
the the best combination of like green

3
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,710
and big city and great public

4
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,920
transportation and cool bars and

5
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,810
actually really excellent food so

6
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,540
obviously the the best way to get to a

7
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,610
conference is to speak at it and I would

8
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,440
encourage pretty much anyone who even

9
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,660
thinks they have an idea to a submitter

10
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,420
a CFP you know it's just a great

11
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,040
opportunity to meet like the coolest

12
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,110
people doing the coolest programming

13
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,720
language and I don't think there's a way

14
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,580
you could regret it it's just been you

15
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,090
know nothing but fun and learning and a

16
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,070
you know community that that sense of

17
00:01:51,070 --> 00:02:07,859
like we're all in this together

18
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:10,759
really enjoy about jas kana it's

19
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,790
fantastic all the speakers are great got

20
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,620
a lot of friends who also came here so

21
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,240
just like people i know from from other

22
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,340
conferences and other other states other

23
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,860
countries it's it's a it's a great

24
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,430
gathering spot I think really fun my

25
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,200
biggest takeaway is probably that the

26
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,900
community is so massive and so large and

27
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,870
so friendly still there's so many people

28
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,280
to meet but everyone's really

29
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,360
approachable everyone's really friendly

30
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,180
no one feels like oh I've been here

31
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,160
before so I'm veteran I don't need to

32
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,650
talk to the new people there they really

33
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,080
feel like they'll guide you along if you

34
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,250
don't know what you're doing or they'll

35
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,840
sit down and talk with you and discuss

36
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,880
any type of topic that you're really

37
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,820
interested in um I love everything about

38
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,459
the conference so my first time here was

39
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:57,860
actually last year one of I got at

40
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,500
Pickett's it was sponsored by Google

41
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,510
because they were trying to support more

42
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,569
women in tech and I love the community

43
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:08,269
here I love the warm welcome that I got

44
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:10,549

45
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:12,829

46
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:14,720
