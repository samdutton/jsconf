00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:15,139

okay and I'm here to as a last minute

2
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:19,190
kind of request to back on the excellent

3
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:24,290
presentation by Sarah Sweden on SVG to

4
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,940
make a long story short

5
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,890
Sarah was originally going to talk about

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,360
shapes and I was really going to talk

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,940
about his Fiji and she got in and I

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,620
didn't quite get him but then she

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,410
changed your mind so I'm gonna try and

10
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,899
do a accessory top to that featuring a

11
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:43,159
little bit of my own work and talking

12
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,780
about some of the things that Sarah

13
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,010
didn't have time to address but I would

14
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,629
recommend that if you're watching this

15
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:53,420
now you go see Sarah's verse so you can

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,659
get the basics from her but I'm going to

17
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:58,760
start off from just a little bit of

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,729
perspective so I am lovely story at

19
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:08,270
Dublin on Twitter I have a blog called

20
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,060
demosthenes dot info where I write about

21
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,750
web development and I'm a by trade I'm

22
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,149
web development teacher that's what I do

23
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:20,450
I teach full-time part-time night

24
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,020
classes all the time that's what I do

25
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,899
I'm also a writer I published through a

26
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:30,740
press last year Pro css3 animation and

27
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,630
I'm also a contributing editor to

28
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,329
Smashing Magazine I do their coding

29
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:38,950
section so most of the requests for and

30
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,890
offers of writers come for coding at

31
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,390
least come through me for special

32
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:52,729
magazine so it's VG s VG's been thought

33
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:59,600
of and debated and worked through as a

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,399
kind of very often as this foreign thing

35
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,320
thus foreign not terribly understandable

36
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,590
kind of battle against

37
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,880
and it's really not right we really

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,880
shouldn't think of SVG and CSS as being

39
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,099
enemies or even being frenemies they

40
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,390
really are two parts the same side so

41
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,950
don't think of them as battling each

42
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,450
other just think of them as one tool

43
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,400
that's like a kick-ass light saber

44
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,890
that's essentially the joined together

45
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,620
and I'll show you ways in which both CSS

46
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,160
and SVG and ultimately HTML can really

47
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,930
start to complement each other they're

48
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,350
not oh it's only just as SVG or it's

49
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,390
only just CS yes the two really do start

50
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,650
to work to give him very interesting

51
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,470
kinds of ways so I'm going to give a

52
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:01,680
very quick little breakdown of a couple

53
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,299
of things that people need to do again

54
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:05,310
Sarah covered a little bit of this but

55
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,510
I'm going to do a in addition some of

56
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,060
this is again from my blog but I'll give

57
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,459
you your ELLs so Adobe Illustrator work

58
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,590
for SVG production so very quickly if

59
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,590
you know and most people will be using

60
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,350
Adobe Illustrator to get some sort of

61
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,540
work out if you know that you're going

62
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,989
to be using Adobe Illustrator for export

63
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:36,870
to SVG then there's a couple of things

64
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,660
that you do want to do you'll want to

65
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,120
set up your canvas in pixels and that

66
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,609
seems kind of weird at the first because

67
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:47,130
SVG is meant to be the scale free

68
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,049
doesn't matter what kind of Units you

69
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:52,769
use and that's true but it's easiest if

70
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:54,930
you set up a canvas first in pixels

71
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,459
because it's the easiest thing to relate

72
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,769
to it doesn't mean that your SVG is

73
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:00,900
limited to a certain pixel dimension

74
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,819
don't get that me here at all but it

75
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:06,000
does help move things across work out

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,259
where components are that sort of stuff

77
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:14,730
the artboard that you make so whatever

78
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,200
size of artboard you want to make is

79
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,350
perfectly fine but the artboard is going

80
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,560
to become the view box of the SVG

81
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,450
essentially although view box does a lot

82
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,090
of things in SVG it's

83
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,960
the visible area of your SVG so if you

84
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,180
want to do things off canvas that's

85
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,380
perfectly fine

86
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,080
just make sure that your your art your

87
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,830
borders a certain size but if you want

88
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,240
to make it larger later that's perfectly

89
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,100
fine as well just be aware that the two

90
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,380
will by default match up in Illustrator

91
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,139
again you can change them

92
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:52,130
SVG again in illustrator will set itself

93
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,610
up to CMYK don't make the mistake that

94
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,020
generations of people have made when

95
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,330
using these tools and setup for CMYK

96
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,880
when you really want RGB in most cases

97
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,919
so make sure it's RGB the thing to

98
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:09,970
remember about making components in

99
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,660
Illustrator is that as you make them the

100
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,240
way that I like to think about SVG is

101
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,789
you're making drawings as data you're

102
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:21,979
not just making pretty lines you're not

103
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:24,289
just making curves you're making

104
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:27,669
drawings as data so as you build things

105
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:30,470
give them some sort of naming convention

106
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,539
get any kind of naming convention it's

107
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:34,370
fine as long as you're consistent and

108
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,039
you stick to it so stick to building

109
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,770
something and name everything as you

110
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,289
build it while it's not absolutely

111
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:44,810
necessary to do so it becomes a whole

112
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,470
lot easier later when you're trying to

113
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:52,120
then manipulate that as a purist VG

114
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,460
simplify it's a couple of things as a

115
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,400
rule I use the fewest number of points

116
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,710
to create a shape again a lot of people

117
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:06,860
will start to use point point point

118
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,720
point point to try and get something on

119
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,030
the screen don't do that try and use the

120
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,820
fewest number of numbers of points I try

121
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,880
to avoid filters in adobe illustrator as

122
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,479
they're not yet translated into SVG with

123
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,419
the adobe illustrator xpg export so

124
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:26,479
don't tend to do that don't stroke

125
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,849
things if you don't have to stroking is

126
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:31,669
going to add another level or layer to

127
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:33,200
your SVG that you really don't need if

128
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,030
you need it fine but if you don't make

129
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,960
sure it's not there

130
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,030
and try to keep polygons and circles as

131
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,430
geometrical objects don't try to break

132
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,680
them apart create a background if

133
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,590
necessary understand that SVG elements

134
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,330
are transparent by default they're

135
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,400
automatically off mask that's awesome

136
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,360
but it means that there's no body to add

137
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,070
SVG element there's nothing there that

138
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,919
you can say oh okay I'm just going to

139
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,930
color the background of this black or

140
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,580
whatever it happens to be you can do

141
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,449
that in the body element of your HTML

142
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:11,400
page where the CSS is sorry where the

143
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,259
SVG is ultimately going to be used but

144
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,599
you can't do an SVG itself short of

145
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,340
drawing a giant rectangle or something

146
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:23,490
behind the whole ad board you can kind

147
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,620
of sort of do a background on the SVG

148
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,970
itself using as well we'll take a look

149
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,639
at this a little bit you can use CSS to

150
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,520
create backgrounds so it's it's possible

151
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,990
to do you're just going to be a little

152
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,280
bit careful about how to do it

153
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,430
finally if if possible before exporting

154
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,099
from illustrator to SVG try and merge

155
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:51,449
shapes so use a finer tools try and

156
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:53,639
merge them together if possible again

157
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,970
fewer elements simple elements better

158
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,310
doesn't mean the SVG can't be complex

159
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,630
doesn't mean it can't involve a lot of

160
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,400
Elam's but obviously the fewer things

161
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,330
you have and better finally I decide how

162
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,550
you're going to treat your text it's

163
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,280
important to understand that you can in

164
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,900
SVG have takes the text so it's readable

165
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,770
it's styler belitz everything else but

166
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,870
with the downsides that we've

167
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,090
experienced with the text readable style

168
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:27,509
text on the web forever that is you

169
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:29,220
might try and load a font and the font

170
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,259
doesn't load right if you're trying to

171
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:36,149
use a special kind of fun so it has all

172
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,550
the same problems in that regard or you

173
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,289
can break apart you can absolutely break

174
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:44,010
it into outlines downside of that is you

175
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,779
it's not readable anymore it's purely

176
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:48,000
path information you just can't use it

177
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,750
that way anymore

178
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,009
so do you try to make a decision about

179
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:55,379
is this going to be readable because it

180
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:57,839
is by Google by everything else they

181
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,490
leave it us takes style it and

182
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,379
understand that ok

183
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:03,269
styles might not always be applied in

184
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:04,709
every circumstance we've got to be

185
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,319
careful with that or you want it exactly

186
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:08,790
that way but you don't want it

187
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,439
ultimately readable by anything but you

188
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:12,209
want it manipulable so you can move

189
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:15,360
points around then absolutely break it

190
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,759
and convert into outlets

191
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:19,410
finally crop the outcrop the Apple no

192
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,180
point in having areas that you don't

193
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,810
need and export to SVG one thing to keep

194
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:33,100
in mind about that the export for SVG

195
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,240
adobe illustrator kind of even adobe

196
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,819
illustrator CC kind of sort of lies to

197
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:41,939
you it does allow an export it

198
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:48,120
absolutely does but adobe illustrator CC

199
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,449
has this semi vaunted new feature of

200
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:57,899
make responsive and it's not totally

201
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:58,379
true

202
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:00,540
it goes part of the way it removes the

203
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,860
height and width elements which I'll get

204
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,040
into a little bit but it doesn't really

205
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,959
do everything that you need it to do in

206
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,480
most circumstances so take the make

207
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,699
responsive in option in SVG with a from

208
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:18,779
illustrator with a grain of salt there's

209
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:23,579
a one important point in illustrator do

210
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:26,790
try to you've got an option to reduce

211
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,750
the number of decimal points used in as

212
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,019
the export and honestly decimal points

213
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,509
are the position of each little element

214
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:38,879
the position of each and a point in the

215
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,360
SVG drawing you don't need three decimal

216
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,449
places for drawings in the vast majority

217
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:48,059
of circumstances so if you can avoid

218
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:49,709
that because all it does is add file

219
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:51,480
space it just makes the SVG larger or

220
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,300
longer if you possibly can reduce the

221
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,009
number of decimal points to ideally one

222
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:59,300
all those stuff can ultimately be done

223
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,620
post-processing with some of the tools

224
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,040
that

225
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,399
Sara talked about but why post-process

226
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,139
something when you can make sure it's

227
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:11,759
right the first time so and finally

228
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,440
obviously export the file as an SVG

229
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,079
treated as SVG it's all good to go from

230
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:22,170
that point okay basic SVG cleanup

231
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,690
so again Sara was talking a little bit

232
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:32,130
about how to make a SVG clean through

233
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,459
the nature of some tools and that's good

234
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:35,790
to know

235
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,069
and that's important it's also really

236
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:41,009
useful to know what those tools are

237
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:42,540
actually doing it's not terribly

238
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,459
complicated for the most part and if you

239
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:45,779
understand a little bit about what

240
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,480
they're doing then you can do this by

241
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,220
hand if the tool doesn't work you can

242
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,290
understand what might go wrong things of

243
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,940
that nature

244
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,279
so there's a couple of things generally

245
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:00,360
speaking the export of an SVG document

246
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,180
will be from illustrator from Inkscape

247
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,120
from a number of other tools will be

248
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,010
extremely verbose you'll have a lot of

249
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,949
information in there and while it's not

250
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:13,730
wrong to have the information in there

251
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,670
you can usually save yourself quite a

252
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,139
bit of space by doing a couple of things

253
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:23,550
so first of all note again that this in

254
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,269
this case has five decimal places for

255
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:33,209
the SVG points on the path and again

256
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:34,680
wouldn't be necessary I'd I could

257
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,750
post-process this take them out but I'm

258
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,920
not going to concentrate on that for

259
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,160
right now okay things you don't need you

260
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,260
honestly don't need in the vast majority

261
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,180
of cases unless you're doing some sort

262
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,959
of of deep deep dive with XML um you

263
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,089
don't need the external POG you don't

264
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:51,769
need the doctor

265
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:54,930
you don't just don't need them you do

266
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:59,069
need the XML NS namespacing stuff mostly

267
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:03,420
for the fact that without it's not going

268
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,009
to be valid so it may as well leave it

269
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:07,670
in version you don't take the clean need

270
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,920
with the height width and height other

271
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,950
things that for the most part

272
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,360
get people a little bit screwed up

273
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,110
because they they think that what's

274
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,630
constraining this thing is the width and

275
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,240
height or the view box I think the view

276
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,800
box out they get confused between the

277
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,240
two so I'll explain what's going on

278
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,550
there for right now take it out notice

279
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,710
that I actually changed

280
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,950
you don't need ID on the SVG element

281
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,660
itself unless you're doing a whole bunch

282
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,200
of work a whole bunch of SVG's on the

283
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,740
same page so again we can take that out

284
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,280
everything's fine

285
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,550
don't need it ID at the same time of

286
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,350
course make sure that it's still valid

287
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,580
make sure that everything is still

288
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,070
working don't need devs

289
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,500
very often unless it's defining a filter

290
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,560
or some other stuff do be careful about

291
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,840
group transforms you'll very often find

292
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,400
empty groups or groups that don't

293
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,860
actually do anything Google Group does

294
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,490
geez

295
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,470
if they don't do anything they can

296
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,020
usually be removed if there are groups

297
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,880
with IDs if they're groups with

298
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,010
transforms on them beat them the heck

299
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,750
alone you don't want to play around with

300
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,270
them because otherwise removing them or

301
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,750
changing blue eyes spoil your work then

302
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,980
there's a whole bunch of stuff in there

303
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,370
here's where it gets interesting okay so

304
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,860
I started off talking about the fact

305
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,980
that SVG and and CSS are really

306
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,900
copacetic they're really buddies they're

307
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,520
not fighting against each other so let

308
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,870
me demonstrate a couple of ways and what

309
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,720
tests true you can see that by default

310
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,050
most tools will put a lot of the styles

311
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,740
for this stuff inline doesn't need to be

312
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,800
in line at all doesn't it ever a path

313
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,080
I'm sorry an ID but doesn't need to be

314
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,960
in line at all you can do the self same

315
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,390
stuff that you've always been used to

316
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,210
and work with by doing an embedded style

317
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:08,630
tag inside the CSS and that style tag

318
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:13,290
can absolutely contain the vast majority

319
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,030
of the CSS that used to it it can

320
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,150
contain media queries it can contain

321
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,370
hovers it can contain most of the stuff

322
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,620
they used to again sarod that are very

323
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,650
nice little screen of here's what

324
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,470
the page will take is what it won't take

325
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,150
so there are some exceptions but for the

326
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,490
most part every every piece of CSS you

327
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,279
used to can actually be applied his word

328
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,110
gets interesting

329
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:41,250
so our path has an ID of path one let's

330
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,080
just change that this is called a Jedi

331
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,440
okay so it has an ID if it has an ID it

332
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,600
can be addressed like an ID or a class

333
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,950
or most anything else that you used to

334
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,950
it can be addressed as an ID just like

335
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,660
anything else right it's a fragment so

336
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,130
it's a piece on a page it's part of the

337
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:06,450
dom the really interesting part is this

338
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:11,900
stuff can get used as part of that style

339
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,970
we don't need even on we don't need

340
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:21,440
stroke in this case all right okay

341
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,050
so what's happening essentially we can

342
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,779
take many not all but many of the style

343
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:34,320
attributes from SVG and apply them as

344
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,190
styles in CSS that starts to make things

345
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,770
really neat and really interesting what

346
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:45,560
it means is that you can use any CSS

347
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,279
color in this case associated with that

348
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:54,720
style right so it means that you can

349
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,670
have immediate manipulation of this now

350
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,380
people get a little confused often

351
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,760
students I think you get a little

352
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,380
confused the first time I show them this

353
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,589
because they say but there's no fill

354
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:09,209
property does that mean I can now go on

355
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:11,040
to my normal agent email so a page and

356
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,100
say they've fill read no you can't it's

357
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,000
only applicable to SVG but within the

358
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,189
context of SVG it's perfectly understood

359
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:24,300
and perfectly reasonable so the the

360
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,209
really interesting part is that all the

361
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:29,670
CSS the apps are all CSS that you know

362
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,429
can absolutely be applied so if we say

363
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:37,360
let's say HSL hsla

364
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:46,650
goodness sake and we say okay 150% 50%

365
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:57,250
come 0.3 so yeah any HSL any colors any

366
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,380
kinds of things that you want to apply

367
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,290
you can absolutely do it doesn't mean

368
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,240
that you have to stick with hex if you

369
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,410
want to stick with the X that's

370
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,130
perfectly fine there's a Pasadena

371
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,620
okay so SVG has a thing called opacity

372
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:16,650
for obvious reason so fill opacity but

373
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:22,450
you can do capacity in however you want

374
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,970
to set it up in just the way that you

375
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,320
wouldn't see us yes all right it's a

376
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,660
it's a CSS thing so now we can use CSS

377
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:35,350
directly on our SVG okay you can do

378
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:40,030
hover fix inside your SVG just using CSS

379
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:46,240
so if you say let's say hover over their

380
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,460
element okay it's got an ID power over

381
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,790
let's say we want to do a partial fade

382
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:00,340
okay now there's a couple of interesting

383
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,230
things to note about that and of course

384
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:08,360
yeah you can transition as well right

385
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,780
let me push that down all the way down

386
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,440
to zero

387
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:18,399
so yeah it fans then it fades out so you

388
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,019
can absolutely do all the interface

389
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:22,620
stuff that you're used to and css3

390
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,960
applied to SVG there's a couple of

391
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,740
interesting things to note about this

392
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,210
SVG is defined by shapes

393
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,710
if the SVG is defined by shapes it's not

394
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,690
the box model you used to in the sense

395
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,889
that you'll notice that if this was a

396
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:43,419
picture like a pink and normal

397
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:45,610
circumstances as soon as you move over

398
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,039
the area of the thing right the

399
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:50,950
rectangular box that contains it then

400
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,769
this thing's going to activate right but

401
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:57,100
in SVG that doesn't count it really only

402
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,909
looks at the shape so I have to be over

403
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:04,419
that shape before anything happens and

404
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:07,539
that starts mean very very precise pixel

405
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,779
responses we've all seen icons big

406
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:13,090
rectangular icons with circular shapes

407
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,820
inside and the problem is you move over

408
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,009
the rectangular outside area and the

409
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,080
circle turns on or clicks or does

410
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,029
whatever it's going to do and it's a

411
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:25,299
Miss registration in SVG one of its real

412
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:27,879
advantages is there is no registration

413
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:30,340
if you make a shape and you say their

414
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,740
shape is a link or the shape has a hover

415
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,779
vehicle the shape has whatever that's

416
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:36,580
the shape and that's what registers

417
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,320
which makes it really really powerful

418
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,259
and very very good okay so that's your

419
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:47,860
basic SVG cleaner that's and some of the

420
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,929
ways in which you can start to use CSS

421
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:52,539
practically I'm just saying okay I've

422
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:54,850
got this SVG I want to make it hover the

423
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,100
one thing I should mention the one thing

424
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,580
you have to be aware of is that CSS

425
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,240
written inside the SVG it will affect

426
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,309
the appearance of the SVG but not as

427
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:08,619
interactivity in other words you can't

428
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:12,610
write a hover rule inside the SVG and

429
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,210
then take that SVG as an image and put

430
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,360
it on the page as image here's my SVG as

431
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,080
inside rage demo the the appearance will

432
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,080
work but the interactivity won't if you

433
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,430
want the interactivity

434
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,840
you've got to move it either as an

435
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,950
object or as a typically increasingly

436
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,110
just as a flat SVG straight inside the

437
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,180
HTML you just bonkers inside the HTML

438
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,520
and then you get all the interactivity

439
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,620
you get everything else so you've got to

440
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,420
be a little bit careful about okay I can

441
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,420
write rules absolutely but those rules

442
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,720
won't necessarily translate interactive

443
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,050
ways into the SVG as and as an actual

444
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,870
image but SVG straight on the page

445
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:01,120
absolutely well okay so a surprising

446
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,950
number of people in the conference that

447
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,280
we've just been attending don't know

448
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,300
about SVG filters or using filters in

449
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,250
general there was a quickl hand up and

450
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,780
very few people were using them and

451
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,990
that's surprising to me because one of

452
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,280
the things that we're talking about

453
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,790
increasingly is okay we want to get

454
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,680
pages loaded as quickly as possible we

455
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,510
want to have interactivity as snappy as

456
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,080
possible we want to not have a lot of

457
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,940
work to make things happen we don't want

458
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,190
to have to do multiple things in our

459
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:37,810
workflow so traditionally with filters

460
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,540
people think of filters with WebKit and

461
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,080
and understandably so because filters

462
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,270
and WebKit they've been in there for a

463
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,920
couple of years now and people say hey

464
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,560
they're really neat and it's it's

465
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,840
totally true you can absolutely while

466
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,700
they went through a couple of changes in

467
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,650
terms of the spec yeah you can

468
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:00,490
absolutely do filters in that way but

469
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:03,730
not too many people know that the same

470
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:07,180
filters were also built into IE up into

471
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:12,910
IE 8 right I'll talk a little bit about

472
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,780
IE 10 and 11 and so on so forth in a

473
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,290
second and very often they were really

474
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,750
simple stuff like that sorry this stuff

475
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:27,000
like this so all right so you have

476
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,970
Safari and at least modern Safari and

477
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,460
modern chrome covered with the modern

478
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,550
web kilt css3 thing that unfortunately

479
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,500
other browsers haven't great yet you

480
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,830
have

481
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,159
ie up nine covered by grace the

482
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:46,960
grayscale filter what do you do about

483
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,210
Firefox well in Firefox you can add a

484
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,770
tiny tiny little SVG farm and that SVG

485
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:05,649
file is so subtle but during various

486
00:24:05,649 --> 00:24:08,200
Fuji file is like the world's simplest

487
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:13,090
SVG it's tiny in this case to be fair

488
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:16,960
it's a color matrix the the nice thing

489
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,029
about this is you really don't need to

490
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:23,740
understand totally it's it's a matrix

491
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,580
math it's no big deal but you pop it

492
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,289
into a page or you can pop it in as a

493
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:31,059
separate file if you want to but it's

494
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:32,830
such so tiny I usually pop it straight

495
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,950
into the page okay what is it doing

496
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,880
very simply it's a bit of SVG that

497
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:46,519
essentially does the same filter job so

498
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:50,289
that fills the grayscale for the URL

499
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:51,640
grayscale because it looks at the ID

500
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,919
right in this case it hit the filter has

501
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,450
an ID of grayscale so I use it here and

502
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:01,080
it does the exact same job in Firefox

503
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,200
and the nice part about this is that you

504
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,510
now have the same thing and it's one of

505
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,390
the really good examples of progressive

506
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:13,029
enhancement unless you or your client

507
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:15,789
are real stickler for everything it has

508
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:18,250
to look exactly the same way generally

509
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,690
speaking people aren't going to be

510
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:23,230
hugely upset if they're in IE 10 for

511
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,230
instance and if they don't know that the

512
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,360
the thing is meant to be black and white

513
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,070
and then transitioning into color later

514
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,600
and they just see a color version

515
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,450
because ia 10 is a between a rock and a

516
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,399
hard place it doesn't use support the

517
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:39,010
web should be the WebKit css3 style

518
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,899
filters it doesn't do the SVG filters at

519
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:43,000
least in this way so unfortunately it's

520
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,830
in a rocky place at the moment

521
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,659
but if they don't they're not aware of

522
00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:49,240
that then that's fine the advantage is

523
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,519
you load one image once you want to turn

524
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,349
to SVG so you want to turn it into

525
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:56,239
grayscale that's that's perfectly fine

526
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:57,799
you had it you had a filter and it's

527
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:00,440
done you don't have to load multiple

528
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,209
versions of the image you don't have to

529
00:26:02,209 --> 00:26:03,830
have multiple HTTP requests you don't

530
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,119
have to do weird things with image

531
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:09,349
sprites they just done so it's it's nice

532
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:12,649
it makes a whole lot of sense to it you

533
00:26:12,649 --> 00:26:15,019
could do the same things same idea with

534
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:21,009
things like blur again traditional

535
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:22,999
Microsoft blur filters

536
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:30,529
okay so ie 8 etc etc modern blur filters

537
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:36,339
in terms of WebKit and blur in terms of

538
00:26:36,339 --> 00:26:40,369
SVG and you can transition the things as

539
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:42,889
well tell ya you can absolutely have

540
00:26:42,889 --> 00:26:49,039
blur on and off sepia toning totally

541
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:54,619
possible as well let me think from out

542
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:56,450
here but very quickly because I'm almost

543
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,769
out of time a couple of other areas in

544
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:02,359
which people don't necessarily

545
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:04,009
understand that is Fiji can start to be

546
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:06,200
used image maps for anybody who's been

547
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,849
around on the web for 10 years plus

548
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:12,950
we'll remember image maps and they went

549
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,629
in kind of the way of the dodo they're

550
00:27:14,629 --> 00:27:16,639
not responsive they will grind these big

551
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:18,409
cloud images but they still do have

552
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:20,599
their place they were actually really

553
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:23,509
good for touchscreens because especially

554
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,129
for kids because they could see them and

555
00:27:25,129 --> 00:27:26,749
they could touch them touch the pictures

556
00:27:26,749 --> 00:27:28,700
and navigate away from their problem was

557
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,869
they're not responsive at all

558
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:32,659
traditional image Maps copying SVG you

559
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:34,219
can absolutely make responsive image

560
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,289
maps because you can make SVG responsive

561
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:37,909
or you can put an image bitmap image to

562
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:40,940
the background and that hotspot will

563
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,889
exactly scale with the image as it moves

564
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:46,419
up and down which is really neat

565
00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:52,550
animated measurements using

566
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:56,510
clip areas you can clip out bitmap

567
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,750
photographs using parse and SVG you can

568
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,820
then again because it's perfect pixel

569
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,640
pixel perfect registration you can start

570
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,720
to both link those areas and animate

571
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,360
them inside had an article a knit

572
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,270
magazine a couple of months ago about

573
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,190
that same technique if you'll read up on

574
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:23,840
it perhaps my most fun adaptive

575
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,840
illustration so adaptive illustrations

576
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,260
are the idea that you can do media

577
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:35,830
queries inside of SVG so a lot of

578
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:42,260
traditional kinds of use of SVG is in

579
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,270
responsive design is making things small

580
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,160
again nothing wrong with making things

581
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,620
smaller rearranging them placing them in

582
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,060
different orders that's perfectly fine

583
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,810
what's somewhat unexplored I think is

584
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:57,590
the concept of well we we don't just

585
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,110
need to make things smaller we could

586
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:03,640
also do things like as an example

587
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,150
starting to remove components and you

588
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,920
can remove components you can see the

589
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,620
top there you can see other components

590
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,740
moving outside of this because each

591
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,070
fragment is identifiable inside that SVG

592
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,800
so you can absolutely remove them using

593
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,400
media queries and simplify designs not

594
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,460
just say okay this thing has to get

595
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,440
smaller and not just saying oh we have

596
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,730
to switch to something else but

597
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,530
literally simplifying diagrams on

598
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,830
smaller screens simplifying tree

599
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,570
diagrams for instance on smaller screens

600
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,250
because you don't have the space no one

601
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,140
sort of zoom in/out it's all kinds of

602
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,950
really wonderful possibilities there

603
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:50,270
very finally the CSS spec for gradients

604
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:53,780
is meant to have animation it's meant to

605
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,380
do it

606
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,840
and fortunately it doesn't know no one

607
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,270
to my knowledge no one supports it yet

608
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,970
which is really really unfortunate

609
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:04,460
however SVG has supported animation

610
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,180
gradients for a

611
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,840
forever so you can start do really

612
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,380
really interesting work but this comes

613
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:19,980
up by animating the actual gradients you

614
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:24,540
have to use animate tags inside of SVG

615
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:28,110
and they're not too dissimilar to the

616
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,270
concept of transitions so it takes a

617
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,650
little bit again you see but it's not

618
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,360
too too terribly too simple

619
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,200
so you can finally this is a basic sky

620
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,930
24 hour Skype intermission you can

621
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:43,140
finally start to animate gradients which

622
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,080
is wonderful and there's a lot in there

623
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,940
but eventually of course this won't be

624
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,430
supported in CSS but if you need it

625
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:50,970
right now

626
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,860
and you you wanted to animate it great

627
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:56,820
in don't in SPG absolutely so that's all

628
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,480
the time I have I hope this was helpful

629
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:04,110
again if you have follow-up questions by

630
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,580
all means ask me on twitter follow up on

631
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,250
the blog and I hope to do a fuller and

632
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,680
more complete a track presentation in

633
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:22,580
future CSS cons thanks very much
