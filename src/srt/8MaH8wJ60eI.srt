00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:15,119

Thanks can you hear me all right thank

2
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,610
you for coming all the way to Iceland my

3
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,770
presentation thank you for waking up so

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,840
early this morning I mean talking about

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,180
if one laptop per child started today

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,300
how JavaScript d would it be we're a

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,340
bunch of JavaScript people we want to

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,439
kind of do a retrospective to see what

9
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,210
happened in the past and then maybe I'll

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,010
be able to use that to convince you that

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,770
we can do a little preview of the future

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,200
yet to come so they gave me a laser

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,300
pointer okay so I work with one laptop

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,430
per child kind of in different roles

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,130
teacher developer volunteer never got

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,750
like a check from one laptop per child

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,149
proper but working for these regional

18
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,230
organizations so I worked in uganda

19
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,930
uruguay haiti and the marshall islands

20
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,799
out in the Pacific between 2010 and 2013

21
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,390
usually a couple months at a time meet

22
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,710
with different people go to the school

23
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,770
get the laptop project setup and a lot

24
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,630
of people when they see me they see the

25
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,850
laptop they ask what happened to OLPC

26
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,010
seemed like it was very popular very

27
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,530
famous we have one of the laptops in the

28
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,560
crowd going around so keep it moving and

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,360
people saw it and wondered what happened

30
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,860
did it ever get to kids what it was it

31
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,710
used for does it really work to really

32
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,479
answer that question we have to go back

33
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,450
in time back to the year two thousand

34
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,369
five eleven years ago if you think about

35
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,610
it and the announcement was very major I

36
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,720
don't know if you would all remember

37
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,430
this but the announcement what they were

38
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,530
first starting it they have Kofi Annan

39
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,270
from the UN they have Nicholas

40
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,220
Negroponte e founder of the mem IT media

41
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,409
lab presenting this prototype a

42
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,049
hand-cranked hundred-dollar laptop is

43
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,630
the goal they would only actually start

44
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,530
delivering laptops in 2007-2008 and at

45
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,360
the idea laptop for kids was actually

46
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,670
very absurd idea laptops were expensive

47
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,099
they're very fragile I found this

48
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:10,019
article from ZDNet that they were proud

49
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:12,060
the average price of a laptop had

50
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,129
dropped from fourteen hundred dollars to

51
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:16,019
eleven hundred dollars here comes

52
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,250
someone saying I'm going to make a

53
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,040
laptop for just one hundred at the time

54
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,660
if you want to get some tech for your

55
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,100
kid you might get this leap pad

56
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,960
it has kind of some clever features

57
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,880
there's like a smart pen that knows the

58
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,950
numbers your kid is writing but not an

59
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,370
actual full computer the ipod looked a

60
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,200
little bit like this and people were

61
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,090
saying why not give people an iPod it

62
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,860
has lots of audiobooks and lessons and

63
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,290
the belief was you know they partnered

64
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,240
with all these very free software

65
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,850
Richard Stallman types who said you know

66
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,170
educational devices should have a

67
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,120
terminal it shouldn't be controlling you

68
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,460
you should have full access to the

69
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,370
computer in some way it shouldn't just

70
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,640
need a device for consumption and so one

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,080
of the first criticisms that people said

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,750
right away laptop is a hundred dollars

73
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,300
or two hundred dollars is this an

74
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,640
effective like is going to affect

75
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,210
education properly by the dollar and in

76
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,970
fact I'm going to say no in fact people

77
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,220
study this very well and they know full

78
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,680
well what are the most effective ways to

79
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,990
change education for your money and

80
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,580
they're very well known very well

81
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,340
research the first is a deworming pills

82
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,620
every three to five years the kid takes

83
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,030
these pills they don't get parasites

84
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,950
second sanitary pads for girls third bed

85
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,690
nets so you don't get malaria these are

86
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,250
very well understood if you want to

87
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,260
donate money to these kind of causes

88
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,420
please do they're very effective for a

89
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,310
small amount of money and they don't

90
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,900
involve school at all if you think about

91
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,520
it it just matters that the kids are

92
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,590
healthy and going to school and not

93
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,450
missing classes it makes a lot of sense

94
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,060
but in the world in the real world that

95
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,380
we live in you know people have

96
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,180
technology I go to these countries and

97
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,450
people are using smartphones already and

98
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,880
there's risk if the technology is only

99
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,160
developed in wealthy countries and the

100
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,930
technology is used worldwide that

101
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,000
there's a great number of people who

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,930
have no access to the economy and the

103
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,200
control over the devices they use and in

104
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,390
my experience people really want to use

105
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,820
and learn technology like when I was in

106
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,310
Uganda I met a kid who was learning

107
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,620
Excel out of a textbook he doesn't have

108
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,990
a computer he's just learning you know

109
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,240
in the Edit menu of cut copy paste I

110
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,960
heard about a school in Rwanda where the

111
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,540
teacher has a C++ book and then the

112
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,729
teacher copies the program onto the

113
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:36,660
chalkboard

114
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,490
and the students copy the program down

115
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,990
their notebooks like you would never

116
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,540
expect those people to actually know C++

117
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,520
because they're learning it in this very

118
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,310
convoluted way that's how high the

119
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,580
demand is how important is to people

120
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,050
that are using this technology to learn

121
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,340
it and take control of it for themselves

122
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,400
so the laptop and products that followed

123
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,580
it is filling a very real gap and

124
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,790
availability to make our technology

125
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,510
world more accessible and equitable

126
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,520
going back to the laptop the first

127
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,010
version of it had just one gigabyte of

128
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,910
solid-state memory on an SD card and

129
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,680
there were no solid state hard solid 8

130
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,280
laptops at the time so very exciting a

131
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,540
Nicholas Negroponte he does a demo where

132
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,280
he tosses it a little bit like a frisbee

133
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,750
but he probably has like a hundred of

134
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,550
them at home I only like one here in

135
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,000
Iceland so please don't uh this screen

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,850
can go from color to like a black and

137
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,820
white pink kind of screen which is very

138
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,680
readable even in direct sunlight the

139
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,330
ideas like there's some outdoor schools

140
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,470
or maybe they're going to be able to

141
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,270
read it and direct sunlight a bit

142
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,760
water-resistant they only have USD and

143
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,280
SD card inputs there's a video online

144
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,860
where when it first came out where

145
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,110
they're typing on the keyboard as it's

146
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,570
like a faucet is pouring water down on

147
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,370
the keyboard they're very excited to

148
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,110
make it water resistant and they work

149
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,870
very hard to source the very lowest cost

150
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,540
pieces so in some cases that was a very

151
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,250
poor decision there was touch pads that

152
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,980
didn't work very well they also agreed

153
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,410
not to sell it outright in the United

154
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,150
States so they wouldn't be competing

155
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,580
with other laptops using the same parts

156
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,550
which would end up to be a problem later

157
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,140
so today we're kind of in a different

158
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,000
environment year and a half ago I was

159
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,160
back in Haiti and a building they've

160
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,330
been destroyed in the earthquake has

161
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,510
been rebuilt and there's this factory in

162
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,940
a sense called I think they call it

163
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,750
hence com kind of unusual name but

164
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,850
there's a system now where there's a

165
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,950
chinese company will they'll do a

166
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,320
program where they'll set up they

167
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,090
manufacture the pieces in china and they

168
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,740
set up an assembly plant in local

169
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,890
countries so haiti north korea other

170
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,270
countries you wouldn't really expect to

171
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,129
be manufacturing tablets

172
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:52,770
control that final assembly step so

173
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,979
today if I were setting up a project I

174
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,300
wouldn't go through a whole trouble of

175
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,149
building you know a brand new hardware

176
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:03,330
from scratch instead I would say look

177
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,459
you can go to this office they'll give

178
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,349
you a tablet you don't have to smuggle

179
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:10,610
computers into the country anymore and

180
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,139
it works if the screen breaks you can

181
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,269
bring it back for repairs they also have

182
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,479
some solar panels and phone chargers and

183
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,619
things they make a lot of really

184
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:22,740
interesting stuff there another really

185
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,360
good idea about that came with the

186
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,189
laptop project was this idea of a mesh

187
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:28,080
network even today this is really

188
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,999
difficult if someone said okay by the

189
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:31,289
end of the day we need to have a mesh

190
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:33,749
network with everyone's phones connected

191
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:35,369
I don't know if we could do it like we

192
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:37,889
were smart people but in small clusters

193
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:40,229
it's doable but then as it expands out

194
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:43,169
it's very difficult in fact the largest

195
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:45,389
deployment plans say ball and org why

196
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:47,849
just in this operating system that they

197
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:49,800
use they just disabled mesh networking

198
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,529
all together but when it does work I

199
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:53,669
mean you have to understand these

200
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:55,740
teachers have never used Google Docs so

201
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,689
it's like oh well they're typing and

202
00:07:57,689 --> 00:07:58,860
it's typing on someone else's computer

203
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,589
people were very excited so then finally

204
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:07,139
we have the operating system many people

205
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:08,699
they turn on their like what is this is

206
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,759
this a real computer so it has linux as

207
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,610
fedora with the support of red hat and

208
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,699
then they added on top of this an MIT

209
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:20,639
Media Lab sort of dream quest called

210
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,079
sugar and so the idea was I think this

211
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,550
comes into play later but the idea was

212
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,860
they could be deploying this laptop in

213
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,379
countries where people are not with very

214
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,000
young kids who aren't literate yet or

215
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,649
countries where there's some countries

216
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:36,870
where even some teachers aren't literate

217
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,360
to the full extent so they were saying

218
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,459
let's make an interface that's all about

219
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:43,560
these colorful icons it makes kids want

220
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,540
to try different things and there's

221
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,250
still new releases to this there's one

222
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,930
laptop per child and there's a separate

223
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,360
nonprofit called sugar labs so you can

224
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,149
get this as a separate deployment and

225
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:55,470
today if I said I'm going to do an

226
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,939
education project and I'm going to start

227
00:08:56,939 --> 00:08:58,860
by building my own operating system you

228
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,120
would be like Nick get out of here don't

229
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,140
do it but

230
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,730
time Android was just a feature phone

231
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,440
operating system there wasn't really an

232
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,110
option you had to pay for stuff so the

233
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,780
idea of there being an operating system

234
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,630
that would be easy for kids to use was

235
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,120
important then and then now it's kind of

236
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,040
like oh no like you know we've made this

237
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,310
huge investment so MIT vision like why

238
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,900
are they making the heart the laptop so

239
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,180
sturdy why are they making the laptop

240
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,100
have its own operating system with these

241
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,800
colorful icons is there picturing at the

242
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,140
time you know these very rural schools

243
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,990
outdoors sometimes in sub-saharan Africa

244
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,060
in Afghanistan Pakistan where this

245
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,450
picture is taken they actually did a lot

246
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,850
of talking with Gaddafi in Libya sort of

247
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,460
a awkward time for us politics at the

248
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,530
time but they thought that Gaddafi might

249
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,630
buy millions of these or maybe there

250
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,190
would be a state in India that would buy

251
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,600
a million of them and then the other

252
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,340
states would start competing with them

253
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,230
but that never worked out there was

254
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,360
never like a massive multi-million

255
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,670
laptop order so instead of reaching the

256
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,610
hundred-dollar laptop target they don't

257
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,960
have that level of production so it's

258
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,670
closer to two hundred dollars for the

259
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,250
laptop they were thinking about

260
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,950
illiteracy the there's a quote that gets

261
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,780
used a lot about if they put a hundred

262
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,000
books on 100 laptops you would have

263
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,770
10,000 books and that's better than we

264
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,740
would have in our school library but you

265
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,030
know like is one kid going to have all

266
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,010
the biology textbooks and one kid can

267
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,870
have all the French poetry like it

268
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,910
doesn't really make sense it turns out

269
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,500
in a real classroom environment you want

270
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,110
kids doll the same book so they can read

271
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,180
together and write their notes and so so

272
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,950
not just like have each kids struggling

273
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,930
with their own book that no one's heard

274
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,500
of and then it turned out it wasn't

275
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,620
about sub-saharan Africa it turned out

276
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,060
the largest participants in the project

277
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,170
were or why and Peru I think each

278
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,630
country is bought about a million of the

279
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:56,860
laptops and over over time and so each

280
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,680
kid in Uruguay gets it like they can

281
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,090
bring it home because your neighbor's

282
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,310
kid has 12 there's no danger of being

283
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,050
stolen you can take it to the post

284
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,000
office and get it repaired look it's a

285
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,950
whole national system and everyone's

286
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,750
very proud of it you see the laptop was

287
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,460
announced at just the right time where

288
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,460
they want to roll out public Wi-Fi to

289
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,100
public too

290
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,019
public spaces and schools across the

291
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:20,509
country and they said the best way to do

292
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:23,240
that is put in the schools give the kids

293
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,399
laptops a lot of the kids parents are

294
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,569
using the internet for the first time

295
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:30,050
using these laptops it just ended up

296
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,060
being different from how they envisioned

297
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,180
it so it went from being a sub-saharan

298
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,160
Africa project to Latin America

299
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,389
middle-income country project the

300
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:44,600
software itself you write in Python I'll

301
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,519
get to that in a minute but you have

302
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:49,130
sort of a custom activity structure that

303
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,829
you zip up into a dot XO file because

304
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:55,459
the laptops called XO 1 X 0 2 they did

305
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:57,980
not originally include flash or mp3

306
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,930
encoders they said don't you know the

307
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,329
wonders of open source and open formats

308
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:05,000
everyone will use audios it seems

309
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,470
strange now like obviously kids are

310
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,459
going to go to youtube and be

311
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:09,769
disappointed but at the time YouTube

312
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:12,230
came out 2006 they were designing it

313
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,990
2005 to 2007 they said you know we don't

314
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,449
want to pay the extra bit to have flash

315
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:22,009
support so what kids do now is they have

316
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:24,709
a separate activity or terminal thing

317
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:26,959
that they can use to install flash but

318
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,670
it's sort of an unusual choice that

319
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,889
ended up hampering them later when stuff

320
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:33,709
like Khan Academy came out and then also

321
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,569
like the administrators want make sure

322
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:37,490
the kids are learning office apps so

323
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,360
they want to make sure they're using

324
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,430
word that kind of an Excel type app that

325
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:44,569
I helped write and presentation apps and

326
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:46,670
it helps to understand why they're using

327
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,860
Python Python this is like the Golden

328
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,230
Age of Python like MIT switch from

329
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,259
schemed using Python a lot of Java CS

330
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:55,519
programs were switching the Python

331
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,730
Google hired the inventor of Python said

332
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,279
this is the future of everything they

333
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,990
create a project wiki since every set

334
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,850
one said wiki's are a good way to

335
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,550
connect people they used get you know

336
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,990
kind of ahead of its time but you know

337
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,579
it's linux distro so they were using it

338
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:13,009
and though these things about the five

339
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:14,480
principles that people would probably

340
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,490
talk about at length I'm just going to

341
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,959
say they pretty much exist just to

342
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:21,079
insist on one laptop per child like

343
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:23,060
people were saying i'm going to buy 50

344
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,100
of them and set up a computer lab this

345
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,529
is unacceptable to the media lab vision

346
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:29,480
because they want the kid to thing

347
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,490
it's their laptop like it's their pencil

348
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,980
like why would they so when it starts up

349
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,899
it says what's your name and then that's

350
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,610
your name like it says Nick's photos

351
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,029
Nick's documents like they're very

352
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:42,860
actually trying to in a software and

353
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,620
operating system way encourage you to

354
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,720
just give this to one child and then buy

355
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,970
another one because that's kind of their

356
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,339
vision for the education and I think

357
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:54,010
today you see a lot of more interesting

358
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,829
ways of handling the puter labs this is

359
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:59,709
a project called keep odd where the

360
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:03,380
student has a live USB so it saves all

361
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,970
their software and settings and files

362
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,360
and the only cost is one USB per child

363
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,829
and then the computer lab can keep

364
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:11,480
running so I think this is a good way to

365
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,050
save your costs on the computer lab

366
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,930
anyway uh scaling up and down so or why

367
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,790
like I said is a national project they

368
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,860
had a very liberal government they were

369
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,930
very interested in this equality of

370
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,970
education between the cities and the

371
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,519
rural areas but you know right away

372
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,959
people say isn't this sort of a

373
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:32,029
political hand down for the party that's

374
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:34,730
in power right now so there's an element

375
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:37,010
of truth to that right I mean but people

376
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,779
would start criticizing is they really

377
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:40,370
want computer education or do they want

378
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:43,220
votes but at the same time if I go to a

379
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,380
school in Uganda and just me the teacher

380
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,750
and doing like a pilot project doing

381
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,130
some research you'd say oh that's

382
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,050
impractical that will never scale we

383
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,519
can't send Nick to every school in

384
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:55,610
Uganda which is again true so it turns

385
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,839
out whenever you launch your own

386
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,300
education project doesn't matter how you

387
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,399
approach it someone will tell you oh

388
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:03,410
that's not how it really works but

389
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,149
that's how it gets started that's how it

390
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:07,610
could start happening I think they also

391
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,620
didn't really expect the internet to

392
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,690
move so quickly so many people are 3g

393
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,269
now even going for Africa South America

394
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:16,310
a lot more internet but also they just

395
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,769
never expected there to be such quality

396
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:21,019
high speed internet I think Khan Academy

397
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:22,459
one of the top countries it's used now

398
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:25,519
is India so people over there are

399
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,850
already learning using computers and

400
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,190
they don't need to have this whole work

401
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,850
around getting a special device ah in

402
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,560
recent years this is in this interesting

403
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,990
movement towards JavaScript both in our

404
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,050
real world and server-side code and also

405
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:42,860
in this edge

406
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,590
asian world so the people who worked on

407
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,660
sugar labs have adopted a project called

408
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,310
sugar riser this is a web-based HTML

409
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,390
java SE 205 JavaScript app and it works

410
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,430
in the browser there's an Android app

411
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,170
and all different Android app stores

412
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,080
that you can download and use the games

413
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,340
unfortunately you can't like open an old

414
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,280
Python activity file and click save as

415
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,620
javascript doesn't work that way so

416
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,000
everything's being kind of tediously

417
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,130
rewritten for this but it makes sense

418
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,290
they're keeping this sugar ethos of like

419
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,030
an interface that could be interesting

420
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,730
and easy for kids and remaking it for

421
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,390
the web the two programming environments

422
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,400
they had turtle art which is like a logo

423
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,680
programming and scratch have since moved

424
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,330
to the web as well so this kind of is

425
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,830
all these different activities that they

426
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,990
gathered and put on a laptop as

427
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,820
different native apps are moving towards

428
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,100
web-based tools and I mean it makes

429
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,950
sense javascript is pretty cool it moves

430
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,600
along with the web and the browser if

431
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,450
you have a computer that has a browser

432
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,610
that updates continuously and silently

433
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,030
kind of like google chrome i would say

434
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,920
device is secure and all the lessons

435
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,690
that you create will work on the next

436
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,340
device and the next device in the next

437
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,380
device you can write one lesson to have

438
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,720
it work on other places and that's

439
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,910
something that I think it took some time

440
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,530
for people to realize these open

441
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,300
education tools are going to get buried

442
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,610
if we don't make them based on the web

443
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,740
so what's going to happen next what's

444
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,480
gonna happen like not everyone's online

445
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,850
so this is a project that we set up in

446
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,730
Haiti I know it looks a little bit messy

447
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,670
but this is a solar-powered offline

448
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,320
server there's like this thing called

449
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,700
Intel nuke and so we put videos all your

450
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,500
Khan Academy videos your maps and your

451
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,200
different interactive things on there

452
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,720
and so you don't there's like 3G data

453
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,550
but it's very expensive so instead you

454
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,280
have everything saved on the server you

455
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,870
wrap it in bubble wrap you take it with

456
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,570
you to the school you charge it you

457
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,000
connect it to some car batteries like

458
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,690
this and it'll say charge and people can

459
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,050
access all those cool online resources

460
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,809
this is kind of a

461
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:56,159
gram of how that works so it would be

462
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,659
good to have all these offline online

463
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,730
resources that can be repeated offline

464
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,740
and one of those resources that we might

465
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,330
want to add is a way for people to learn

466
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,309
how to code I don't think that everyone

467
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:08,600
must code I don't want it to be the s80

468
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,129
coding thing but I do think people

469
00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:12,840
should always have an opportunity to

470
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,669
learn how to code if they want to so I

471
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:16,139
get this question a lot what should I

472
00:18:16,139 --> 00:18:18,980
teach my kid my niece my nephew and

473
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,749
we're not really though if you've never

474
00:18:21,749 --> 00:18:22,980
been asked this or ask another

475
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,539
programmer this is kind of an unusual

476
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,309
question like you would think because we

477
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:28,320
know how to program we would know but

478
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,379
it's not so easy because I mean we're

479
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:33,690
here and if you ask around you'll find a

480
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,820
lot of people including myself here like

481
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,799
you know learn it themselves with the

482
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,480
help of their parents they know or like

483
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,100
they were like not like oh stop messing

484
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,179
with the computer they're like oh let me

485
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:43,889
help you I also know how to code you

486
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:46,049
know so see we come a lot of us come

487
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:48,149
from this position of advantage we don't

488
00:18:48,149 --> 00:18:50,519
really know like it's not really about

489
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:52,379
us and how we learn how to code is like

490
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:53,580
how are we gonna get all the other

491
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,070
people who aren't here today all people

492
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,230
who said you know I don't get this and I

493
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,330
don't know who to talk to or like this

494
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,220
really doesn't make any sense or this

495
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,379
doesn't compile how do we fix that

496
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:06,450
environment so that people can learn how

497
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,379
to code in a more reasonable way I met

498
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:13,499
someone at UPenn and she said that she

499
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:15,480
learned how to code herself she went to

500
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,580
school there using scratch which has the

501
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,039
interactive blocks and she said it's

502
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,710
like a slap in the face she said I'm

503
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,509
like well I was nice to her at the time

504
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:26,519
but if I went back in time and came up

505
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:28,139
with this great come back and be like

506
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:29,879
it's not about you like you were already

507
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:31,740
learning how to code it's like when you

508
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,029
went to school if you learn how to read

509
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:36,330
and you have to learn phonics again like

510
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,190
it's not about you we're not sympathetic

511
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,690
that you have to learn phonics again

512
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,639
it's about everyone else everyone should

513
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,799
learn how to read and so we're going to

514
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,299
spend time on that and make sure it

515
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:48,659
works you think open-source onboarding

516
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:49,769
would be the easiest way to do this you

517
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:50,909
don't have to be part of a government or

518
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:52,769
a company you don't have to be old

519
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:54,299
enough to drive in order to participate

520
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,519
in an open source project but it's still

521
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:58,049
really hard to join an open source

522
00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:00,149
project if I send someone to get up what

523
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:02,009
are they going to do there looks like oh

524
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:03,240
well they should download this text

525
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,200
editor and they should start running a

526
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,990
program and then do

527
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,670
get clone and there's things that people

528
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,460
don't know yet and even the whole idea

529
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,350
of open source is really weird to people

530
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,440
a couple weeks ago I was talking to a

531
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,000
cashier at the coffee shop I'm like I'm

532
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,240
going to Iceland anyway and I she was

533
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,010
like are you supporting like a brand or

534
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,380
a product I was like well well it's like

535
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,510
we write the code and then we give it

536
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,240
away for free and then I tell a story

537
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,550
about it later like you know people that

538
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,640
people are very surprised by this still

539
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,530
their projects but are Mary you should

540
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,210
be more projects that just accept all

541
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,010
the poll requests you can patch it up

542
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,300
later just so you know we're not

543
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,710
mission-critical if you want to

544
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,900
participate will merge your code and fix

545
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,440
any mistakes that come up so back to the

546
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,230
laptop so there's four things that were

547
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,610
stored on the laptop for teaching kids

548
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,710
how to code turtle art which is based on

549
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,620
logo etoys which is still really

550
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,790
interesting concept it's like each

551
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,809
object in etoys has own coding stack so

552
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:03,190
you can dry it make a little racecar do

553
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,570
something make another little car do

554
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,240
something scratch which I think many

555
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,830
people have seen which is also block

556
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,650
based and then pippi which is like a

557
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,720
Python interpreter came with some

558
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,990
different math games and like a photo

559
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,970
booth kind of application photo booth

560
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,140
application so it's kind of interesting

561
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,720
but none of them really like drew people

562
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,820
in as much as like turtle art and

563
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,320
there's some different schools of

564
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,340
thought on this some people were like

565
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,190
let's keep kids using turtle art let's

566
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,170
add blocks that control robots and

567
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,540
cameras and sounds and just write

568
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,730
everything in blocks why ever go to text

569
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,890
code so that's an interesting idea I

570
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,450
don't really agree with it but it's kind

571
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,300
of an interesting idea today there's

572
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,280
many different paths that people are

573
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,100
recommending there's block based coding

574
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,450
which we've been mentioning so this is

575
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,760
with code org and there are two things

576
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,590
that I like about this screenshot one of

577
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,120
them is we're not just using Turtles

578
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,160
anymore this is I believe this is elsa

579
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,220
from frozen someone who knows frozen

580
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,429
tell me so like it seems weird to look

581
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:06,400
at a Disney character to your your logo

582
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,830
program i'm pretty sure because of this

583
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,640
and they also have an r2d2 star wars 1

584
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,750
i'm pretty sure more people have learned

585
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,830
how to code using r2d2 and elsa then

586
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,480
in all the years that we've been

587
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,620
teaching people with coating with

588
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,840
turtles like it seems like a weird

589
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,269
compromise but it makes it easier for

590
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:26,980
kids to say I want to do this it's a

591
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,840
game has my favorite character in it

592
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,760
what I also like about this is with

593
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,860
blocks there's no syntax you don't have

594
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,600
to worry like oh I missed a semicolon

595
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,490
what I also like about this is you can

596
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,899
translate it into different languages

597
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:41,590
this is a Arabic blocks and they go from

598
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,909
right to left like when you switch

599
00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:44,559
language they change the direction of

600
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,960
the blocks it's very clever and they're

601
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,460
actually a couple of languages that come

602
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:53,440
out recently kalbe which is Arabic Lisp

603
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,019
kind of language and pataka just came

604
00:22:56,019 --> 00:22:57,750
out like in the last week it's like

605
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:04,000
Bengali language and scratch and Google

606
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,260
are kind of moving this forward they

607
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,600
have merged all the all the people who

608
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,470
are making these different block based

609
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,539
coding they have like one collective now

610
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:12,100
where they're going to make blocks that

611
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,080
work really well on tablets so that

612
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,220
could be really interesting in the

613
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,100
future there's also this idea of maybe

614
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,559
we could teach kids using games you need

615
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,000
a pretty high-end browser for this all

616
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,620
to work so it won't work on the laptop

617
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,049
but I'd really like if we did of

618
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:28,029
something like this because it's like

619
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:29,649
you have a spell book and you move the

620
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:31,750
character around you fight various

621
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,269
things it's not bloody or anything don't

622
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:35,860
worry like you could not going to like

623
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,279
be traumatized unless unless they miss a

624
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:42,909
semicolon then it might be charlton but

625
00:23:42,909 --> 00:23:45,460
then also this is a part of iOS 10

626
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,870
Apple's can release something called

627
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,210
Swift playgrounds and there's like

628
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,559
little character and move around this

629
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,440
beautiful 3d world and apple is actually

630
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,510
going to do coding workshops at all the

631
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,899
Apple stores so it could be that in the

632
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:00,580
future you're going to meet people that

633
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,899
learn how to code using something like

634
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,669
this it's interesting it's a mix of

635
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:06,100
Swift which is a text language and it

636
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,630
has some kind of block intelligence if

637
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,309
you look at the bottom it's not very

638
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:11,529
visible but it suggests what you should

639
00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:12,760
type you don't even have to type the

640
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,220
words you can click the suggestions and

641
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,980
then it'll fill out your program because

642
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,070
it's recommending what you should type

643
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,899
there's an idea that maybe we should get

644
00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:24,220
rid of all the screens and have people

645
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,470
learn using robots this is a project

646
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,480
called bow bot which came out of

647
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,919
something called the ten-dollar robot

648
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:30,970
challenge I think

649
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,070
a bit more than ten dollars but it's got

650
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,870
some sensors it's got motors got power

651
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,090
this could be really cool to learn how

652
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:40,539
to code just with a physical thing I've

653
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:42,159
even seen recently there's something you

654
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,780
can there's like paki you can use

655
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,520
Japanese Canada to write programs now

656
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,770
gnarly sure how that works there's some

657
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,690
physical blocks that you can move around

658
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,850
to write a code and then also the

659
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,740
Arduino if you do anything with makers

660
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,390
stuff look up our do we know it's really

661
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:59,860
good device and then I think this is a

662
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,720
few years ago now have you seen the post

663
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,260
by Brett Victor worried dream where he's

664
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,299
talking about what if as you were coding

665
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:09,669
you saw the consequences of all your

666
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:12,220
decisions like all possible futures so

667
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,690
as you're writing a loop you see

668
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,429
different things being created and

669
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:19,450
uncreated so this very ambitious idea

670
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,070
there's some different gifs on his site

671
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,260
that explain it and the two kind of

672
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,610
projects that have gone forward with

673
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,429
this reactive programming idea one of

674
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:30,280
them is khan academy they have this

675
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,580
activity for kids where you write the

676
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,530
program and you do different graphics

677
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,090
and processing very similar to java

678
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:41,559
script and then you have instantly see

679
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:43,030
the results on the side and so you're

680
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,919
able like change numbers and see how it

681
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:48,400
would affect your program then there's a

682
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,900
pro an IDE that's going to come out

683
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,669
called eve which i think is supposed to

684
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:53,530
be for like grown-ups doing web

685
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:56,470
development and web apps I don't have a

686
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,929
screenshot of that it's still very under

687
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:01,030
wraps but the idea is that you'll be

688
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,230
able to see what your coding would

689
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,030
change entirely how we as developers

690
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,610
think about coding and then going back

691
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,919
to the interface and then going back now

692
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:11,860
if you're going to teach kids JavaScript

693
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,890
or if you're going to write your brand

694
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:17,380
new education app and JavaScript there's

695
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,150
like three risk factors that I thought

696
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,450
of just as doing one of them is

697
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,510
JavaScript could be replaced by some

698
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,429
future language to be determined you

699
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:29,500
know python made a lot of sense at the

700
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,350
time everyone was very excited

701
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,850
javascript is having that moment now and

702
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,730
is at a moment like are we at risk of

703
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,640
that there's also a risk that javascript

704
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,490
could divided into several

705
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:44,230
incomprehensible warring faction

706
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,830
mmm feel like that if you've seen some

707
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,539
different versions of Java Script you

708
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:51,619
might be a little bit more worried about

709
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:54,110
this and then throwing in there just for

710
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,899
fun there's risk that machine learning

711
00:26:56,899 --> 00:26:59,269
could redefine how we write code and

712
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:00,710
what we're actually trying to write I

713
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,869
mean I've seen a lot of weird stuff done

714
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:05,240
with machine learning and does anyone to

715
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,740
openstreetmap what was it yes okay so we

716
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,480
always thought you know we humans would

717
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,360
pour over these satellite images and map

718
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,980
all the buildings of the world and all

719
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,679
its GPS and then they started having

720
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,659
computers look at it and they so it's

721
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:23,299
just for error correction and it appears

722
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:25,039
like yeah you missed one you missed this

723
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,080
one you missed this one like computer is

724
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,999
like this is so easy I can find all the

725
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:30,440
buildings like they're they look like

726
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,350
this so it turns out all the labor

727
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,730
intensive stuff that people have been

728
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,980
doing and mapping turn out to be really

729
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,049
easy for computers to do once they got a

730
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:41,570
good training data set so I wonder as

731
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,820
programmers if we have machine learning

732
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,860
look at front end development or like

733
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,679
wireframes going into HTML I wonder how

734
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:50,419
that's going to turn out in the next few

735
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,649
years another thing I want to mention is

736
00:27:53,649 --> 00:27:57,080
I have this whole thing today you're

737
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,909
supposed to clip it on to your baby but

738
00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:00,559
I got one because I poured the

739
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,179
Kickstarter as this thing called

740
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:04,909
Starling is not a step counter it is a

741
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:07,639
word counter so there's this research

742
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:11,749
that kids who hear more words I get

743
00:28:11,749 --> 00:28:13,429
better vocabularies and do better in

744
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:16,100
school so the obvious solution is to

745
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,679
make a microphone and clip it on to your

746
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:21,139
baby and it's this really cool device

747
00:28:21,139 --> 00:28:23,179
I'm not really sure where this is going

748
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:26,749
to go but I like it because you know

749
00:28:26,749 --> 00:28:28,669
it's there's no screen there's no like

750
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:30,080
we're going to teach the kid this or

751
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,179
that it's just saying like we should

752
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:34,009
have metrics and sensors that let us

753
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:36,559
know are the kids learning what are they

754
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,419
learning what should they be learning is

755
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:40,759
very early stages i think if you gone

756
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:43,100
into this field people would believe you

757
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,559
whatever it was that you said and then

758
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,840
you would get some really interesting

759
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,919
results um looking forward like what are

760
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,899
what's the if you were starting a new

761
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,629
organization One Laptop Per child 2

762
00:28:56,629 --> 00:28:57,650
point 0

763
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,510
what are you gonna do so I think you

764
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,920
don't focus on the hardware of the

765
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,800
browser you say whoever you are whatever

766
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,720
computers are available to you if

767
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,760
someone donates you them to you it's

768
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,860
fine just get me a computer with a

769
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,380
browser on it like we really really want

770
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,240
on top a child focused on the whole

771
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,370
thing from the hardware and the

772
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,350
operating system and the education tools

773
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:21,530
really just focus on some people are

774
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,120
going to get kids computers with browser

775
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,440
some people are gonna give them the

776
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,900
internet and then their resources like

777
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,030
Khan Academy and there's a group library

778
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:32,810
for all that does I books and they can

779
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,550
set up something on the web and will

780
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:37,430
work anywhere and when you do that one

781
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,960
thing that one laptop per child messed

782
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,270
up is their hardware they agree not to

783
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,580
sell it outright in the u.s. because

784
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,960
they want to get the lowest possible

785
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,370
price they don't want to compete with

786
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,220
other suppliers but if you look at Khan

787
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,170
Academy they're getting a lot of funding

788
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,720
and interest because it's used in the

789
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,060
United States it just happens that it

790
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,490
works really well in other countries so

791
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,500
I think that's a good tactic if you make

792
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,540
an education library don't say this is

793
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,340
going particularly to this kid that

794
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,710
you've never met say I want your kid to

795
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,720
use this in school and I want the kid on

796
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,460
the other side of the world to be able

797
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,520
to log on and use this to ebooks are

798
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,400
still really hard if you go on Project

799
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,050
Gutenberg you'll find so many millions

800
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,910
of books but they're all very old

801
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:22,220
they're like dr. Dolittle when it was

802
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,090
racist there's like like French poetry

803
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,820
there's they didn't make kids books a

804
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,600
hundred years ago is the problem you

805
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,030
can't find good English content uh and

806
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,890
then local languages try to find

807
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,510
something in Haitian Creole there's kind

808
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,460
of a market now but it's very difficult

809
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,680
you like I have a friend who like knows

810
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,450
all of the publishers and talks to them

811
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:47,650
regularly because there's so few of them

812
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:50,450
so that's difficult to set up ebooks in

813
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,370
different languages and then also it

814
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,840
turns out a lot of times they deliver

815
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,250
the ebooks and the kids don't read them

816
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,070
I mean they have a computer like they're

817
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,770
not so I think if you had some way like

818
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:03,080
to engage kids more with the books or

819
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,130
found ways to make them especially

820
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,710
exciting or interactive in some way you

821
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,500
might get an edge but I don't know

822
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,910
another thing is making it available on

823
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,270
Apple

824
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,370
double server I showed that server

825
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,940
before that can work offline Khan

826
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,080
Academy is made offline using a separate

827
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,760
nonprofit called learning equality I

828
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,990
don't know if they even talk to each

829
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,750
other officially and then things like

830
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,970
co.org which has that block language

831
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,680
they've never considered making it

832
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,260
offline that's just their own website so

833
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,700
I think you need to look seek out

834
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,650
resources that you know have an open

835
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,120
source server somewhere that can be set

836
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,210
up somewhere else since we're all

837
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,640
programmers or programming environment

838
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,890
technical people i think if you want to

839
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:46,880
focus on computer science education

840
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,680
because it's something that you know

841
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,540
that's beautiful you should go ahead and

842
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,660
do it trying to make something that

843
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,520
works both at school like someone can do

844
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,260
like an hour of code with their kids and

845
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,080
just that's it but then also the kids

846
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,460
interested in they want to go home

847
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,560
there's like a self-serve like learn

848
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,980
what you will want to learn that's it

849
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,050
I'm Nick Doran if you've any questions

850
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,420
or really cool stories you can come up

851
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,950
if you haven't got a chance to play

852
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,480
around with the laptop like can you

853
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,550
bring the laptop up later and then we'll

854
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,400
we'll try it out i'll show it to you and

855
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,590
then i'm on map meld on twitter and on
