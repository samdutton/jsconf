yeah I like to call myself a creative

21
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:26,600
developer um I like oh I just got why

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,200
you were clapping thank you the gestures

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,060
yes those I've been practicing these to

24
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,890
make sure they went okay and yes thanks

25
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,409
for the applause but I like doing like

26
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:39,049
fun interactive experiences games I like

27
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:41,030
whatever whatever happens happens and

28
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:46,560
sometimes that happens

29
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,150
hello so I like doing fun games and

30
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,760
different interactive experiences and

31
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,970
there we go this happens why you're up

32
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,050
on stage so and so what I wanted to get

33
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,090
started with is in the 80s we were all

34
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,460
sitting on the couch this is the typical

35
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,370
scene from the 80s sitting around eating

36
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,610
snacks being generally like were kind of

37
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,520
fat and lazy so yeah we were we were

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,470
really lazy this only happens when I'm

39
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,780
on stage so here's another picture Al

40
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,890
Bundy he's really lazy uh again 80

41
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,160
typical 80s stuff uh just being lazy

42
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,500
sitting on the couch eating snacks no

43
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:37,430
good you saw it happen I did it um so

44
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,640
but then something awesome happened so

45
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,650
TV has always been a sit-down medium

46
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,570
since the 1950s when it was just kicking

47
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,270
off and the obesity crisis was just

48
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,100
getting started in the 80s you know my

49
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,530
parents were like no snack food no junk

50
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,140
food we're gonna ration your TV time you

51
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,050
can't watch ducktales you can't watch

52
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,020
you know Batman and stuff but uh and you

53
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,850
know it was largely blamed on TV and

54
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,739
snacks so what happened that was so

55
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:07,370
awesome it was the 80s fitness craze and

56
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,920
we had we had this TV they didn't active

57
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,280
since the 1950s Richard Simmons he

58
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,500
transformed it we took this in active

59
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,190
medium I wish I could gesture this sucks

60
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,750
so instead of sitting on the couch

61
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,459
Richard Simmons and friends like Jane

62
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:24,500
Fonda and people that got us to clear a

63
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,540
space on our living room floor and we

64
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,700
did some cardio so we took this in

65
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,010
active medium and we we changed the way

66
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:37,520
we watch TV for the better but at the

67
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,680
same time we had a we had a Nintendo

68
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,150
taken off Nintendo wasn't the first game

69
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,489
console but you know intend to

70
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,170
popularized it with mario and everybody

71
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,450
so we had that medium taken off but

72
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,720
guess what it wasn't any better gamers

73
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,280
you know you were sitting in front of

74
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,650
that thing and you need a TV and like

75
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,209
using your consoles reaching into the

76
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:58,760
bag of chips it wasn't it wasn't any

77
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:07,229
better but maybe it was cuz it hello

78
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:09,500
Nintendo came out with a power pad in

79
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,930
1986 it wasn't that popular at a time

80
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,970
but it got you it put the buttons on the

81
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,709
floor and let you dance around a bit and

82
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:18,380
got you moving by just placing those

83
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,850
buttons in different locations so that

84
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,780
was great how is it thank you now it's

85
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,220
finally working all right Dance Dance

86
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:33,470
Revolution guys this isn't funny Dance

87
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,789
Dance Revolution 1998 it really took off

88
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:40,490
the game pads on the floor so it was it

89
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,370
was really taking off Japan got a 1998

90
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,099
first really really popularized this

91
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:47,840
because we had we had music and we had

92
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,180
dance unlike Nintendo's 8-bit days and

93
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,889
we had like really weird characters

94
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:58,699
moving around but you know it heart game

95
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,300
controllers they were just funny looking

96
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,620
things with buttons that were display so

97
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,930
I mean you think of a guitar hero the

98
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,910
buttons are just on the fretboard

99
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,139
they're the same controller buttons

100
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:10,820
we've already had same with Dance Dance

101
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,380
Revolution they're just displaced I

102
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,570
won't lie to you it's incredibly fun

103
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,159
using these things they're awesome to

104
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,340
play and the experiences we had were

105
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,520
just they're just fun so you know

106
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,400
Nintendo you know they took this and

107
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,810
kicked it up a notch so we have an

108
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,150
accelerometer built in so you know I can

109
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,520
I can tell the orientation of where I'm

110
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,560
putting the controller and I had an

111
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,419
infrared optical sensor so I can point

112
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,430
out the TV and like figure out where it

113
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,470
is on the screen it also had the buttons

114
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,570
mashing buttons and directional pad so I

115
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,330
can still play my same games and you

116
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,770
could move around a little bit so we're

117
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,240
getting there wireless connectivity via

118
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,370
bluetooth no wires anymore awesome I

119
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,720
always try and I always fail it only

120
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,470
works when I don't want it to work so

121
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,750
then Sony came along and guess what they

122
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,479
had the eye and eye toy for ps2 and ps3

123
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,990
so they took these cameras they're just

124
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,449
normal web cameras they

125
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:09,610
they don't do anything fancy but they

126
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,830
hooked them up and they did some

127
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,259
computer vision stuff I'm not that

128
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:16,180
familiar with computer vision stuff but

129
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,430
you know they had edge detection face

130
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,089
detection pixel tracking head tracking

131
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,089
and they also had a 4 array directional

132
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:27,669
microphone or a 40 or a microphone so

133
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:29,740
not just having like four microphones

134
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,800
you could tell hey users over here years

135
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,979
is over here or you could cancel out

136
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,419
some echoes and around the room and you

137
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:39,430
could get rid of background noise so

138
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,020
everything was a lot more clear with

139
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,520
four microphones with different sound

140
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,370
sources coming in and then you know the

141
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,740
problem with web cameras is living rooms

142
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,330
can get dark what we're playing can get

143
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,729
dark and you know there might be weird

144
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:56,499
lights all over the place that shine up

145
00:06:56,499 --> 00:07:01,719
and cause lighting to be weird and so

146
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:04,060
what's what Sony did was they put LED

147
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,789
balls they put them on the tip of the

148
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:09,490
controller and they lit up a different

149
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,860
color for every player and the size and

150
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,479
the position you still use this computer

151
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:16,120
vision with a simple web camera but they

152
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,339
give distance in motion and they know

153
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:19,689
better where they are especially in a

154
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,699
dark room and they also built into the

155
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:23,800
accelerometer just like the wii for you

156
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,389
know rotation and improved motion data

157
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:28,029
on that controller so things got better

158
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:30,129
they're starting to get more active all

159
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:34,930
is cool now microsoft they came onto the

160
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,819
scene so they have the typical RGB

161
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:39,339
camera they have the typical for a

162
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:42,129
microphone but what they have is what

163
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,349
they added to it is a infrared depth

164
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:47,439
finding camera so let's look at that a

165
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:52,509
little bit but I digress because we're

166
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:53,889
talking about consoles here we're all

167
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:58,060
web developers so let's think about this

168
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,319
a little bit connect i think it was in

169
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,509
2010 they came out with the the kinect

170
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:07,569
for windows sdk and they supportive

171
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:09,219
application development see sharra blah

172
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:12,610
blah blah there's bindings for so what

173
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,870
they could there's this project on the

174
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,339
scene called Kinect j/s it was pretty

175
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:18,209
cool it created a flash and air

176
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:21,069
WebSocket server and sent all that web

177
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:21,400
dad

178
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,740
over to javascript through a web socket

179
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,720
and that's how connect jas work cell

180
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,160
it's a cool project I tried it out it

181
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,419
was it was a good time the official the

182
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:33,789
official official windows sdk it costs

183
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:37,240
to or two hundred fifty dollars but the

184
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,520
not so official kit if you can get one

185
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,450
for a hundred dollars or under and

186
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,589
that's where that's what i call poor

187
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:46,600
man's connect hacking so you can get an

188
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,850
xbox kinect and i found one online for

189
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,550
like 70 bucks used and you have to get a

190
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,410
ten-dollar USB splitter for the power

191
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,060
supply so you're connecting with USB

192
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,160
you're connecting with a power AC

193
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,400
adapter the windows sdk works great on

194
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,800
this it's not legal for commercial use

195
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,089
though so that's that's the thing that's

196
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:06,640
how microsoft gets you on this and they

197
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,380
also lack the firmware to give you a

198
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,880
proper near mode so if you get really

199
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,770
close to the camera it's not going to

200
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:18,040
necessarily work properly but again i

201
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,140
digress because we're web developers

202
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,260
right so how can we how can we get

203
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,900
around this no microsoft or maybe some

204
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,760
Microsoft I don't mind Microsoft but I'd

205
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,209
rather not be all Microsoft so open

206
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:33,550
source awesome open source library for

207
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,279
3d sensing open an eye foundation they

208
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,540
call themselves the standard framework

209
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,220
for three sensing they are

210
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,310
cross-platform so ubuntu you know linux

211
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:46,000
OS x windows it also works with a kinect

212
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,830
but that that scenarios windows only

213
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,900
unfortunately however if you get a

214
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,120
camera like i have this small guy right

215
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,320
here that's an that's an asus it works

216
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,970
with those other cameras i'm running

217
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,950
this on ubuntu it works on OSX works on

218
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,470
windows cross platform cross-platform

219
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:07,930
goodness it's awesome so like I said

220
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,420
asus x john pro live is what i have

221
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,700
there's also the the primeSense carmine

222
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,560
primeSense was the original people that

223
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,510
came up with this technology licenses /

224
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,510
microsoft for the original Kinect so you

225
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,100
can get those for 119 to two hundred

226
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,860
dollars it's smaller than the Kinect no

227
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,810
motor so like the the Kinect has a motor

228
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,279
and it can follow you around the room

229
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,060
really creepily and no extra power

230
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,829
supply is needed I'm not plugged in via

231
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:34,750
an AC adapter here I just plug

232
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,910
right in USB in my computer all as well

233
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,500
some of these does some of these guys

234
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,470
don't have microphones you can use your

235
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,910
own sound setup that's fine yay working

236
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,200
again so not so open source Oh die skip

237
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,800
the slide no I didn't ok so there was

238
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,020
open and I and that gave you cool depth

239
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,240
finding data 19 minutes all right

240
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,030
exactly what I have not to open source

241
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,940
so there is a the open and I stuff nest

242
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,370
gave you depth depth data so like how

243
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,670
far everything is close to the screen

244
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,320
but we got some middleware and a lot of

245
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,730
people are making middleware for this

246
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,620
one of those people is primesense so

247
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,090
they're trying to they're trying to get

248
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,760
this out there and they give you

249
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,040
skeletal tracking user detection and a

250
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,920
few gestures so that's that's cool

251
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,470
however you know it's all still C++ but

252
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,030
let's take a look at what these cameras

253
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:34,180
do first so if you were talking about a

254
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,290
normal web camera playstation I they'll

255
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,270
typically use edge detection so if you

256
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,040
go to photoshop you can take a look at

257
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,260
you can use edge detection on a photo

258
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,910
and you can get the edges and that's

259
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,740
kind of how these to my understanding

260
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,660
that's kind of how these places you know

261
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,540
they'll they'll do gestures and object

262
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,770
tracking and whatnot they'll get the

263
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:59,920
edges and work from there so but an RGB

264
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,700
plus D camera depth being depth they'll

265
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,410
they'll get a they'll get all the depth

266
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,110
data so the the lighter stuff is the

267
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,790
closer to you the the darker stuff is

268
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,890
farther away and you know behind the

269
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,540
scenes if you put on infrared goggles

270
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,330
you can see tons of beams shooting out

271
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,150
at people and that's how they the beams

272
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,770
will shoot out at somebody or that an

273
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,839
object in the background bounce back to

274
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,510
you and that's how they see and that's

275
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,910
why that's why I like in this slide you

276
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,490
know it's not very fine-tuned it's kind

277
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,160
of sketchy it's kind of blurry so that's

278
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,480
that's that's what's going on there

279
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,910
because these aren't very small infrared

280
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,440
beams so there's not they're not very

281
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,540
fine-tuned for performance here but it

282
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,640
still works because you can interpret

283
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,650
that depth stream get you know my hand

284
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,649
is over here my head

285
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:52,220
over here my torso is over here so you

286
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,009
can get full skeleton control for this

287
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:56,600
but again I have to die grass because

288
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,050
we're talking about C++ um and yeah we'd

289
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,699
probably rather be stuck on she sharp on

290
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:05,569
Windows but luckily I can make a plug-in

291
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:08,709
for this and I made an oj s plug-in so

292
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:11,689
hopefully now we can get crack and sweat

293
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:14,540
into the web so it's actually on NPM MPM

294
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,399
install new emotion i have it on github

295
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,579
right here so my point in here is not to

296
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:21,559
sell anything or anything like take it

297
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,720
learn from it break it apart for kit

298
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,519
whatever you got to do I just want to

299
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,160
see cool experiences on the web using

300
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,869
browsers and no Jas so example of what

301
00:13:32,869 --> 00:13:35,389
we can see here is you know I can I can

302
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:37,639
go in and start a skirt start a skeleton

303
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,410
listener so I add a left hand or right

304
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,379
hand I had a call back at a certain

305
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:44,389
interval 50 milliseconds being my

306
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:46,610
default and I can take a look at okay

307
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,439
and my callback function i'm getting a

308
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:51,559
parameter my skeleton I get XYZ

309
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:54,589
coordinates for any joint I want X Y Z

310
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:59,509
rotation for any joint i want my my hand

311
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:01,519
being a hundred percent excited being

312
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,040
not extended at all so there's the

313
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,480
thought kind of things you can get if

314
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,990
you look look at the skeleton so I you

315
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,089
know it's it's fun stuff it's a really

316
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:14,059
fun stuff an event listening I can I can

317
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:17,629
see Oh is my user out of the scene or if

318
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:23,990
it would do that there we go alright so

319
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,970
yeah when my users out at scene when it

320
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,620
stopped tracking when it start tracking

321
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,189
all that good stuff and I can listen for

322
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:33,740
gestures to so swiping down up left

323
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,459
right I can figure out a wave on my hand

324
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:41,749
and yeah so you can write I'm running my

325
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:43,939
own gestures and sometimes they're not

326
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:45,350
very good especially in situations like

327
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,110
this when things are going crazy but i

328
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,899
like that i like the skeleton stuff

329
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:54,499
myself the best and uses its it's a coup

330
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:58,009
it's really fun to use and other than

331
00:14:58,009 --> 00:14:59,509
that you can create cool 10-foot

332
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:01,790
interfaces so like the xbox I

333
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,990
you're sitting on your living room couch

334
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,360
and you're controlling an interface with

335
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,090
your hands there's also innovative games

336
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,730
using your whole body to to get out and

337
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,980
make a game interacting with public

338
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,020
spaces how many time you know there's so

339
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,750
many touch screens out there and they

340
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,580
all get smudged up in greasy what if you

341
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,640
could create some public space

342
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,260
interactive experience where you don't

343
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,210
have to touch a screen you just use your

344
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,180
hands in thin air real world analytics

345
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,580
this is a cool thing that somebody did a

346
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,340
cool application so there's a company

347
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,680
called shop reception shop reception I

348
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,480
would have never thought of this they

349
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,300
mount like a couple connects or whatever

350
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,640
whatever cameras on top of a shopping

351
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,920
aisle and they look down on people and

352
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,950
they gather real-time metrics on when

353
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,500
people take stuff from the aisle stuff

354
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,930
from the shopping display and they'll

355
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,790
get heat maps they'll get analytics data

356
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,530
so this is something I would have never

357
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,530
thought of and people are doing it with

358
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,850
these cameras so it's like a real-life

359
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:07,670
google analytics for you but here's what

360
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,340
I don't want to do and there's a book

361
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,010
called brave new world and it's about

362
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,600
the only we're talking about natural

363
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,100
user interfaces and natural user

364
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,540
interfaces are the type of thing where

365
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,310
you're interacting with something very

366
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,290
naturally not using a mouse and clicking

367
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,360
around just walk up to something and

368
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,180
figure out how to use it and they i sell

369
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,340
i stole this from their book they made a

370
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,940
great little point so we all wanted

371
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,410
power gloves back in the eighties when

372
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,120
we were kids at least I did I don't did

373
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,870
anybody have one yeah like two people so

374
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,130
uh and why was that I mean I I don't

375
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,570
think my parents don't want to be a buy

376
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,200
one but um the reason they were a

377
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,600
failure was there was like two power

378
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,330
glove games ever made they could also be

379
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,470
played with the standard controller

380
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,440
therefore you know you didn't see any

381
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,720
you user experience innovation on these

382
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,550
games it was just an awkward controller

383
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,310
you use it looked so cool but at the

384
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,110
same time what are you getting out of it

385
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,030
kind of nothing so the author of this

386
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,860
book kind of says you know why bother

387
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,290
with this when you can we can try other

388
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,400
things and you

389
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,080
no I kind of put the connection my brain

390
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,060
to Kinesis IO Kinesis IO is a project

391
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,730
started last fall or summer and they

392
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,320
came up with this whole thing with the

393
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,280
Kinect and you could take div tags and

394
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,210
mark them up with special CSS styles and

395
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:36,210
and you know Markham up its interactive

396
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,130
and what it would do is go through your

397
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,050
DOM and look for these things and say

398
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,420
hey this is interactive this is gonna

399
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,890
I'm going to make it you know I can

400
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,540
click by putting my hand up in the air

401
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,860
and holding it there for a while so

402
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,690
that's how I click links i can scroll

403
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,910
around on the screen i can use a cursor

404
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,060
so all cool stuff when you think about

405
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,000
it but if you really think about it why

406
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,040
bother because we already know how to

407
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,450
interact with a web page and this is

408
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,850
kind of an awkward way of doing it I

409
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,590
don't mean to be disparaging of these

410
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,440
guys but you know maybe we could create

411
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,440
better experiences with with these new

412
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,870
natural user interface tools we have the

413
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:17,270
hardware so that's that's my why bother

414
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,230
so like I said we're talking about

415
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,960
natural user interfaces they should to

416
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,100
reiterate they should really be

417
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,290
intuitive we're talking about gestures

418
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,000
we're talking about motion we're talking

419
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,790
about speech 2d gestures are already on

420
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,650
all your mobile devices you can pinch

421
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:36,390
zoom flip photos and guess what speech

422
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,250
is also a form of natural user

423
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,930
interaction we're talking to our devices

424
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,310
now so we're talking to a Google now

425
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:50,130
where we're talking to Siri and so some

426
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,290
rules people are already doing this

427
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,860
stuff especially on xbox and microsoft

428
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,130
is already coming up with some rules for

429
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,470
this so they're one of those rules for

430
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,380
games use the game mindset in games you

431
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,180
know people like being challenged they

432
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,440
like they don't mind looking a little

433
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,600
silly like I'm doing with all this stuff

434
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,070
so and they're eager to learn they're

435
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,250
eager to improve um but for applications

436
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,950
if if I'm using a slide deck for example

437
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,740
I gotta walk right up there I gotta

438
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,870
start using it right away I don't want

439
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,920
any guidance

440
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,320
no learning curve I want my app to be

441
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,940
immediately functional or people will

442
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:36,570
just not want it and I have some gesture

443
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,300
guidelines of those going along here so

444
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,560
what you want to do is create a good

445
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,780
balance of intuitive and intentional so

446
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,560
when I say intuitive i mean i like i

447
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,820
said i want to walk right up to

448
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,380
something i want to start using it i

449
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,820
want to i want to know what's going on

450
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,940
and intentional means you know my

451
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,260
gestures haven't been working out well

452
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,600
with you guys here but you know i don't

453
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,490
want to do anything accidental like i

454
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,230
have been doing here with you guys so if

455
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,970
I start getting really excited about all

456
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,010
this stuff I don't want my stuff to go

457
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,130
off and advance the slide so you gotta

458
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,870
strike a good balance there between with

459
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,600
your gestures and I want to see gesture

460
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,880
progress so when I raise my hand here

461
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,940
you can see the majestic Star ting to

462
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,790
start and then I can see it canceled so

463
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,620
I have some good visual feedback there

464
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,970
one of my arms getting raised when I'm

465
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,980
ready to go and do a gesture so I have

466
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,360
some progress steps in there am i plug

467
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:35,430
in so yeah I'm hoping you guys try it

468
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,460
for yourself like I said you know take

469
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,440
apart my plug-in learn from it whatever

470
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,340
you want to do web sockets are probably

471
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,320
the most obvious way to use this

472
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,370
technology so what I have is a plug-in

473
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,550
for node the new emotion plugin and what

474
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,750
it does is just connects over web

475
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,580
sockets and sends moat and sends data to

476
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,500
the browser and like this guy is a

477
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,930
reveal j/s obviously it I have a I have

478
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,120
a plug-in going in reveal jas to pick up

479
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,270
this data and listen for gestures but

480
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,100
the another cool thing i found was

481
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,440
making a desktop application with app

482
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,050
j/s or node WebKit so node WebKit take

483
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:16,890
some it takes your your node project and

484
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,840
slaps a WebKit front end on it and

485
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,060
bundles it all up on one project and I

486
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,760
tried that with this and it works great

487
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,290
so check out node WebKit I have some

488
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,650
links at the end for this and then you

489
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,600
know the other reason I want want to

490
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,640
check this out is because open and I the

491
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,050
foundation they're a little biased of

492
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,910
course but they project a 15 billion

493
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,910
dollar 3d sensing industry by 2018 it's

494
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:39,850
a little far the future

495
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,730
but I like to get it like ground floor

496
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,830
on stuff like this so and start playing

497
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,400
with stuff just go this fun and

498
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,049
primeSense the company that makes some

499
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:51,880
of these sensors they're being sold in

500
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,720
bulk to device manufacturers so you'll

501
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,309
see just let us see them in Smart TVs

502
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:00,160
you'll start to see him in smartphones

503
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,669
all over the place so I think it I think

504
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:06,789
it's a cool cool thing to try as web

505
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:08,700
developers to get out there and start

506
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,030
even if you know my plugin who cares but

507
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,650
if we can start experimenting with ways

508
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,600
to do the stuff on the web and start

509
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,539
experimenting with innovative ways to

510
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:21,640
get all this stuff going and I think I

511
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,140
think we can get a jump start on this so

512
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:28,690
yeah so here's some links you can find

513
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,850
my manifesto on all this stuff on sweat

514
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:35,140
into the web com here's my my github

515
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,890
repository and then my website and then

516
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,620
a node web kit which I mentioned for

517
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,809
wrapping all your apps up as a whole

518
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:47,230
package so yeah that's my presentation

519
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,580
but i want to show you guys a quick

520
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,150
little demo that will traditionally work

521
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:56,799
better than this one and i think like

522
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,450
you know everybody i talked to when they

523
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,730
do stuff like this they're all over the

524
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,980
painting demo so i made a made a little

525
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:13,039
painting demo let's see

526
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:16,080
and I also let me switch it over to

527
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,980
https because I wanted to use google

528
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,989
google chrome chrome 25 they have a web

529
00:23:21,989 --> 00:23:26,519
speech web speech get api in there so if

530
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:28,320
we switch it over to https it can always

531
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,259
be on and always be listening to you so

532
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:33,299
let's see if it can hear me i hope it

533
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:35,549
can maybe the micros are weird but so

534
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:39,659
we're gonna so I have some my painting

535
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,820
in here so if I keep my hand in like

536
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,340
this it's not painting but when you

537
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,989
reach out your hand which i think is a

538
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:49,679
good a nice way of telling it you want

539
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,480
to actually do something it starts

540
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,869
painting and so we can paint along and

541
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:57,809
then we can start erasing things and you

542
00:23:57,809 --> 00:23:59,429
know like I said like bring your hand in

543
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:01,049
and it doesn't do it anymore you're just

544
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:03,720
going on the screen with your icon so we

545
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,450
can start painting and you know if I

546
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,029
shout at this thing so when we hide the

547
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:15,629
mic give me a purple paint brush I think

548
00:24:15,629 --> 00:24:17,580
the sound is weird on that one but so

549
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,679
yeah that's that that's one thing you

550
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,039
can try to do with the skeleton data

551
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:24,239
since I have a few minutes let me show

552
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:27,600
you let me show you guys another little

553
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:43,630
demo here

554
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,160
so here's a little demo where you start

555
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,280
as an egg and then when you get on

556
00:24:49,280 --> 00:25:00,190
screen it should hatch let me refresh

557
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,690
there we go started to hatch while I'm

558
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:10,970
pick me up

559
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:15,179
Oh No okay there we go so magically it

560
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:16,860
hatched I know you guys you know you

561
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,330
didn't see it or anything but let me a

562
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,520
lemon yeah okay we're back to an egg so

563
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,140
when you go in front of the screen again

564
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:35,760
oh come on seriously let me start let me

565
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,860
start that oh jesus only happens when I

566
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:50,400
love in front of you guys all right come

567
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,490
on there we go so the the interaction

568
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,210
mechanism here is we're seeing the

569
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,190
rotation of each arm and we're

570
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,809
controlling the the birds arm was that

571
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,260
and the the physics on those are really

572
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,120
wacky to have to tweak it but you can

573
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:12,590
start flying away if I get high enough I

574
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,710
can start floating down and I think my

575
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:24,889
computer just died

576
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:27,340
that was that was really rough so I'm

577
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,289
gonna have to put on my extra sweatband

578
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:47,730
here thanks guys much appreciated
