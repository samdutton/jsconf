00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,900

mic check 12 hey everyone thanks for

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,490
being back here from lunch I want to say

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,340
thank you to jay s fest and CSS comp

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,039
Oakland the organizers Carolina and

5
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:16,810
Michael for giving me this opportunity

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,660
to talk about something that I think is

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,340
really fun and then I'm really

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:28,120
passionate about so let's see very good

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,980
so there's a lot of really fascinating

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,500
math behind the display of colors on the

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,140
web there's hue and saturation and

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,390
brightness and then variables of this

13
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:42,280
and that is a whole talk in itself but

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,440
what drew me to designing for the web

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,569
and the first place was that first of

16
00:00:46,569 --> 00:00:48,309
all I could use really vibrant colors

17
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:51,579
and second of all that the web connects

18
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:54,309
you to information and stories and

19
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:57,879
people so I want to talk today about the

20
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:03,039
stories behind the hex values so for a

21
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,449
while I have loved these two things

22
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:07,060
separately I love riding CSS code and

23
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,650
making things look good on the web and I

24
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,300
love color I got really into namespace

25
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,400
colors when I saw this project it's

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,070
called music for the Memphis group and

27
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,670
it's just really cool basically visual

28
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,680
album almost it's imagining of what the

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,140
what this design group the Memphis group

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,310
what the type of music they would listen

31
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,990
to and the background is all these

32
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,150
different Memphis group patterns and I

33
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,120
like I started tweeting at the guy who

34
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,120
designed it and asking him how he did it

35
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,250
and he was telling me that the

36
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,040
background is actually rendered all with

37
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,840
SVG's and three different layers of

38
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,180
transparent SVG's and he was like I used

39
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,820
all CSS namespace colors for the colors

40
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,370
and this is something that I had heard

41
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:58,240
of but I never really made much use of

42
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,470
namespace colors like just by themselves

43
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,110
so I think everyone knows this but just

44
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,850
to make sure we're on the same page when

45
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,039
I'm talking about CSS namespace values I

46
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,750
mean when you're coding in CSS and

47
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,730
instead of typing in the hex value you

48
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,790
can reference a set list of key word

49
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,080
color keywords I think

50
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,940
about 147 of them and the browser and

51
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,200
everyone will know what you're talking

52
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,250
about so back to this project I was

53
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,750
talking to the creator of it and he was

54
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,450
showing me the color chart that he used

55
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,960
in order to make this design and I got

56
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,400
really inspired and wanted to make my

57
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,820
own but put it in rainbow order like you

58
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,510
do and when while i was doing this i

59
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,030
spent a lot of time with the names and i

60
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,040
got really intrigued about where they

61
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,920
came from a lot of them are kind of

62
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,960
quirky like some are really normal but

63
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,060
then some are really out there like I

64
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,709
think on this slide we see peach puff

65
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:01,990
and tomato and I wanted to know more

66
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,270
about how those names got chosen and who

67
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,150
got to pick them and I knew the story of

68
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,790
one recent color edition I think a lot

69
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,550
of you do that's Rebecca purple so most

70
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,160
of you know this but almost exactly six

71
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,700
months ago Eric Myers a big writer about

72
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,690
CSS and web standards his daughter six

73
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,940
years old Rebecca passed away after a

74
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,120
battle with pediatric brain cancer so in

75
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,790
her memory and in their honor a proposal

76
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,450
was submitted to name six six-thirty 399

77
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,530
after Rebecca and call it Rebecca purple

78
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,930
so this is this really incredibly human

79
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,630
moment touching story of naming of

80
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,630
colors and a great moment in the history

81
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,120
of the internet that really brings his

82
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,760
color to life and I was hungry for more

83
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,530
stories like this behind the naming of

84
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,450
the colors and I thought surely there

85
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,340
were more instances of why something was

86
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,260
called papayawhip or a mint cream or

87
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,950
gainsborough so I went hunting for more

88
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,550
anecdotes I'll tell you what I found the

89
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,489
reality is a lot more tedious and sort

90
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:11,580
of black and white and boring but

91
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,160
there's a lot that is revealed about the

92
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,900
history of the web and the possibilities

93
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,680
that lay ahead of us so the first thing

94
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,320
to clear up about CSS namespace values

95
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:29,689
is that they're not CSS original they

96
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:32,360
were there web standard colors and i

97
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,939
think i saw in Brenna's slides a lot

98
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:39,039
like she uses them an SVG they're there

99
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,199
they can be used across a lot of

100
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,089
different platforms which we'll get to

101
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:47,389
but they were originally descended from

102
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:49,549
the x windowing system which is a

103
00:04:49,549 --> 00:04:51,439
windowing system for bit map displays

104
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,259
common on unix-like computer operating

105
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:57,319
systems so these were called the x11

106
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,649
colors and they were first shipped in

107
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:02,929
1986 so this type of windowing system

108
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:04,759
was one of the first graphic user

109
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,919
interfaces to render things in window

110
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:09,919
boxes and so having these standard

111
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,019
system colors were really important for

112
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:14,989
the differentiation of different areas

113
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:19,099
and sections and windows the original

114
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:21,019
late 80s list still had a lot of

115
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:23,929
variation between monitors so there was

116
00:05:23,929 --> 00:05:26,239
kind of an agreed-upon set of names but

117
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:28,669
even within those the different vendors

118
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:30,169
would tweak the values for their

119
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:33,469
particular monitor so neither the names

120
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:35,539
nor the values were quite standardized

121
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:38,989
yet until nineteen eighty nine we see

122
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:41,899
the release of the fourth revision of X

123
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:44,569
11 and most of the colors that we know

124
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:48,349
today as web standard colors so here is

125
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,300
the beginning of that x11 color list

126
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,989
these colors were user tested and tuned

127
00:05:53,989 --> 00:05:56,989
originally to an HP monitor and graphic

128
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,779
designer started to get used to them so

129
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:01,610
from there they were popularized by

130
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,919
Netscape and then they started being

131
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,739
widely used in HTML browsers and finally

132
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:09,769
in 2011 I think SVG officially

133
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,469
standardized them and then also in 2011

134
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:15,139
they were rolled into the css3 color

135
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:18,860
module so we took a while but the usage

136
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,319
in css3 is just the most recent tip of

137
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,149
the iceberg for these standard web

138
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:26,809
colors why did it take so long that begs

139
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:29,259
a question there's a big gap between

140
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:33,110
1986 and 2011 well as we have already

141
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,149
heard today it takes a while for web

142
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:37,489
standards to get rolled in and it's

143
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:41,240
normal for things to take I think tab

144
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,590
says like five years at the least

145
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,110
and also because apparently there are a

146
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,850
lot better ways to incorporate name

147
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,160
color values in CSS which maybe you guys

148
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,080
make use of you can sort of define your

149
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,820
own values and if you really like a

150
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,430
certain pink you can call it George pink

151
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,310
or project pink and then go from there

152
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,690
and so they're not necessarily needed

153
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,700
but I want to make an argument for using

154
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,840
them because I think they're really

155
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,540
great even though they're not CSS I

156
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,580
think there's a lot of good reasons why

157
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,260
to use them they are time and user

158
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,810
tested for accessibility I was really

159
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,610
nervous about this slide because I was

160
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,350
like I'm saying this but I don't know

161
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,240
how this yellow is going to look it

162
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,740
could really kill everyone's eyes but

163
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:31,230
it's going well so there you go because

164
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,600
they were put through the wringer before

165
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,550
at being added to the web standard list

166
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,430
we know that we can rely on them to be

167
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,000
good looking on the on the web and on

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,550
monitors so when you're writing code you

169
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,950
are obviously dealing with a lot of

170
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,830
syntax and numbers and I think it's so

171
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,140
refreshing that you can just use the

172
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,020
name and they're not case-sensitive

173
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,310
again they're recognized by all browsers

174
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,710
and they work across HTML and SVG and

175
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,170
they have really fun names so i will

176
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,510
highlight some of my favorite ones we

177
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:13,220
have honeydew papayawhip mint cream

178
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,780
Navajo white this was actually one of

179
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,370
the first ones that I was scrolling

180
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,390
through the list I was like what's

181
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:23,230
Navajo white and why is it orange

182
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:30,110
cornflower blue Dodger blue orchid

183
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:36,530
antique white gainsborough saddle brown

184
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:42,690
Peru ghost white these are just a few of

185
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,230
my favorite so while it wasn't exactly a

186
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,460
committee of people sitting around

187
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,830
deciding to name something gainsborough

188
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,530
or bone white i did find out where these

189
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:56,889
names came from so in 1980

190
00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:00,369
9 for the fourth revision of X 11 this

191
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:01,929
is when a big bunch of the colors were

192
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:03,519
added and one of the one of the

193
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,379
contributors to this was Paul raveling

194
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:09,009
and he got a lot of colors from Sinclair

195
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:12,369
paint swatches and a lot of the ones

196
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:15,339
that a lot of the light and off white

197
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:17,879
colors were from Sinclair paint swatches

198
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,799
Sinclair paints was a california area

199
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,459
paint supplier and after these colors

200
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:26,949
were added they were actually bought up

201
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:28,029
by somebody in the bought out by

202
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:29,019
somebody else and they're like

203
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:33,519
completely devoured now but I went

204
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,399
digging on paint forums and somebody had

205
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,929
a swatch book from the late 80s and you

206
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:42,970
can sort of recognize some of these

207
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,910
names which is so cool I'll highlight

208
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,239
the ones that are like definitely in the

209
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:51,429
web standard colors but it makes sense

210
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:54,309
because thinking about like what the

211
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:56,049
goofy names are in these web standard

212
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:57,879
colors and when you're naming paint

213
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,980
swatches and you have to find six

214
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,929
different ways to say light orange you

215
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:06,299
get really creative so hence papayawhip

216
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:08,949
you may have noticed that a lot of these

217
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:11,470
colors which were using this and Claire

218
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,569
paint swatches there are a lot of beiges

219
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:16,689
and off rights so this is one of my

220
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:18,699
favorite sections but it does sort of

221
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:20,589
beg the question like why do we have so

222
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:22,629
many beiges I don't know about you guys

223
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:25,149
but I I maybe use a lot of Gray's a lot

224
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:26,980
of different like light or dark Gray's

225
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,379
but I don't really need that many bases

226
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:34,720
well this is because there's so many

227
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,850
options for different browser

228
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,980
backgrounds when these were standardized

229
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,009
in the late 80s and early 90s this was

230
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,689
so designers could find like the perfect

231
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:45,669
beige for their desktop browser

232
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:50,470
background so another big chunk of them

233
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,470
came from John see Thomas naming a lot

234
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,829
of the colors after Crayola 72 crayon

235
00:10:56,829 --> 00:11:00,999
box that he had on hand in scrolling

236
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:02,769
through the list of the different names

237
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:04,869
of Crayola crayons you can recognize

238
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:06,779
some that are definitely rolled in I

239
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:10,510
think I counted 39 that are

240
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,910
definitely from this list and this also

241
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,080
makes sense because when you're looking

242
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,970
at naming a lot of colors it makes sense

243
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,580
to reference a commonly held standard

244
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,820
color nomenclature so these are ones

245
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,830
that are definitely from Crayola crayons

246
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,600
and then from there there's light and

247
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,030
dark variations so adding colors

248
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,770
actually seems to be a rare occurrence

249
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,620
for web standards considering we're

250
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,680
still working off the list released in

251
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,310
1989 besides Rebecca purple the names we

252
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,560
have today we're gathered from various

253
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,120
defaults and more or less are the same

254
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,860
even Rebecca purple which seems like an

255
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,810
obvious opportunity for doing something

256
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,140
nice and beautiful and human why not

257
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,120
name this color after the sweet little

258
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,250
girl but there was a big debate over

259
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,680
this over adding this and it was added

260
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,220
unusually quickly I think in less than I

261
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,450
think it was like three months but this

262
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,850
is because the creators of web standards

263
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,380
take their responsibilities very

264
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,420
seriously which is really good we want

265
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,670
that but it also means that colors never

266
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,610
get added to the standard list and I

267
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,290
just wonder why should we stop there are

268
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,540
we really cool with this or should we

269
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,610
question the standard list and make it a

270
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,980
part of web culture to expand this list

271
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,210
of colors I believe that color is one of

272
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,830
the ways that we can make the internet

273
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,790
more human and more fun I think that

274
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,560
default is boring and I think so many

275
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,450
websites seem to be generated from

276
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,510
defaults they have the same navies and

277
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,630
grays and black and default bootstrap

278
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,390
templates so I invite all color lovers

279
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,580
to think beyond the default but I also

280
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,200
challenge you to think about the color

281
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,110
of the web we have so many colors at our

282
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,220
disposal why aren't we using them we

283
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,110
have this great resource for trying

284
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,780
tested colors so there's kind of no

285
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,060
excuse to just pick some of these and

286
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,890
start experimenting I think that's a

287
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,840
theme of today is experiment and be

288
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,800
adventurous of course we have to keep in

289
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,720
mind accessibility especially when it

290
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,260
comes to rendering text the w3c states

291
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,100
that call

292
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,199
or should not be the only means for

293
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:28,120
conveying information or prompting in

294
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,160
action but still we should use more

295
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,949
color so I want to show you guys some

296
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:35,199
examples of sites that are using color

297
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:39,310
boldly and using it really well this is

298
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,360
a site for pollen Midwest and I think

299
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,190
that this website really struck me

300
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,680
because they use colors that I sort of

301
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,060
thought were off limits like this

302
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,550
magenta and bright yellow and they also

303
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,009
use a wider color palette than I

304
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:55,930
normally do I think typically as a

305
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,389
visual designer I pick one or two accent

306
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:00,519
colors and feel like I'm even pushing it

307
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:02,290
at that and then everything else I just

308
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,000
let be neutral and come stay in the

309
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,819
background but they've used all of these

310
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:10,360
really bright accent colors and because

311
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,529
of the mastering of design they pulled

312
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:15,790
it off and still made it look really

313
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,670
slick and professional but to me the

314
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,529
site is really memorable because of its

315
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:21,940
use of color and because of its color

316
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,209
palette so this is a portfolio for an

317
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:27,579
Australian designer and also a really

318
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:31,089
bold nice use of primary colors and a

319
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:32,980
bold color palette that I think makes

320
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,350
this portfolio website which we've all

321
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,839
seen a million of really stand out and

322
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,660
really be nice but you might be thinking

323
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,660
I have to work on serious things I have

324
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,089
to work on financial site and I have to

325
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:47,529
make websites that make people feel

326
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:50,800
secure about using it and doing business

327
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,120
on the Internet I hear you the biggest

328
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,279
projects I've done have have been these

329
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,920
types of projects for nonprofits dealing

330
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,230
with financials and working with

331
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,079
government websites too and the default

332
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:07,389
there is again to use like navy blue or

333
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:12,220
blue or blue and grey and black but my

334
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,800
trick is to kind of find like the little

335
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,079
instances where you can flip that out

336
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:19,810
and what I do a lot is use instead of

337
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,610
that navy blue is like a like a green

338
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,880
okay like a blue green and then use

339
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,610
illustrations as an opportunity to make

340
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,139
things really beautiful and you see an

341
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:30,910
even wider color palette because i think

342
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,730
if you nine times out of ten if you come

343
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,970
back with a beautiful design people are

344
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,690
going to be

345
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,470
one over by that so I say make it

346
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,570
beautiful and don't ask permission to

347
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,320
use pastels so there's one thing you

348
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,610
take away from this talk I hope it's

349
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,270
that but seriously we should have fun

350
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,730
with color we should use these CSS

351
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,630
namespace values and we should challenge

352
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,850
ourselves to think beyond default colors

353
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,980
and even push the standard list of

354
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,340
colors I want to make a shameless plug

355
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,130
for my own CSS color chart if you want

356
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,860
to experiment start here but there's a

357
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,630
lot of really great ones there's a guy

358
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,760
named Neil orange peel that has one that

359
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,910
is definitely better than mine but

360
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,400
different but you have this link so use

361
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:27,880
that one these are some some references

362
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,590
i used a big thank you to Chris Lilly he

363
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,810
was actually super helpful in answering

364
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:38,500
all my questions about CSS color specs

365
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,280
and web standards and thank you to

366
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,010
lexington ladies code club and lexington

367
