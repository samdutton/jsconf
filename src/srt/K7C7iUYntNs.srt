1
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:24,040
Thank you, general, that was very kind of
you, hi, everyone, I'm Brad Bouse as Jen said,

2
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,930
I'm from Seattle.

3
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:31,700
Seattle is the city in the northwestern corner
of the United States, we have a lot of coffee,

4
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,750
we have a lot of men with beards, we have
a lot of tattoos, and we have a lot of rain,

5
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,460
I feel really at home here in Berlin, it's
great.

6
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:47,070
I work as a front end engineer, products manager,
mostly for very early stage start ups, I like

7
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,070
figuring out what should and should not be
in a product.

8
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,320
So, I have a little bit of advice for you.

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,710
Now, I just want to clear something upright
now, I know that there's been rumors, this

10
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,320
is actually not about the Apple Watch.

11
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,179
I know the timing kind of worked out that
that might be what it's about, it's actually

12
00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:11,360
something different.

13
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,180
Marking something useless sounds, it's a funny
thing to say, maybe that's why you're here,

14
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,860
it's not how we think about things, we normally
think about things and their utility, we've

15
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:28,060
learned a lot of really useful things to day,
I don't know if that's always the best idea.

16
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,920
So, there's one question that as professional
developers, engineers that you've been asked,

17
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,229
be asked by your boss, your product manager,
your client.

18
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:48,250
And that question is how long will it take?
And, if you're like me, that's your answer.

19
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:57,810
And if you're really like me, and then you
just want to tell them to go away.

20
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,310
You have to deal with this problem, the reason
why this causes us a lot of anxiety is that

21
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,119
we have to distill all the come collated things
that could go on in this product, in this

22
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,290
feature, in this bug all the things that could
go wrong, we have to distill that down to

23
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:17,360
a number, have to turn that to a date, we
have to commit to it, every decision we make

24
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,829
along the road we have to meet that number
this is how we solve problems professionally.

25
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:33,230
We put them into a mechanism that managers
times, manager chunks of problems to land

26
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,640
the project in finish state, sometimes down
the road.

27
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,849
And along the way we have to make a lot of
compromises, we have to keep saying, oh, we

28
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:45,672
can't do this, we can't do that, because we
don't have a lot of time that's okay, that's

29
00:02:45,672 --> 00:02:49,780
how it works, with eve got to make money\h‑‑
we have to make money, business has to go

30
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:56,950
on, the one thing that this does is it stops
us from exploring code, it stops us from playing

31
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,700
with code.

32
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,099
The reason I want you to do something useless,
take a little bit of time and do something

33
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:07,600
where there's no dead line where nobody cares
if it's finished.

34
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,879
This is the waterfall swing.

35
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,380
They have been doing well with this, tail
brought it around to different installations

36
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,700
in different cities, and this just looks fun.

37
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:25,650
If you\h‑‑ if you, I would really rather
be there right now, in fact.

38
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,590
If you ride this and you're not giggling like
a little schoolgirl, you're just not human,

39
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,959
it looks like a lot of fun.

40
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,989
So what this is called, broadly speaking,
is creative coding.

41
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,830
It's a little bit of problematic term because
it has a gait in coding, yee creative coding

42
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:49,790
is a qualifier, yee creative is a good thing,
if you don't feel like you're creative, can

43
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:54,209
you do yee creative coding? That's a problem
I'd like to talk about, that's what I'd like

44
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:55,379
to work through today.

45
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:00,590
So the first thing is Iv to say is don't be
afraid I've been talking about yee creative

46
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:06,459
code for a while, and a lot of people say
that's really neat, but it's not for me, I'm

47
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:10,629
not yee creative, I'm not good at that, my
stuff doesn't look good.

48
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:12,439
I can't do that.

49
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,439
That's okay.

50
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,549
It's really natural.

51
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:20,579
When mess of you think ant art, you probably
think about something like this\h‑‑ think

52
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:28,140
art you probably think about this, this is
a masterpiece, Rembrant, he looks like a million

53
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:33,750
bucks, it probably is way more than a million
bucks, he's worth multiple million bucks,

54
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,590
if you're like me, you might have sat down
and try to draw something, maybe you tried

55
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:47,820
to draw this? (Laughing) and I'll admit, like
I, I didn't draw that, I Googled it, I took

56
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,719
a terrible child's drawing because I was too
embarrassed of my own bad drawing to put it

57
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:55,130
on screen.

58
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,810
This is kind of my favorite illustration of
the problem.

59
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:03,539
And it's what you see all over the place where
experts will give you a tutorial where it

60
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:06,530
starts to go, way, way, way too fast.

61
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,590
And when you're an expert you never see all
these geniuses you never see all the crap

62
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,289
that they actually make.

63
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:15,919
You never see their process when they're making
art.

64
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,550
You just draw the rest of it out.

65
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:24,630
So Ira glass is an American talk show host,
he has a great talk about this very problem.

66
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,969
He said asacriative person the first thing
you probably have is taste, you know kind

67
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:35,479
of what's good, what's bad, and you have an
opinion about the way things should be, when

68
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:40,320
you sit down to make something for the very
first time, you make it, you're disappointed

69
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,050
you know your taste is work against you, you
know this stuff is not as good as what you

70
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,570
see out there, what you like, he call this
is the gap.

71
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:54,180
I think that's\h‑‑ everybody faces this,
and the only way to cross this grab is with

72
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,960
practice, you have to take a step back, recognize
that I'm at this gap, and I can cross it,

73
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,310
I can cross it by doing work.

74
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:08,180
Put in practice, I can put in time, I can
work on this process.

75
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:15,990
This is Chuck Close, he is an American artist,
this was in 1968, I believe.

76
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,770
His quote that I really like, inspiration
is for amateurs the rest of us just show up

77
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,500
and get the work.

78
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,060
Chuck Close is an artist that believers in
process, he believe in doing work.

79
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,000
This is actually a huge painting.

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,950
It's an 8‑foot by 8‑foot painting, it's
glorious to behold, if you get a chance to

81
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:44,789
see it please do, each whisker is beautifully
render, the bouquet around his face, it's

82
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:47,930
a luminous painting.

83
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,490
And he puts in the work.

84
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:56,180
And he's actually made a career out of these
extremely photo realistic large form pictures.

85
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:02,120
And you can see his style evolves you can
understand this is a man that's showing up

86
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,080
to work, he's putting in the hours and he's
making great work.

87
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,709
I don't what his first work started out like,
but I imagine it evolved and he got better.

88
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:17,660
Maybe he started out drawing the two little
circles, I don't know.

89
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,930
So what this\h‑‑ when I see this, we like
to think kind of culturally as artists as

90
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,830
being struck by a lightening bolt, maybe they're
lounging on a hill somewhere, they're struck

91
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:34,490
by a lightening bolt of sudden inspirery inspiration
and they paint the Mona Lisa, whatever, whatever

92
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:40,039
is an amazing piece of work, but that's not
the case, they're men, they're women, they're

93
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:44,830
working, they're struggling and they're putting
in the hours, showing up for work, working

94
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:52,160
on a process, and when you're feeling bad
about whatever you're markinge, think about

95
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,940
process as your savety net, know that if you
keep working at it.

96
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,029
You'll get better.

97
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:01,930
The reason why you want to keep working when
you're trying to make something is great ideas

98
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,440
are really hidden.

99
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,099
There's a theory I really like strew art Kaufman
it's about adjacent possible.

100
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:15,380
It's about evolution, we think about evolution
as a linear path where we went straight out

101
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:20,750
of the muck to bee become Homo sapienses,
that's not how it worked, it was a lurching

102
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:28,010
process, one evolution beget another evolution,
by the time we got to a third evolution it's

103
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,219
a completely different space from where we
started.

104
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:36,019
Ideas work the same way, if you're exploring
an idea, a project, you don't know what's

105
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:41,460
going to happen right away, you have to work,
put in the hours and maybe you'll see something

106
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,760
new that will happen.

107
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,460
We have this in our own live in start ups,
it's called a five pivot.

108
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:52,870
Sometimes it's a cover for something else,
the classical use of pivot, they explore a

109
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,760
space, they see something else is Bert that
they didn't see before and they move into

110
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
it.

111
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,860
So if you combine these two things, idea of
working a process of crossing the gap and

112
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,520
exploring where you are at every stage youv
a powerful mechanism to make something new

113
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,060
and interesting.

114
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:16,250
Now, it's important for me to say, that I'm
not an artist, I'm not particularly blessed

115
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:22,260
with creativity, what I am good at is streamlining
processes, I'm good at understanding how things

116
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:28,900
work, but as you see I'm married to an artist,
this is Anne\h‑‑ she is a poetty professor,

117
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:36,950
I have been to far more than my share of poetry
reading, performance arts museums and all

118
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:43,750
strange things, I feel as an ambassador from
strange lands to share what I've learned as

119
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,060
an engineer.

120
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,570
We work on projects together.

121
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:54,750
This is one project that we did, it's called
between page and screen.

122
00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:00,360
And it is an augmented reality book of poetry.

123
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,050
I know.

124
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:07,240
When you open it up you'll see that you have
markers, there's no words, just a series of

125
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,790
markers.

126
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,400
And the instructions to go to between page
and screen.com.

127
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:25,640
Question see me in many ways, when we hold
up\h‑‑\h‑‑ we hold the words in our

128
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:38,030
hands, and what these are is a series of letters
between page and screen about their kind of

129
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:43,170
tack curious relation ship.

130
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:50,280
(fracturus) that's been a successful project
for us.

131
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,940
She's been invited to fly around the world
to present it, she does a much better job

132
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,620
than I do.

133
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,070
This was great, it was a lark, a thing that
we did for fun.

134
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,550
People like it, it's a real book, you can
buy it.

135
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:11,190
One of the great things that came out of it
a small arts group approached us to do a commissioned

136
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:16,330
project, which means that we were paid artists,
that was really exciting for us.

137
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:23,241
Now it was a tiny amount of money, it counts,
right, as paid.

138
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:34,780
So we started the process with this group,\h‑‑
Whoa\h‑‑ don't get excited.

139
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:47,620
All right we started the process with this
group, ignore that.

140
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,730
And started to look a lot like work.

141
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:56,720
And we got that question, how long will it
take? How long will it take us to finish this

142
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,260
project, when can we deliver it.

143
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:04,150
We've arranged the gallery space, figure it
out, start marketing, started to feel a lot

144
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,310
like work.

145
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:10,850
And the thing is between page and screen never
felt like work, this is the first demo that

146
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:11,980
we did.

147
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:17,421
I showed her the library that did the marker
technology, she thought that was cool, we

148
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:23,410
talked maybe we codo a book, we did this with
a little pig on a piece of paper, we showed

149
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:28,000
it to a few people and they thought that was
cool and before we knew it we had a book.

150
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,620
Now we have this whole other project and we
have a deadline and it's stressful.

151
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:41,460
We decided to do a project where we had diaries
from 1858, shopkeeper's diary told a very

152
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,420
interesting story.

153
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:49,410
She extracted\h‑‑ transcribed some of
the entries, we decided we would have a project

154
00:12:49,410 --> 00:13:02,050
with the leap motion of where you would go
to a gallery, you would see the leap motion

155
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:08,720
on a column, and then you would see a monitor
above it that is not as large as this one.

156
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,160
And then as you approached you would see your
own distorted face and when you waved your

157
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,920
hand over the leap motion you would see there's
another text within it.

158
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,260
This is called an erasure.

159
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,490
And this is all done in JavaScript with particles
so there are about a million particles that

160
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,520
are moving around my hand.

161
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:36,900
And we have thirty different entries that
you can go and you can read.

162
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:50,920
Of (applause) thank you, that's very kind
of you, and actually it's really hard for

163
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,290
me to show that project because I don't think
it's as good as what it could be.

164
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:00,300
It doesn't have the same pop that between
page and screen has.

165
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,770
People when she showed between page and screen
there's an O O Oh in the audience, this one

166
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,240
doesn't quite have that.

167
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,250
The reason I feel the deadline really paralyzed
me.

168
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,520
There was a lot of new technology that we
needed to learn.

169
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,350
Every one of these blessed technology had
some problem or another in doing this, and

170
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,930
every time I was faced with solving this problem
I had to make compromises because we had a

171
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,710
deadline.

172
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,750
That's okay, that's how stuff works, that's
how business works, it made me think about

173
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,480
this problem of time and what it does the
creative process.

174
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:45,650
I realized one thing people like to do is
go up and they like to see themselves reflected.

175
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:51,200
I thought that was pretty cool, I realized
with this big plate of software that I had

176
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,740
I could do a new project.

177
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:58,130
I could reuse that rendering pipeline and
do something I call glitch booth and what

178
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:03,020
that takes very bad selfies.

179
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,779
So, as you see it's kind of like a Skype call.

180
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:17,400
(Laughing) and there are different things
that you can do and then if you find one that

181
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,540
you like\h‑‑ you can\h‑‑ can tweet
it.

182
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:27,920
So, that's glitch booth and this was that
was about ten hours of code, maybe fifteen

183
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,920
hours of code.

184
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,550
I spent more time ton logo, the site, registering
the Twitter, doing all that stuff then I spent

185
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,200
on writing the code.

186
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,080
I think this is a great example of the adjacent
possible.

187
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:44,310
There's no way I would of sat down and made
glitch booth, it's a bit of a trivial project,

188
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,420
but since I had the code lying around it was
fun.

189
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:55,050
I brought it to cascade yeah JS and a lot
of people came up and took pictures and tweeted

190
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,250
it.

191
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,540
It was a lot of fun.

192
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,570
And you can see that now you can see\h‑‑
there are about 90 of them, it's a Twitter

193
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,570
account.

194
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:12,710
So that's a little bit of my work, and now
it's your turn, so I want you to make something

195
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,500
useless.

196
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,430
The first thing you'll find as a diligent
conference goer, you're going to go home and

197
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:27,610
say brad wanted me to make something useless,
and I'm going to do that, and you'll find

198
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:32,620
that blank pages are blockers, the hardest
part about getting started is getting started

199
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,770
you have a blank page.

200
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:40,000
That's not a new problem, one thing that artist
do is use rules to get started.

201
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,830
They're called constraint, a really common
constraint is a Haiku, it's a three line poem,

202
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:51,660
first line has five syllable, seven syllables
and five syllables in the United States we

203
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:58,700
have school children do this, the form is
so restrictive it becomes a game you have

204
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,560
to fit what ever your mess ermessage is into
this tight format.

205
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,559
Instead of a blank verse assignment they give
them a Haiku, the kids get it done and they

206
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,160
learn a little bit about poetry.

207
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,510
So we actually have, we're blessed with this
enormous network of con train based writing,

208
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,640
I guess you call it Twitter.

209
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:27,600
This is a Haiku Bot that finds completely
inane tweets and recognizes that they're in

210
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:34,370
a Haiku formaillot and tweets them as such.

211
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,650
They're actually kind of entertaining.

212
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:43,790
I everyone in has their favorite dots, this
one's mine, art assignment Bot, pulling a

213
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:53,100
list of three different tasks, the task, the
theme and then a deadline, and they're great.

214
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:59,900
I love the constructed D print critiquing
fear due in two seconds.

215
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:07,780
So,Bots are a great place to start, because
they use the tools you already know how to

216
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,820
use.

217
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:18,201
They're all based with text, if you know a
little Regx X if you pull from a list, use

218
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:21,360
an API, osseter, you're Godden.

219
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,250
Then there's a built in audience once you
tweet it and there's a built‑if data set

220
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:31,620
that is always changing there, are fun things
you didk do with that.

221
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:38,100
If if text isn't your thing this is Sol Lewitt.

222
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:45,660
Considered the father of conceptual art, he
is most famous for wall drawings.

223
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:51,650
The wall drawings are just instructions, instructions
for how to generate the drawing.

224
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:57,950
And what you have here is the text, the instructions
for the image that you see be hind it.

225
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,850
Basically says place 50 random dots on the
wall and then connect them all.

226
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:09,050
So if you want to have your own Sol Lewitt
you hire drafts people, official certified

227
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,760
Sol Lewitt people to come out.

228
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:19,520
They will put it on your wall and you'll get
a certificate, and you now own a Sol Lewitt,

229
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:26,660
this is a conceptual piece, you never meet
Sol Lewitt certificate.

230
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:31,270
He's dead, you can still get a new Sol Witt
just for you.

231
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,910
This is part of the concept.

232
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:39,850
When I saw these instructions I thought it
looked like a ticket from a PM.

233
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:44,840
And so I made a repository, no idea if this
is legal or not, it hasn't been shut down

234
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,840
yet.

235
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,230
I have several dozen of the instructions,
you can go there, there are templates using

236
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:57,310
paper J S using processing, if there's a graphic
language you particularly like, we can make

237
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:02,970
a template for you, and people are making
their own rendering of Sol Lewitt, this is

238
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:08,870
one you can go to it right now, and there's
renders in your browser, there's another one,

239
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,700
another one, another one.

240
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:18,340
And the great thing about them is that there
can be multiple versions of the same solution.

241
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,340
Because they have a little bit.

242
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,910
They have alliful ambiguity.

243
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:25,580
He did that intentionally the different aboutist,
different drafts people would interpret it

244
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,799
differently.

245
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:35,100
I encourage you to fork that Repo, give it
a star, because that helps and then it takes

246
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:40,720
about an hour, two hours depending on your
comfort withdrawing with code, and solves

247
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
them.

248
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,621
And then finally this is somethinge something
that you can do without any code at all, I

249
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:51,870
know that's kind of an outrayous proposal
at JSConf 2014, but that's the deal.

250
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:59,390
So this is a Swiss artist\h‑‑ a group
of artist they were inspired by Sol Lewitt.

251
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:07,880
They have art game, all you need are four
players, four sharpies, and many beers, and

252
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,040
each player takes a turn and what you see
there is that they're doing the first exercise

253
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,491
in the book, a cross hatching exercise and
by the time they're finished with it, you

254
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:20,500
get kind of a neat piece of hatched art.

255
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,170
This is a great thing to do with anyone, you
can do it with your partner, you can do it

256
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:29,210
with your kids, you can even do it with your
entyre company, everybody will have a different

257
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,299
perspective on how this art is generated.

258
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:37,330
I did this with 60 engineers at a company
in LA, it was neat they had it up on their

259
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:41,110
wall for months after ward.

260
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,640
That's a conditional design work book.

261
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,640
I love it.

262
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:52,059
They have about a dozen exercises in this
book, you can download it at conditional design.org

263
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:53,400
your can buy it.

264
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,330
If you ever see them, buy them a beer and
send me the bill.

265
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:01,730
This is great work and they deserve to be
reworded.

266
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,050
So those are some things to get started.

267
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,290
It's not the limit of things to get started.

268
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:10,370
We have all this great stuff like projection
mapping, which we see here, the demo scene

269
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:14,620
that Matthew talked about earlier, there's
Arduino, connect.

270
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,670
There's tons of things to do.

271
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:23,750
These are three little snacks for you to start
with, start with anything.

272
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:33,670
And the reason why we solve problems, the
technology is going to change but the problem

273
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:40,450
solving skills are not, if you take time to
abstract your problem solving skills, using

274
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:45,730
something like this, get to understand the
process of how you solve problems, I think

275
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:50,260
that's a skill you're going to be able to
use for a wrong time in your career, long

276
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:56,940
after like Angular, JavaScript becomes something
if new in five years.

277
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:08,320
JavaScript okay is not going anywhere, that's
not Blasmmy\h‑‑ go home, this is my Twitter

278
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:15,350
handle, my web site, my e‑mail, I want to
help, show me what you make, and let's get

279
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,350
started.
