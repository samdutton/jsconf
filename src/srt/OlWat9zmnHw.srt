00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,080

today I'm talking about making it pop um

2
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,250
so this is going to be a different uh

3
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,300
let's see if I can get this to pause

4
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,570
here there we go this is going to be a

5
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,280
different talk than your typical

6
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,250
technical talk at GS comp and that's not

7
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,720
pausing so it's going to be pain in the

8
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:02,020
butt oh there we go there we go we'll

9
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,640
just go like this like this I did have a

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,440
pause oh there we go it's not playing

11
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,760
yeah there we go all right good start so

12
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,890
um this is going to be a little bit

13
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,220
different of a talk it's about visual

14
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,930
design and how many of you are just

15
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,270
building JavaScript apps all the time

16
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,979
how many of you have like side projects

17
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:32,860
you're working on anybody cool so I mean

18
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,979
there I'm in the right crowd um so this

19
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:38,080
design is about making the apps you

20
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,360
build in JavaScript with your amazing

21
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,460
code just as beautiful as your

22
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,229
JavaScript code so I'm Kyle Lambert I'm

23
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,360
heading up design at ol arc I work for o

24
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,070
lard were an awesome company it's a lot

25
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,400
of fun to work there designer developer

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,170
but mostly focused on design there and

27
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,810
one of my things at work that I'm trying

28
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,140
to do is scale our design team we have a

29
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,360
bunch of really talented front-end

30
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,950
developers and they are perfectly

31
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,110
capable of making design decisions we

32
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,899
like to code and ship really fast so

33
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:13,239
trying to get stopped by the bottleneck

34
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:14,880
of a designer sometimes

35
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,410
sometimes it's tough just needs to get

36
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,380
shipped and done and so my goal Oh lark

37
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,350
is to equip our engineers to make really

38
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,150
good design decisions just like their

39
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,850
goals is to make me a better engineer so

40
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,180
this talk is kind of about that and

41
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,560
things you guys can keep in mind while

42
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,800
doing that so why talk about visual

43
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,630
design that Jas comp well I wasn't

44
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,880
planning on talking at jas comp but our

45
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,670
engineers kind of pushed me into it we

46
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,010
do weekly tech talks at o lark and I

47
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,290
gave atop this talk and apparently they

48
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,820
thought it'd be good for the jas crowd

49
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,550
so they convinced me to do it so we're

50
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,260
just going to go for it but i think the

51
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,120
benefit of having your design team and

52
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,340
development team in communication with

53
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,470
each other and able to communicate with

54
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,660
each other it's so important it really

55
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,060
helps with collaboration it helps make

56
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,760
the process so much faster and it makes

57
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,330
everybody just a better all overall

58
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:12,150
maker we all have the desire to build

59
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,310
stuff from the ground up by ourselves

60
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,400
like if I can't I can design things but

61
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,870
if I don't learn how to code I'll never

62
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,610
be able to make my own application

63
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,830
myself and design it myself same thing

64
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,230
with engineers you're never going to be

65
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,270
able to you could build an awesome app

66
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,670
that looks great on the back end but if

67
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,010
it makes no sense on the front end it

68
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,610
might not make sense for your users so i

69
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,260
thought jay is comp played this funny

70
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,360
little trick on me I took the screenshot

71
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,770
last week as they added me to the

72
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,510
schedule and notice I'm the only one

73
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,720
with a broken I'm the only talk here

74
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,750
that's actually breaking the design of

75
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:52,170
the schedule so well played jazz comp I

76
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,490
don't know if that was intentional but

77
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,650
I'm going to I'm gonna if it wasn't just

78
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,760
claim it as it was because it's awesome

79
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,890
so why design matters so we're doing a

80
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,170
lot of things when we design things

81
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,570
we're helping communicate to our users

82
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,270
we're helping build trust we're

83
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,580
preparing people for decisions we're

84
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,500
trying to help curate their process and

85
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,470
experience and so we're trying to

86
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,140
accomplish a lot with that um so good

87
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,660
design is always intentional so

88
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,210
sometimes you see things like this this

89
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,100
picture of a bathroom I always loved

90
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,229
going into public places and finding

91
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:28,650
things

92
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,720
we're design wasn't intentional somebody

93
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,090
threw up some doors without even

94
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,830
thinking about it and it's just like

95
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,990
this poor person is you know using the

96
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,610
bathroom and just opened up to the world

97
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,560
and just in this miserable experience

98
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,810
and now that can happen all the time

99
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,300
when you just throw to throw stuff

100
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,949
together visually on the front end and

101
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:49,050
expect the user to to do what you want

102
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,880
without thinking about it and it's tough

103
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,850
I tell our designers and myself to think

104
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,139
about all the time so it's really

105
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:58,320
important to keep that in mind ah design

106
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,650
helps make decisions so this is another

107
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,010
picture keeping in the bathroom theme of

108
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,389
just an awkward experience so there's a

109
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,740
men's room and there's a woman's room

110
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,270
but the men's room is kind of pointing

111
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,070
to the women's room so you're kind of

112
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,050
like well am I going to expect urinals

113
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,090
in this room or am I going to a bunch of

114
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,440
stalls and you're just going to find

115
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,570
yourself in an awkward experience so we

116
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,720
want to make everything the user does we

117
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,370
want them to know exactly what they're

118
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,360
getting into before they get into it

119
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,229
design helps communicate so I don't know

120
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,610
this this sign isn't doing a great job

121
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,460
of communicating so please no smoking

122
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,010
alcohol on the beach I have not seen

123
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,889
anybody smoking alcohol at jas comp if

124
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:43,949
you are that's crazy but cool so let's

125
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:45,810
just think about what we're trying to

126
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,770
communicate when we're doing stuff um so

127
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,479
let's go over the basics I'm going to

128
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,639
give you a couple tips just to keep in

129
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,830
mind while you're designing stuff while

130
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,710
you're building web applications on the

131
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,470
front end side of the user facing side

132
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,990
these will be tips that you can write

133
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,470
down and just think about these are good

134
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,340
conversational elements to have with

135
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,289
your designers please push back on your

136
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:11,970
designers they'll probably hate me for

137
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,580
telling you about this but um they want

138
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,130
to be pushed just like you want to push

139
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,800
them up in your code reviews and all

140
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,680
that stuff so the basics number one

141
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,409
hierarchy this is a really important

142
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:28,320
thing when a user comes to your page and

143
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,270
they don't know what to click what are

144
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,270
you supposed to do so the thing I tell

145
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,800
people is you want to pick out out

146
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,750
number one on number two and a number

147
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,880
three so what's the most important thing

148
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,009
on the page it should be the most

149
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:42,300
obvious thing that's your number one

150
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,360
number two it should be obvious that

151
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,219
it's a number two so we'll go through an

152
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:49,289
example a good way to tell this is a

153
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:51,360
squint test I'm kind of doing it for you

154
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,520
blurring it so you can see the top

155
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,460
example it has just this basic block of

156
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,759
text when you squint your eyes and you

157
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,229
look over at the right it's kind of just

158
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:02,849
blurring together at the user doesn't

159
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:04,139
really know what's more important

160
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,659
information so they don't know how to

161
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,399
make a decision based on that if you go

162
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,389
to the bottom we've bolded the text for

163
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:14,309
the headline eat more vegetables and

164
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,529
we've put a button we've made the call

165
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:18,330
to action sign up button a bit more

166
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,860
important so that's the second most

167
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,479
important thing on the element and then

168
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,479
there's display text to help reinforce

169
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,279
that but that's a good thing to keep in

170
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,020
mind when you're doing things just make

171
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,169
things hierarchy make the most important

172
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:33,990
things obvious and then go from there um

173
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,499
balance is another thing sometimes you

174
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,089
go to a web page and it can be all

175
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:40,770
everything's on the left-hand side and

176
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,139
there's some input like important

177
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,620
information out hanging out but it looks

178
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,089
like it's going to fall over so this

179
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:50,430
example is we have a line straight down

180
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,740
the middle of this page this line is

181
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,430
dividing the white block in half but on

182
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,979
the the left-hand example the big blue

183
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,930
block is like taking up so much space

184
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,240
and it's dominating it so it's making

185
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,439
everything feel like it's going to shift

186
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:07,860
over to the left now to offset that on

187
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,949
the right hand example um a trick you

188
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,529
can do is kind of move the little guys

189
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:16,649
away so it's creating the illusion of

190
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:20,569
tier I that everything is more centered

191
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:23,370
contrasts now contrast is another

192
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,259
important thing this goes with hierarchy

193
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,349
and all I mean it's it's definitely a

194
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:30,419
friend of hierarchy it's going to help

195
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,229
you make things more hierarchical the

196
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:35,940
hierarchical and it's going to help

197
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,769
users to understand what you're trying

198
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:40,380
to get them to do a great example of

199
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,339
this is of the Spotify screenshot so the

200
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,290
most high contrast thing you see on the

201
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,760
page the first thing you see is that

202
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,100
green button gets Spotify in the top

203
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,660
right-hand corner that's an obvious

204
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,150
statement everything else on the page is

205
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,220
thing to it but really Spotify wants you

206
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,620
to get the app so just click that that's

207
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,880
pretty much what they're telling you to

208
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,870
do so the most obvious user action on

209
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,180
the page you want them to be high

210
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,980
contrast you don't want it to blend in

211
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,300
you don't want it to fade to the

212
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,010
background because that's the action you

213
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,340
want the user to take light space okay

214
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,560
you always everybody needs space

215
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,330
everybody needs room to breathe this is

216
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,580
an important thing in design you want to

217
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,030
make sure your your blocks and elements

218
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,220
are separated on the page and they're

219
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,950
not all mingling together so on the

220
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,080
first example here to the left we have a

221
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,080
block of text with a picture and it all

222
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,770
kind of runs together there's there's no

223
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,150
distinction between the elements it's a

224
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,560
muddy mess you don't really know what's

225
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,020
happening if you move over to the right

226
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,540
we've opened it up a bit too much so

227
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,700
everything is competing so the eat

228
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,060
vegetables the all those lines are

229
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,790
broken up in such a way that they're all

230
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,530
individual elements they're not a block

231
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,350
they're not whole so all the way to the

232
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,730
right it feels a little better we've

233
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,470
separated the headline we have the

234
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,210
blocks of text that feel like a whole

235
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,980
but they're not scrunched together and

236
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,950
there's room for the user to really

237
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,810
digest the information the important

238
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,540
thing here is just digestibility if you

239
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,760
go to a web page and a web app and you

240
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,290
have no clue how to read it and it's

241
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,390
just overbearing your users are just

242
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,070
going to click away as soon as possible

243
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,630
unless they're really really interested

244
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,680
alignment this is another thing that's

245
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,220
going to help users eyes so in this

246
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,730
example you've all seen like the columns

247
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,080
profile pictures on the left hand side

248
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,020
text you know like your basic twitter

249
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,170
app the reason designers are sometimes

250
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,620
super picky about I want this to be

251
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,590
moved over one pixel or they should be

252
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,760
um if they're picky just because if they

253
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,140
don't have a reason to sell you on this

254
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,940
then don't listen to them but the reason

255
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,490
you want to keep stuff really aligned is

256
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,400
because you want the users I to be to

257
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,320
scroll down to the page so this creates

258
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,870
a visual line for the user to scroll

259
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,490
there I down to the page if you break

260
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,740
that then the user is not going to

261
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,390
follow you down the page and you're not

262
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,510
going to be able to guide them as much

263
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:16,050
consistency this is a huge one um like

264
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,880
one of my points before design should be

265
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,340
intentional things should be consistent

266
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,380
in this presentation you've seen i'm

267
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,810
using and and there's a gray area for

268
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,070
that but it's like you should have a

269
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,290
basic idea of how you want things to

270
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,240
flow i have i've used a couple different

271
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,430
colors i have a couple different fonts

272
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,260
but everything I'm doing I'm trying to

273
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,470
keep consistent so if you add a new UI

274
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,920
element it should go along with the rest

275
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,020
of your brand so if you've if you have

276
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,970
added something to the front of your

277
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,400
site and you have say you're all your

278
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,260
buttons are styled and then you throw in

279
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,630
a new button and it's a default browser

280
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,190
button then the user is not going to

281
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,510
become it's they're going to be a little

282
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,310
confused they might not trust your app

283
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,800
quite as much so just being intentional

284
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,900
about the little things is going to

285
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,540
really set you apart and bring some

286
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,400
clarity and trust to everything you do

287
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,770
this is just an example you can go

288
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,990
online there's tons of UI libraries and

289
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,330
stuff that you can pull apart you know

290
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,950
you all know bootstrap and stuff

291
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,820
bootstraps great um but I want to help

292
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,130
you guys understand bootstrap a little

293
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,570
bit more so you can make bootstrap a

294
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,640
little boot less bootstrap II and more

295
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,450
custom to what you want so let's go

296
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,550
through some of these points and let's

297
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,610
go through and make a little widget okay

298
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,020
so we're going to go through everything

299
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,710
I've talked about so far and we're going

300
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,960
to talk about it so number one here's

301
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,810
our little silly little widget where are

302
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,400
you from help us customize your

303
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,930
experience and then a little drop-down

304
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,150
menu with a submit button so we're just

305
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,540
going to start off bit by bit point by

306
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,490
point and let's go through and tighten

307
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,400
this up a little bit more visually so

308
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,900
hierarchy we talked about hierarchy

309
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,610
first the first thing we're going to do

310
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,210
is okay let's increase the size of the

311
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,250
question the main question we're asking

312
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,780
the user that should be the first thing

313
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,950
like they need to know what they're

314
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,550
getting into that helper tests isn't the

315
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,500
help us customize your experience isn't

316
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,680
super important um it could be but we're

317
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,670
going to bring down the point size so

318
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,360
separating the

319
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,089
headline and the helper text is going to

320
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:28,260
help us create hierarchy number two is

321
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,620
balance okay so you can see and I'm

322
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,500
going left is the previous widget and

323
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,140
right is what we're updating so it's a

324
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,850
little unbalanced everything shifted

325
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,100
over to the right or to the left hand

326
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,290
side on the left hand widget and it's it

327
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,500
just seems a little sloppy unintentional

328
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,790
so this will bring in tension year

329
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,230
design so you want everything to feel

330
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,120
balanced let's Center everything put it

331
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,329
in the middle and make sense contrast

332
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:56,690
okay well let's make it a little bit

333
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,550
let's increase the hierarchy let's make

334
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,079
things a little bit more apparent what

335
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,870
we want the user to do so we we made the

336
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,089
submit button green added more contrast

337
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:08,760
to it obvious that we want them to click

338
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,010
and we took down the contrast of the

339
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,839
help us customize this experience

340
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,850
because it's still not that important so

341
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,560
we're we're going to tone it back even

342
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,160
more so contrast will help us build even

343
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,850
more hierarchy white space okay so this

344
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,860
text is feeling a little this widgets

345
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,149
feeling a little crammed and we have

346
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:29,610
plenty room of room on this page to add

347
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,890
some white space so we opened up the

348
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,250
padding on the sides we gave the submit

349
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,320
button a little bit more padding so it's

350
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,050
even more of a call to action and it

351
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,690
makes sense but when we did that we are

352
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,350
we did we forgot to align our the

353
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,660
drop-down menu with the submit button so

354
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,430
that's something that on the left hand

355
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,130
side it looks kind of like a mistake but

356
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,480
if you put it in a little bit more

357
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,370
effort you have those things align

358
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,290
that's the polish that it's going to

359
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,570
make your users just appreciate little

360
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,519
things and add a little bit of trust to

361
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,089
what you're doing um consistency now

362
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:07,829
this would be this one might be a little

363
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:10,380
bit hard for for some people to pick up

364
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,940
but it's just something to train your

365
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,860
eye to look for the inconsistent thing

366
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,070
here is the fonts and this is where I

367
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,779
might lose you a little bit but I hope I

368
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,399
keep you is it the fonts in the

369
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,019
drop-down menu and the fonts and the

370
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:25,170
submit button are different than the

371
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,899
other fonts on the left hand side so

372
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,810
it's it's a small nuance but if you can

373
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,490
start picking up on those things and

374
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,320
like I just have a

375
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,330
fault font on the left hand side but I

376
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,520
realized oh man i'm using Helvetica so I

377
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,260
let's just update everything to hell

378
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,360
vatika because it's more intentional

379
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,920
it's an intentional decision um so we

380
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,170
have a before and after shot now this is

381
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,320
like this is pretty big difference in my

382
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,370
eyes as a user or as a designer um these

383
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,130
are small updates that we made there

384
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,930
nothing huge there's nothing

385
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,510
groundbreaking about them all I'm doing

386
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,090
is I'm thinking about what I'm doing so

387
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,730
I just encourage you guys to keep these

388
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,140
points in mind while you're designing

389
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,820
apps while you're building your side

390
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,070
projects so you can make them more

391
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,170
successful and so you can push back on

392
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,120
your designers when they hand you stuff

393
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,520
and get involved even in the design

394
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:25,110
conversation as well so that's it um if

395
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,300
