00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,170

this is candice in New Jas my name is

2
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,039
John Schultz I'm not going to be able to

3
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:34,529
show you this like this Wow

4
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:37,910
it's going to go okay so I'm currently

5
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,710
working at include which is a web

6
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,360
consulting company in DC before that was

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,430
that honesty I also upped its own

8
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,949
company and we did work at Sur conus

9
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:47,480
which is a really nice monitoring

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,920
service where i did a lot of the work

11
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,320
with the charts and am on twitter at jf

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,100
s III so why would you want to use

13
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,290
canvas on node and the idea is to

14
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,649
replace script you know source path to

15
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:01,969
your live and then creating it with the

16
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:04,970
script or an iframe width image source

17
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,970
equals and just get your canvas image

18
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:14,080
back everything is croakin okay

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,600
so we made some canvas bass charts for

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,400
somebody and they really liked them they

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,540
wanted to get they liked them so much

22
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,370
they wanted those charts to be in their

23
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,650
wiki the problem is that canvas bass

24
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,440
charts need a browser or document

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,000
iframes a good way to do that but wiki's

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,360
don't allow high frames so I really

27
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,320
wanted to forget a way to do this

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,760
because it seemed like you know it's a

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,490
really valid use case it was just not

30
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,560
possible so I did a little research and

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,080
there is something called rhino canvas

32
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,640
which is kind of what it sounds like the

33
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,830
main problem with that is 2006 as the

34
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,110
last time any work was done on it and I

35
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,970
just wanted to stay a node and work on

36
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,550
v8 so I asked Twitter for help and I got

37
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,660
a bunch of what are you talking about

38
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,880
back people it's I understand it's a

39
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,020
visual thing and I'm talking about do it

40
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,440
on the server what if you think about it

41
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,280
there's really nothing inherently

42
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,890
browser specific about canvas or about

43
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,320
this geometry that we're dealing with it

44
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,119
just keeping track of go to this

45
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:12,550
position then make a move and then once

46
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,780
you've I don't know make a circle and

47
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,820
fill it that's all just math I don't

48
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,050
need to worry about where the mouse is

49
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,120
or what the window view port is so it

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,910
definitely seemed possible one of my

51
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,170
former co-workers mentioned that I could

52
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,470
look at Cairo which does PDF generation

53
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,900
SVG a bunch of other stuff I'm only

54
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,060
problem with that is it's in C and I

55
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,010
would have to go through and mimic or

56
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,239
make a mirror of the shell of the canvas

57
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:40,630
API and see which is problem for me but

58
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,209
then TJ hollow wall Chuck and learn

59
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:46,209
boost released note canvas and what note

60
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:50,230
canvas is is it gives you so it is

61
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,220
canvas in know Jas and it gives you a

62
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:01,840
standard canvas element so in a TI so

63
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,480
you get moved to begin path stroke all

64
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,340
the things you expect and that gives you

65
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,620
some non-standard methods like create

66
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,500
PNG stream to buffer which is actually

67
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,930
used to create binary information to get

68
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,849
an image back and to data URL

69
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:21,810
so here's an example from that page and

70
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,250
if you notice i put a comment in there

71
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,930
but the first two lines are the only

72
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,370
thing that's any different from a

73
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,430
regular canvas program we do a require

74
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,590
to get the package and then instead of

75
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,389
saying canvas equals document create

76
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:37,359
element canvas canvas not hide equal

77
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:38,560
something canvas top width equals

78
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,870
something you just create it with new

79
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,299
canvas pass it the height and width so

80
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:51,220
then if you were to paste that in you

81
00:03:51,220 --> 00:04:00,329
know or run that is that will give me a

82
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:03,400
data URI kick back an image that's got

83
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:18,500
this data string in it

84
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,650
and that's it so that's text so that got

85
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,380
me pretty far so that means that i can

86
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,930
now run canvas on the server my problem

87
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,480
with that was that i already had a

88
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,070
client-side library that i was using it

89
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,310
was flat and flat uses jQuery and jQuery

90
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,710
uses the DOM and there is no Dom on the

91
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,780
server so technically I could do it I

92
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,100
had the tools but I didn't get a lot of

93
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,170
the benefits that I was looking for and

94
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,400
I didn't want to recreate flot on the

95
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,930
server side I just wanted to move it

96
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,160
over and have these charts that looked

97
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,320
all the same the same there like I said

98
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,730
the customer liked him I wanted to keep

99
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,440
him that way so i had to find a way to

100
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,140
get jquery to work on node and that is

101
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,210
done by the incredible jazz dom they

102
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,580
find a way to do a common jas

103
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,870
implementation of the dom in node they

104
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,580
give you donna level one and dom level

105
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,440
two just came in February I think the

106
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,900
latest version 02 and you get get like

107
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,790
last name get on with my ID a lot of the

108
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,790
bomb stuff you need so I now had a fake

109
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,080
DOM and that means i can now run jquery

110
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,240
so here's an example actually from the

111
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,020
jsm site the new version at movement

112
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,340
this thing called n where you pick this

113
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,560
case they're going to scrape a page so

114
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,620
you would say end destination URL that

115
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,200
array is a list of scripts you want to

116
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,210
include so I made a point to notice that

117
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,800
that's a production jquery file that's

118
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,810
not patched or hacked in any way then

119
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,400
you get a call back when you've got that

120
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,130
window and then this case it runs when

121
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,750
did that dollar so it's taking jquery

122
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,800
and running it against that URL now that

123
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,820
screens great thing it's not quite what

124
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,080
i was looking to do but you get the idea

125
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,470
I mean he's immediately able to use

126
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,740
jQuery on some remote code so I did a

127
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,750
little bit of patching and flop it's

128
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,300
really minimal because can denote canvas

129
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,540
gives you an API compatible but is API

130
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,430
compatible with canvas I really just had

131
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,680
to go into node and find or flot and

132
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,110
find where they did the creation so they

133
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,970
used to create element I now just do a

134
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,490
test and say if you've got this new

135
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,110
incredible constructor use that

136
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,660
otherwise use the regular one

137
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,220
that's really it I changed some

138
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,170
detection at the bottom where their

139
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,240
detection used to be if get contacts is

140
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,370
available or if it's not available then

141
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,190
do X canvas well because node canvas

142
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,080
again is API compatible that is now

143
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,490
going to be there so I just changed that

144
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:50,700
too if you have the bx canvas hack if

145
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,090
you have the X campus hack use it all

146
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,410
right yeah I do have the full patch

147
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,850
available as a guest if anybody's

148
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,900
looking to patch flop so putting it all

149
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,680
together here is an example that uses in

150
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,500
Jas node and this is using the new

151
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,020
version of jas Dom so you do require

152
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,650
give it an end where I pass in again

153
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,410
production jQuery code the two scripts

154
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,640
that are there one of them that flot

155
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,500
that svn is my patch version of flop

156
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,670
flop text is just a plug-in for flock by

157
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,580
default flot renders labels in absolute

158
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,200
position gives so not part of the canvas

159
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,210
so when I go to export it you'd have

160
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,430
lines and areas but you wouldn't have

161
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,230
values associated with them so you need

162
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,730
to have a plug-in for flot to do that

163
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,430
and that's just what this is done is to

164
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,740
call back this is just data generation

165
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,570
I'd have to do this for any example same

166
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,240
in the client side the things that are

167
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,240
of note at all width and height that is

168
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,770
something that's different about this

169
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,100
version flot by default takes an element

170
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,250
and then it determines its dimensions

171
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,650
which I don't have those dimensions when

172
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,820
I'm running on the server even if i did

173
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,650
in line styles i couldn't get jquery to

174
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,960
detect a height and width so i had to

175
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,669
say here's a specific height and width

176
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:07,290
now people have been asking for that in

177
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,510
flot for the the reason that you might

178
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,190
have a div that's off-screen and you

179
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,780
want to pre-render it and just show it

180
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,860
so if it's off-screen it would get a

181
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,710
zero and not show up anyway so

182
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,780
technically I needed to add it for this

183
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,370
project but it's something that isn't

184
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,940
going to be in the next version of flock

185
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,410
x-axis and y-axis and normal arguments

186
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,150
canvas text is something we use for the

187
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,550
plug-in and then clickable false and

188
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,940
hover bull falls are again flot

189
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,560
arguments I just set them to false

190
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,210
because it's a static image there's no

191
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,669
need to apply that then the rest of this

192
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:40,740
is me just doing some aliasing I didn't

193
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,539
want to say window dollar window jquery

194
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,050
so i just set those up

195
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,330
and then did equals div on this

196
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,070
signature right here is exactly what you

197
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,339
would see out of the plot docs plot div

198
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:53,459
or placeholder data in an options array

199
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:56,670
then I get a canvas back again this is a

200
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,310
get canvas is a flot method normally it

201
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,920
would give you a dom instance back in

202
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,570
this case I'm getting the node canvas

203
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,430
instance back so I can do something with

204
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,529
it I set up where I want to save this

205
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:11,829
image and then so I create a right

206
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:14,470
stream create a stream on data right to

207
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,209
that so I think I've got that open well

208
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:26,050
if I nude jst MJS wow that's right now

209
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:30,120
so log some stuff out in there ji sent a

210
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,339
flaunt just on pain sweet update if you

211
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:39,399
were to that may show you I mean that

212
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:45,820
really is just an image but that is if

213
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,320
anybody's work with fly mean that's lot

214
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:55,519
that is a styled flot image or canvas

215
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,740
alright so I actually was real stoked to

216
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,829
score j SN o de so my initials rjs and

217
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:03,839
this is where i play with node and after

218
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,980
all the JavaScript Jess note / flat will

219
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,499
always give back a random but very

220
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:14,999
narrow set of items but you should

221
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:16,639
always be able to do image source equals

222
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,529
jas note / flat and you'll get the

223
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:21,689
canvas image just a way for me to test

224
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:23,519
it and put multiples up and make a you

225
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,470
know a list or whatever I also did a

226
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,959
little bit of work so that it'll accept

227
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,480
parameters via the query string so you

228
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,819
can get it a JSON object or just the

229
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:41,590
data or options example that being that

230
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,790
and

231
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,830
alright Bob misspelled so and that is

232
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,019
updated right there and again I mean

233
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:56,310
that is just an image so we're able to

234
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:59,610
use flat on the server side and get a

235
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,140
nicely styled canvas chart back one

236
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,279
point I should one thing I do want to

237
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,720
point out in the previous example here

238
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,680
whatever guest I had while i was showing

239
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,399
Jas Tom and I was creating a dom every

240
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,130
time what I actually do on Jas node is

241
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,000
at start I preload flat so it's real

242
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,519
basic stuff I just do a basic you know

243
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,589
script injection but I pull those in so

244
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:27,060
it does at one time that I just share

245
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,560
that document instance I don't feel like

246
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,850
I shouldn't be creating a new j/s Dom

247
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,680
window or document every time I serve an

248
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,120
image let's want to point that out all

249
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,050
right wrapping up some advantages I see

250
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,329
I think the biggest thing is image works

251
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,070
everywhere whether it's me we're talking

252
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,160
on mobile said iframes aren't available

253
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,079
you know on a wiki an image it's been

254
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,910
around for a long long time it's got

255
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,440
incredible support it's about as who's

256
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,899
going to get code reuse you take the

257
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:59,940
library you've already have on the user

258
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,800
level client-side can move to the server

259
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,839
side you will have to do some patching

260
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,020
but again the work the tj's done that

261
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,050
canvas API is there it's exactly the

262
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,940
same so all you have to do most likely

263
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,760
is change the way that that instance is

264
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,410
created and then hand it off and it

265
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,589
should be good from their performance

266
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:22,380
images much less burdensome on on any

267
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,329
device or again older browser mobile I'm

268
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:26,399
not giving it information having it

269
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,320
create it render it spit it out it's

270
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,060
just an image so you might not have that

271
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,720
horsepower on an older browser or mobile

272
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,520
privacy was another one we had a case

273
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,779
about that monitoring service where

274
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,970
person wanted to show a graph and they

275
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,010
wanted to show relative changes but they

276
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,300
didn't want to show the absolute numbers

277
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,360
whether it was membership CPU burden

278
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,630
whatever so if you do have regular the

279
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,610
regular way you deal with it you give

280
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,890
JSON back and while I could do a graph

281
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,600
that didn't have labels on it that data

282
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,220
still got transferred across the water

283
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,690
you look at the net request you'll see

284
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,160
it and maybe it's off you skated or

285
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,040
something but

286
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,509
it's still coming across the wire with

287
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:04,300
this you control what you want to return

288
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,279
and just kick that image back and it's

289
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:08,199
completely opaque so there's no way that

290
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:10,120
anybody would be able to know what those

291
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,089
values actually were also by having that

292
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:15,850
URL you now get a nice normal HTTP asset

293
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,050
and you can cash it as you see fit so

294
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,130
you have some like sales figures are

295
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,529
something that are static or i would say

296
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:24,370
aren't going to change you could do

297
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,380
something like if I'm given a start and

298
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,779
an end and they're both in the past set

299
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:30,399
a far futures expires header on it they

300
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,350
cash it for a year 10 years whatever

301
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,410
your site does so that way the client

302
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,019
doesn't have to do another request they

303
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:39,550
don't have to redraw they just pull from

304
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,440
cash and you on the server aren't

305
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,589
redrawing that or reserving it text I

306
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:46,930
was going to say that canvas text isn't

307
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,880
the canvas text methods aren't supported

308
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,279
in all browsers but it's a kind of an

309
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,540
arrow key thing I think one of the

310
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,180
bigger ones is that you get the benefit

311
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,560
of having a single platform that you're

312
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,329
supporting here and you can use a font

313
00:13:58,329 --> 00:13:59,949
if it's available on your server you

314
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:01,120
know what's available because you're

315
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
controlling that environment

316
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,260
disadvantages I think probably the

317
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,760
biggest one is you're bringing load from

318
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,230
the client back to the server now I

319
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,459
talked about ways you can hedge that

320
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:11,860
with caching and and so on and there's

321
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,360
other reasons my you why you might want

322
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,310
to what you are pulling from the spokes

323
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,339
back into the hub image means there's no

324
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:19,690
interaction that's probably that's the

325
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,389
other key one you can't do onmouseover

326
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:24,190
can't do tooltips that's what if it is a

327
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,230
static image but in the cases where

328
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,250
that's where you're you know there's a

329
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,600
lot of times where that's perfectly

330
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,970
suitable and it's another piece of

331
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:31,959
technology and your infrastructure

332
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:34,269
although you likely have something

333
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:36,279
that's serving images anyway and you can

334
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,480
it's not as though you need to have your

335
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,089
entire stack or anything running a node

336
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:42,399
you just go to a certain port or certain

337
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,589
URL which you mod rewrite or otherwise

338
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:46,569
direct to your node instance which kicks

339
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:48,430
that image back but it is something

340
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,480
you'd have to add in if you're not

341
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,290
already running node president don't

342
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,380
think i've got anything else that's it
