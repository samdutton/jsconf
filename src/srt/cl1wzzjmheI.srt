00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,710

hello okay microphone works okay I have

2
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,120
a lot of slides we don't have much time

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,640
i'm also very very tired because i came

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,920
just yesterday and i slept like four

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,750
hours and some hours on the plane and

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,060
you know plane flights it's never good

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,189
sleeping you just drool on yourself and

8
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,189
you just type that there in the water

9
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:31,080
talking about the water i want to talk

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,170
about today a bit about how we are we go

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,700
a bit overboard with the javascript that

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,500
we're doing right now because javascript

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,480
has been such a massive success the last

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,059
few months that we all get very excited

15
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,950
about it and I find it kind of

16
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,649
frustrating how people feel out of sync

17
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,559
or feel not appropriate anymore and how

18
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,449
the JavaScript community becomes a bit

19
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,789
arrogant and aggressive and I think it's

20
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,620
not necessary that we do that to

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,320
ourselves or to other people as we've

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,000
been asked to introduce ourselves a bit

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,890
to the camera and the recordings I'm

24
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,449
going to talk a bit about myself but

25
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,250
it's not gonna be the normal like hi I'm

26
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,619
here and I'm sorry it does it mean but I

27
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,270
want to give you a bit of a frame of

28
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,330
mind why I came to be Who I am here and

29
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,890
why I think that we're going a bit

30
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,220
overboard so I'm Chris Hyman I'm at code

31
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,990
poet on Twitter so if you don't have

32
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,640
enough hedgehogs fluffy animals and

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,650
JavaScript information in your world you

34
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,200
can always follow me there I think fifty

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,119
one thousand people do that right now so

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,860
don't be surprised if there's a lot of

37
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,600
answering and stuff going on and I don't

38
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,579
know why people do it but it seems some

39
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,130
of the things I do are interesting I

40
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,630
live in London England and this is what

41
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,290
my street looked like last week

42
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,150
basically grim and terrible that's why

43
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,979
we do so many things with computers most

44
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,450
of time it rained since when people

45
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,860
start drinking and fighting that's why

46
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,750
you stay inside and write JavaScript

47
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,540
instead it was also seven degrees and

48
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,939
now it's like 24 here or something and

49
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,770
I'm just going in between I'm going to

50
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,719
Thailand after this and Sydney because

51
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,159
they're going to try out what happens

52
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,520
when you put redheads in the Sun and

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,899
then I hope back to England and go to

54
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,549
Finland after this so if I not get a

55
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:06,990
cold it's going to be a very big

56
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,709
surprise I've been a developer right to

57
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,900
present a trainer and manager and all of

58
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,860
this is

59
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,740
cause I know JavaScript and I think it's

60
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,600
very important that all of us here stop

61
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,160
thinking about that sooner or later

62
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,230
you're gonna be as old as me your hair

63
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,780
is gonna fall out you're gonna not have

64
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,340
fun in life any longer and you're going

65
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,900
to think about your long-term plan of

66
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,480
what you're doing so thinking about I'm

67
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,460
the best engineer on this planet and I'm

68
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,050
going to do that for the next 50 years

69
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,050
is not a good plan but as we build a

70
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,090
community around our technologies and as

71
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,670
we build as we work in a medium which is

72
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,800
the internet and we don't work just in a

73
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,709
software platform we have a chance to be

74
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:49,680
all these kind of people so in 2004 I

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,360
wrote this unobtrusive JavaScript

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,820
tutorial how to write JavaScript that is

77
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,640
not in the way of your end users in 2006

78
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,370
i wrote my first book i've i think it

79
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,739
published or written in eight books so

80
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:03,480
far or something like that and thousands

81
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,910
of articles basically because when i

82
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,270
write things down i remember them my my

83
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,160
blog started as a scratch pad for my

84
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,050
ideas because i wanted to remember them

85
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,700
which is very very annoying if forget

86
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,530
something and i go to google and i find

87
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,200
my own blog is the first result because

88
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,000
i just realized i get forgetful but this

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,390
is what we all do so i worked in several

90
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,090
companies and large corporations and i

91
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,620
work with javascript in all these

92
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,380
corporations and did things to scale and

93
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,440
did things to two different audiences to

94
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,090
different markets and i found out that

95
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,310
way that javascript is a very very cool

96
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,590
and versatile thing I worked for Yahoo

97
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,360
and I worked on the way I library i

98
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,160
worked on your home apps i worked on

99
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,290
yahoo answers and there you hear things

100
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,060
like oh we got three thousand people a

101
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,830
second what do we do about this in terms

102
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,870
of architecture be like okay let's try

103
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,019
that out then I worked for firefox and i

104
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,239
worked on firefox OS which was very very

105
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,580
low level devices that were running an

106
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,340
operating system written in HTML 5 for a

107
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,290
market that is not in the Silicon Valley

108
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,630
and it is not rich kids and now i'm

109
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,489
working for microsoft and work on a new

110
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:09,840
edge browser because I basically

111
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,910
realized that internet explorer is the

112
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,790
reason for all of our unhappiness and I

113
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,680
should be in the company that built that

114
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,299
thing and replace it with something good

115
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,419
and that's what we did right now always

116
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:23,490
go for the source don't go for fighting

117
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,440
symptoms find out if you if you're sick

118
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,450
find out what made it happen not take

119
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,170
painkillers

120
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,270
and hope it's going away so that's what

121
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,830
I did with Microsoft I'm very happy

122
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,620
about that and I use JavaScript in many

123
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,660
many different environments altering

124
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,580
websites and enhancing them with GS of

125
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,780
course the first thing that's why

126
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,550
javascript came around and that's why

127
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,130
javascript was used and I think it's

128
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,020
very important to realize that enhancing

129
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,880
them with jas is a big big thing here

130
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,980
because websites are more than a

131
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,410
JavaScript construct websites or HTML

132
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,670
CSS images writing accessibility UX

133
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,070
these are things that are publications

134
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,290
on the web and the web is an undefined

135
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,330
environment I cannot control anything

136
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,190
that our end users are doing so if it

137
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,470
runs fast on my machine well done if you

138
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,690
your only user that's great but think

139
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,130
about the people who are out there as

140
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,220
well we also had scripting and extending

141
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,570
applications that started with

142
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,280
illustrator I wrote JavaScript an

143
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,350
illustrator that was possible in 99 and

144
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,630
then home side was my big editor back

145
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,130
then it was written in jscript which

146
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,600
raised the terrible thing that should

147
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,510
never happen but did then Visual Studio

148
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,700
code for example now came out yesterday

149
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,160
as open source Adam is another travel

150
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,990
script editor that is written in

151
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,690
JavaScript with node and sublime text

152
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,490
has all kind of extensions that you can

153
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,040
write with it as well so we wrote in

154
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,080
environments like applications before

155
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,820
and for the web and these are two

156
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,110
different environments and two different

157
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,480
rules and two different best practices

158
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,330
apply to those and authoring reusable

159
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,590
widgets for people who don't know

160
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,470
JavaScript I mean later on this became

161
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,510
jQuery plugins but before that we had

162
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,760
like d HTML drop-down menus in these

163
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,590
wonderful things like when you got like

164
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,180
six on a pound for 40 lines of

165
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,440
JavaScript that when you look at them

166
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,350
now you want to kill yourself working on

167
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,480
libraries and frameworks on Yui on

168
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,420
jQuery on dojo on all these things that

169
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,400
came and went when I wrote for a Jackson

170
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,080
as a blogger at one time there were 400

171
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,810
12 different Dom libraries that all made

172
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,370
Ajax easy now we have was like 15,000 no

173
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,900
180,000 NPM modules that make everything

174
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,090
easy as well it might be a different

175
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,460
world that we're living in right now but

176
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,020
also we ride a lot of code that other

177
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,720
people will never use working on

178
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,760
browsers and JavaScript engines gave me

179
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,410
a lot of insight how javascript is

180
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,780
actually going into the computer how

181
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,639
it's turned into bytecode what the

182
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,680
browser does to us and what we do

183
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,659
terrible things to the JavaScript engine

184
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:47,310
and then blame the browser makers that

185
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,060
they write kara crab code and working on

186
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,800
server side JavaScript using no chest

187
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,479
this is a really really great thing that

188
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,099
we can now write a server with a few

189
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:58,439
lines of code and we can host the thing

190
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,240
in the language that we're done before I

191
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,849
moved most of my PHP work to note

192
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:04,889
because it's just easier for me to do

193
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:06,689
nowadays although it's damn easy to get

194
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:09,060
a PHP server not as easy to get a node

195
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,090
server going and designing a P is for JS

196
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,069
consumption as well when i worked on

197
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:17,250
yahoo yql or on pipes and I help people

198
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,759
like encoding calm as fortify and all

199
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,020
those people that want to talk to

200
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,879
JavaScript developers how do you define

201
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,789
an API for JavaScript developers all of

202
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:28,830
that taught me that javascript is a

203
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,659
versatile creative and easy-to-learn

204
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,419
pick and mix environment it is basically

205
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,180
it's it's a sweet shop it's a beautiful

206
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,129
thing because you can use that language

207
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:40,710
for almost anything and when you use it

208
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,139
you apply it in a certain way you don't

209
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,479
apply it in just one way to rule them

210
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,599
all but we keep treating JavaScript like

211
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,639
a one-size-fits-all environment that we

212
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,219
can control it works for me our our

213
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:54,930
users should have the newest browser as

214
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,969
well all of our users should actually

215
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:58,379
have a faster computer because it's

216
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:00,990
their fault that my code is slow and we

217
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,879
really like this kid we just scream and

218
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,770
shout at each other and we scream and

219
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,870
shout about everything that we use while

220
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,550
we are actually having incredibly good

221
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,169
hardware an incredibly good development

222
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:12,419
environments when I look at dev tools of

223
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,539
chrome dev tools of Firefox and soon dev

224
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,539
tools in edge I'm just amazed what we

225
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,490
can do nowadays what kind of insight we

226
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,529
get and still we're saying like Otis is

227
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:24,000
not as good as the other environments

228
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,620
although most of us never looked at the

229
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,750
other environments and just looked under

230
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,610
the hood just how horrible Android and

231
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,099
iOS is as well because it's software

232
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:33,839
it's written by humans it's written by

233
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,940
people like us who just clean other

234
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,320
things and then like look it's working

235
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm not going to look at a name all and

236
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,699
I think lately we go overboard with Jess

237
00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:43,800
we just try to do everything with Jess

238
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,160
and we get terribly excited if if it

239
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,899
works and we get terribly disappointed

240
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,029
if not everybody is with us on that on

241
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:54,029
that same boat we're going full speed on

242
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:55,230
innovation I'm not going to

243
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,140
go into the details but if you subscribe

244
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,960
to a co je s or you go to hack and use

245
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,240
every day there's some new thing every

246
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,830
three months one of the large

247
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,540
corporations will have some great new

248
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,950
thing that will be the future of the

249
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,750
internet and then half year later we

250
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,760
won't hear about it any longer and all

251
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,950
of these things are incredibly important

252
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,210
things they're incredibly intelligent

253
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,870
things very well architected things but

254
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,450
many of them are also like is it really

255
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,790
necessary that we all play on the

256
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,650
bleeding edge because the bleeding edge

257
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,080
is about this wide we would fall over if

258
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,390
all of us played there and it's bleeding

259
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,660
so it's hurtful so the code that is on

260
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,280
the bleeding edge should not hurt our

261
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,010
users but should move us forward so we

262
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,530
should find time and space to use it and

263
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,330
not just say this is the bleeding edge

264
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,140
and it's now they've now the reality

265
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,610
it's a vicious innovation cycle

266
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,950
developers don't use features until

267
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,320
browser support them and browsers don't

268
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,270
add new features unless there's demand

269
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,580
and use in the wild this is how every

270
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,550
browser maker prioritizes new features

271
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,760
do people really use these things oh no

272
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,650
they don't so we don't have to have them

273
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,080
and it's a very important thing because

274
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,300
browsers are also software developers

275
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,640
it's a finite number of people even the

276
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,620
open-source ones have a finite number of

277
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,930
people working on those things so that

278
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,090
cool new feature that you really want is

279
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,990
it necessary is somebody using it no we

280
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,820
all know that app cache is broken it's a

281
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,740
terrible thing Jake Archibald said it's

282
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,090
the end of the world and it killed

283
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,490
kittens and all kind of stuff and then

284
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,320
when you when you send out the ping

285
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,940
crawler ping is a search engine you

286
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,110
could go before that if you don't know

287
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,440
it and we look at the mag Adam to

288
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,540
standards inside Firefox we found out

289
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,480
that hardly anybody including

290
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,460
applications used in app cache people

291
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,680
just saw it's broken and never tried it

292
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,930
out so at the same time we just had this

293
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:49,920
like oh we're not going to touch it

294
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,780
because it's so terribly broken I tested

295
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,040
it myself no you didn't you're lying

296
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,230
because it otherwise it would be on the

297
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,100
web somewhere and developers just want

298
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,360
the new shiny things rather than

299
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,890
demanding the things that are broken

300
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,320
form elements are still terrible across

301
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,050
browsers you cannot start a select boxes

302
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,059
you cannot a datepicker Lou

303
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:10,829
doesn't work on all browsers the same

304
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:13,349
way and it that's fine they can work

305
00:11:13,349 --> 00:11:15,239
differently but it should work and not

306
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:16,739
just be something that is in the browser

307
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:18,509
because it's there we should demand more

308
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:20,879
that the basics of HTML 5 is working

309
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,559
before we're going for the next feature

310
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,559
out there and we force rules on to

311
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,929
ourselves that might be overkill I love

312
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:29,789
this blog post the other day that's the

313
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,559
checklist for a new open source

314
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,749
JavaScript project please follow these

315
00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:37,979
steps and you know if I were now

316
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:40,139
somebody coming from University I never

317
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,999
been to university or somebody coming

318
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:43,439
from school and saying like I want to

319
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:44,789
learn something about that computer is

320
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:46,349
thingy where all the jobs are and people

321
00:11:46,349 --> 00:11:48,809
get money and I get this instead of like

322
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,449
here's the SDK of iOS I probably would

323
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:53,699
go for iOS as well because that is too

324
00:11:53,699 --> 00:11:55,979
much all of these things are important

325
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:57,359
all of these things are well architected

326
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:59,669
all of these things are beautiful but

327
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:00,899
putting them all together is just

328
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:02,849
shocking new people and stopping them

329
00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:04,199
from getting into the market because

330
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:07,199
this is not inviting this is just

331
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:09,209
telling people here is how it has to be

332
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:11,339
done and this is why i left germany and

333
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:12,659
move to England because in Germany

334
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:14,249
everything is this is how it has to be

335
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:18,149
done we live in a high fueled

336
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:19,979
environment we don't even want to

337
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:21,659
deliver things anymore we just get

338
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,849
excited about ourselves the the tech

339
00:12:23,849 --> 00:12:25,559
press has nothing else to write about

340
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:27,419
but javascript and developers at the

341
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:29,699
moment almost every tech company sees

342
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:32,069
developers as the audience that we try

343
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:33,929
to get to cause the audience for our

344
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:36,239
users of our products that stuff that

345
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:38,669
happens magically or so we hope but

346
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:40,499
developers are the most expensive thing

347
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:42,509
to get right now and hardest thing to

348
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:44,549
get as well but the only market where

349
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:46,709
there's more jobs than people for now

350
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:48,659
there will be a crash there was a crash

351
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:50,729
in 1999 when I we lived in when I lived

352
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,649
in Los Angeles that it will come again

353
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:54,359
it cannot be retained so I'm like 18

354
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,679
billion dollars for a company that

355
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,389
allows people to send emojis to each

356
00:12:57,389 --> 00:12:58,709
other there's something going wrong

357
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:02,549
there but right now we are could we are

358
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:05,309
basically up in demand and people really

359
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:07,349
really want us and it's all about hype

360
00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:09,179
it's a set of saying like okay I want to

361
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:10,649
build something beautiful for you that's

362
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:12,599
maintainable I'm like I can make it a

363
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:14,309
coolest newest thing using these 12

364
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:16,949
frameworks like writing that you know

365
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:18,539
about your ex that you know how to make

366
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:20,909
an accessible web app on your on your CV

367
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:22,860
will get you much less than saying

368
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,720
like I know the framework so in so

369
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,550
that's right now in half the demand I

370
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,350
love these linkedin invites when people

371
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,120
ask for three year experience or five

372
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,000
year old libraries but that's a sign of

373
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,830
that hype that we're having right now

374
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,050
which is trying to impress each other

375
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,330
and the prayer and the tech press is

376
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,460
just making everything amazing you know

377
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,500
everything is like just a new library

378
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,660
dust is it's only so small it's so

379
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,100
amazing it does this and this and this

380
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,810
and this don't use in production so what

381
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,150
do we use it for like impressing each

382
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,620
other playing with it at home this is

383
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,630
not really what we're going to do we're

384
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,010
impressing one another rather than

385
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,600
building things for the outside world

386
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,570
and this is most like most of time

387
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,460
people like to quote Moore's law and

388
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,980
this is a bit paraphrased is normally

389
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,660
about semiconductors and pricing of

390
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,820
those computers get faster better

391
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,890
cheaper and more available every two

392
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,080
years and I hear that every time when

393
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,400
something is slow yeah but the new

394
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,960
iphone is coming out it will be fine

395
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,720
then you know because my javascript

396
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,280
library is probably the thing you want

397
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,780
to buy an eight-hundred-dollar phone for

398
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,630
so it actually works faster and

399
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,100
everybody just expects continuously

400
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,780
people to upgrade their computers

401
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,080
because we do we work with amazing

402
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,790
hardware most of the companies are not

403
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,440
flinching anymore when I say like I want

404
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,990
to get a macbook pro I got a macbook pro

405
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,420
for Microsoft when a joint them as my

406
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,750
computer and assembly to test the test

407
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,400
things out because they know not

408
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,380
everybody uses windows in the developer

409
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,120
world and I used to Mac before so I

410
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,340
wanted to stay with that as well we have

411
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,320
phones that are amazing we get test

412
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,900
phones we get to try things out we also

413
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,650
work with amazing connectivity like

414
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,030
compared to the outside world there and

415
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,370
I staying in hotels a lot I know how bad

416
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,500
connectivity can be and living in

417
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,140
England at times as well we work with

418
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,640
great connectivity and what does that

419
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,950
blink anyways we work with great

420
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,140
connectivity in an environment where we

421
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,610
don't even know what elf line is anymore

422
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,800
and most people out there that don't

423
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,560
have that we get paid well for a job

424
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,440
that we like to do and start talking to

425
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,570
people outside our market if they get

426
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,400
paid for the job that they like to do or

427
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,780
if they have more fun in their free time

428
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,790
and it just go to work to make money and

429
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,710
that's something we should never forget

430
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,270
how lucky

431
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,430
we are how amazingly lucky we are that

432
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,680
we get the freedoms that we have the

433
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,070
problem is though that we assume all the

434
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,990
things that we have other people have as

435
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,220
well we work with these beautiful

436
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,250
browsers and all of them are amazing yes

437
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,650
even the ones on older androids yes even

438
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,320
Safari yes even know Internet Explorer

439
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,100
as dead edge is great all these browsers

440
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,620
have come with amazing tools and all

441
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,810
these browsers have at least a baseline

442
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,360
that we can now work against and when I

443
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,430
started as a web developer that baseline

444
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,780
wasn't there that's what we fought for

445
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,700
this is what the web standards movement

446
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,360
was about that browsers follow standards

447
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,600
and compete on the on UX and compete on

448
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,790
the features that are for end-users and

449
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,620
not on the engine that drives those

450
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,430
browsers when we talk about Moore's law

451
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,170
we have to talk about mais law which is

452
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,060
again paraphrase but it says software

453
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,770
efficiency halves every 18 month

454
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,480
compensating for moves Moore's law

455
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,760
meaning the longer you maintain a piece

456
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,260
of software the bigger it gets in the

457
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,410
slower it gets and we all been there I

458
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,030
love that it's two years for software

459
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,890
for hardware to get faster an 18 month

460
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,930
for software to get slower so some will

461
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:49,020
be losing six months all the time so in

462
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,700
essence we move fast and we run in

463
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,220
circles because we have good stuff and

464
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,350
we put more things in and then we wait

465
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,270
until the hardware catches up again and

466
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,340
then we write more stuff again I talked

467
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,990
earlier to somebody outside i noted with

468
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,850
hard drives you know you upgrade your

469
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,490
hard drive from 100 gig to 250 cake and

470
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,690
then like oh that's going to last me for

471
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,220
the next three years four weeks later

472
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,650
there's like 10 gig left and you're like

473
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,870
what did i do you have 6000 NPM modules

474
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,520
thousand eighty resolution movies

475
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,010
instead of CM 920 resolution which is

476
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,260
with digital hoarders we love to fill

477
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,120
things up because we might need it later

478
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,400
on the same way in our products we use

479
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,200
all the things that in the future our

480
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,300
users might want to have rather than

481
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,920
building something simple and making it

482
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,410
after feedback from the users making it

483
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:35,130
better the web is in a sorry sorry state

484
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,110
and that is really annoying me because

485
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,290
the behb the web made my career I don't

486
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,000
have a job education I didn't finish

487
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,280
university without the web but would be

488
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,750
probably I don't know what I were doing

489
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,480
dancing at cafes or something

490
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,270
the median web page time to interact is

491
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,240
5.5 seconds and fully loads in just over

492
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,000
15 seconds and that was a there was an

493
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,770
analysis / web performance daily had

494
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,780
been done I've been done there the

495
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,520
median web page is to megabyte in size

496
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,179
and contains 170 resources it is if it

497
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:07,559
is if like we didn't have any

498
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,900
performance information or training or

499
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,850
tools and browsers for years and years

500
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,040
who builds this stuff it cannot be us

501
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,390
because we learn all these cool things

502
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,730
here right must be some idiot that does

503
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,700
it differently but it's us it really is

504
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,590
over time because we move on to the next

505
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,840
library that we try out and we move on

506
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,580
to the next project that we want to have

507
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,710
and we believe companies when the

508
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,480
software becomes unmaintained well we

509
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,919
don't want to keep it any longer and

510
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,809
then instead of fixing it when we go to

511
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:35,280
a new job we just show them the new

512
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,049
framework that we came with that will

513
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,890
make everything better again right

514
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,750
waiting isn't fun it's not fun to look

515
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,429
five seconds on your phone people don't

516
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:46,620
do it they basically after two seconds

517
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,840
on the phone we have much less patience

518
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,340
than we have on the desktop on a desktop

519
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,169
you got 12 tabs open you go to the other

520
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:53,970
tab you look at fluffy kittens and you

521
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,410
come back to the other one that loaded

522
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,960
on the phone you like I'm gonna kill you

523
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,179
or like is it come disconnected again

524
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,190
the amount of times i call my isp that

525
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,630
something is wrong where it realities

526
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,970
was just a website slow yeah well they

527
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,340
deserved it it's especially annoying

528
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,140
when it costs you i just arrived

529
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,210
yesterday and three my provider in

530
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,549
England says it's a max of two pound of

531
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:16,770
minimum to call one point 25 to receive

532
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,740
a call six pound per megabyte to use the

533
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,230
web and email this means the average

534
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,750
website is the same as the same price as

535
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,750
a ticket for the cinema so I really hope

536
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,669
that your website is entertaining enough

537
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,860
that I don't watch Spectre or something

538
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,540
instead of watching your website for 12

539
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,429
pound how does this happen what's going

540
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:41,010
on here how do we fill up that web why

541
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,919
is that happening all the time I think

542
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,650
it's because we keep projecting we

543
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,049
attack the cheapest remember we're

544
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:51,390
technically proficient we know our stuff

545
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,910
about computers we're being we have

546
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,530
interest in change in upgrades a new

547
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,240
browser comes out we download that thing

548
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,830
and your operating system comes out

549
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,250
unless it's OS X we uploaded immediately

550
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,210
I don't know is it same with you like as

551
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,740
soon as that the news is out the other

552
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,270
one becomes really unstable I don't know

553
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,030
what they're doing but fair enough we

554
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,710
have interest in spending money on the

555
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,870
web and for web services because we're

556
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,700
actually we live off the web so we also

557
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,560
spend money on there and we expect our

558
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,180
audience to do the same thing they

559
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,770
always have the newest computers they

560
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,630
always upgrade the operating system they

561
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,640
make every security patch out there and

562
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,470
that's basically why we have such a

563
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,240
wonderful symbiosis with our users and

564
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,390
we never hate them the reality is kind

565
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,880
of different first of all the last thing

566
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,740
the interest in spending money on the

567
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,990
web for web services doesn't apply to us

568
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,200
because we want everything for free we

569
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,700
all have ad blockers installed because

570
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,340
we're not stupid you know the other

571
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,750
people are the ones that click on ads

572
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,840
you know like why would I do that I love

573
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,640
that Adblock Plus has been bought by

574
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,640
somebody and nobody knows who and that's

575
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,260
that was like four months ago it could

576
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,150
be the Mafia it could be the Triads it

577
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,640
could be NSA or worse the American

578
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,960
government anybody could have bought

579
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,430
these things and that's on all of our

580
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,530
computers and spies on us because we

581
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,170
don't want to see ads I think it's time

582
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,840
for a reality check this is us in the

583
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,520
middle of it we don't spend money but

584
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,870
we're technically proficient we're

585
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,490
interested in change we upgrade all the

586
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,640
time we work for an assumed audience

587
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,650
that actually spend money on the stuff

588
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,120
that we do and keep upgrading their

589
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,500
computers all the time and know what a

590
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,320
computer is and know that a database

591
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,730
error on the page is not their problem

592
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,340
but our problem in reality our audience

593
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,590
is more or less there because it's a

594
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,320
numbers game it's the people the people

595
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,090
that we never see are the people that

596
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,710
click on ads the people that we never

597
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,390
see are the ones that download a new

598
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,010
game where you put two colors and

599
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,720
colorful fluffy things together that

600
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,400
make a ping sound that cost you twelve

601
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,010
dollars those are the people that pay

602
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,590
for the web and it's not i'm not saying

603
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,000
that they're not that they're stupid you

604
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,970
just don't care and even more so they

605
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,650
don't care nowadays anymore because

606
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,750
internet and computers has become

607
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,630
plumbing and water it's become a thing

608
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,310
that's just their people don't know what

609
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,680
offline is or they don't know what a

610
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,200
computer but what a browser is they just

611
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,000
click on the thing and go somewhere on

612
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,100
the mobile phone the browsers to last

613
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,590
app did you open when you

614
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:19,640
new board of all the other ones the next

615
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,580
users though are not those who complain

616
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,960
that the web is not as good as native

617
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,429
apps Bruce Lawson at state of the

618
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:27,289
browser and some other conferences gave

619
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:29,570
this great talk ensuring a performant

620
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,669
web for the next billion people where he

621
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:34,010
shows you numbers about where the growth

622
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,929
is where the next users are the next

623
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:37,970
real billion of you billion people are

624
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,860
and it's actually in your neighborhood

625
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,029
here like Indonesia India Africa these

626
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,409
are the markets that are coming right

627
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:47,000
now and these are not the board people

628
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,740
these are the people what the internet

629
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,419
access to the Internet makes a

630
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:52,130
difference to them where the Internet is

631
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,809
a teacher where the internet is an

632
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:56,029
education tool where the internet means

633
00:22:56,029 --> 00:22:57,710
that they will have a business or don't

634
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,020
have a business and this is something we

635
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,669
should think about when we start putting

636
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:03,830
all the cool new technologies into our

637
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,929
products because we like to because

638
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:07,460
Moore's law stopped working when

639
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,649
hardware and when we hardwired hardware

640
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:11,809
and software this is the phone that my

641
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:13,370
hotel gives me here for free and for

642
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,049
some reason calls me mr. Batchelor I

643
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:18,049
don't know why it's an android phone

644
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:20,149
that has a sim card in here that I can

645
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,130
use off in this great service thank you

646
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,770
so much but this Android gave me like

647
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,960
flashbacks from a google i/o six years

648
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,970
ago or something because it's a really

649
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:31,220
really old small device that never has

650
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,990
been upgraded because it cannot be

651
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,610
upgraded because it's too slow for a

652
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,649
newer Android version and the browser in

653
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:39,590
there is something that is like done by

654
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,960
fullmoon by two werewolves and an old

655
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,000
Fork of WebKit or something that it just

656
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,710
shouldn't be in use but this is the

657
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,480
browser and will stay the brita browser

658
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,340
of those till the end of time and

659
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,990
everybody who goes into that hotel would

660
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,789
get that browser and there's nothing we

661
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:54,620
can do about that we can stand on our

662
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,179
ahead and scream that they should have 2

663
00:23:56,179 --> 00:23:57,350
News coolest thing because i want to

664
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,120
have service workers but these phones

665
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,649
are out there and it will stay out there

666
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:02,240
for quite a while because we hardwired

667
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,730
operating system and browser which is

668
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:07,070
too stupid idea to Microsoft in the 90s

669
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,980
but now finally gave up as well as

670
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,809
developers we are always asked to do the

671
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:13,760
impossible that's our problem as well

672
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,409
because we're still so far removed from

673
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:17,659
the people who pay us money or from the

674
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:19,549
people who run the projects that we're

675
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:21,409
doing they always ask us things that we

676
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:23,450
cannot do in which is too proud to tell

677
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,220
them that we can't do them we just say

678
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,350
okay yeah fair enough I can do that make

679
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,299
it work the same in every browser

680
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:32,210
that's pointless that's like saying make

681
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,950
your car drive the same speed under

682
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,929
water doesn't analyze on the motorway a

683
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:38,570
good website looks different and works

684
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,549
different according to the environment

685
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:42,350
that it's actually used in that's the

686
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,970
power of the web that's the power we

687
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,460
have over native environments make it

688
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,409
easy to maintain and we want to control

689
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:50,419
everything it's like we want to have a

690
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:52,159
CMS but we also want to control the

691
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,960
color of every different letter on in

692
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,570
our logo please then what that's where

693
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,059
it becomes complex again make sure that

694
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:00,679
it's accessible I think there's a law we

695
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:02,059
need to follow nobody cares about

696
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:03,950
accessibility because of people they

697
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,749
just don't want to get sued and that's a

698
00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:07,639
cynical argument but I've seen in far

699
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,950
too often sadly enough don't spend too

700
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,840
much time on it let's release it now and

701
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,009
fix it later that's the biggest life

702
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:17,720
followed by I read the Terms and

703
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,159
Conditions fix it later never comes fix

704
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,049
it later means you put things on the web

705
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:26,149
that you're embarrassed about and you

706
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:29,629
will never get the chance to fix use

707
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:31,279
this analytics code you have no clue

708
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,049
about we need to know how people use our

709
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:35,869
products like great that your javascript

710
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:38,480
is fast here's 12 Nana lytic speak ins

711
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,690
that really really slow down the thing

712
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:43,279
just find the right bricks and assemble

713
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,899
something great there's so many tools

714
00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:47,539
out there 150,000 mpm modules why do you

715
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:51,830
even write code any longer right what

716
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:59,330
does this code do

717
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,850
it looks quite complex it looks quite

718
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:05,260
amazing it's minified of course that's a

719
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:12,760
good thing any guess it's to follow me

720
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:18,310
on twitter button this is the code that

721
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,140
is on the Twitter website to copy and

722
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,360
paste so it's progressively enhancing a

723
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,430
link so that's pretty cool but this is

724
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,020
the co degenerates and this is not

725
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,090
because Twitter hates users this is

726
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,650
because Twitter needs to make this thing

727
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,960
work in every environment possible and

728
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,210
just don't want to think about it and

729
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,680
put like lots of poly fields and all

730
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,440
kind of things in there and this is just

731
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,840
painful you know this is like if that's

732
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,480
where we are then we forgot to move the

733
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,520
platform with us and we forgot to feed

734
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,230
back to browsers what we really really

735
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,710
need the amazing tech of today is the

736
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,380
rubbish of tomorrow and I say I see that

737
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,330
a lot right now because working for

738
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,490
microsoft and working on edge we have

739
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,800
this wonderful site scanning tool that

740
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,750
one you put your website in and it shows

741
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,400
you what you're doing wrong with your

742
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,530
website that you're using WebKit only

743
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:08,560
CSS that using jQuery 12 times where

744
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,900
four times would be enough that you're

745
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,600
using a attached event that's not

746
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,010
necessary anymore of course

747
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,630
addeventlistener works on every browser

748
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,270
nowadays it's a really nice tool to make

749
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,400
to show enterprises and show companies

750
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,990
what they're doing wrong with their

751
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,640
website it's also on get up so if you

752
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,110
find a bug in it or you want to run it

753
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,880
run it behind your firewall as a lot of

754
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,190
our clients are doing you can do that I

755
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,110
think my favorite quote that I heard

756
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,180
from all the clients was a simple way to

757
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,890
detect her older part of our massive

758
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,350
website is it's checking which version

759
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,410
of jQuery was used in that part of it

760
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,690
it's like rings new tree trunk so they

761
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,340
found like 16 different versions of

762
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,020
jQuery on death website because

763
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,850
different departments build different

764
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,800
parts of their website and didn't talk

765
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,480
to each other and didn't point to some

766
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,630
CDN hosted a jQuery that could be that

767
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,340
could be cached and could be evergreen

768
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,440
but everybody just bundled it in and and

769
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,880
threw it in there because nobody sees

770
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,350
that right we break the web for the sake

771
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,240
of developer convenience this is the

772
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,070
experience that the web gives me a lot

773
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,900
like waiting for randoms

774
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,370
off and when there was a javascript

775
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,660
error in the background and they don't

776
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,520
have an event handler of the error case

777
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,530
this is this is forever and ever and

778
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,720
until I reload the page and thought it

779
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,160
was my browser or something like that

780
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,380
how many tutorials do you see where it's

781
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,380
only the success case the error case is

782
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,030
the most important thing this is where

783
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,880
you piss people off you make it as poss

784
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,670
never blame the user for something like

785
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,890
that never let them wait endlessly show

786
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,020
them like something went wrong your data

787
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,600
is safe we're trying again it's our

788
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,610
fault sorry for this this is the only

789
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,290
thing that you can do here but we always

790
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,940
get like well they will reload it don't

791
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,150
worry about that there's a great read

792
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:53,980
and talk video by Paul by what's his

793
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,920
name again Paul Lewis from google it was

794
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,160
at full frontal last week and the post

795
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,660
was like three days ago it's the cost of

796
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,760
frameworks and it's all about ergonomics

797
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,500
versus user needs and i found that

798
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,270
exciting to talk to him about that

799
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,800
because i had these things before he

800
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,360
collect a lot of data about these

801
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,060
problems so one thing he looked at is

802
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,970
that everybody uses a virtualization and

803
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,950
uses a framework because the dome is

804
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,140
slow but tom is terrible we need a

805
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,420
jquery course Adam was impossible to use

806
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,550
and reading and writing from your HTML

807
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,440
all the time is slowing things down in

808
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,000
the reactor documentation it says the

809
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,530
bottleneck is almost always the Dom

810
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,420
mutation and not the JavaScript

811
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,910
execution so Paul Lewis said like okay

812
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,640
let's let's throw that to a test and see

813
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,900
what's coming out there so you build

814
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,120
this website using angular and using

815
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,820
react that just loads pictures from

816
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,340
twitter from flickr and each of these

817
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,080
pictures like five dom elements because

818
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,460
that's the documentation of the ority

819
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,680
description stand the link and then he

820
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,260
started looking a started a timer when

821
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,230
the page loads until the framework kicks

822
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,240
in and then he finishes the timer and

823
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,880
then it starts writing out the HTML and

824
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,560
starting to position the pictures and

825
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,180
stuff and then the second time of

826
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,190
finishes and what he found out what's

827
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,440
really interesting that the more

828
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,080
pictures you have the longer of course

829
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,050
it takes we all know that more HTML not

830
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,780
a good idea but what he found is that

831
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,240
the the rendering and the dom

832
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,760
manipulation stayed more or less the

833
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,700
same whereas the javascript execution

834
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,340
framework that reads all these things

835
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,780
and then turns them into virtualized

836
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,580
Stallman writes them out there it's

837
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,220
becoming bigger and bigger like 1.5

838
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,290
seconds at the end of it when it came to

839
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:38,650
like 100 1,000,000 dot no 1500 pictures

840
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,010
on a 50,000 picture something like that

841
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:44,050
anyways he realized that the Dom

842
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,300
manipulation is slow but it stays the

843
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,940
same whereas the JavaScript execution if

844
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,530
you do clever things to your things

845
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,390
before you render them out becomes

846
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,280
bigger and bigger because the objects

847
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,410
internally take more memory it takes

848
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,870
more computation these kind of things he

849
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,210
even found more interestingly that when

850
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,370
you do vanilla JavaScript without the

851
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,130
library the more pictures who did it

852
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,560
started evening out and it started

853
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,720
actually becoming faster again because

854
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,390
the browser caches stuff for you the

855
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,090
JavaScript engine reuses things that are

856
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,950
already being there like okay I notice I

857
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,300
don't have to touch it anymore because

858
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,700
it hasn't changed where it's like doing

859
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,620
clever things in your library means like

860
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,300
you start from scratch every single time

861
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,190
again so we need to learn in these

862
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,230
libraries to do the same kind of caching

863
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,300
if you read the same Dom element in

864
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,670
jQuery 16 times it should come from a

865
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,470
cache and not be read from document

866
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,140
again but this is very interesting that

867
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,200
we optimize the JavaScript engines 40s

868
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,720
end cases and we don't get these end

869
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,370
cases any longer because people think

870
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,320
JavaScript engines are too slow from the

871
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,470
very beginning and they're not browsers

872
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,360
to an incredibly amount of work for us

873
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,620
and we always just complain when

874
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,180
something is broken if you think about

875
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,070
it and you work your work with browser

876
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,530
makers they display all kind of media

877
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:02,350
content like how many images out there

878
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,270
are in the wrong format with the wrong

879
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,070
file name in the wrong mime type and the

880
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,140
browser will still show them people can

881
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,420
put bitmap bmps on the web and the

882
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,040
browser will render them instead of

883
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,480
hurting those people which would be the

884
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,690
right thing to do it fixes minor

885
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,670
mistakes in our code you don't close a P

886
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,590
tag the browser closes it for you we

887
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,930
gave up on developers we just expect you

888
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,700
to do mistakes and the browser should

889
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,400
fix it for us and this is called like a

890
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,010
good programming nowadays or something

891
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:32,740
we optimize our code to run smoothly the

892
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,180
amount of stuff that you chakra

893
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,580
JavaScript engine does two for loops by

894
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,260
Lou by reading through them in

895
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,910
seeing if there's a function called and

896
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,710
embed that function into the other one

897
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,410
before creating a binary code from them

898
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:47,140
is quite impressive it provides us with

899
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,210
developer tools we have full inside over

900
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,380
what we're doing but we're still

901
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,670
complaining it's probably the browser

902
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,230
that slow and it's very easy to point

903
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,510
out that was our mistake and it was just

904
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:58,600
bad rendering thrashing of the layout

905
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,910
again a young kind of things because of

906
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:03,610
that they provide us with deep insights

907
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,320
what our code does to the computer we

908
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,360
cap heap analysis how much RAM we used

909
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,940
how much CPU were using when i started

910
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,920
with javascript i had not even idea what

911
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,450
the cpu would be like I couldn't even

912
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,130
tested in the operating systems back

913
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,600
then but now we have it in the browsers

914
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,210
it allows us to automate testing on them

915
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:21,040
and debug remotely on devices we don't

916
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,440
even own we can use third-party services

917
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,600
like browser tests and browser link and

918
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,000
all these kind of things to access a

919
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,730
iphone in America and that connectivity

920
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,560
and get the report back how our

921
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,080
JavaScript amazed they perform their how

922
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,960
awesome is that and and yet we want to

923
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,670
have every browser on our machine and

924
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,110
tested there rather than just using

925
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,410
these kind of wonderful environments

926
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,990
Paul build a great thing called big rig

927
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,960
which takes a which takes at a scanner

928
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,120
file either from chrome or from

929
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,940
webpagetest org and it shows you what

930
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,590
was going on how much memory was

931
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,020
consumed what the CPU was doing where

932
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,580
your time went and where your

933
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,400
computation went and using this you can

934
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,500
actually tweak your applications and

935
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,270
realize where the real bottlenecks are

936
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,830
instead of just complaining about that

937
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,980
it's the Dom I was very interesting use

938
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,590
the to do MVC application and then use

939
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,330
different libraries and compared them

940
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,159
with each other how much they're in size

941
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,159
and how much then bootstrap time and on

942
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:24,850
a 95 in an iphone 5s and he found out

943
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:27,010
that some of them took up to two seconds

944
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,750
before they started rendering the first

945
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,240
line and this is all JavaScript

946
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,340
execution this is not like talking to

947
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,600
the browser and all kind of things this

948
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,480
is the deed libraries themselves because

949
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,040
we want to use them and it makes it

950
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,050
easier for us as developers but these

951
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:43,030
are two seconds and lots of battery and

952
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,100
lots of time on useless machines that

953
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,510
they shouldn't have to use because we

954
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,770
want to write three lines of JavaScript

955
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:50,860
instead of car instead of 50 it's not

956
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,149
about how many lines

957
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:53,710
javascript your itís how your code

958
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,659
behaves at the end users computer

959
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:57,819
because these are the people we work for

960
00:34:57,819 --> 00:34:59,770
we don't work for other developers

961
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:02,049
unless you write developer tools we work

962
00:35:02,049 --> 00:35:03,640
for people out there and they shouldn't

963
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,079
have phones that the battery dies

964
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:06,789
because we have a memory leak in the

965
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:09,609
background fixing everything with a lot

966
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:11,500
of JavaScript helps us but not

967
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,630
necessarily our audience javascript has

968
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,549
become this duct tape of the web leg if

969
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:17,410
something's wrong we do with javascript

970
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,029
because then we got full control over it

971
00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:20,589
and we don't not at the mercy of those

972
00:35:20,589 --> 00:35:22,450
stupid browsers and those terrible

973
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,460
environments we just can do everything

974
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,349
ourselves because we're infallible and

975
00:35:26,349 --> 00:35:27,849
we're domestic levers people on the

976
00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:31,329
planet we all know that so we should

977
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,520
worry about oops we should worry a lot

978
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,250
more about costs and costs and Paul

979
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,770
talked about this as well costs for

980
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,420
developers is learning new frameworks

981
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,670
like every month there's a new one and

982
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,010
we want to have it on our CV so we have

983
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,079
to look at it and then version 2 is

984
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:48,520
completely completely different to

985
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,380
version 1 so we have to relearn them and

986
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,880
find out what changed and why is it

987
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,700
breaking out of a sudden because

988
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,020
frameworks is software as well it's the

989
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,359
same problems that we have its people

990
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:00,460
writing these things debugging

991
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,140
frameworks where did this error come

992
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,000
from it's obviously not in my code but

993
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,980
the framework does something wrong so

994
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,869
can you debug the framework do you

995
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:10,029
understand what the thing is doing or do

996
00:36:10,029 --> 00:36:11,380
you just have to wait until there's a

997
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,970
patch and you'd go back to your client

998
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,140
well we have to wait three weeks sorry

999
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,640
about that I hope you can pay us for the

1000
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,369
three weeks we're not doing anything

1001
00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:19,930
setting up developer environments so

1002
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,160
it's like this is easy you're at a

1003
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,440
command line type Keys 12 things in wait

1004
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,720
for 15 minutes of em p.m. with 12 with

1005
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,430
200 warnings and then everything will be

1006
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:30,849
fine or like oh you need you need a

1007
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:34,630
macbook pro to run this JavaScript no no

1008
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:38,200
sorry and cutting down on possible hires

1009
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,029
and adding two on boarding time if your

1010
00:36:40,029 --> 00:36:43,150
company subscribed to I 02 I don't know

1011
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:47,109
a blah blah framework so and so you only

1012
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:48,910
can hire people that are happy to use

1013
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,920
blah blah framework so and so and you

1014
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,180
actually cut down on those feet but

1015
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,410
doesn't work most of time are the more

1016
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:56,319
expensive ones as well the real

1017
00:36:56,319 --> 00:36:57,789
important bit is the cost for our

1018
00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:00,190
end-users time to load and execute the

1019
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:03,579
bandwidths used you remember 66 pound

1020
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:05,920
per megabyte CPU

1021
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,359
search the frame rate if it's less than

1022
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,190
60 frames per seconds and we had that in

1023
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,839
the first talk today it feels icky

1024
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:12,880
people will complain that it's not fast

1025
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,339
no matter how fast it really is memory

1026
00:37:15,339 --> 00:37:17,170
usage because memory is not endless as

1027
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,970
well and that actually ties into battery

1028
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,549
life as well if your website sucks my

1029
00:37:21,549 --> 00:37:23,160
battery dry that's not a good service

1030
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,510
it's time to clean up and learn the

1031
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,609
basics I love that BYE MOM now to post

1032
00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:30,190
yesterday find meaningless code why was

1033
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,200
it put their future proofing rip out the

1034
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,119
code the future is here and it's not

1035
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,970
happy with your proofing we are crap at

1036
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,650
predicting the future we really are if

1037
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,270
we were we could play the lottery and

1038
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:42,130
don't have to work anymore but all of

1039
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,410
our code or a clever code predicts

1040
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:47,020
problems of the future wait until the

1041
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,670
problems are there and write code for

1042
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:51,670
now that is fast small and behaves

1043
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,500
really well on our end users computers

1044
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,480
worry about the problems that are coming

1045
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,579
with scale when they're coming there's

1046
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:59,530
nothing worse that when you have lots of

1047
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,150
users and it gets slowed that's a good

1048
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,069
problem to have because those users pay

1049
00:38:03,069 --> 00:38:05,349
money then you actually get paid to fix

1050
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:06,970
these things rather than hoping the

1051
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,970
future will come the JavaScript learning

1052
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,589
process has always been kind of

1053
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:14,349
interesting what do we do we use view

1054
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:15,670
source to see what other people are

1055
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,220
doing then we copy and paste the bits

1056
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,809
that look like they're responsible for

1057
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:22,510
some things then we change some numbers

1058
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,960
around we run into errors and we blame

1059
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,099
Internet Explorer that was back then no

1060
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,290
of course now we're all like full stack

1061
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,030
developers and whatever we call

1062
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,440
ourselves right now so be much more

1063
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,470
professional so nowadays we search for a

1064
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,559
solution on stack overflow we copy and

1065
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:42,880
paste the bits that look like they're

1066
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,130
responsible for some things we change

1067
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:47,170
some numbers around we run into errors

1068
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,119
and we blame JavaScript for being a

1069
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,760
terrible and not a real language and we

1070
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,250
blame Internet Explorer for good measure

1071
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,240
we're running out of both excuses first

1072
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,490
of all internet explorer is dead Windows

1073
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,349
10 is the operating system there's a

1074
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:04,569
free upgrade the browser's evergreen

1075
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:06,130
like all the others i love that at the

1076
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,200
MVP summit unattended laptops will be

1077
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,069
upgraded to windows 10 javascript grew

1078
00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:15,130
up as well es6 is here it's a ratified

1079
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:18,970
standard we as 2016 2015 is not es6 is

1080
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:19,540
rat

1081
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,060
I'd since June we have a standard and

1082
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,670
it's not the what is javascript anymore

1083
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,980
it's ECMO script six is the is here and

1084
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,960
it's backwards compatible and has a lot

1085
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,480
of good changes in it the support is

1086
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,670
encouraging we got edge Firefox Chrome

1087
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:37,450
Safari on is on iOS 9 Safari is really

1088
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,700
really good and that's uncommon because

1089
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,980
a lot of other things Safari is like not

1090
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,390
as good any longer and they're not as

1091
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:46,890
fast as implementing us because reasons

1092
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:49,600
there's a compatibility table at Kang X

1093
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,100
website is really really good for

1094
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,080
finding out what's going on some numbers

1095
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,810
edge is eighty percent Firefox 4271

1096
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,930
percent chrome is sixty-three percent

1097
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,800
Android twenty-nine percent and

1098
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,570
fifty-four percent so a lot of stuff you

1099
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,970
can use one hundred percent is not

1100
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,950
possible to achieve right now because a

1101
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,290
few of the standard bits would break a

1102
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:10,900
wrist already existing functionality we

1103
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,580
found websites that run all version of

1104
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,410
mood tools for example and we cannot use

1105
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:17,350
array contains in our JavaScript engine

1106
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,580
because of deaths because it would break

1107
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,160
old websites browser innovation also

1108
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,740
means don't break the web because we are

1109
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,480
not allowed to do that but we as

1110
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,670
developers broke the web by using things

1111
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:31,390
too early now with year six we have a

1112
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:34,390
clean new slate and the new baseline is

1113
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,980
here i love that by kyle symes in the

1114
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,690
other day a new baseline for modern

1115
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,160
JavaScript competency includes

1116
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,720
understanding how to effectively use

1117
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,150
promises generators for a sync up your

1118
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:46,930
game and I don't know up your game I

1119
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,850
think about these like bros drinking

1120
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,560
beer when I hear that kind of stuff I'm

1121
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,140
very allergic to this you know I'm like

1122
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,940
we're in high school trying to impress

1123
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,620
each other how much more JavaScript we

1124
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,360
know our JavaScript knowledge should

1125
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,830
make better products for our end users

1126
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,140
that's the main reason everything else

1127
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,990
is a nice to have everything else is

1128
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,600
unnecessary and if if you write better

1129
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,370
code and faster code by using all these

1130
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,650
things good for you but other than that

1131
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,960
as he as you said like as well I'm

1132
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,490
trying to turn over a new leaf or

1133
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,170
encourage people to less Nick the

1134
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:19,240
negativity I won't fully succeed but I'm

1135
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,370
trying and then like it's just the face

1136
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:24,250
of burnout because if we if we up each

1137
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,840
other all the time we like this is what

1138
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,150
we have to use we're burning out and for

1139
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,920
nothing and we're not burning out for

1140
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,420
creating better things for our end users

1141
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,430
we're burning up by trying to

1142
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:35,079
one another who's going to be the best

1143
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:37,450
JavaScript developer on this planet you

1144
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,829
know when people come up to me and

1145
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,359
select do you think that guys better

1146
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:43,240
than you and I'm not maybe I don't care

1147
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,710
I want to be better tomorrow than I'm

1148
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,540
here denim today I'm comparing myself

1149
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,329
with myself and then I can overtake

1150
00:41:49,329 --> 00:41:51,640
anybody else if I compare myself with

1151
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,140
other people all the time I just get

1152
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,520
frustrated there's a lot of frustration

1153
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,710
going on in our market controlled

1154
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,420
environments allow us to use the newest

1155
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,089
and coolest and find best practices so

1156
00:42:01,089 --> 00:42:02,530
if you're using server side JavaScript

1157
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:04,900
and you're running node make that work

1158
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,270
across all platforms any node solution

1159
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,190
that only works on mac is terrible you

1160
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,839
might as well right right native code

1161
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:14,650
and use everything you can find in es6

1162
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,630
that you want to use and use it to the

1163
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,460
best practice in the right patterns in

1164
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,839
the node environment because you control

1165
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:24,490
it for example vs code was released

1166
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:26,950
yesterday open source it's running on

1167
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:29,650
node so play with that hack type thing

1168
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,240
to death find something cool in there

1169
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,980
Adam editor we saw that earlier as well

1170
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,390
these are the environments where we can

1171
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,910
play because we control them this is our

1172
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:39,130
stuff so let's play with the newest and

1173
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:41,109
coolest inside of those but don't play

1174
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:43,290
for end users because they cannot use it

1175
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,490
let's not make JavaScript wrote the

1176
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,770
world overly complex and scary this is

1177
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,329
the entrance to my dental office in

1178
00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:50,589
London I don't know why I'm going there

1179
00:42:50,589 --> 00:42:52,510
but it's really like a horror movie but

1180
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,980
you saw that earlier we don't we

1181
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,420
shouldn't shock people with what they

1182
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,559
need to do if they want to write

1183
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:02,109
javascript is 6 7 2015 2029 caters to

1184
00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:04,569
different audiences each of these parts

1185
00:43:04,569 --> 00:43:06,490
are either for syntactic sugar for the

1186
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:08,079
jQuery users for scalable applications

1187
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,750
of a library builders you don't need to

1188
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,490
know all of it and you don't need to

1189
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,869
feel depressed if you don't know what a

1190
00:43:13,869 --> 00:43:16,240
symbol means because you will not use it

1191
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,160
if you don't write a library for example

1192
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,660
you do will not use it if you don't

1193
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:22,089
write a massive application but you can

1194
00:43:22,089 --> 00:43:23,710
have used templates for the things that

1195
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:26,740
make sense to you play with it and find

1196
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,480
out which parts matter to you and start

1197
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,160
loving those parts start kicking the

1198
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,319
tires of those parts start writing good

1199
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,089
things with those parts rather than just

1200
00:43:34,089 --> 00:43:35,950
like oh I should have used that one as

1201
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:37,900
well because people say so people say a

1202
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,670
lot of stupid things don't listen to

1203
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:43,089
people phas allows you to learn and use

1204
00:43:43,089 --> 00:43:45,369
it in the now so that one converts you

1205
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:47,230
is 62 is 5 so it runs every

1206
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:49,240
we're performance issue you don't know

1207
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,710
what you're controlling but it's great

1208
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:53,230
to learn es6 right now because you can

1209
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,880
run it on any device and you see what's

1210
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,290
actually coming out of it you can see

1211
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:59,350
what HTML file but what-what es5 gets

1212
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:03,790
generated from your es6 pony foo has a

1213
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:06,970
great has a great order so long that's

1214
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:09,460
wrong link excellent I'm es6 overview

1215
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,320
and 350 bullet points if you really want

1216
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,260
to have like chunky bits go damn if you

1217
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,580
want to read a book that's exploring

1218
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,440
your six-pack so Roush Maya its online

1219
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,570
for free or it costs like twenty dollars

1220
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,550
to buy I was one of the editors it's an

1221
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:22,960
amazing book it's a really really

1222
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,750
beautiful explanation not only how but

1223
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,300
also the why why were things done in a

1224
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,160
certain way in es6 and not like okay

1225
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,440
this is it you have to use it now but

1226
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,660
also let's just calm down a bit and fix

1227
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,340
and remove what's broken on the web

1228
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,840
because there's so many things broken

1229
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,420
out there I'm just we have two megabyte

1230
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,180
everywhere 170 things so what's going on

1231
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,430
there let's fix those as well let's

1232
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,170
analyze and clean up put the web on a

1233
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:49,930
diet and 12 convenient solution at a

1234
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,150
time kill those old libraries because we

1235
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:53,530
don't need them any longer they're just

1236
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:56,730
dead weight on the web right now and

1237
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:59,200
then the helping hand what I'm doing

1238
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,760
right now when I'm feeling depressed I

1239
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,440
go to github and a look at something

1240
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,359
that's kind of broken and I fix it and

1241
00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:06,760
then I send it send a request and say

1242
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,250
like okay I fixed this because this is

1243
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,960
the reasons why I think this is better

1244
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,720
you might get a bit get a response back

1245
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,910
you know right thats words my code what

1246
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:18,310
the hell doesn't matter you still learn

1247
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:20,619
something from it but you might be lucky

1248
00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:22,750
and you might get something like me the

1249
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,580
other day when i'm like thanks very much

1250
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,230
for your input advice on making the

1251
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:27,910
changes i learned something new today I

1252
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:30,460
appreciate it take care and this feels

1253
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,200
good and it's what we should do to each

1254
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,180
other much much more rather than

1255
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,740
outbidding each other on who's the

1256
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,720
coolest javascript developer of tomorrow

1257
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,330
and a JavaScript warrior of the world so

1258
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:42,490
let's turn education as competition into

1259
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,490
education and fun again and now that you

1260
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:47,410
don't have to be perfect you can be good

1261
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:58,840
that's all I had so thanks very much

1262
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:01,920
yea high priest thanks for your talk I I

excellent yeah and and while grid we as

1265
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:13,260
um Kim presenter just now as well that

1266
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,750
we developers we also have the tendency

1267
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:18,320
of over engineering things and and

1268
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,270
Kenley in delivering product and focused

1269
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,090
too much on maybe performance and how

1270
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,860
will you suggest us to balance between

1271
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:29,880
these are these two things so the

1272
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,010
question was to how do we how do we find

1273
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:34,950
how do we stop ourselves from over from

1274
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:37,110
over architecting and from thinking too

1275
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:39,570
much about performance I think you can't

1276
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:41,880
think too much about performance if it

1277
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,470
means the performance of your end users

1278
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,570
if it means the thing will run better on

1279
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:47,730
the end machine that's great put as much

1280
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:49,710
as time as you want in there and I'd

1281
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,570
rather us work a week longer on a

1282
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,340
product that is good for our end users

1283
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,710
then to release it and say like where

1284
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:58,110
the fastest engineers out there when it

1285
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:00,240
comes to over architecting our things

1286
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,130
and talking about the future is what I

1287
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:04,620
said about we try to predict things of

1288
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,960
the future that will come I'd rather

1289
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,320
have a clean code that is easy to

1290
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,020
understand then have a very generic code

1291
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,940
that can deal with every situation out

1292
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,010
there because this generic code will be

1293
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:20,040
used to ten percent of what it can do in

1294
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,580
most of the cases so I think if you find

1295
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,740
that you're using only a part of what

1296
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,530
you've written then you have wasted a

1297
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:31,020
lot of time at the same time to release

1298
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,580
it as a JavaScript library and when how

1299
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:36,400
can use for a day that makes us excited

1300
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:38,820
performance is the most important thing

1301
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,830
in terms of what our end users have

1302
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:43,650
performance of us as developers how much

1303
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:46,110
code can we turn out in a month is what

1304
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:48,270
made us what made the web so broken

1305
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:50,490
right now it's not about how much code

1306
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:52,200
we write its how much clever code we

1307
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,930
write how much our code does to our end

1308
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:57,480
users and that also means we have to

1309
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,920
communicate much more with other

1310
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,920
departments where I found ourselves

1311
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,360
architecting wrongly as well is that we

1312
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,070
think as developers we have to do

1313
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:07,470
everything I found for example paper

1314
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:10,470
prototyping when Yahoo made us go

1315
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:10,950
through like

1316
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:12,990
five iterations of a tool before we

1317
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,609
actually build it and we spent the time

1318
00:48:14,609 --> 00:48:16,200
that people spend paid a paper

1319
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,329
prototyping with end users to write the

1320
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:21,839
data API is instead so parallel work on

1321
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,520
different parts of the interface is a

1322
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,050
very important thing we can only do that

1323
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:27,150
when we start communicating with other

1324
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,950
parts of our company and not only do

1325
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:31,079
everything in engineering talking to

1326
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:33,030
humans I know it's scary but it's a good

1327
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:35,190
thing something will come out of it and

1328
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:38,339
so kind of you say that we shouldn't

1329
00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:40,890
focus on life was too shiny new

1330
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:44,460
framework but if um how do you convince

1331
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,890
companies that even if you don't know

1332
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:50,180
framework X you're a very good developer

1333
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:54,359
mmm that is a really good question so

1334
00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:56,220
companies won't want you to see the

1335
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,690
newest and coolest all the time and they

1336
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:59,220
measure the quality of developers that

1337
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,560
way and I think that's where the whole

1338
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:06,000
hype thing went pear-shaped in terms of

1339
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,130
like in terms of how do you convince

1340
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:09,780
companies you show them how much you

1341
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,089
really know about the basics you you

1342
00:49:12,089 --> 00:49:14,369
shouldn't just guard new frameworks that

1343
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:15,900
you don't need them you should know what

1344
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,150
they are and you should know how what

1345
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:19,920
use case is there in if you come to an

1346
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,390
interview and they say look well what do

1347
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:22,680
you think about react and you say like

1348
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,240
for this kind of application that kind

1349
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,829
of stuff and that kind of things it's a

1350
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:27,869
really good idea whereas most of the

1351
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:29,430
time I would go for this kind of

1352
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:30,960
solution because then it performs better

1353
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,750
any hiring manager who has half a brain

1354
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,970
would be very excited about that answer

1355
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:39,270
so getting found in LinkedIn is a

1356
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:40,920
different story but that's also the jobs

1357
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,990
that you normally don't get I think one

1358
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:44,670
of my favorite moments was when I hired

1359
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:47,220
a javascript engineer in in Mozilla I

1360
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,500
know in yahoo begged them we gave people

1361
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,020
a drop an exercise a website to build

1362
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,609
which is illegal in California but in

1363
00:49:53,609 --> 00:49:56,190
England we could do it and the

1364
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:57,869
javascript parts of it were kind of

1365
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:00,030
tricky liver they looked very simple but

1366
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,349
I had a few mistakes in them and these

1367
00:50:01,349 --> 00:50:03,660
kind of things and the guy who came in

1368
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,970
had used all the examples from my

1369
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:07,829
javascript book and he didn't know that

1370
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:09,300
I'm the guy interviewing JavaScript

1371
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,550
developers so he came into the room and

1372
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,109
he was as wide as the wall when I came

1373
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:14,790
in he's like oh my god I'm like yeah i

1374
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:16,589
saw that code and i kind of looks

1375
00:50:16,589 --> 00:50:17,760
familiar and he's like yeah it's from

1376
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,680
your book and like what didn't you like

1377
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,930
about my code and what would you what

1378
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:23,790
would you make to better and the

1379
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:24,910
explained that I hired him

1380
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:28,000
spot there's no problem using code when

1381
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,010
you understand it when you don't

1382
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:31,630
understand and you try to impress people

1383
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:34,390
by listing five different modules and

1384
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:36,070
hoping they don't understand it either

1385
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:38,790
then we have a communication problem so

1386
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:40,990
understanding how much you use things

1387
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:42,400
for is something that more and more

1388
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,290
companies will look forward to as well

1389
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:46,990
when we get or less excited about hiring

1390
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:49,540
50 developers because company growth is

1391
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:54,280
something that TechCrunch loves all

1392
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,080
right I think we can close it here big

1393
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,730
hands for Chris and thank you so much
