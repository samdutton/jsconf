00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,099

hi everyone as as mentioned my name is

2
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:17,740
Sarah Dresner I'm if I apologize if I'm

3
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,990
coughing a little bit I don't wear

4
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,360
glasses but I'm very nerdy so I have

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,230
asthma so if I COFF a little bit while

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,680
I'm speaking that is why I am a

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,259
consultant this isn't a picture of me

8
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,719
and my mom and also my relationship to

9
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,680
Authority I'm a consultant and I used to

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,090
be a manager of UX design and

11
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,640
engineering at trulia zillow group and

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,370
now I give talks and I work for

13
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,649
companies all over the place and give

14
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:50,379
workshops speaking about things like I'm

15
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:54,879
going to speak about today so before we

16
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,460
get into any details about animation I

17
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,690
think it's important that we start from

18
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,090
the beginning what happens when you

19
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,180
visit a website every time you look at a

20
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,100
picture or anytime you look at a website

21
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,439
at all your eye isn't looking directly

22
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,899
at anything your eye is gonna constantly

23
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:13,929
move around an event called saccade and

24
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:15,219
the part of the reason why we do this

25
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:16,899
and these are heat maps of where your

26
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:18,849
eyes are looking part of the reason we

27
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:20,740
do this is to create a spatial awareness

28
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,490
of the site or of the thing that we're

29
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,740
looking at you do this so that you can

30
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,359
kind of understand your surroundings

31
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,759
biologically but it works the same way

32
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,479
on a website so why is this important

33
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,759
like why are we talking about the way

34
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,950
that our eyes look around and see these

35
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,409
things we already use this information

36
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:43,719
all the time web sites all start to look

37
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:46,060
the same because you get used to like

38
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,459
having the CTA on the right and having

39
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:50,079
the big hero image and stuff so people

40
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,939
feel comfortable when they come to their

41
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:53,889
site their know their way around they

42
00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:56,649
don't have to kind of grok all of the

43
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,029
information that you're giving them at

44
00:01:58,029 --> 00:02:00,340
once they can kind of already know what

45
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,630
they're supposed to be clicking and

46
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,749
hitting in order to engage buttons on a

47
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,819
website and CTAs become the most

48
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:09,130
powerful thing we tend to like make

49
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,319
everything else grey or green or blue

50
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:14,019
and then these like bright orange CTA so

51
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:16,450
that our users know where to click

52
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,380
because when they're gay

53
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,240
gathering all of that spatial awareness

54
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,490
looking around the site they can say Oh

55
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,220
aha like that is the piece that I need

56
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,490
right there this is also why things like

57
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,350
growth hacking happen and people are

58
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,480
like okay making the button purple like

59
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,730
it make it pop polka dot make it pulse

60
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:38,320
and like developers are like no so

61
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,700
that's why that kind of stuff happens

62
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,530
that's also why we have all these like

63
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,800
user testings to see what will work this

64
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,080
way or that way when you're scanning and

65
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,850
reading things what actually draws your

66
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,640
eye and because of this animation kind

67
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,620
of gets a bad rap because when you're

68
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,410
scanning an environment and something is

69
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,080
moving that is the most powerful thing

70
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,630
you are biologically programmed to

71
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,390
notice and take note of something that's

72
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,770
in motion if you do animation well it

73
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,110
can be really really an informative

74
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,390
experience and guide your users in a

75
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,640
really important way but if you do

76
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,890
animation poorly then it could be

77
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,020
irritating and jostling for the user so

78
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,510
in light of that let's talk about

79
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,670
animation in terms of how you can create

80
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,670
spatial awareness 'iz and be responsible

81
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,250
for your users and part of the way that

82
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,060
we're gonna do that is we're gonna

83
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,000
separate out to ideas and animation one

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,280
of them is invisible animation or ui/ux

85
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,470
animation and the other is immersive

86
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,270
animation so we're gonna speak about

87
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,470
those two things totally differently

88
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,480
because they're they're in essence

89
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,790
totally different ideas when you're

90
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,350
talking about invisible animation the

91
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,270
whole purpose of it is so that the user

92
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,520
is not thinking like oh I just had an

93
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,959
animation happen what they're thinking

94
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,540
is what it like a cohesive experience I

95
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,640
just had when you're doing an immersive

96
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,070
animation the whole point is to guide

97
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,100
the user through like an entire idea of

98
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,230
animation and we'll kind of dig into

99
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,080
each one of these things in in a lot of

100
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,730
detail but let's start with invisible

101
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,910
animation what I mean by that so UX

102
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,490
animation and UX choreography kind of

103
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,000
come together in this format so when

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,070
we're creating these mental maps a lot

105
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,900
of times when we're dealing with stuff

106
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,060
on a website the most challenging thing

107
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,070
that we have is state right that's

108
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,500
something that we work a lot with in

109
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,820
terms of like moving over

110
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,480
to react to manage state or like

111
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,920
understanding state as we manage it in

112
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,440
the Dom or understanding how the things

113
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,450
change and shift and move as a user

114
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,740
engages with our site so when you're

115
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,740
when your users are working with your

116
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,840
site and they're totally getting into it

117
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,160
and they're having this like flow based

118
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,080
experience because everything is really

119
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,330
really groovy and then all of a sudden

120
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,310
you interrupt them with like a modal or

121
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,350
something that's kind of just jarring

122
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,780
and jostling and doesn't work for your

123
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,650
experience it can completely destroy

124
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,450
what you've built for them this you

125
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,640
spent so much time creating these mental

126
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,890
maps for them and spatial awareness for

127
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,390
them and then all of a sudden you break

128
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,610
it that's bad

129
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,530
so we're connecting to different states

130
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,870
like we are here so you know a very

131
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,480
small example of this would be like the

132
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,850
one on the left where things kind of

133
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,770
just jump into view and the one on the

134
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,510
right where you kind of get a sense of

135
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,490
where things are coming from and where

136
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,040
they're going in like where the spatial

137
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,500
awareness is there so Kathy Sierra has

138
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,360
this awesome book called badass making

139
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,760
users awesome and a good talk that's

140
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,810
associated with it

141
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,370
and in it she kind of talks about these

142
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,650
cognitive leaks that can develop as we

143
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,620
structure our UIs and new X's so if

144
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,870
we're looking at something like this you

145
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,660
know burners that you might have on your

146
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,430
typical stovetop you have a bunch of

147
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,690
burners and then you have a bunch of

148
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,670
controls for the burners and you can see

149
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,800
here like it always takes me a second

150
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,020
like wait which knob is for which thing

151
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,450
but if you just restructure it a little

152
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,670
bit you can see how those cognitive

153
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,310
leaks are reduced you all of a sudden

154
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,950
just by rearranging those things are

155
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,710
giving users much more of a key for how

156
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,170
they should be working with your site so

157
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,380
I made this pen to kind of demonstrate

158
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,630
this idea so if I have this map marker

159
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,920
and I open it and then in that this

160
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,590
contact form because actually I should

161
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,890
probably turn the brightness up sorry I

162
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,310
was on an airplane that contact form

163
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,020
becomes the title and then the email

164
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,210
gets out of the way and then when I hit

165
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,160
the submit button

166
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,440
those two things become the loader which

167
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,220
then in turn becomes the success well

168
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,990
the things go on in the background and

169
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,300
then I know what what happened and what

170
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,740
is where it's going and where it's

171
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,660
coming from now when I close that down

172
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,360
it becomes the Mack marker again and if

173
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,470
I said to you later

174
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,810
where did it go where is the contact

175
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,230
form you would say oh it's in there

176
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,010
there's no in there

177
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,840
they're all just divs they've just

178
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,910
absolutely positioned things and stuff

179
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,880
all of that is just like CSS and stuff

180
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,860
like that but really what it does for

181
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,570
the user is it gives them a sense of

182
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,490
spatial awareness and what happened was

183
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,800
we went through three different screens

184
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,590
of cognitive and mental maps that you

185
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,930
would have had to create and instead of

186
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,210
making that again and again with like

187
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,980
successive modal's or successive

188
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,290
dialogues we have it all one fluid

189
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,970
experience it feels much better for the

190
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:42,360
user so it can happen in these small

191
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,710
ways too you don't have to do something

192
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,630
as big as that either this is a kind of

193
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,760
typical UX pattern right we've got like

194
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,330
you know simple like magnifying icon and

195
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,610
then when I click on it it becomes the

196
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,830
input and what's nice about this is when

197
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,190
I put it away it not only does it give

198
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,870
us that spatial awareness of like oh it

199
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,970
goes in there and make it feel a uniform

200
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,830
it also takes up a lot less space in our

201
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,390
interface right we don't have the entire

202
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,790
giant like the magnifying glass the

203
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,100
input the submit button all of those

204
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,169
things we can actually condense those

205
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:15,120
things down and make a better experience

206
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,930
for the user

207
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,980
another thing that's important is

208
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,430
isolation so if I have like in that same

209
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,860
way if I'm like scanning my environment

210
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,510
and I'm trying to make create a mental

211
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,610
map of a situation if I have to read a

212
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,010
lot of information at once it takes me a

213
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,080
lot of time it takes me if there's more

214
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,690
cognitive leaks in that idea so if I

215
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,380
like zoom in on one of these it all of a

216
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,210
sudden becomes much more easy to read

217
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,030
and for me to understand and like really

218
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,650
really process that information it's not

219
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,400
a lot more things at all to build that

220
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:56,550
in so I was thinking about this idea of

221
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,870
revealing and

222
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,790
how much I hate modal's I just hate

223
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,980
modal's it's like a weird personal

224
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,420
vendetta thing but it's not actually

225
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,510
even super personal in that Google hates

226
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,510
them too and has started to dock you

227
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,330
points if you have timed interstitials

228
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,220
on mobile so if you are one of those

229
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,110
companies that waits a few seconds and

230
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,029
then Springs a modal on you when you

231
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:21,210
look at a site Google is now gonna take

232
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,640
off SEO points so you should not do that

233
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,310
so I'm not the only one who has this

234
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,770
vendetta I I think that that is a really

235
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,110
jarring experience it breaks your

236
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,330
context you're like involved in

237
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,380
something and without triggering

238
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,170
anything this thing pops up and I would

239
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,210
call that kind of like brute force UX

240
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,740
you know you're like I want the user to

241
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,650
see this stick it in their face which is

242
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,810
not you know the most intelligent way of

243
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,930
working with the web so this is me and

244
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,029
like a really detailed picture of me

245
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:54,980
very very highly proficient and drawing

246
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,720
modal's suck but then this is also me

247
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,850
thinking about it later

248
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,580
well okay wait let's be fair it's maybe

249
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,500
not just them it's their typical UX

250
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,510
pattern I bet that there is a way of

251
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,180
investigating a modal that makes it make

252
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,220
more sense and makes it not break all of

253
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,290
these things that you set up for

254
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,540
yourself so rather than have it be x and

255
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,810
just like an attack you would have to

256
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,390
open it you would have you as the user

257
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,250
would have to engage in order to create

258
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,120
it but it comes from that button and

259
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,070
because it comes from that button I know

260
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,810
where it came from and I know where it's

261
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,670
going and it doesn't feel as jarring

262
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,990
anymore

263
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,300
sometimes I dismiss modal's right away

264
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,950
when they pop up even if I need that

265
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,350
information so in this way I can get it

266
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,200
again if I decide that I need it and I

267
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,610
know where it's coming from and I know

268
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,089
where to retrieve it so I was thinking

269
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:50,850
about this this whole idea like the

270
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,950
whole idea of how we have to bake

271
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,380
animation into an experience and that

272
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,240
animation can't just be slapped on on

273
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,400
top right like some of the examples that

274
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,310
I just showed you particularly like that

275
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,450
contact form one I couldn't have just

276
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,180
added animation at the end and that's

277
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,550
the way that a lot of PM's and a lot of

278
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,500
companies kind of deal with animation

279
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,340
they're like okay

280
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,990
let's just build the page and we'll slap

281
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,270
the animation on after but it really

282
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,620
needs to be part of the core experience

283
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,410
otherwise for the user it feels like an

284
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,050
extra thing they're waiting for so I was

285
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,460
considering this as I was in Barcelona

286
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,830
this summer and I was on this trip and I

287
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,170
was on this trip exploring a city and I

288
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,180
wanted to build out a day of activities

289
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,190
so this is kind of like a normal use

290
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,710
case I love Lonely Planet and it has

291
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,830
really good content but if I go here and

292
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,660
then there's like five steps to even get

293
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,570
to Barcelona and then there I came from

294
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,040
there I can scroll down and see the

295
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,279
sights but like okay so that's good I

296
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,230
have some content that like helps me

297
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,450
find something I'm gonna pick la Sagrada

298
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,000
família I hear that's pretty nice and I

299
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,620
look there and this is the map that they

300
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,710
have is like the site and then one thing

301
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,779
that's a pub and then one thing that's

302
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,820
like another Church but like what if I

303
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,860
want to get lunch and what if I want to

304
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,410
see another site you can't expand this

305
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,320
map at all or like engage with it

306
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,779
so then I go back and then all of a

307
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:15,810
sudden the sites look different and and

308
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,339
then I scroll down to food and drink

309
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:18,780
which also looks totally different I

310
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,670
have to scan and create a new

311
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,010
environment but then at the very bottom

312
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,780
of the page there's this map section I'm

313
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,760
like okay that's maybe that's better so

314
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,070
I have this sites but all it has those

315
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,860
sites so if I go to if I click on each

316
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,480
one it takes me to the page of la

317
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,120
Sagrada família takes me back this isn't

318
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,210
great I'd have to keep writing down

319
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:41,730
where I'm going I need food all sorts of

320
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,240
stuff so Google Maps kind of does

321
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,040
something that's similar but different

322
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,520
in its better right so we once I have la

323
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,470
Sagrada família like it won't suggest to

324
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,360
me to go to a lesser Cara familia but

325
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,190
once I know I'm gonna go there I can

326
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,900
click here and it says like search

327
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,760
nearby which is pretty great because I

328
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,530
can look for restaurants that are nearby

329
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:05,970
that area that's getting closer cool but

330
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,850
then you know if I want to look for bars

331
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,040
or pubs I lose all the context of all of

332
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,260
the restaurants that I was just at so

333
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,450
that's not so good and I can send it to

334
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,250
my phone but then I'm sending each fun

335
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,940
off to my phone so I was kind of canned

336
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,620
they also have things like reviews but

337
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,550
their content

338
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,760
unlike long

339
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,700
planet is not so great so let's consider

340
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,830
how animation can really help the user

341
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,920
and here like let's empower the user so

342
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:40,730
I built this demo which hopefully loads

343
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,330
so if you type in love for the Sagrada

344
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,970
família you go to sites then you're

345
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,250
going in between the sites and you can

346
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,170
kind of go through them and then you can

347
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,110
pick one and then you can pick food and

348
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,330
you can go the food and I could keep

349
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,600
going and pick more sites or I could

350
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,420
just pick the itinerary that I want and

351
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,760
send the whole thing to my phone that's

352
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,340
more what I want that's more what I need

353
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,890
as a user and in this animation isn't

354
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,460
like hi I'm animation look at me go in

355
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,770
this animation is key and core to the

356
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,600
experience but that's not the only thing

357
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,190
that's key in court of the experience

358
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,990
you're really thinking about the whole

359
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,780
thing from start to finish for the user

360
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,540
and not just what features you have but

361
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,430
what they are looking for and what they

362
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,480
want to make so like we can just empower

363
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,850
them in this way and that's a really

364
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,580
really awesome thing that we can do so a

365
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,070
piece of tough love here for everybody

366
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,810
who works on the web because I hear a

367
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,670
lot of hate for animation

368
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,570
do you hate animation if animation feels

369
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,700
like the sugar on top that might be

370
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,220
because you treated it that way so like

371
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,110
if you are one of those companies who

372
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,180
said okay let's wait until we have the

373
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,500
whole thing built and then we're gonna

374
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,080
put some animation on on top that is an

375
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,020
additive experience that is not core to

376
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,580
the experience that you're giving your

377
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,440
users that's something that you're doing

378
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,720
just to delight yourself which you know

379
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,460
delight is great but it's not

380
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,040
informative and animation can be

381
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,060
informative which is some of its power

382
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,250
so things to keep in consideration when

383
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,840
you're working with your own company's

384
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,820
animation as you're like we'll take

385
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,590
these lessons and learn from them and

386
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,300
want to engage and put them into your

387
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,610
site style and branding in animation is

388
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,980
just as important as style and branding

389
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,650
in like text or color and things that we

390
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,710
kind of consider often for other kinds

391
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,180
of things like if we hadn't done this

392
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,780
with text already I'd be

393
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,190
here talking about text if we hadn't

394
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,390
done it with color I'd be talking about

395
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,160
color but I think animation needs a hero

396
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,580
so we have these kind of like if you all

397
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,750
over your site you have these like

398
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,450
linear eases you can have a conformation

399
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,280
that's like a bounce and then all of a

400
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,290
sudden people on the your users are like

401
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,820
oh that was a little bit different maybe

402
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,380
I need to be paying attention to that I

403
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,480
guess that was a success screen so you

404
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,090
can use animation and like different

405
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,640
kinds of entrances and exits to really

406
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,420
call meaning there's also like this

407
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,460
thing called react motion that's really

408
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,150
awesome what it does is it allows you to

409
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,760
vana mayshen one of them and that that

410
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,380
we're gonna go into like more detail

411
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,810
about today it's going to be about

412
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,000
sequential based animation timed

413
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,140
animation that you're probably more

414
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,210
familiar with react motion is very

415
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,980
different it's like game based animation

416
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,860
it allows you to have physics and mass

417
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,260
and put that on the object and then you

418
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,030
send it on its way so it's interruptible

419
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,670
it's good for things like chat heads and

420
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,510
things like that

421
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,160
so that you can like actually have the

422
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,350
user engage with it at that moment so

423
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,390
we'll talk a little bit about tools but

424
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,920
the way that these things are moving

425
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,230
around is nine-tenths of the law

426
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,110
if they were just scooting over that

427
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,880
wouldn't be the same experience at all

428
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,580
but but because I'm playing around with

429
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,800
the way that those easing --zz work with

430
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,960
the way that those Springs work that

431
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,210
makes the whole animation experience

432
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,490
feel different and that's part of your

433
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:10,010
branding as well so if we're looking at

434
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,330
these two balls everybody has to do a

435
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,040
bouncy ball demo like if you are an

436
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,080
animator like you're just like you sit

437
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,610
down and then somebody comes into the

438
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,750
room and they say it's time for the

439
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,760
bouncy ball demo and then you have to

440
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,590
write it so this is my bouncy ball demo

441
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:25,280
the one one of these balls feels a

442
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,460
little bit more rigid and feels a little

443
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,100
bit harder and the other ball feels a

444
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,690
little bit more fluid and it's subtle

445
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,670
right it's not like over-the-top or

446
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,860
anything but these have the exact same

447
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,770
timings and the exact same heights and

448
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,420
they don't even feel like it they feel

449
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,890
like they have different timings they

450
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,060
feel like they have different structures

451
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,320
they feel like they're going to

452
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,330
different heights because of the way

453
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,490
that they're animating and so that

454
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:53,360
becomes really really important

455
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,580
a one last thing to say about style and

456
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,320
branding if you are the kind of person

457
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,510
who has a site like fidelity insurance

458
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,190
where you have like a bunch of money and

459
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,050
you're dealing with somebody's cash you

460
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,730
might want to be dealing with like more

461
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,640
responsible linear eases and like maybe

462
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,030
the hardball is like your ball but if

463
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,530
you're something like MailChimp that has

464
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,240
branding that's really playful and

465
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,370
engaging and exciting you might want to

466
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,810
step away from that and make something

467
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,460
that's a little bit more bouncy and a

468
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,650
little bit more fluid so all of the ways

469
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,910
that you work with those so you'd have

470
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,560
the bouncy ball on the ride for sure

471
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,930
so with these kind of anticipatory cues

472
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,080
if I have this form here and I'm

473
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,460
actually let's open it up in its own

474
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,460
page so if I have this form here and I

475
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,940
write my email blah blah blah and a lot

476
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,260
of times what will happen is when you

477
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,120
have a form and you submit something

478
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,740
into a form you're giving your

479
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,590
information to a website and that's kind

480
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,210
of a you know not so great experience

481
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,290
for the user

482
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,690
you have to let them know that something

483
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,270
is going on while you're doing that like

484
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,190
just having the submit button and then

485
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,960
letting them sit there and wait while

486
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,120
something happens - for a database in

487
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,830
the background is kind of harrowing for

488
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,080
them so if I hit this contact button and

489
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,590
it becomes a loader it you know feels a

490
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,180
little bit more fluid and that actually

491
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,670
took some time but I didn't feel that

492
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,220
time passing as well as much and I'm not

493
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,220
sitting there like United Airlines did

494
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,030
you take my money or not I don't know I

495
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,700
also like let them know with a big

496
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,040
bright green success screen that

497
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,690
something good happened here that's

498
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,090
great you are okay why don't you go

499
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,830
somewhere else in our site now so I'm

500
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,060
thinking about that whole fluid

501
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,920
experience going to another thing you

502
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,960
don't need to make it so big or anything

503
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,520
but just letting them know that

504
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,560
something good happened you want them to

505
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,320
feel good things like dopamine when

506
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,420
they're on your site you want them to

507
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,860
feel successful when they're on your

508
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,490
site so this is part of perceived

509
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,960
performance you might have heard of

510
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,900
perceived performance - this is like a

511
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,800
really big strength of animation so

512
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,630
anticipate anticipatory queues these

513
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,240
custom loaders biet did an experiment

514
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:05,690
and

515
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,440
that when you use like an old-timey

516
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,539
loader that everybody's seen before

517
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:14,179
people are not willing to wait as long

518
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,179
if just that that we get logo with the

519
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:20,299
tiny little dots that's not a crazy kind

520
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:22,700
of animation that's not like a an insane

521
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,350
thing to implement but people were

522
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:27,139
willing to wait twice as long for that

523
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:29,539
loader because you tell the customer

524
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:31,909
hey we care about you we made something

525
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:34,460
for you hold on a minute and that really

526
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,289
actually means a lot to the user with

527
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:37,730
all of these experiments that we're

528
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:41,419
doing another thing that's kind of nice

529
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:44,149
is if you have these perceived

530
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:46,129
performances that aren't just like out

531
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:47,600
of the box if you do something that's a

532
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,549
little bit more unusual it captures

533
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:51,649
their attention and that also doesn't

534
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:53,570
feel as long that doesn't make you feel

535
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,220
like you're waiting forever and it's an

536
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,919
amazing amazing how a few seconds it

537
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,379
takes a user to feel like you ditched

538
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:03,710
them so so even just thinking about a

539
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,919
small animation like this that really

540
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:07,850
doesn't take you like if you're using

541
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,649
something like gzip which we'll talk

542
00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:11,509
about in a second this is one line of

543
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:13,940
code that can actually really change the

544
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,679
way that your user is feeling about the

545
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,490
way that you feel about them so one of

546
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,679
the big takeaways here spatial awareness

547
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,259
is important we're trying not to break

548
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:26,059
spatial awareness because we don't want

549
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:28,940
to let our users down and you know don't

550
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,889
draw people and stuff so you know and

551
00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:36,590
like when we're creating and using these

552
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,629
kind of spatial awareness techniques we

553
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:41,210
can go from simple like we were talking

554
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,740
about here to more complex this was a

555
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,379
code drops demo so if you want to select

556
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:48,289
your seats at this theater you can see

557
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:51,350
how just with like a little bit of

558
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,080
animation you're actually letting you're

559
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,259
telling the user so much more about what

560
00:21:57,259 --> 00:21:59,000
this experience is gonna feel like for

561
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,129
them when they're in the theater and how

562
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:03,590
that's going to be for them and it's a

563
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,409
much much more engaging experience than

564
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:09,080
them just selecting their seats we can

565
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,269
also do something simple and small like

566
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:13,549
these drag and drop in interactions so

567
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:16,639
if I've got like these kind of things

568
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:18,619
where I've got to like hold a piece of

569
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:19,590
information for the

570
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,470
again if I asked somebody where did that

571
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,380
go you would say it went down there if

572
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,660
there's no down there it's a absolutely

573
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,780
position div but like knowing that they

574
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,970
know where to get it and they know where

575
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,860
it went is really helpful for them they

576
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,570
didn't have to break any kind of spatial

577
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:42,180
awareness for that so we can't really

578
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,620
talk about animation without talking

579
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,910
about performance performance is really

580
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:47,190
important because when things look janky

581
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,350
and things like stutter across the

582
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,760
screen even if you have the most

583
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,070
beautiful animation in the world people

584
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,930
are going to not feel so great about it

585
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,940
so one thing that's really important is

586
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,220
that you're using opacity and transforms

587
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,500
wherever possible you can do crazy

588
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,930
amazing stuff with just opacities and

589
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,850
transforms it's amazing what you can

590
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,430
accomplish so I know it sounds like two

591
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,050
properties that doesn't sound like much

592
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,240
but you can actually accomplish a ton of

593
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,280
things you should also be thinking about

594
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,470
hardware acceleration things like this

595
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,360
translate see hack you can even make a

596
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,460
mixin for it that you can apply or an

597
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,610
extend where you can apply it all over

598
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,960
the code base so you don't sorry write

599
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,930
it all of the time so let's take a look

600
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,390
at what that would look like so for this

601
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,640
pen we've got like a hardware

602
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,880
accelerated div moving across and a

603
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,300
control so this is the the like margin

604
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,280
I'm moving things with margins for this

605
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,570
one and I'm moving things with

606
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,670
transforms for this one I'm not sure if

607
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,650
you can see from that screen but on my

608
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,930
screen the top one is flickering and

609
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,510
kind of moving across in a really janky

610
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,580
way well the bottom one is moving very

611
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,390
very beautifully across now also if you

612
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,790
look in chrome dev tools and I say

613
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,130
something like alright let's go to more

614
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,190
tools and we're gonna go to rendering

615
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,980
I'm gonna pull this up and I'm gonna say

616
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,590
paint flashing when you when you use

617
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,510
paint flashing in the chrome dev tools

618
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,580
what's gonna be highlighted in that

619
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,500
green is anything that you're moving

620
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,170
around whether it's causing repaints so

621
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,600
you can immediately see anything that's

622
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,460
on your screen that you're not really

623
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,040
dealing with correctly so that's a

624
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,630
really nice visual cue if you're doing

625
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,700
an audit of a bunch of animations at

626
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,220
once saying okay we need help here and

627
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:32,550
we need

628
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:37,710
help here and we need help here in case

629
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,120
you were wondering if it's just me who

630
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,670
thinks this Netflix also employs all of

631
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,290
these things you can read a case study

632
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,700
about that

633
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,560
yeah they work with opacity and

634
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,420
transforms in order to animate some of

635
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,370
the very simple hover effects that they

636
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:54,960
have on their movies so all of that said

637
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,970
we kind of went into all of these like

638
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,910
how to really subtly deal with you know

639
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,980
your spatial awareness and your users

640
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,170
and getting them from here to there now

641
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,060
let's kind of break and talk about

642
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,550
something else and it's similar but

643
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,250
different in its immersive animation so

644
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,170
immersive animation would be a little

645
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,870
bit closer to like if you have a diagram

646
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:18,000
that you're trying to like show

647
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,310
something to the user explain a concept

648
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,740
you're not trying to hide the animation

649
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,780
from them that whole experience is

650
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,700
supposed to be an animation or like if

651
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,500
you think about like the big movie sites

652
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,510
where they're like the whole idea is

653
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,570
just like go watch Life of Pi and here

654
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:37,140
are lions and tigers and things so

655
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,640
that's an immersive animation they're

656
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,370
not trying to like subtly do anything

657
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,680
they're just like we're gonna wow you so

658
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,720
this is a different type of animation

659
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,070
and a different we deal with it in a

660
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,110
different way the purpose is to call

661
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,480
attention and I there's lots of

662
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,430
different ways of working with them 3je

663
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,200
yes and canvas and there's be our

664
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,940
experiences but today we're gonna focus

665
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,890
on SVG because I think it's a little bit

666
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,540
closer to what we were dealing with

667
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:04,560
before in that the typical you know web

668
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,930
developer will probably be able to work

669
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,190
with it and create something really

670
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,370
beautiful and it's got a lot of things

671
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,590
going for it one of them is that it's

672
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:16,830
got really great support SVG like has

673
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,900
kind of a bad reputation for not being

674
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,790
well supported I do consulting work with

675
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,740
a lot of different companies and one of

676
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,970
the first things they say to me is

677
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,070
always like oh well but SVG isn't

678
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,320
supported but look at all that green I

679
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,630
think it kind of crept up on us we have

680
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,670
this like old idea that it has poor

681
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,140
support but it doesn't anymore

682
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,330
so we should take advantage of that you

683
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,370
probably know these things already but

684
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,840
I'm just going to go over them just

685
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,790
really quickly to talk about some of the

686
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,130
things I love about SVG it's crisp on

687
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,380
every any display for anybody who's had

688
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,390
do like image replacement for retina and

689
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,250
things like that you don't have to slice

690
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,800
a million images the picture element is

691
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,230
great but you still have to make all of

692
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,180
these different images and cut them all

693
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,800
up and you know make sure that they're

694
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,420
all like working properly and your

695
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,800
polyfill is working properly you don't

696
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,570
have to do that with SVG you have one

697
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,700
graphic because of that there's less

698
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,800
HTTP requests to handle and in some

699
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,860
cases no requests to handle because you

700
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,960
can have it in line and then you're not

701
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,900
making any requests at all and the thing

702
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,670
that's the fastest request is no

703
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:21,330
requests so it's also easily scalable

704
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,950
for responsive we're gonna talk about

705
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,530
that a bit that's probably one of my

706
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,970
favorite parts of this and that's

707
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,160
probably part part of the reason why it

708
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,310
has gotten so much giant popularity

709
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,030
lately

710
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,460
that's a really really important one and

711
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,290
it can be a really small file size if

712
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,610
you design for performance

713
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,410
if you design for performance is a

714
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,690
really important concept here not all

715
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,670
designs are gonna be created equal you

716
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,890
can't just like throw massive things in

717
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:48,840
there it's built with math which is

718
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,630
really awesome you can do such crazy

719
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,700
things with it and very unique things

720
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,190
with it but if you load it up it's not

721
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,660
like a bitmap where you're just like

722
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,970
pixel pixel pixel pixel you have to pay

723
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,050
attention to what you're actually

724
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:05,100
putting in there it offers a navigable

725
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,560
Dom which is super awesome because it's

726
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,810
easy to animate you already know the Dom

727
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,060
adding a class to something and then

728
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,610
animating it is stuff that you already

729
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,560
know you don't have to learn any new

730
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,750
material in order to animate pieces of

731
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,930
an SVG and it's easy to make accessible

732
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,990
how cool is that you can have a creative

733
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:28,170
crazy immersive experience with data

734
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,640
visualization and lots of information

735
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,490
and it can be accessible to screen

736
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,800
readers that's one of my favorite parts

737
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,990
like you no longer just have these

738
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,610
images with alt tags you can actually

739
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,310
have them looking for bits that you want

740
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,680
them to or go over the whole thing if

741
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,620
you don't want them to so you know I

742
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,060
hear a lot of times people say like

743
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,580
flash is dead but we really miss it and

744
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,730
well you know I kind of think SVG

745
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,740
animation is more fun than Flash I I

746
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,720
think like people kind of got stuck in

747
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,940
the like oh flash was so good at all

748
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,039
lista but there's so many capabilities

749
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,169
that we have now with SVG animation that

750
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:06,509
people haven't even tapped into so what

751
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:08,820
is it good for it's good for interactive

752
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,799
and immersive animations it's good for

753
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,679
narrative it's good for UI UX animations

754
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,090
like the ones that you just saw like

755
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,279
that morphing pin it's great for

756
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,350
prototyping because it's easy like the

757
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,850
designer gives you a sketch in that

758
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:24,450
sketch is the webpage that's great and

759
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,799
it's really awesome for data

760
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,389
visualizations because it's built with

761
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:31,440
math so if we're looking at this pen in

762
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:56,330
terms of narrative

763
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,680
there's a lot that you can do just with

764
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,930
one image and picture and just by moving

765
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,760
some text around in terms of

766
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,040
communicating a story and in terms of

767
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,840
making an engaging experience for the

768
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,740
user actually Sarah Sweden showed this

769
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,330
my demo I had a conference and then she

770
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,550
was like oh how many introverts are out

771
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:20,570
there raise your hand and like nobody so

772
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,580
hmm what's really really cool about it

773
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,470
too is that it can be responsive so if

774
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,120
I'm gonna do like a book of Kelly I

775
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,410
don't know if you any of you have heard

776
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,670
of book of kells so these beautiful

777
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:33,090
illuminated manuscripts and they did

778
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,800
these like initial illustrations so they

779
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,450
take the first letter and they make it

780
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,790
kind of beautiful so I decided to make a

781
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,460
modern-day book of kells and so this

782
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,470
would be like the desktop version and

783
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,780
then this is the tablet version and then

784
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,190
this is the mobile version so you can

785
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,230
see it gets like less and less visually

786
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,660
complex and you know kind of adjusts to

787
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,580
each viewport in that way so that's the

788
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,100
design when I when I poured it over to

789
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,800
like create the actual SVG I make a

790
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,750
sprite out of it because I'm saying like

791
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,690
okay well I see some repeated things

792
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,600
between the like desktop and the tablet

793
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,620
version and I can just change the

794
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,810
background with a color change like just

795
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:12,660
a media query that's pretty easy I'll

796
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,160
slap some classes on some of the

797
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,450
repeated elements and I'll hide and

798
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,400
display them with media queries just the

799
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,500
way that we're used to and then I can

800
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,410
have this like this other piece and I'll

801
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,300
use the view box which is a really

802
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,240
awesome tool that SVG has to just hide

803
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,660
and display pieces of that sprite as it

804
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,090
changes so then I can have something

805
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:40,730
like this where it's like an animated

806
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:44,460
effects and it goes all the way down and

807
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,380
then we have this kind of book of kells

808
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,130
that changes and what's nice about this

809
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:53,700
is that whole animation and SVG

810
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,090
everything and the text was 8 kilobytes

811
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:01,080
gzipped so compare that to using text

812
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,330
and image to tell a story like big

813
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,220
photos that everybody is using all over

814
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,870
the place that are really huge

815
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,790
performance hits for websites you can

816
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,080
make something in

817
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,740
gauging informative interesting and that

818
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,460
can be in performance and you could be

819
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,649
accessible all of these things you don't

820
00:32:19,649 --> 00:32:21,419
have to compromise anything I think a

821
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,039
lot of times when people see something

822
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,809
kind of interesting on the web they

823
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,250
think like oh we have to compromise

824
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,779
something in order to get there

825
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,260
you don't have to compromise anything so

826
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,149
we'll talk a little bit about green sock

827
00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:35,010
I won't be able to go into tons of

828
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,390
detail because I don't have tons of time

829
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,669
but it's a really good tool for working

830
00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:41,730
with SVG animation one of my favorite

831
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,380
reasons for working with green sock and

832
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,880
probably the reason why I talk about it

833
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,769
so much is because it's I don't work for

834
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:49,830
them by the way it's because it solves

835
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:52,049
cross browser inconsistencies there's a

836
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:53,610
lot of weirdnesses that you'll get in

837
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,570
Safari and especially Safari and Firefox

838
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,490
and stuff and this really really helps

839
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:03,480
solve all of those I still doesn't

840
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,880
support transforms on SVG ie get it

841
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,809
together seriously if you if you want to

842
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:11,429
go vote for this they'd like definitely

843
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:13,799
do I should have put a link to that in

844
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,690
the slides or something but definitely

845
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,580
go vote for support for transforms and

846
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,450
SVG it also offers a timeline which is

847
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,940
super great because you can stack tweens

848
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,590
you can set them a little before and

849
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,519
after one another

850
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:27,870
you can change their placement in time

851
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,940
you can group them into scenes you can

852
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,519
add relative labels you can animate your

853
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:36,450
animations and you can make the whole

854
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,950
thing faster and move the placement of

855
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,110
the whole thing and nest everything so I

856
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:43,080
think it is like an incredible tool for

857
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,909
animation and what's really nice about

858
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:45,929
it is you can do it without

859
00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:46,799
recalculation

860
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,169
I love CSS and I did the last pen and

861
00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:52,230
CSS but the issue with it is sometimes

862
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,820
these recalculations because like let's

863
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,830
say I have two animations that have to

864
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,690
fire at the same time and someone says

865
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,880
okay make that one a little bit smaller

866
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,070
and I have a bunch of delays after it I

867
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,870
have a bunch of chain defects I didn't

868
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,570
have to go back and figure out like all

869
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,210
redo all of the math for all of those

870
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,250
and figure out all the delays for both

871
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,760
and it's kind of a pain but in with gzip

872
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,129
and JavaScript it's a lot easier to work

873
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:18,990
with your you're changing one value

874
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,929
instead of 10 so anytime you're working

875
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,500
with like a small

876
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,409
bit of ui/ux animation I think CSS is

877
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:28,090
great anytime you have to chain

878
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,740
something or make something more complex

879
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,480
and you get beyond three chaining x' i

880
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,070
really suggest working working with

881
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,679
something like g sap and javascript so

882
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,990
we have this pen to kind of demonstrate

883
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,790
I'll actually open this in another

884
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:42,490
window so I made this like this kind of

885
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,710
animation and this one thing fires a few

886
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:47,440
times and it kind of goes around and

887
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,320
just to show you how the timeline works

888
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,960
I can call a function for that and then

889
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,909
I can call it repeated times on that

890
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:58,870
timeline and then I can have that like

891
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:03,700
first section and it goes here and then

892
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,010
I can have like that other section and

893
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,780
that's plotted to this point and the

894
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,640
timeline you can see it so I probably

895
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,170
don't need to narrate it for you but

896
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:14,200
it's kind of fun anyway so you have a

897
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,150
menu of this next section and it gets it

898
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,370
it's put here so I can actually just

899
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:21,160
then just change the order of them in

900
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,550
one line of code and have the whole

901
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:29,370
thing run in a different direction or I

902
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:32,320
could say okay it just wasn't fast

903
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,670
enough so I just want to make it a bunch

904
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:37,450
faster and in one line of code that's

905
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:40,330
like totally achievable so that's really

906
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:42,340
powerful and makes working with

907
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,320
animation a lot less tangled and

908
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,850
confusing so the other cool thing about

909
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:52,510
SVG is we can do fully fully scalable

910
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,070
and responsive stuff because you're what

911
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,210
you're doing is you're working within

912
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,980
the SVG Dom so even if you're plotting

913
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,140
with transforms it's working within that

914
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,310
SVG Dom structure so I can make this any

915
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,820
size and it's gonna stay totally stable

916
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,440
absolutely stable which is obviously

917
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,230
like really huge boon to responsive

918
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,120
development I can just keep replaying

919
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,740
this and making it different sizes

920
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,690
that's pretty cool

921
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,550
but you know our anime are like

922
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,560
interfaces aren't just squishy they

923
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,970
don't just like squish back and forth

924
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:24,100
but let's implement a bit of responsive

925
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,560
design here so if we design interactions

926
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,270
into responsive animations we're gonna

927
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,570
make a huggy laser panda Factory yes as

928
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:34,150
was mentioned before you know like you

929
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,260
have in real life

930
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,480
hardly Laser panda factories

931
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,000
so we have the desktop version here in

932
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,160
the mobile version here and you can see

933
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,990
that there's like different sections to

934
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,190
this so they're kind of like Legos

935
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:48,640
here's one here's another this one is

936
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,890
this one but it's just flipped around to

937
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:53,080
stack and then they kind of nest in

938
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,510
there and we have different timelines

939
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:58,570
and those timelines are scoped exactly

940
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:01,630
to those design pieces like Legos - so

941
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,210
our code is scoped like our design is

942
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:06,160
and if I have to adjust something I know

943
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,320
exactly where to go in that illustrator

944
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,730
document and I know exactly where to go

945
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,590
in my code it keeps everything really

946
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,540
nice and neat and organized and very

947
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:17,110
simple so if we have like this and we

948
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,600
have the factory so I click this and he

949
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,420
becomes like lasered and he's evil and

950
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,420
then we have this any beak-like becomes

951
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,660
a panda and then we do this and he's

952
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,090
like all of a sudden I'm very huggy and

953
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:34,750
I can scroll my browser window down and

954
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,840
it reconfigures and it still works

955
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:43,900
perfectly on mobile and this all was

956
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,060
like 12 kilobytes gzipped

957
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,940
so that's kind of fun and kind of

958
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,920
interesting and there's a lot of stuff

959
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,170
that we can do on the web that we have

960
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,810
not done yet that is really engaging and

961
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:58,210
exciting part of you know I mentioned

962
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,550
accessibility accessibility is a giant

963
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,650
thing here I could have like gone

964
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,660
through and labeled each one of the

965
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,060
things that I was just firing off and to

966
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,010
tell the story of the Panda to people

967
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,870
who need a screen reader I can also say

968
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,760
something like roll presentation and

969
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,510
have it skip over that whole SVG Dom if

970
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,430
you are gonna use things like titles do

971
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,190
remember to use things like IDs this

972
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,250
isn't just about SVG or anything that's

973
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,410
that's like an important thing for you

974
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,380
to note when you say Aria labeled by

975
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,690
title it's a lot easier for jaws and

976
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:35,410
NVIDIA to find the title here and it's

977
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,820
also important to have the language on

978
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,110
there too so that people in different

979
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,790
countries can actually have it be

980
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,250
translated so I'm not going to go into

981
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,080
giant details about accessibility again

982
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,640
because we don't have time but there's a

983
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,620
resource here with support charts and

984
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,990
this article by Heather is really really

985
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,619
awesome and

986
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,989
CSS tricks and she goes into like every

987
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:55,779
kind of SVG and how to make all of them

988
00:38:55,779 --> 00:38:58,420
accessible so that's a really great

989
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,559
resource I think she went to the library

990
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:02,410
like every Sunday testing everything on

991
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,969
every device that she put a ton of time

992
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:05,349
and effort into it so you should

993
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:06,849
definitely use that resource and make

994
00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:15,190
good use of it so I made a game we're

995
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:20,170
gonna play it real quick so there's this

996
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:23,440
elephant he's pretty good tacos but his

997
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,039
friends keep texting him to change plans

998
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:29,319
even though he just wants to tacos and

999
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:30,880
so you have to like play this game and

1000
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,010
try not to get hit by the text messages

1001
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:36,740
there's a margarita attitude so it's

1002
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,980
based off of real-life events of this

1003
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:44,000
hipster elephant and all of this was

1004
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,130
built with SVG and react and you can

1005
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,020
kind of see this like art leader up here

1006
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,990
is gonna change as I get like more and

1007
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:56,420
less and yeah if you lose you like you

1008
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,430
become hangry and you have to go see a

1009
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:02,810
movie that you've already seen before so

1010
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,020
all of this stuff was created with web

1011
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,100
technologies it was created with react

1012
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,780
it was created with SVG and was created

1013
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,930
with green sock how did we use SVG here

1014
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,940
we used it three ways we did it just

1015
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,950
directly in line for things that were

1016
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,750
looping across we had things like

1017
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,369
background images for stuff like the

1018
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:20,540
tacos that we're gonna always stay the

1019
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,609
same size and we had it in line and

1020
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:24,640
react and I'll show you why we did

1021
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,200
here's a heart meter even if you're not

1022
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,580
familiar with react I'll walk you

1023
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,050
through it's not gonna be a lot of code

1024
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,420
here we have this thing called width in

1025
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,840
this SVG for this rect and it's passing

1026
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,300
down that's not prop score and what that

1027
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,700
that this dot prop score is doing is

1028
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,010
telling it what our score is and it's

1029
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,859
gonna update that width so what's cool

1030
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:48,710
about SVG since it's drawn with math is

1031
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,330
that when you have something like a

1032
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:52,520
rectangle all you have is a width a

1033
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,340
height an X and a Y value so if I say

1034
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:58,640
something like 250 for the width it

1035
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,160
updates and makes the line longer that's

1036
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,410
makes it really easy to work with and

1037
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:06,140
just like update and change so that's

1038
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,270
really really cool and that's why we can

1039
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:10,160
use something like that very very easily

1040
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,720
for the web how do we animate things we

1041
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,820
animated them four ways we did G SAP

1042
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,980
looping the green sock G stop looping

1043
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,440
functions outside of react for like the

1044
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,270
clouds and things we had

1045
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:25,850
requestanimationframe to see if things

1046
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,400
hit each other we had green sock for

1047
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,650
keys app for key press events and those

1048
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,240
key press events are just native key

1049
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,340
press events and then we had a repeating

1050
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,170
callbacks for the tacos and margaritas

1051
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:39,140
you know your regular repeating taco

1052
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,500
callback and we're just having it go

1053
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,960
again and again so this is like a G SAP

1054
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,390
function where when it finished

1055
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,640
it's gonna pass those parameters again

1056
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,170
so that they can move across the screen

1057
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,420
again and the code is actually pretty

1058
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:59,660
simple to create a fun game so this is

1059
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,930
smoke with SVG I think I'm showing you

1060
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,760
this because I think people tend to

1061
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,770
think of SVG is only being these like

1062
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:09,890
linear kind of like platonic shapes and

1063
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,840
that you can't do a lot of like really

1064
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,150
fun and beautiful things with it but

1065
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:16,430
with things like filters and things like

1066
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:19,220
gradients you can create really ethereal

1067
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:23,390
and elemental effects Chris Chris here

1068
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,670
in the audience invented SVG so he's

1069
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:32,090
making faces at me right now you can

1070
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,040
also make things like candles you can

1071
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,990
make things morph and change you can

1072
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:38,720
make all sorts of beautiful effects that

1073
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,780
actually look earthly with something

1074
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,400
that is built in math and I think that

1075
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,280
is just super cool so I'm showing you

1076
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,080
all of that to let you know that the web

1077
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,450
has so much potential and we've only hit

1078
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,370
the tip of the iceberg there's so many

1079
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,920
things that we can do without

1080
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,150
sacrificing performance without

1081
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:58,300
sacrificing engagement without

1082
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,340
sacrificing accessibility in fact making

1083
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,740
accessibility better so even all

1084
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,930
technologies by recombining them and by

1085
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:07,340
thinking about them in a different way

1086
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,530
and by thinking about our users we can

1087
