1
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:21,400

you

2
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,529


3
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,440
hello

4
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:35,470
with any better hello hey so the tight

5
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,910
the title of the talks changed a little

6
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,700
bit that was originally representing

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,350
microwave and sling microworld it's no

8
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,110
revisiting Wendell managers hey when I

9
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,590
originally submitted the talk proposal I

10
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,390
I hadn't written a line of code but I

11
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,070
had that had an idea of what I wanted to

12
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,949
present and I got to work a couple

13
00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:57,129
months later as always happens with your

14
00:00:57,129 --> 00:00:58,750
own ideas they they they kind of take on

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,020
a life of their own and it morphed into

16
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,869
a rather than something like logo it

17
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:06,670
turns into something more like a window

18
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:12,759
manager so I I have a love-hate

19
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:16,390
relationship with it with the desktop in

20
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,979
one hand I love using the mouse I love

21
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:21,220
the idea of of the the affordances you

22
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,960
get from looking at an interface right

23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,280
in front of you graphically rather than

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,450
having to explore it as using the

25
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,149
terminal and at the same time I'm

26
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:29,830
constantly frustrated by the

27
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,920
capabilities that and modern desktop

28
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,090
environments gave us and I find them

29
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,080
clunky I don't like the way you interact

30
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,190
with things I don't like the way

31
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,150
applications exchange data or don't

32
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,430
change they don't exchange data for that

33
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,280
matter so quickly bit what I want to go

34
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,100
over and some of the key things I

35
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,920
dislike of a desktop environment and

36
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,750
then suggest a few maybe improvements

37
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,340
that that we could implement in the

38
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,090
future so the first ones when the

39
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,100
organization it's setting up your

40
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,649
workspace and one of you start like

41
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:10,360
whenever I start working on a project

42
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,370
you open up your text editor can maybe

43
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,380
open a couple of terminal tabs you put

44
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,820
your browser over to the right or maybe

45
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,130
to the left and then you called away and

46
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,170
then that's all good you close it down

47
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,750
and you've wasted all this time setting

48
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,390
it all up you've got to move you're

49
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,500
going to nudge the windows about you can

50
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,549
take your hand off the keyboard you've

51
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:32,110
got to move the mouse and it's all about

52
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,329
it's a little bit frustrating so why not

53
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:39,220
treat the desktop is a malleable space

54
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,290
just right rather than thinking about

55
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,060
booting windows on the desktop consider

56
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,099
the desktop as being a space that you

57
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,930
can you can bend to your well so we can

58
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,670
actually take a knife through it and we

59
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,129
split it in half split it again you

60
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,290
split it again even if you want to go

61
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,819
all the way through you can just split

62
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:56,650
up the whole thing and then the whole

63
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,359
thing can be resized and each window

64
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:00,609
you've created can be going to resize

65
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:03,459
them dependently and then you can summon

66
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:07,480
your your tasks and to here to get to

67
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:14,990
get your job done so that's one thing

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,250
bigger applications we used bigger

69
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,709
applications every day you've got web

70
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:22,889
browser as we get Photoshop we get emacs

71
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:25,419
all these applications that do tons of

72
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:27,280
stuff and very often you just want to do

73
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,319
one little thing and you think I'd be

74
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,519
great if I could just take that one

75
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,319
little piece of functionality from this

76
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,569
application and use it use it by itself

77
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:38,799
so let's try implementing something like

78
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:45,189
that let's make maybe a text editor so

79
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:50,139
we'll split the work space here we got a

80
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:53,709
text editor component and we can have a

81
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:56,440
command bar and I'm going the two

82
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,530
together so rather than having a single

83
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,159
application we have small chunks of a

84
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,579
functionality that can tail blocks what

85
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,760
to do I can't clean a visual programming

86
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,919
now I'm unprepared and I haven't got a

87
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:30,010
fail to play about with here so

88
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,120
so there we go we've we've hooked it up

89
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,009
and know we've taught there the

90
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:35,300
application how to how to load the

91
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,030
contents of a fail and what what have

92
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,280
you wanted a like a buff a list of your

93
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,229
open files of your if you're working on

94
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:43,639
a bigger project again what we do is we

95
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:46,729
just split the space and will say well

96
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:49,610
let's have some history in here and

97
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,740
we'll connect make the relevant

98
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,509
connections I know next thing we open a

99
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:57,280
file they as itself to the list and

100
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,419
double-clicking it again a double

101
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:03,800
clicking it should reopen it if you hook

102
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,479
it up correctly so there's another

103
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,340
another example and we can we can do so

104
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,599
we can do something similar if we could

105
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:13,759
we could we could replace the text

106
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:21,380
editor where the browser component hook

107
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,870
the two together and dad want a wife I

108
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,520
hope you can trust me that I actually

109
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:37,840
works um so that's an ass another um

110
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,949
frustration I have a desktop to the fact

111
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:43,909
we can't completely compose chunks of

112
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,529
functionality as you would do maybe on

113
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:47,750
the console or in the terminal if they

114
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,870
easy to create pipelines whereas

115
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,889
traditionally in a graphical environment

116
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:57,139
you're stuck with what you've got makes

117
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:02,930
frustration recall so it kind of ties in

118
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,090
with the first point of a building up

119
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,120
your workspace but it seems two strikes

120
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,610
me is absolutely ludicrous a nest in age

121
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,349
that once we've set up a workspace

122
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:13,789
there's no way of just saying give me

123
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:15,800
that same thing back you know you were

124
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,120
working on all these files you set up

125
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,349
your box base is out the way you wanted

126
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:19,729
that why can't you the next time you

127
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:22,610
turn on your machine just have it being

128
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,259
exactly the same way all say it's all

129
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:28,159
state saved so what we can do here is

130
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:32,120
introduced the concept of macros and so

131
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,370
going back to our browser example you

132
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,080
can save that quebec by clicking the

133
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,720
Save button and

134
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,340
again we can split the work space and de

135
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,370
for and this time we just say well give

136
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,990
it that we've got a new macro appeared

137
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,730
here you could just see give me that

138
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,300
browser back and we can afford them that

139
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,610
all work independently and if we inspect

140
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,630
the way they've been connected together

141
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,940
we see each one's got its own one set of

142
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:14,390
connections scripts ability so modern

143
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,330
desktop desktop environments they treat

144
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,740
the Wendell the windows are very opaque

145
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,990
you've got your window manager and it it

146
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,240
just gives a block of video memory to

147
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,040
your to your application your

148
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,630
application just draws jaws its wedges

149
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,430
and it's got this complex object model

150
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,920
represents those wedges but then once

151
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,270
it's rendered onto the onto the screen

152
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,030
not like that representation is gone

153
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:42,580
you're just stuck with um the raw bitmap

154
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,830
hey whereas if they're if the window

155
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,480
manager had a greater a notion of what

156
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,800
what what these components actually

157
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,890
represent a it would be possible to

158
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,430
disrupt it through chords soft for

159
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:06,770
example we can set up a text editor you

160
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,330
will have to text editor talking to each

161
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,660
other and what we can do is we can have

162
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,020
the concept for a mark so we've got a

163
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,760
solid get cursor that we can we can

164
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,430
click about and by clicking on a part of

165
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,290
the screen we see this is where I want

166
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:26,470
any future messages to be sent so I'll

167
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,630
target the pane on the right and then

168
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:44,040
the pin on the left

169
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:49,000
so so there you go so by selecting by

170
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,430
highlighting some system command within

171
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,470
the left-hand window and executing it we

172
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,740
then caused an actions appear on the

173
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,230
window that we targeted we could

174
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,079
actually target itself and enter it and

175
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:05,290
I would hopefully replace the active

176
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:15,880
document the reinvention I mean we've

177
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,470
all seen output applications like

178
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:23,940
netbeans Eclipse them and they all have

179
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,769
they all the implement the same things

180
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:29,940
they've got tabs they've got five views

181
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,300
they've got um there but we are docking

182
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,829
frameworks for moving a little sub

183
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:39,519
Wendell's about and despite all the work

184
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,690
that's gone into these things their

185
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,790
stems are still incredibly inflexible if

186
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,230
I'm using an instance of eclipse and

187
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,910
decidable I want to eat I want to look

188
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,920
at something in Firefox there's no way

189
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,920
for me to inject a Firefox instance in

190
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,570
there so why is this we should be able

191
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,440
to again cutting up our area too well to

192
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,779
what we want I'm just using a gesture

193
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:11,600
say will give me some tabs here oops

194
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,870
give me a file system west here text

195
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,720
editor and what we're doing is we're

196
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,910
customizing the space to exactly what we

197
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,190
need for that the task at hand rather

198
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,079
than accepting the the functionality

199
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:26,820
that we've been given by the big

200
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,410
inflexible applications that work that

201
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:38,519
we've got shearing so a comment

202
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,290
frustration you've got you've got 22

203
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,390
you're working with not with two out to

204
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,370
desktop applications and the right

205
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,060
beside each other on the screen but you

206
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,880
can't get data from one to the other

207
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,529
it's like there's they might as well be

208
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:55,290
in different countries um you know we're

209
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,529
aware as us most of us assume or UNIX

210
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:00,390
users we've got we've got less wealth of

211
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,800
primitives we normally were to be used

212
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,690
to using for passing data between

213
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,750
processes we've got pipes we've got

214
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,970
system 5 IPC we've got the main sockets

215
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,380
we've got all this but when it comes to

216
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,570
a graphical user interfaces all we've

217
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,450
got is save as we have to save the file

218
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,490
and if we're lucky the other thing will

219
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:24,240
reopen it and and I've just I've just

220
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,579
actually done the top for the next slide

221
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:31,050
so just yeah but well carry on on this

222
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,519
theme with their that there's no way to

223
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,630
to get these two applications to

224
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,550
communicate whereas what we really want

225
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,490
to be doing is having the two talks each

226
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,579
other directly so what could you do

227
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,600
about this so let's start with our a

228
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,769
browser that we saved earlier and I'll

229
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:53,910
get rid of that because we don't want

230
00:11:53,910 --> 00:12:03,280
that and we'll go and look at

231
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,160
so

232
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,300
they've got a wee diary if they might

233
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,829
have sleep 5 managed to get over the

234
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:15,300
last week and now what we work what

235
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,529
we've got we've got this this data on a

236
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:17,910
web page but we want to do something to

237
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,430
that data now I've encountered the

238
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,139
situation loads of times on my life as a

239
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:23,490
freelancer where people want a scrape

240
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,560
data off a website and only what you do

241
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,910
is you'll goes curl and you'll copy

242
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,399
Attila your your local system and then

243
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,540
you'll run it through some sort of

244
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,949
script that works track some data and

245
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:34,260
then you'll turn to csv file or

246
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,760
something why should we have to do that

247
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:52,649
why can't we say well oops oops hook it

248
00:12:52,649 --> 00:13:03,519
up and see kree the document

249
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:06,740
and if we want to get they say that the

250
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,959
second column we could just give it a

251
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,310
little creed ii to run and we go and

252
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,480
then all that all the data just goes

253
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,550
from one process and to another they

254
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,810
will notice there we've got that theta

255
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,370
isn't particularly useful because it's

256
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,220
it's come out as HTML elements whereas

257
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,999
what we really want our numbers so let's

258
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:29,720
split this up again sculpt something

259
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,389
called the sculpts process which is kind

260
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:35,059
of our general purpose transformer when

261
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:37,699
one when one task doesn't issue data in

262
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:40,459
the right format we can put one of these

263
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:44,209
in the middle and we just tell it how to

264
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:45,949
change what it gets given which in this

265
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:54,589
case is a table cell and there we go

266
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:56,930
we've got another another say eventually

267
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,459
is underneath on the list they give this

268
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:01,069
extract those numbers as numbers and to

269
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:03,499
enter a table that we can then take one

270
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:05,389
later and manipulate we could it's easy

271
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:06,470
to see how we could do aggregate

272
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,319
operations on that or how we could maybe

273
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:11,269
export it to a variable honest and a

274
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:17,360
script or something okay so the final

275
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,139
the final frustration is well that it

276
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:27,800
was actually IPC was what I just covered

277
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,800
and I'm going on to sharing but sharing

278
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,800
so if I'm I'd say i've been working on a

279
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:43,500
really important document text

280
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:47,580
I was up all night writing that note

281
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,720
I've written this document no he won't

282
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,160
if you want to if you want to show

283
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,010
this with a friend there's various ways

284
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,390
you could do it if you're the less

285
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,920
technical I tintable will save it as a

286
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,810
file that upload it to their email and

287
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,270
then they'll send it as an attachment if

288
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,710
you're a bit more technical tire you

289
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,910
might save it to your hard drive and

290
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,530
then start but we local web server and

291
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,520
share the URL you might upload it to ftp

292
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,700
but this text document it's not just

293
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,560
stuff I wouldn't go into a file it's a

294
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,270
data source in itself so why can't we

295
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:26,860
just say give me an HTTP server and

296
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,240
serve the contents of the file and then

297
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:41,980
if we go and visit it on

298
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,700
we'll see we get we get the content

299
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,020
coming up so we haven't had the bones to

300
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,730
desk there we've just taken our

301
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,500
environment and asked the environment to

302
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,140
work work to our needs rather than I was

303
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,180
um to worker in limitations of the tools

304
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:04,399
that we've been given so why the 80s why

305
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,930
my what was this obsession I've got with

306
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,570
the 80s anyway why not

307
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:16,540
um the 80s I mean the 80s are mostly

308
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,560
known for bad news and worse fashion but

309
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,050
there it's also for me it was it's maybe

310
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,940
the closing of one of the golden golden

311
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,340
ages of maybe research into experimental

312
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,410
programming languages and environments

313
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,690
you know it really the heyday of

314
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,080
environments like small talk self box

315
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,720
our Oberon all these and all these

316
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,430
environments were these were all created

317
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,130
in the late 70s early 80s late towards

318
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,950
the late 80s how all this amazing stuff

319
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,220
that was both this disappeared for 20

320
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,900
years and that now is starting to make a

321
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,920
reappearance and the 1i have plundered

322
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,020
the most from is over on Oberon's are

323
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,250
it's an operating system but not an

324
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,840
operating system like we'd probably know

325
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,660
it today it's a saying it wrong it all

326
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,630
runs in a single process so it's really

327
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:11,740
just the colonel it's single-threaded it

328
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,520
has an event loop and it manages a bunch

329
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,370
of recursively lado rectangles I might

330
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,329
sound familiar it's it's very like a

331
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:25,570
browser it was all written by by two

332
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:28,990
guys one Nicholas worth and somebody

333
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:34,990
else and as I this I don't know his name

334
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,140
thori and there's a fantastic book on it

335
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,840
there um if you can read that URL it's

336
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,810
um the book actually contains the entire

337
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,790
source code for the operating system so

338
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,680
it's a 400-page book but more than half

339
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,110
of that is called but it's what what's

340
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,790
amazing about it is how simple the code

341
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,840
is so it mean obviously they were

342
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,220
liberating at a time what he didn't have

343
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,200
these complicated machines but the the

344
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,630
the serious beauty and the simplicity of

345
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:05,080
how it all falls together so what's the

346
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,740
goal of what I'm doing here I'm trying

347
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,970
to create more what I have termed

348
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,620
disposable ad-hoc computational spaces

349
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,480
sounds like a mouthful but really what

350
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,180
I'm what I want to do is I want an

351
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,290
environment i'm not interested in

352
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,580
creating something that can be polished

353
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,800
i'm not for a minute seeing you could

354
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,370
use this to

355
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,260
three world-class applications that's

356
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,900
just not the goal the goal is that a lot

357
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,570
of the time you've got you have ideas

358
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,480
and there's all this boilerplate in the

359
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,850
way on acting upon your ideas you know

360
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,730
if you want to if you want to do some 3d

361
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,110
you've got to say I set up a WebGL

362
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,490
context then you've got to find a

363
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,350
library that works if you want to talk

364
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,180
to nard we know we've got to download

365
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,710
the software and then install the rate

366
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,820
libraries for the peripherals that are

367
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,890
correct connected to your machine if you

368
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,470
want to if you want to make a website

369
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,000
you've got it you've got to download all

370
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,230
that you've got to start with with your

371
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,600
you know your template HTML document and

372
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,760
install all that your style sheets and

373
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,500
you're a bootstrap and whatever anyone's

374
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,540
using these days where does what you

375
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,500
really want to do is you want to verify

376
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,210
if the idea is possible if it's feasible

377
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,470
if it's something you want to work on

378
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,670
properly for something that's worth

379
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,200
going to the effort to do all that work

380
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,620
that can a ramp up for and that's there

381
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,420
that's that's the goal behind the system

382
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,160
that we're building not i'm not

383
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,260
interested in the underlying elegance

384
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,840
the idea here isn't to create lots of

385
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,240
little components that do really cute

386
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,290
things and then have to assemble

387
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,790
hundreds of them to get something useful

388
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,500
we're trying to find that pragmatic

389
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,210
middle grounds where we get these

390
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:36,100
components that are there are useful for

391
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,990
specific tasks and themselves and if

392
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,730
they're not it doesn't matter if there's

393
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,200
a bit of overlap and functionality here

394
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,820
and there what's useful what the point

395
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,170
is is that you can actually just just

396
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,450
use them and finally I don't care about

397
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,040
performance I mean this this is all

398
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,950
implemented in JavaScript it's not for

399
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,360
rain world-class games it's not for made

400
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,870
in bitcoins it's for it's just purely

401
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:59,170
for experimentation why do it in

402
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,510
JavaScript well we've got there the

403
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,920
hierarchical display model that I

404
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,840
alluded to earlier it's great for I mean

405
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,450
you can see the minister slideshow

406
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,010
itself is running inside that the same

407
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,700
the same system for slicing and this is

408
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,980
the hierarchical display works perfectly

409
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,540
you can just nest your dev since I each

410
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,750
other CSS is great for rapid prototype

411
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,150
inventor faces it's a joy to work with

412
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,620
if you've ever tried building interfaces

413
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,030
with the likes of java swing or cute

414
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:31,510
demo this year little the tiny amount of

415
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,580
time it takes to actually prototype a

416
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,549
new UI concept is

417
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:39,090
it's great multimedia support you'd be

418
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,409
crazy to try and make an environment

419
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:41,909
like this without good multimedia

420
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,759
support we expect there to be videos and

421
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:46,049
audio support and the browser's got all

422
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:49,139
of that flexible object model we're not

423
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:52,860
tied down to two classes and rigid

424
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,139
inheritance and that's great for messing

425
00:20:55,139 --> 00:20:57,419
about with different concepts because if

426
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,269
you you don't have to go to that that um

427
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:01,860
that if of designing a class hierarchy

428
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,179
you can start off with you know a

429
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,980
function returns a couple of closures

430
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,950
and then you can move on and then

431
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,659
extract it into something in Belgium let

432
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:10,889
your object model evolve with your

433
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:13,409
system and finally it's everywhere the

434
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:14,759
thing that what worked against all these

435
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,440
systems in the 80s like small talk and

436
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,570
the self's and all this stuff is there

437
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,679
were no machines about that could

438
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,419
actually run these things that were in

439
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:24,059
the hands of their everyday people

440
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:25,830
whereas know we've all got this

441
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,659
incredibly powerful runtime on every

442
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:30,109
pretty much every system in existence so

443
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:33,239
maybe that that's what I would do my my

444
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:35,489
the abstract my talk when I said maybe

445
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:38,309
this is the time for tools us to to

446
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:42,059
start coming back so i think i've got if

447
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:45,299
I got time for a quick demo job tries to

448
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:51,450
fit on um so when I the initial

449
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,889
motivation for building the system was

450
00:21:52,889 --> 00:21:55,320
actually teaching a teaching children

451
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,840
programming and when it comes to

452
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,259
teaching I I like to like to take a

453
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:02,700
concept exists in the real world and

454
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,309
then I try to work out how we could

455
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:08,419
maybe implement night in code and then

456
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:11,580
build on that solution so I've taken a

457
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,869
very simple idea a set of traffic lights

458
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:21,389
so we'll start off with our traffic

459
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:30,330
lights and some code now what we're

460
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,570
doing here is we're wiring up we create

461
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,190
something called a context which again

462
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,759
as I said is like in a black box for it

463
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,289
contains all the state that the the

464
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:44,070
programming language uses and so we

465
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,529
borrowed those up

466
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:48,899
and we'll need a button because the

467
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:51,149
context can be starting stopped started

468
00:22:51,149 --> 00:22:57,029
and stopped button bar here and then

469
00:22:57,029 --> 00:23:00,210
I'll I'm gonna cheat not writing any

470
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:05,519
code today so let's let's start that

471
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,429
hope it works so there we go so running

472
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:09,600
a bit of code there and it's just we've

473
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,710
just about to start off for the first

474
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,749
two states flashing between red and red

475
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:13,739
amber I don't know traffic lights

476
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:15,539
working Germany our home I've been run

477
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:16,980
over almost remember three times since I

478
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,899
got here so this is how they work where

479
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:23,460
I come from so we just got to add a

480
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,109
either few lines so after that we go

481
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:27,330
green so we'll add a little bit cold

482
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:31,799
here green on and will delay there and

483
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:38,960
hopefully yeah and then we'll add the

484
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:45,269
state that goes back to yellow they

485
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:46,859
probably notice this language i'm using

486
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,899
here doesn't really look like javascript

487
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:50,100
it doesn't really look like ruby it

488
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,539
doesn't really look like python but it

489
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,580
looks a little bit like all of them it's

490
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,799
it's a when we were teaching when we

491
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,409
started teaching kids there according we

492
00:23:58,409 --> 00:23:59,789
found that they had enormous amount of

493
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:01,499
problems with things like timeouts and

494
00:24:01,499 --> 00:24:04,139
you didn't mean to do this in javascript

495
00:24:04,139 --> 00:24:06,539
an idiomatic JavaScript not not talk

496
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:08,190
about generators infant but you would

497
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,179
have to have a couple of state variables

498
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:10,830
to track the amount of time a light had

499
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,289
been on a specific state and and the

500
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:14,580
current state and the next day the

501
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,739
lights we're going to go into and for a

502
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:18,239
beginner that is a lot of stuff to track

503
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:22,230
just to make a simple sequence occur so

504
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:27,210
we we developed this really simple

505
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,679
language that allowed them allows them

506
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,039
to to write avec they called in a more

507
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:35,039
synchronous style so we've got that

508
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,859
working let's let's take into the real

509
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:51,100
world so a

510
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:54,420
so that's the you see that yep so that's

511
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,980
that's the week are we've got them we've

512
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,559
got a BF of traffic lights there so

513
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,420
again the thing I want it like i said i

514
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,679
mentioned earlier about getting rid of

515
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,960
boilerplate so we've got this we've got

516
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,549
these flashing lights and we're quite

517
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:06,780
happy with that but we'd like to make it

518
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,100
we'd like to make an effect in the real

519
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,130
world no normally if you want to start

520
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,510
integrating with hardware you've got it

521
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,830
you've got to find the right you've got

522
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,090
to find an environment to use you've got

523
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,590
to find you've got to find the right

524
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,730
libraries that work with the thing

525
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,390
you're you're wanting to do and I don't

526
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,880
like that I would prefer to be services

527
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,260
you know why can't we have a service

528
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,100
that just offers you access to the

529
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,150
relevant hardware and then we can

530
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,669
interface with that so let's do that so

531
00:25:32,669 --> 00:25:37,559
we'll create well it's called imp but

532
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,179
will create and we just tell it which

533
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:40,290
pens we want to use for the

534
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:43,980
microcontroller and I'll say up a few

535
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:49,799
others for later and we bite we just

536
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,130
bind this to the the same the same

537
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,140
script in context and by doing that it's

538
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,270
just given those the functions that

539
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,700
control those lights to to the same code

540
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:04,470
so now we can see pen for right false so

541
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:10,860
excuse me but I do this pin 6 false and

542
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,010
then in here so it's radon so that we

543
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:18,090
pin for right true and hopefully a got a

544
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:24,660
late oh so be go see it and then we can

545
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,919
we can we can go out and fill the rest

546
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:32,400
then I'll just do one more so what we've

547
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,720
done there is we've taken us that we've

548
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,070
taken that we've taken a simple

549
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,919
programming solution so a simple program

550
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,760
programming problem and we've we've

551
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,530
solved that now in a couple of ways and

552
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:47,520
we've we've done so without having to

553
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,590
mess about with libraries having to mess

554
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,270
about with setting up you know canvas

555
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,520
bootstrap code without having to do all

556
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,419
the stuff you

557
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:55,679
normally have to do to get off the

558
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,409
ground and we can we can immediately

559
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:05,389
start focusing on problem solving and

560
00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:19,039
yep I'll leave it there

561
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:27,549
you
