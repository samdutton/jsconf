00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:10,310

ah

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,280
so I'm michiyo I'm going to be talking

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,170
about some giving you some latest news

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,020
from the Mozilla jetpack project and the

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,970
goal today to give you the latest news

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,170
um a little bit about me I'm a linguist

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,810
primarily and then coder and teacher

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,150
until sometime last week last year I was

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,460
working at mozilla labs anybody works it

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,730
played with ubiquity fantastic I I got

11
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,530
to have the lovely job of teaching

12
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,570
ubiquity many different languages so

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,280
that's what I did and that's the natural

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,050
language connection right now as a

15
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,210
community member as a Mozilla community

16
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,609
member i continue to talk about jetpack

17
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:47,710
as a jetpack ambassador and right now in

18
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,710
my day job i'm a grad student at MIT and

19
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,829
i live on the internet so uh the big

20
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:56,859
question is hack ability right that's

21
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:58,449
that's the big question we want to

22
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:01,359
address it's this right this is the hack

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,750
ability issue right so the web should be

24
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,090
generative right we at Mozilla and I

25
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,160
think many of you agree the web should

26
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,260
be a platform where people can change

27
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,380
their experiences people users should be

28
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,450
able to transform the interactions and

29
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,130
the types of experiences they're having

30
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,200
on the web on a very fundamental level

31
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,600
and we believe as the main broker

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,480
between a user and the internet for

33
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,040
those interactions we believe the

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,720
browser itself should be generative as

35
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,810
well and so Firefox's answer is add-ons

36
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,480
right and there are thousands of add-ons

37
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,100
out there i'll talk a little bit about

38
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,010
this platform real quick so

39
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,570
addons.mozilla.org I'm sure many of you

40
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,490
are familiar with this that's the main

41
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,700
public repository of add-ons there are

42
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,540
over 6,000 in the wild and they're

43
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,820
written in this mishmash of HTML

44
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,070
Javascript and then xpcom this

45
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,080
underlying sea-based component layer and

46
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,590
zool which is this xml user interface

47
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,240
description language so that that's what

48
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,390
they're written and it's the largest

49
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,440
extension platform ever over 1.9 billion

50
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,250
downloads just on amo alone over a

51
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,769
hundred and seventy million in active

52
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:17,200
use this is a phenomenal platform

53
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,870
embraced by users embraced by devel

54
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:25,510
bers but there are some problems so just

55
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,860
to step through them real quick so

56
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,170
installs need restarts now that's that's

57
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,870
annoying for users it's very annoying as

58
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,400
a developer of add-ons that's very

59
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,920
unfortunate they're not trivial to

60
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,959
develop so as I said it's it's a

61
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,879
mishmash of a number of different kinds

62
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:43,060
of technologies which you know are its

63
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,920
programming an add-on it is quite

64
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,569
different than programming for the web

65
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:48,220
unfortunately and we want to bring that

66
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,790
closer they require manual upgrades and

67
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,530
from a security point of view as well I

68
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,569
mean if we will have the security patch

69
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:57,549
we want to be able to push that out and

70
00:02:57,549 --> 00:02:59,829
they're not designed for quick security

71
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:02,019
review so some of the incredible power

72
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:05,620
that we at the Firefox platform gives to

73
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,599
add ons is because we basically open up

74
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,099
the store they have all the chrome

75
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:10,390
privileges they can look at your

76
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,040
browsing history they can look at your

77
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,190
cookies they can look at everything and

78
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,230
because of that we have a security

79
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,220
processing in that we use at amo of a

80
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,379
number of different volunteers around

81
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:25,989
the world that are amo editors and they

82
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:27,760
go through basically line by line

83
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,590
looking at the code that's submitted to

84
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,019
a mo and for every upgrade right this is

85
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:34,180
a very time and labor intensive process

86
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,650
and we think we can do better so it's

87
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,019
2010 this was supposed to be the future

88
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:44,620
where is my jetpack well I'm very glad

89
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,200
to say we're working on a jet pack right

90
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,150
now at mozilla labs so I want to tell

91
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,269
you a little bit about this project now

92
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:54,519
so the idea is jetpack is going to be a

93
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:57,370
new way to extend Firefox and I'm sure

94
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,470
many of you have have heard about this

95
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,019
project as well it's important to note

96
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:04,629
that this doesn't replace zool based

97
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:07,030
add-ons the xpcom add-ons the add-ons

98
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,519
that you use now in Firefox it's not

99
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,410
meant to replace that in fact this lives

100
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,220
on top of it a little bit of the

101
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,250
highlights first of all it's easy so

102
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,930
it's going to be written in JavaScript

103
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,349
HTML CSS the same sort of stack the same

104
00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:26,530
Ajax EAP is that you use now on the web

105
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,570
when writing a web application or even

106
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,729
for a server we're using those types of

107
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,300
design paradigms there

108
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,639
kinds of languages you're going to be

109
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,020
able to use your favorite libraries

110
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,680
whether it be jquery mootools whatever

111
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,750
and it's going to have a simple modular

112
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,629
a jack capi built into it to give you

113
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:47,000
access to the core functionality of the

114
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,780
browser instant install we think this is

115
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,280
going to be a huge win for users and

116
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,720
developers alike great development tools

117
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,639
so we're working on some tools like a

118
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,740
built-in memory tracker check for leaks

119
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,690
unit testing framework is going to be

120
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,449
built into this IDE integration I'm

121
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:08,270
going to get to that in a little bit and

122
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,860
finally you're going to be able to build

123
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,500
this thing in JavaScript HTML CSS the

124
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,509
languages you know and export it as an

125
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:17,300
XP I which without any dependencies on

126
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,580
something called jetpack users will be

127
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,280
able to install it directly and the only

128
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,870
difference they'll notice is that hey

129
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,000
this is a special kind of add on it

130
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,169
installs without restarts it's fantastic

131
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:33,259
so it's secure that's that's another

132
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:36,229
highlight so because we're splitting up

133
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:38,440
the API the browser API into these

134
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,509
abstracted Ajax EAP eyes which are also

135
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,610
modularized we're going to make it so

136
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,110
that when you write a jet pack add-on

137
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,509
you're going to say in the manifest I'm

138
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:48,860
going to access I'm going to make

139
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,050
external HTTP requests but i'm not going

140
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,240
to access the browser history i'm not

141
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,620
going to look at your tabs and not going

142
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,419
to edit your cookies and you say that in

143
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:58,729
the manifest and then because we've

144
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:00,800
modularized the capabilities and we were

145
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,259
sandboxing this code whenever you try to

146
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:04,699
access something else it's just going to

147
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,080
trip a wire and you're not going to be

148
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,060
able to do that so through this process

149
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,150
where where this is going to help with

150
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,919
the review process as well we think this

151
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:14,719
is going to help secure the code and

152
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:18,169
make reviews faster we're also building

153
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,690
the functionality for automatic upgrades

154
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,699
and we're working on exactly what is

155
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:23,990
going to be the target of that maybe

156
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,120
just security patches maybe just vital

157
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,639
patches but we'll see but hope but

158
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,379
that's something we're working on and I

159
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:31,969
think users will appreciate that as well

160
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:35,719
and it's built for the future we're

161
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:37,909
designing right now we're in active

162
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,800
development of a stable API which

163
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,050
hopefully you can live for the test of

164
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,110
time and hopefully will be compatible

165
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,680
with future

166
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,449
versions of Firefox so users will be

167
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,479
able to use your jet packs jetpack based

168
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,990
add-ons for years to come so I mentioned

169
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,560
IDE integration and you know what

170
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,270
exactly does that mean so the current

171
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,100
iteration of jet pack which I'll talk

172
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,220
about a little bit is built on right now

173
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,430
a set of command line tools which run

174
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,400
these processes bootstrap your code into

175
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,530
a Firefox profile etc during development

176
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,310
and then produce the XP I one of the

177
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,590
instances of an IDE that we're creating

178
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:22,070
right now is an ID on the web which uses

179
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,710
these same tools but of course you'll be

180
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,570
able to use whatever tools you like but

181
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,039
this is just something we're working on

182
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:31,669
internally so this is a demo I just

183
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:34,340
pre-recorded because live coding scares

184
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,580
me and this is a prototype of what we

185
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,000
have working on codenamed flight deck so

186
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,590
here are some extensions and libraries

187
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,389
that others have written in flight deck

188
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:46,330
I'm going to write a new extension

189
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,949
called control tabs my girlfriend's

190
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:50,449
always complaining when she uses my

191
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,039
computer that I have like 60 different

192
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:55,580
tabs open so hopefully this will reign

193
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,610
that in this can this can help me out

194
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,830
with that so let's see what happens when

195
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,479
we create a new one there's a manifest

196
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,199
file it's got some crud in the name so

197
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,820
I'm just going to pull that out just

198
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,849
make it Mitch oh there's it going to

199
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:12,949
update that save it there's a

200
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:18,110
description and we'll actually get

201
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,699
started coding this all right so the

202
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,800
first thing to do is access some api's

203
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,120
which we're going to be using some

204
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,620
different modules and so I'm going to

205
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,349
first require the tabs module and this

206
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:29,630
require system this is based on the

207
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,940
common jas module system and we're

208
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,520
taking a lot of inspiration from Narwhal

209
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,430
as well also i'm using a module called

210
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,260
simple dialogue which is actually not

211
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,719
built into the platform it's a module

212
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:43,459
that a friend of mine in japan wrote as

213
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:46,130
well which is accessible as a library

214
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,399
and to actually access it i need to add

215
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,380
basically add the files into my jetpack

216
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,240
aside from calling them i need to

217
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,980
actually add them in so they get loaded

218
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,260
all right so now

219
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,780
I'm going to add in a tab event I'm

220
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,670
going to say when there's a tab open

221
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,700
event I'm going to run tab control so

222
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,210
i'm going to write that callback now so

223
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,580
we'll just do a simple demo first i'm

224
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,180
just going to use the simple dialogue

225
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,830
basically this first i'm going to get

226
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,170
the tab count using the count method and

227
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,300
then I'm just going to display a simple

228
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,490
dialogue alert which is basically this

229
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,590
similar to window dot alert except here

230
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,050
we don't have access to window so we

231
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,090
have to use this module and I'm going to

232
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,310
hat say you have this many tabs open

233
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,840
right so just as a quick start so let's

234
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,240
try that will save that and try and

235
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,190
browser right and no restart required

236
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,320
the extensions installed i'm going to

237
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,240
open a new tab and says you have two

238
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,490
tabs open okay so that's that so go back

239
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,660
we want to do something more interesting

240
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,150
than that and we can so so I'm just

241
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,120
going to strip this back out and change

242
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,120
it so that if we have more than 20 tabs

243
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,980
open right I'm going to say that's the

244
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,350
maximum threshold then I'm gonna harass

245
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,430
the user myself by displaying an alert

246
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,770
but actually a confirmation yes no

247
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,290
confirmation that says you already have

248
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,190
too many tabs open right and I can let

249
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,320
you go ahead and open this but then I'm

250
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,000
going to randomly select one of your

251
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,430
other tabs and close it right is that

252
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,620
okay and you say yes or no and that will

253
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,190
return a true value or false value right

254
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,700
so if the answer is true if I said yes

255
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,100
go ahead and do that then we're not

256
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,600
going to mess with the current tab we

257
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,920
just open but instead I'm going to use

258
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,110
tab remove and I'm going to we already

259
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,460
know the tab count I'm going to pick a

260
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,980
random index using round and then floor

261
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,810
and pick a random tab index tab tabs

262
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,060
retrieve that and then tabs not remove

263
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,460
that very straightforward pick a random

264
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,360
tab close it if the answer is no if I

265
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,760
said no then what we want to do is close

266
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,850
the new tab that we are we just opened

267
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,100
technically so I'm just going to tabs

268
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,070
out remove

269
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,370
tabs out retrieve tab count minus one so

270
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,020
the last tab I'm just going to close

271
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,210
that the one you just tried to open so

272
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,830
let's try this out we'll try it in the

273
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:24,030
browser and just to test this I have a

274
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,030
bookmarks folder with 20 different

275
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,560
bookmarks in it they're just google

276
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,010
searches for 1 through 20 so i'll open

277
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:36,870
that in tabs so we get 20 tabs yes i

278
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,680
want to open 20 tabs so there we have 20

279
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,700
tabs right just 1 through 20 nothing up

280
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,650
my sleeve all right um and well Oh URL

281
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,270
encoding I like that so i'll check that

282
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,100
out um so i try to open that in a new

283
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,520
tab you already have too many tabs open

284
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,810
yes go ahead and randomly close

285
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:00,480
something else okay and so now I look

286
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,140
down and number 7 is gone alright so

287
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,380
this could be really annoying but notice

288
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,750
how easy it was to write this with a

289
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,120
very ajax e very straightforward api

290
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,890
much more straightforward than the

291
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,100
actual xpcom internals i might add very

292
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,350
straight forward with a fantastic ide

293
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,060
and this is just the prototype and

294
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,890
hopefully there will be other tools as

295
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:26,460
well that build on this sdk so this all

296
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,220
began with a blog post like many things

297
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,970
do back last year in May the jetpack

298
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,650
project was launched with a with a

299
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,190
prototype and since then the this whole

300
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,960
platform has really exploded a lot of

301
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,470
people have been reading writing jetpack

302
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,710
add-ons on top of this jetpack prototype

303
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,680
but alas this was just a prototype so

304
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,870
right now we're in this process called

305
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,600
the jetpack reboot and really it's very

306
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,870
straightforward this is the idea harder

307
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,360
better faster stronger that that's the

308
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,980
idea of the jetpack reboot so we're

309
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,810
rewriting this from the ground up we

310
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,820
started this beginning of this year and

311
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,450
so right now we have the jetpack SDK 0.2

312
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,690
please go ahead and download that

313
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,010
unfortunately right now it doesn't have

314
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,600
its really laying a lot of the

315
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,450
foundation of this we're trying to make

316
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,670
it a very production-ready very stable

317
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,880
sort of core very solid foundation but

318
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,720
it doesn't have any of the

319
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,819
I high level modules yet SDK 0.3 will be

320
00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:31,769
out later this month hopefully by the

321
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,269
end of the month and that will include

322
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:35,250
some of the first high-level api's like

323
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,009
panel overlays the context menu API a

324
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:42,480
Dom selection API and the tabs so this

325
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,610
is jetpack this is the basic idea so

326
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,879
there's Firefox zulan xpcom internally

327
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:51,920
that's you and your JavaScript right and

328
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,019
this is jetpack right that's what will

329
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,300
take you from A to B that will connect

330
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,759
you and let you write fantastic add-ons

331
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,149
very powerful add-ons in Firefox in the

332
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:05,040
same sort of JavaScript that you love

333
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,120
writing every day so that's jetpack so

334
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,370
it's the power of this add-on platform

335
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,490
together with the bond benefits all the

336
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:18,149
benefits of a modern web api and so the

337
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,279
key terms again the key words are easy

338
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,129
secure and future-proof that's the

339
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:28,199
message so today 315 to 4 15 or so I'll

340
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:30,059
be in the game room hooked up to the

341
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:31,800
projector will be doing a little jet

342
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,500
pack workshop talk about it we'll look

343
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,839
at the prototype play with the SDK and

344
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:38,759
I'll talk a little bit about how to get

345
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,559
involved how you can follow this

346
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,839
development process as it keeps going so

347
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,759
I'll see you guys there welcome to the
