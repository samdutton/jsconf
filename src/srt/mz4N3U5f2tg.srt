1
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,550

so good afternoon everyone I'm really

2
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,129
excited to be here talking to you today

3
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:17,140
my name is rob kerr i'm from IBM

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,090
research and I've come all the way from

5
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:25,090
Melbourne Australia so as it says up

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,080
there I'm going to talk to you about

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,750
science in the browser today I'm going

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,859
to talk to you about how I use a web

9
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:32,310
browser to orchestrate and visualize

10
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,930
simulations of neurons which are brain

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,870
cells but more generally I'm going to

12
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,280
speak to you about my experiences

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,400
working at the intersection of science

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,640
and web development but before I get to

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,130
that and if this will still work I'm

16
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,030
going to tell you to origin stories and

17
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,040
like all good origin stories these

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,240
involves science so the first of these I

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,920
think a lot of you'll probably be

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,290
familiar with and that is the birth of

21
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,379
the web so the web was created back in

22
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:09,420
the 1980s to help scientists do science

23
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,240
was created by that's the science lab

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,000
was created by tim berners-lee at CERN

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,920
and it was created to to solve a problem

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,000
particle physicists from around the

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,460
world needed better ways to access and

28
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,230
share the data that they collected while

29
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,940
they're out soon as Tim sort of put it

30
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,080
the data collected from different

31
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,760
experiments would be stored on different

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,110
computers you'd have to log onto these

33
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,810
computers manually you'd often have to

34
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,340
learn a new program or programming

35
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,100
language to get at the data and so he

36
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,409
saw the web as a way to simplify this to

37
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:46,060
make it easy to access and share the

38
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,729
data between like within the community

39
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:52,450
and shortly after this the web spun out

40
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,430
of the scientific community to become

41
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:59,560
what it is today oops so the second

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,740
origin story guess this isn't working

43
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,600
quite like he expected the second origin

44
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,330
story that i'd like to tell you is one

45
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,310
that i think very few over you feel

46
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,260
familiar with that's the story of how I

47
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,280
came to be speaking to you today

48
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,019
so like most of you sorry like many of

49
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:19,430
you here I've come to the web from

50
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:24,340
somewhere else my background is in

51
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,329
neuroscience it's in developing

52
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:28,099
mathematical models to try and

53
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:29,450
understand different parts of the brain

54
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,209
and how they work this was something I

55
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:34,040
was so interested in fact I decided to

56
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,090
do a PhD in it and PhD specialties are

57
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,890
difficult it's not because you have to

58
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,250
be super smart that that does help but

59
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,829
it's because you have to work by

60
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:47,720
yourself on a single project for years

61
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,599
and years no one else really knows what

62
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,609
you're doing ultimately no one else

63
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:54,049
really cares if it's successful it's

64
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,260
your project and because of this the end

65
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,079
of a PhD is a time of stress

66
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:04,549
disillusionment and procrastination now

67
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:06,459
I didn't make a jacket out of receipts

68
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,959
instead what I did I taught myself Ruby

69
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,040
on Rails and as a sort of a project to

70
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,560
help with this something to build I

71
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,549
built a rhyming dictionary which I felt

72
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:20,900
wrong I built a rhyming dictionary

73
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,409
called any rom-com which is online if

74
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:26,299
you want to check it out and so I used

75
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:28,010
Ruby on Rails to build the backend for

76
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,040
it and then I decided I wanted sort of a

77
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,709
visual interface so the users could not

78
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:35,840
just do a normal sort of rain but they

79
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,159
could like match different parts of the

80
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:40,459
word and even do portman toes and that

81
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:44,629
sort of thing so i told myself a bit of

82
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:47,299
angular to build something and i found

83
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:49,639
myself really enjoying this I'm not just

84
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,810
because i had a thesis i didn't want to

85
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,229
write I found it really satisfying to

86
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:56,959
use code to construct something visual

87
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,129
something you could see and something

88
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:00,019
that people could interact with I think

89
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:01,519
that probably resonates with the follow

90
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,290
of you here but eventually I handed in

91
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,150
my thesis and got a job with IBM

92
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,629
Research to continue doing euro science

93
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:14,720
but now I'd had this taste for what web

94
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,070
could do I knew about this whole other

95
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,220
world of stuff and perhaps that could

96
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,580
help with my research but before I get

97
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,729
into that I'm going to give you a bit of

98
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:27,050
context and a bit more of an

99
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,310
understanding of what research it is

100
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,020
that I do

101
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:39,060
so this is going to work at all oh well

102
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:47,060
yeah place it's a really good transition

103
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,050
so I'm going to do it for the

104
00:04:51,050 --> 00:05:06,100
transitions right yep

105
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,240
okay oh we're not Marin okay that's good

106
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,949
now we've got we've recreated the

107
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:12,240
failure and you leave that open because

108
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,479
I'm going to need to me later yeah it's

109
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,810
going to be fine so this is the other

110
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,120
monitor and so now if I click this and

111
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,680
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

112
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,990
wait

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,420
it's going to be good

114
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:44,660
gosh right right right right right Leigh

115
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:50,060
from current slide is that it it's a

116
00:05:50,060 --> 00:06:01,000
wide slot that's what I wanted

117
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,570
well this is excellent because you're

118
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:08,970
really going to like this transition so

119
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,860
this is a plastic model of the human

120
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,220
brain it represents a hunk of meat that

121
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,470
sits in our heads and is responsible for

122
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,510
all our memories and motions and

123
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,420
decisions it gives us our sense of self

124
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,330
and our ability to comprehend the world

125
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,980
it allows us to learn to move and to

126
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,740
speak information from our senses such

127
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,210
as our eyes our ears and our fingertips

128
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,390
is all sent to the brain to be

129
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,070
remembered to be understood and

130
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,890
potentially lead to actions yet how the

131
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,870
brain accomplishes all of this is still

132
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,230
largely a mystery and finding out is one

133
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,650
of the fundamental goals of neuroscience

134
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,060
one thing we do know however is the

135
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,710
brain is made up of an enormous network

136
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,560
of neurons of cells called neurons ready

137
00:06:52,560 --> 00:07:02,190
for it so the human brain contains

138
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,340
approximately 86 billion neurons and

139
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,020
each of these makes 10,000 connections

140
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,750
with other cells in the brain it is this

141
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,030
large dense network of cells that

142
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,770
scientists believe give rise to all of

143
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,950
these abilities that I just mentioned

144
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,810
but let's zoom in now through some

145
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,080
individual neurons what we see is that

146
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,970
these all have a common structure they

147
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,310
have a cell body called the soma they

148
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,750
have incoming fibers called dendrites

149
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,910
and have an outgoing fiber called an

150
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,270
axon this axon end branches and it forms

151
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,560
connections onto the dendrites of other

152
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,530
neurons yet despite this basic common

153
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,900
structure there is a large variety of

154
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,610
different neuron morphologies found

155
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,400
throughout the brain so here are some

156
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,580
examples and examples of even more of

157
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,500
these can be found online ok so now

158
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:02,760
going to mirror

159
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,170
at a website called neuromorphic org you

160
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:09,440
guys can say that yes so this is an

161
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,150
online database of neuron morphologies

162
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,220
and that have been uploaded by

163
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,590
experimentalists so what happens is

164
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,990
experimentalists get fluorescent dye and

165
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,600
they inject the eject the dye into the

166
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,490
neuron cells so that they stand out from

167
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,470
the other neurons they then take a

168
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,940
series of microscope images at different

169
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,000
depths and they then get these images

170
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,830
and they painstakingly know they get

171
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,360
their students to painstakingly trace

172
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,700
through these images in order to

173
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,510
recreate the full 3d morphology now here

174
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,610
we see some images of these sort of

175
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,510
morphology so these are static 2d images

176
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,470
so they give you an idea of what the

177
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,540
morphology looks like but what they

178
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,960
actually look like is this they're

179
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,300
actually text files so each row in this

180
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,220
text file corresponds to a point on the

181
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,370
neuron the first the first done column

182
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,880
is the ID each row then has a type so

183
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,400
milord end Raider axon has XYZ

184
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,410
coordinates and as a radius telling you

185
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,410
how thick the fibers at that point and

186
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,780
then starting from the cell body which

187
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,260
is negative 1 they all have the parent

188
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,760
point the idea of the parent point and

189
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,230
in this way it construct sort of the

190
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,650
tree that is in your arm now very often

191
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,390
in science having a good way to

192
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,080
visualize your data is is key this is a

193
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,700
prime example because just looking at

194
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,590
this file we can't see what's going on

195
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,380
we can't see what this neuron looks like

196
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,090
so what I decided to do was to build

197
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,910
build a simple tool to to visualize this

198
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,210
morphology and existing tools were

199
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,410
already out there that's how they made

200
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,050
those images but I wanted to learn three

201
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,650
jazz and I also I wanted something sort

202
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,140
of simple in and easy to use that I

203
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,480
could extend how I want it so i'll just

204
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,820
show you a demo of that now so this is

205
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,120
let's make it a bit figure so you can

206
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,330
see so here i can upload that file we

207
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:09,530
were just looking up

208
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,860
and we can see it loads here it's a bit

209
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,740
small but now we can we can rotate and

210
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,470
zoom in and see the full 3d morphology

211
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,600
so here we've got the blue and purple

212
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,459
fibers at the dendrites so the incoming

213
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:23,889
fibers the cell body is sort of just a

214
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,600
point and then in white we've got the

215
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,940
outgoing axon so this neurons upside

216
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,389
down to the one I showed you previously

217
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:32,949
and so this is nice i now have sort of a

218
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:36,480
visual way to interact with my model but

219
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:43,610
okay now I've got to do this again

220
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,510
settle in each digit

221
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,680
yes

222
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,800
jump forward so I now have I now have

223
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,449
this nice way of interacting visually

224
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,940
with my data but for a moment let's get

225
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,800
back to the problems in science that Tim

226
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,360
berners-lee saw in that he was trying to

227
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,670
solve with the web how are we doing

228
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,720
today well it's now like easy to just

229
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,279
browse online through scientific

230
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,079
publications of researchers from around

231
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:16,050
the world they can share their code and

232
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,810
their data with us and I can point to a

233
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,790
number of websites in just in

234
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,170
neuroscience of loans such as new and

235
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,579
more food org where you'll find

236
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:26,910
carefully curated data sets in addition

237
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,350
to this there's open source software

238
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,690
available to do different types of

239
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,019
simulations and analysis and put all

240
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,310
different fields within science yet how

241
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,779
different is this really to before the

242
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:44,069
web arise arose it's now trivial to

243
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:47,250
access all this data i agree but all of

244
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,870
it requires a high level of technical

245
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,889
expertise to understand and to use what

246
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:54,259
if we started using and sharing

247
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:57,810
interactive visualizations to let us

248
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,339
fully explore the data without needing

249
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:02,130
to install anything what if we started

250
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,139
sharing interactive tools for performing

251
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:05,970
analysis and simulations that could be

252
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,069
run by anywhere any that could be run by

253
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:12,779
anyone anywhere researchers want to be

254
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,130
able to share their findings they want

255
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,240
to be able to share the details of these

256
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,250
findings this is good for their career

257
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,649
and it's good for science in general

258
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:20,759
they just haven't had good ways of doing

259
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,380
this when they were specialized software

260
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,209
that was required for performing the

261
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:27,360
analysis simulations and even doing the

262
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,269
visualizations however this is starting

263
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:33,839
to change recent developments in browser

264
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,550
technologies such as WebGL and

265
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,730
JavaScript libraries such as 3gs and d3

266
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,199
make the browser a compelling place to

267
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:43,050
build useful visual you is for

268
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,180
scientific tools I would say it's much

269
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,610
easier now to create these online tools

270
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,829
than it is to create a native app to do

271
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:51,240
the same thing and it's much more easily

272
00:12:51,240 --> 00:13:00,029
shareable and right so let's get back to

273
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,339
me and my neurons I was nailed will to

274
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:04,310
visualize these in 3d

275
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,860
and this is great but so what what I

276
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,240
actually wanted to do what I actually

277
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,860
was interested in its understanding how

278
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,260
these neurons worked and try to build

279
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,410
models of this behavior I was interested

280
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,090
in what it was that neurons actually do

281
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,950
that when they connected up in these

282
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,320
larger networks somehow leads to

283
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,420
cognition somehow leads to us so to give

284
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,950
you a bit more of an understanding for

285
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,450
what we know about neurons let's go back

286
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,210
to our diagram so neurons communicate

287
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,910
with each other within this network by

288
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,830
sending bursts of electricity called

289
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:40,339
spikes or action potentials they send

290
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:41,900
these out along their axons to the

291
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,250
connection between neurons called

292
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,860
synapses when an action potential

293
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,330
arrives at a synapse it creates or any

294
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,130
juices in the target neuron in the

295
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,960
dendrite of the target neuron a much

296
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,839
smaller pulse this small pulse then

297
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:59,779
travels towards the soma just too too

298
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:02,000
excited a little bit and if there's

299
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,650
enough of these small pulses arriving at

300
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,470
the same time the neuron gets very

301
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,980
excited and it produces its own slack

302
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,260
its own action potential which travels

303
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,839
out along the axon to signal other

304
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,310
neurons in the network and this is in

305
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:20,450
this way they communicate and this is

306
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,980
often recreated artificially in

307
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,500
experiments through using stimulating

308
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,450
electrode that injects current directly

309
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,720
into the neuron and it was for doing

310
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,270
experiments like this one like like this

311
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,670
that two English scientists back in the

312
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:38,120
1950s called hodgkin-huxley developed

313
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,950
the first mathematical model of the

314
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,760
electrical behavior of a neuron they

315
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,560
they did these experiments on squid

316
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,020
giant axon which is a disappointingly

317
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,170
normal-sized squid that has a very large

318
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,209
axon and it was the size of this

319
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:55,310
accident that allowed them to do these

320
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,810
experiments with the technology that was

321
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,860
available to them at the time and they

322
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,600
won a Nobel Prize for this work which

323
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,640
they shared with a Melbourne researcher

324
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,560
in fact called tongue coach John Eccles

325
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,089
now I didn't have any code to show you

326
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:13,730
today but it's okay because I've got

327
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,620
something even better I've got some

328
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,230
equations

329
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,380
now you don't need to understand these

330
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,320
equations but they tell you how the

331
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,700
voltage and the difference teta

332
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,050
different ion channels within a neuron

333
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,020
change over time they're still widely

334
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,340
used within the neuroscience community

335
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,220
or some variant of them and I use this

336
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,000
type of model in these type of equations

337
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,950
for my own research so the simulations I

338
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,990
run i divided a neuron up into small

339
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,720
segments called compartments and this

340
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,250
set of equation gets applied to each of

341
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,980
those compartments in this way I can

342
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,110
simulate what it would be like to inject

343
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,270
current into a neuron or bombarding

344
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,670
you're on with synaptic synaptic inputs

345
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,500
like it like it does in the brain so

346
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,130
what I wanted was a visual tool to let

347
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,230
me to let me change the parameters of

348
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,060
this model and actually see what I was

349
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,800
doing to see the morphology and to see

350
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,690
how the parameters varied over that

351
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,950
morphology I also wanted a way to for a

352
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,450
simulation that had been run look at the

353
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,060
outputs look at what parts of the neuron

354
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,620
responded to can't be injected at a

355
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,800
particular point so I decided to build a

356
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,530
tool to let me do this this is something

357
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,330
I've spent a decent portion of the last

358
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,960
might say two years on I've learned it's

359
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,360
taught me a lot and I've gotten a lot of

360
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,340
help from other people that I'm very

361
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,610
very grateful for and what I've built

362
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:43,870
I'm very proud of it's my baby and I'm

363
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,150
very excited to be I'll show you today

364
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,920
so that what I'm going to demonstrate to

365
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,070
you is first of all how I can figure a

366
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,660
simulation and change the input

367
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,670
parameters and then I'm going to show

368
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,410
you a simulation that's already been run

369
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,630
we can visualize the outputs and see how

370
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:04,180
the new one response so let's push our

371
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:13,309
luck and do this again where is my mouse

372
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:17,579
okay so here is here is the new

373
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,009
interface it looks quite similar to the

374
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:22,169
old one we've got still the purple and

375
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:23,909
blue fibers representing the dendrites

376
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,279
and the white one representing the axon

377
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:29,940
we can still zoom and rotate the cell

378
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,470
body is now represented by severe so we

379
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,100
can see how large it is and this is all

380
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,059
a bit small so one big edition is now we

381
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,769
can select a compartment and select a

382
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,269
piece of the neuron and look at the

383
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:45,090
properties of this so we can look at the

384
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,490
XYZ coordinates and the radius so things

385
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,710
about the morphology but we can also

386
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,190
look at some of the active electrical

387
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,840
properties of the neuron we can look at

388
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,759
its axial resistance and we can look at

389
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:57,899
different properties of ion channels

390
00:17:57,899 --> 00:17:59,610
that exists within that part of the

391
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,629
neuron I can select multiple

392
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:07,649
compartments and let's just change one

393
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:09,720
of these parameters for that let's make

394
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:16,470
it a lot lower so that was easy but we

395
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,809
can't really see what we just did it

396
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:21,870
looks the same so what I decided to

397
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,940
build was a way that we can color the

398
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,919
neuron by the different parameters that

399
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,080
we have in the model so I can color it

400
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,110
by this parameter we just changed

401
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,980
hopefully you can all see that there's

402
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,549
purple and blue there so what we're

403
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:38,429
visualizing now is the conductance

404
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:41,759
density of sodium ion channels now these

405
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:43,529
kind of control how excitable the cell

406
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:45,720
is so we've got very high values high

407
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,639
densities of these in the summer and in

408
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:50,039
the axon and lower values in the den

409
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,769
drive and then much lower values where

410
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:55,889
we manually change them so this is this

411
00:18:55,889 --> 00:18:58,590
is pretty useful and I can also color by

412
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,740
other things like the radius so you may

413
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,179
have noticed this is just a line drawing

414
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:06,809
of a neuron now at some point I plan to

415
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:08,399
sort of make this and into actual

416
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:10,980
volumes that I render but it's not a big

417
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,720
priority because these fibers are quite

418
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,519
thin relative to the overall size of the

419
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,350
neuron and it wouldn't look overly

420
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,289
different but this lets us quickly and

421
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:21,990
easily see what thickness the fibers are

422
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,879
we can see that this is this thick trunk

423
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:25,320
going sort of vertically through the

424
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,210
neuron we see that the fibers get

425
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,149
being as you travel out so i'll just go

426
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:34,880
back and color by the type again so

427
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,899
importantly though i want to be able to

428
00:19:36,899 --> 00:19:40,169
inject current insist neuron 22 given an

429
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:41,370
input basically that we could then

430
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,980
simulate something it could respond to

431
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,690
so we can go down to this tab and I can

432
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,929
inject some can't into it i can add an

433
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:53,640
electrode just amount of it and using

434
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,230
three jace i made this little graph so

435
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,700
you can see the current overtime for

436
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,159
this electrode and we can change this i

437
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:00,779
might make this pulse come in a bit

438
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:06,480
later maybe it's larger maybe it's much

439
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,299
wider pulse we can also change it so

440
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:11,220
that there's multiple pulses through the

441
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,360
simulation so let's now go to a

442
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,110
simulation I prepared earlier so this is

443
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,700
quite similar to the one I just showed

444
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,159
you here we've got current being ejected

445
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:26,909
at 50 milliseconds into this part of the

446
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:29,220
cell and if I go down the bottom we've

447
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,880
got this visualized tab and we can see a

448
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,289
similar sort of d3 line graph however

449
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:39,390
this one represents the voltage over

450
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,919
time this is an output of the model

451
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:44,399
we've ran a simulation of this and we've

452
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:45,929
got this response this is how the neuron

453
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:48,539
responds and so a line graph like this

454
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,529
and we can do it for different

455
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:51,510
compartments so I can do it for one down

456
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:57,419
here and we can zoom in on this this is

457
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:00,240
sort of the typical typical output of a

458
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,919
neural simulation you find how the

459
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,350
voltage changes at a particular point in

460
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:08,370
the neuron usually the soma but for

461
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,929
certain questions this isn't really

462
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:13,529
enough so what I decided to do is the

463
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:15,390
same way i was coloring the neuron by

464
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,399
different input parameters i can color

465
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:20,220
the neuron by the voltage and so we can

466
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,760
see now it's all gone purple so purple

467
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,919
here represents about negative 65

468
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,169
millivolts it's the resting state of

469
00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:30,539
this neuron before any inputs come in

470
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,970
and so what I'm going to do now is play

471
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,490
forward over the time where we inject

472
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,409
current into the cell and we're going to

473
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:39,700
see how the neuron responds to this

474
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,389
so if I got in here and press play you

475
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:44,679
can see where we're up to here current

476
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,120
was about to be injected up here and

477
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,450
enough can't it enters the stoma too

478
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,460
excited and to produce an action

479
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,769
potential so I'll just play it back over

480
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:57,070
this again so we can zoom in and rotate

481
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:09,299
as this is happening thank you

482
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:27,590
so back to power punch

483
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,299
yes good so believe it or not spikes

484
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:35,130
like that are occurring billions of

485
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,710
times the second in your brains this is

486
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,850
how we think and do everything now I bet

487
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,559
most of you are pretty surprised to be

488
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,910
learning about neuroscience at a

489
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:49,320
JavaScript conference to me this is kind

490
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,270
of normal this is what I do but I

491
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,860
understand that this is somewhat niche

492
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,410
it doesn't really relate to what most of

493
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,289
you would do day to day but the point of

494
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:01,890
this is not about neuroscience the point

495
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,960
of this is that the web is changing

496
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:10,679
science in general modern web browsers

497
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:12,960
now allow us to deliver interactive

498
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,120
visualizations to fully explore data

499
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,860
into to visualize simulations coupled

500
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,809
with this we've got cloud-based

501
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:23,280
technologies which can power these

502
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,799
interfaces now I haven't shown you this

503
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,380
yet but that simulation of a neuron you

504
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,679
just saw that was running the cloud by

505
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,900
pressing a button within that web app I

506
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,090
could run a simulation of a neuron and

507
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,010
not care where the computation happened

508
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:41,760
and the point of this is that it didn't

509
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,720
have to be a neuron that I was

510
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,450
simulating in fact using what i learned

511
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:48,570
from building this tool me and others in

512
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,909
the lab built an analogous tool for

513
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:54,630
simulating the weather it's a bit lazy

514
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:58,860
of me so i'm going to show you a

515
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,299
demonstration of this now and i think

516
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:03,179
this will help you appreciate how how

517
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:05,460
generally applicable the web is to

518
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,080
science and how much can change science

519
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,900
in general so going to do this a few

520
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:17,149
more times

521
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:22,049
okay so here is our interface for our

522
00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:32,220
weather simulation tool thank you now

523
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,259
you can see it let's make it a bit

524
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:38,460
bigger so we're no longer looking at a

525
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,619
three-dimensional view of a neuron this

526
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:42,269
is something we're all more familiar

527
00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:45,479
with we're looking at a map so we're

528
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:47,009
looking at budapest here and we've got

529
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:50,399
this big rectangle around the city so

530
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:52,169
this is this is the area that we might

531
00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:55,229
want to simulate the weather for we can

532
00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:57,929
make that much larger and look at a much

533
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,549
larger grid and get the weather for now

534
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:11,169
decent part of europe and we can hold on

535
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:14,159
ok i need to make the internet work

536
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,479
before we do the next bit but that's

537
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:18,989
okay and i can choose where it is so i

538
00:25:18,989 --> 00:25:20,940
could go to where i live in melbourne

539
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,169
australia and we could look we could

540
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:25,139
simulate the weather there and i could

541
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:28,109
we could perform a simulation of or a

542
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,269
forecast rather of the weather going

543
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:32,429
forward several days into the future or

544
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:34,649
we could do something else that's quite

545
00:25:34,649 --> 00:25:36,869
common which is called a hindcast so

546
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,220
this is where we go to a previous point

547
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,029
in time and simulate using existing

548
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:44,549
weather observations create a much more

549
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:46,049
detailed simulation of what the weather

550
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:48,599
was or would have been in that location

551
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:51,029
and so it's an example of that that i'm

552
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:53,399
going to show you now for the weather

553
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:58,859
over Barcelona so here we see a heat map

554
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:00,389
of the temperature or the surface

555
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:02,249
temperature for this region that

556
00:26:02,249 --> 00:26:04,619
includes Barcelona and I'm going to play

557
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:06,659
forward over a couple of days so we can

558
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:08,849
see how this changes you'll see it go

559
00:26:08,849 --> 00:26:11,070
yellow over the land during the day as

560
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,570
things heat up and it will stay

561
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,059
relatively constant over the

562
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:18,029
Mediterranean so if we play forward like

563
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:20,639
this we see this is what is predicted

564
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:22,289
the the weather to be like and we can

565
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,659
see the outline of a mountain range

566
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:26,279
there where it doesn't get quite as warm

567
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:30,190
I think that's the Pyrenees

568
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:41,900
yeah so back to PowerPoint and while I'm

569
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,790
here I'm going to turn off Wi-Fi and see

570
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:55,120
you how that goes can you see that no

571
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,360
excellent

572
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,110
so meteorology and neuroscience are very

573
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,900
different fields but despite that these

574
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,179
two apps share a lot in common in both

575
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:07,590
cases we were able to move everything

576
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,710
online to use cloud-based resources in

577
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,270
both cases we did away with the need to

578
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:15,360
install files or sorry to organize files

579
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,929
or install software but having a web app

580
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:23,880
that can do this this is my web app that

581
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,530
is able to orchestrate these simulations

582
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,150
to store the inputs and to store the

583
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,850
outputs this is by no means trivial and

584
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:34,410
it certainly wasn't to me luckily though

585
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,270
I work with a lot of amazing people at

586
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,820
IBM Research whom I could learn from and

587
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,090
who could guide me in this the other

588
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,190
benefit to working for IBM is that I

589
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,230
have access to these new web and cloud

590
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,890
technologies that are available because

591
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:51,270
we we acquired the companies that

592
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,750
develop them so I've deployed my web app

593
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:58,530
in bluemix so this is a service built

594
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,450
around cloud foundry for deploying web

595
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,220
apps and it lets you connect in other

596
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,530
services very easily like databases so I

597
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,299
use a database to keep track of the

598
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:08,760
simulations in their state and these

599
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,460
simulations have to run somewhere and so

600
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,790
I need to put these on virtual machines

601
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:18,240
in the cloud and they run using C++ code

602
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,070
that was in fact written by my manager

603
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,770
and this c++ code runs inside a docker

604
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:27,150
container and it generates upwards and

605
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,440
it has to put these outputs somewhere

606
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,760
and we want them somewhere where they're

607
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,530
very accessible from where the browser

608
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:34,169
can access them easily and for this we

609
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:37,790
use object storage which is terrific for

610
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:41,250
large size data files that you want to

611
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,600
make easily accessible to the browser

612
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,169
you can create a temporary URL and so

613
00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:48,270
both of these things can be offered to

614
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,549
us to an IBM acquisition called

615
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:54,240
softlayer and so this is the basic

616
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,740
architecture and you'll notice there's

617
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,360
nothing to do with neuroscience or

618
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,480
meteorology here that'll happens in the

619
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,520
browser locally or at the very back end

620
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,550
in our docker container this is

621
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,140
generally applicable to any sort of

622
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,059
scientific problem or in fact any

623
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:10,320
problem where you need to analyze data

624
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,130
or performs

625
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:16,830
relations and so do you see what's

626
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,990
happened here from its birthplace in

627
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,060
science the web has come full circle and

628
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,740
is now offering new possibilities and

629
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,830
new opportunities to science and it's

630
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,090
for this reason that I'd like to see a

631
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,490
larger overlap between the scientific

632
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:32,850
and the web communities and to this end

633
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:37,140
a friend of mine Isabel and I developed

634
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,620
a course to teach academic researchers

635
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,930
about the web give them basic web

636
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,850
development understanding of HTML and

637
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:48,290
JavaScript and CSS and how to use a

638
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:52,800
visualization library called III so we

639
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,380
developed this course sorry I'm supposed

640
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,240
together we developed this course and

641
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,490
his Isabel tweeting about it and we

642
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,650
developed it all online on github so

643
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,910
that other people can contribute and

644
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,350
more important other people could use it

645
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:07,050
to teach it wherever they were and in

646
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,550
fact before we even have the chance to

647
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:11,070
teach it someone else picked it up and

648
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,890
decided to teach it they taught it at

649
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,970
CERN believe it or not it was part of a

650
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:21,990
student summer web fest and I just think

651
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,850
this is really cool cern is embracing

652
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,500
the fruits of the web that they helped

653
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,080
create so before i leave you today i

654
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,360
want to show you something that was

655
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,860
unfathomable back when Tim berners-lee

656
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,770
first proposed the web I want to show

657
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,930
you a simulation of a neuron that's

658
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,150
happening in the cloud in real time from

659
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,940
the browser so in real time we're going

660
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,280
to to watch the electrical activity

661
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,350
travel through this neuron as it's being

662
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:52,650
simulated assuming that demo gods allow

663
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:58,950
us to okay everything's looking pretty

664
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,430
good

665
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,049
let me jump back here so this is where

666
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:08,309
we were and if I jump back out we can

667
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:10,379
see this was one simulation in a gallery

668
00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:12,480
of simulations so the green ones the

669
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,980
ones that have been previously simulated

670
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,440
and the yellow ones are new ones that

671
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,590
we're still configuring and haven't yet

672
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:23,370
haven't yet run and and this is this is

673
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,500
great because this is all online so

674
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,960
people collaborating together can access

675
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,460
and see what their what each other are

676
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,659
working on they can put a new model up

677
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,580
and tell the others possibly on the

678
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,320
other side of the world to check out the

679
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,240
new model I developed what do you think

680
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,059
and so we can create a copy of this

681
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:44,970
simulation here a new copy that we can

682
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,639
modify and then simulate and this is

683
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:51,899
going extraordinarily well so this is

684
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:53,009
the simulation we're looking at before

685
00:31:53,009 --> 00:31:56,399
let's now add a few more inputs so let's

686
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:01,230
add let's add one up here and let's make

687
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:13,500
it happen at 75 300 that's good but it's

688
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,289
a bit boring let's add another one here

689
00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:21,960
so let's make that happen at 100 and

690
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,220
let's make it last 400 hundred

691
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,149
milliseconds and let's make it really

692
00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:30,029
strong let's give it a thousand Pico

693
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:34,110
amps okay so I've got the simulation

694
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,059
ready now so what we can do is go up the

695
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:37,379
top here and there's a button called

696
00:32:37,379 --> 00:32:40,919
simulate so i can press that and it now

697
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,779
says it's running so what's happening

698
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:45,509
now is that all our new inputs were sent

699
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:47,669
back up to the server and it was told i

700
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:49,500
want to simulate this so it puts the

701
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,309
data in object storage and it puts this

702
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:55,320
job in a queue saying please simulate

703
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,539
this I then have a worker that picks it

704
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:01,230
up and and downloads the data it needs

705
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:05,309
and starts simulating and as it

706
00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:09,960
simulates it'll output is not working

707
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,659
as it's simulating it will start

708
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:16,980
outputting data he does not yet let's

709
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,120
give it a bit longer I have a back-up

710
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,210
plan so as its as simulating it outputs

711
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:23,010
data into object storage which is the

712
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,299
browser can then check to see whether

713
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,520
it's there and if it is it can download

714
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,260
and present it to us before the

715
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:32,190
simulations even finished doesn't look

716
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:35,279
like we're going to be so lucky today in

717
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,450
fact i think the simulation is maybe

718
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:42,070
finished

719
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,760
no I'm uneven that's right I once again

720
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,280
prepared one familiar so just imagine

721
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,820
this is still running in real time so

722
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:58,440
I'll play this for you now so again

723
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,480
initially we'll have the same pulse that

724
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,820
we injected last time and then we'll

725
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,860
have one a bit further away so up here

726
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:12,120
and the next one will come in no one is

727
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,590
going to be awkward pauses exciting time

728
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,080
this one so what's it well and so this

729
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,140
one isn't enough to excite the cell and

730
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,550
then in a little bit we'll just really

731
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:26,730
hammer it so as I mentioned my manager

732
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,620
he wrote the C++ code that runs the

733
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,420
simulation and he kind of insisted on

734
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,090
doing this because he done a bunch of

735
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,560
times and he knew exactly how it needed

736
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,350
to be done but this is the first time

737
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,090
he's been able to watch as the

738
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,310
simulations been running and really see

739
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:44,280
what was happening in the cell this is I

740
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,990
think something that science badly needs

741
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:49,260
in all fields of science I see it as the

742
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:54,030
future of science and so before I go I

743
00:34:54,030 --> 00:35:02,610
need to affect about that and spoil us

744
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:07,680
know you can see that

745
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,089
and so I'm used to giving academic

746
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:12,430
conference talks and those always end

747
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,750
with an acknowledgement slide sorry

748
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,660
that's what I'm going to do today so the

749
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,240
first person i thank is Glen Madden so

750
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,280
he was who got me into web in the first

751
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,859
place and he continues to be a mentor in

752
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:27,310
anything web related secondly like that

753
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,200
Isabel Kiril kornek who I mentioned

754
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,900
earlier with whom I developed the d3

755
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,660
course to teach to researchers she also

756
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:38,109
is happy to supply endless feedback for

757
00:35:38,109 --> 00:35:41,560
any project I've been working on I'd

758
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,589
like to thank certain members of the web

759
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:47,020
community who first suggest that I could

760
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,310
speak at a JavaScript conference like

761
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,530
this and for helping me craft my

762
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:53,560
submission but I'd like to thank all of

763
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,240

765
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,869
outside seriously you're great I'd like

and I'd like to acknowledge all the

770
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,800

to this so it specifically Tim and

772
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:17,680
Jordan there who built most of the the

773
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,020
weather the weather up that was only

774
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,900
partly me and as I mentioned my manager

775
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,170
John Wagner who who wrote the C++ code

776
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:29,079
that ran in the back end and finally I'd

777
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:32,020
