1
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,320

I'm going to talk to you my name's first

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,720
germ mo I'm a developer from Glasgow in

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,029
Scotland and I'm going to talk to you

4
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:25,250
about an event that was just mentioned

5
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,140
there that changed the world that

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,840
changed all their lives had changed your

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,820
life and Men yours and in mine and that

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,160
was this gig at the Leicester Free Trade

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,570
Hall in Manchester

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:43,190
it was a Friday 4th of June 1976 first

11
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,190
was the night the Sex Pistols played now

12
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,899
this is one of their first gigs outside

13
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:50,000
London they hadn't had a record eye or

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,280
anything and they're only a bit 40

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,050
people in the room but those 40 people

16
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,300
were inspired they were inspired by the

17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,859
rawness and the the passion and the

18
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:06,380
enthusiasm that the Sex Pistols showed

19
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,800
that may now Bernard Sumner from Joy

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,960
Division New Yorker was there he said

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,869
this said they were terrible I thought

22
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:16,880
they were great I wanted to go up and be

23
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,159
terrible to know he wasn't only person

24
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,479
that was ill at started a band

25
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:25,759
I thought those people who were there we

26
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,740
got the following bands wicked joy

27
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,970
division new order Buzzcocks magazine

28
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,590
Morrissey was there started to Smith

29
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,869
after seeing the Sex Pistols as well as

30
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:39,079
marki Smith from the fall now Mick

31
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,790
Hucknall was also there from simply read

32
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,500
but we don't talk about those bands who

33
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,079
were since the part they were inspired

34
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,420
by the Sex Pistols but those bands also

35
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,100
went on to inspire other bands such as

36
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,640
REM ravana Radiohead's Pixies Beastie

37
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,719
Boys in PJ Harvey all great bands and

38
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,350
Coldplay but we don't talk about that

39
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,600
okay so I'm going to talk about

40
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,490
something that I'm inspired by and that

41
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,120
is you know JavaScript's I you know I

42
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,700
love it and but I've also become

43
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,470
recently become obsessed by something

44
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,930
called the Web Audio API now I don't

45
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,010
know if you know be the Web Audio API

46
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,370
it's basically like in a

47
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,260
high-performance way of manipulating

48
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,950
audio and the browser via JavaScript

49
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,750
we can take audio in process and do

50
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,590
anything we want with it no it's only

51
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,910
available in Chrome Safari and Mobile

52
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,099
Safari the moment but Firefox is looking

53
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:44,270
to implement it as soon as they can know

54
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,310
the way the Web Audio API works it's the

55
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,360
skin a concept of an autograph we're

56
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,280
imagine you had a guitar player but the

57
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,989
guitar like this one there was a strong

58
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:56,720
Accords that signal would travel down or

59
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,840
wire and to maybe an effects pedal like

60
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,360
a distortion pedal that would manipulate

61
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,209
the sound then go into another wire and

62
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:06,890
then maybe to the speakers in this

63
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,140
situation the source node is the guitar

64
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,209
the distortion or it is manipulating

65
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:14,000
that audio and then passing it on to our

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,890
amplifier no the other thing you can do

67
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,489
is that we can create audio completely

68
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:25,100
in the browser from scratch we don't

69
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,080
need to use an mp3 or a wire file or

70
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,080
anything we can just mix own from thin

71
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,880
air it's amazing so I'm going to show

72
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,600
you that just now just get the console

73
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,820
up the first thing we do is we create a

74
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,840
what's known as a context and this is

75
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,810
like I don't know if you have used the

76
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,840
canvas tag which kind of creates an area

77
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,480
that that you can you can draw on and

78
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,209
JavaScript context is a kind of similar

79
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:00,470
thing for audio it can let you it's kind

80
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,000
of world of soda but you can kind of

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,359
paint with sound that's terribly happy

82
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:08,720
and I would hate but that's what you can

83
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,560
do to create context and then from our

84
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,669
context we need a sound source so so in

85
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:18,919
this case I'll make a sine wave but I'll

86
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:21,130
talk a little bit Lisa what sine wave is

87
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:27,340
so we do context not create a oscillator

88
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,870
okay and then we have to get from our

89
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,400
stain wave dot connect to our speakers

90
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,340
in that context our destination

91
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,670
okay so everything's right plugged in

92
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,510
ready to go

93
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,850
the only thing we need to do know is

94
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,380
start the same wave off so it's dot note

95
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,420
on and we're going to do that after the

96
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,300
0 seconds so do we have audio oh it's ok

97
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,840
great so we should hear some beautiful

98
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:06,790
sounds Wow so we can just do my job so

99
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,740
that such creating its own completely in

100
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,300
the browser there was there was nothing

101
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,970
else involved in that and which I think

102
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,910
some you know so you might think that's

103
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,210
just that's just noise pleasant music

104
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,890
that's just a touch so do you think your

105
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:26,150
brain you know know it as some little

106
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,170
thing was used in one of the best

107
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,070
records of all time

108
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,430
good vibrations by the Beach Boys D is a

109
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,100
thing this was an actual theremin which

110
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,630
is slightly different than a normal

111
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,730
theremin with you wave your hands this

112
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,800
one created a sine wave like we just

113
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,700
heard but in a big wooden box now due to

114
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,070
the wonders of a technology I've been

115
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,990
able to shrink that big wooden box down

116
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,140
and to our web browser and we can see

117
00:05:51,140 --> 00:06:01,420
one here so for God idea again it's very

118
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:09,440
space age so if you'll indulge me I'd

119
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,930
like to do a little a little performance

120
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,720
with the theremin with help of my

121
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:24,720
backing ok space the final frontier

122
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,060
these are the voyages of the Starship

123
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,150
Enterprise its five-year mission to

124
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,650
explore strange new worlds to seek out

125
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,430
new life and new civilizations to boldly

126
00:06:38,430 --> 00:07:14,719
go where no man has gone before

127
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:18,479
okay thank you

128
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,679
okay so we're paired the same wave and

129
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:22,809
that's a snake round so it's just you

130
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,999
know a nice and even and the thing is so

131
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:27,639
sounds I just explained waves or what

132
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,550
sound s so does the again a happy phrase

133
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,099
are the vibration of the air it's this

134
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:36,849
idea the the the audio yes sorry the air

135
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:39,309
is oscillating a really high speed and

136
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:42,069
then petting your ear at like 40,000

137
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:44,319
times a second it's really quite

138
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,809
something but the the way we graphically

139
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:49,629
we can graphically represent sound using

140
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:53,800
waves and so different zones look

141
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,839
different so we see the same wave at the

142
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,169
top here and so then we'll get a square

143
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:01,629
wave and a triangle wave so just kind of

144
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:04,599
play one of these Zowie that's a square

145
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:06,429
wave you can hear it signs a little bit

146
00:08:06,429 --> 00:08:08,559
different than before and maybe a

147
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:12,849
triangle wave it's a bit softer so the

148
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:15,430
way that's this kind of way of taking

149
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,529
waves and then manipulating and changing

150
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:20,289
in the shape is basically how to make a

151
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:23,019
synthesizer and that's that's how we we

152
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:26,019
do and that's why I've done here to do

153
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:29,199
the the magic of the Web Audio API and

154
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,289
JavaScript we've got a little keyboard

155
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,149
and so this one just basically contains

156
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:37,870
two different types of waves let's see

157
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,199
let's have a sawtooth and triangle and

158
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:45,470
you can hear

159
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,040
so this sustain we can put this sustain

160
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,490
up and that allows is the sustain is if

161
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,320
you play a notes that's how long that

162
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,670
note takes did they can add icky and

163
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,010
disappear so I can you know like that

164
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,600
hangs around for a while

165
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,090
whereas one really short is just so

166
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,960
again you know this is really easy to do

167
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,730
this isn't any fancy this is just a

168
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,010
different frequency a different Petra

169
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,200
saying to each type of wave and then

170
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,670
they're combined

171
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,150
so I don't know very good keyboard

172
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:41,269
player bit

173
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,380
so so if you want to make your own

174
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,399
synthesizer it's really easy

175
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,779
I've made this thing called QWERTY

176
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:54,459
Hancock which allows you to in started

177
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:56,320
Rafael and it basically takes allows you

178
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,389
to take a vector keyboard and stick it

179
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,269
as a front to your own your own sense

180
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:03,760
and it can take you know keyboard keys

181
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,410
and stuff as well as the mouse so audio

182
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,889
is going on that anyway so what really

183
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:14,110
excites me a bit this is from not

184
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,170
excited all that other stuff it's the

185
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,410
fact that we can now write songs in

186
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,930
JavaScript you know traditionally the

187
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,880
way people wrote songs or was you know

188
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,649
they would you know set up a guitar or

189
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:29,260
piano and you would write a lovely song

190
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,420
and they would take it into the

191
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,620
recording should you do and get it

192
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,820
recorded and you know even more recently

193
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,600
people have been you know rating you

194
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,190
know writing songs that computer but

195
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,769
still this idea of you know you have a

196
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,019
timeline that goes goes from the star

197
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:48,670
all the way to the finish and there's

198
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,410
all these multiple tracks and it's just

199
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,680
you know what we can do is we can be we

200
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,079
can write songs I'll just that's quotes

201
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,040
by the maths was Leibniz he says music

202
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,570
is the pleasure the human mind

203
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,390
experiences from counting without being

204
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,910
aware that it's counting and it's true

205
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:10,570
music is math and and there's nothing

206
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,850
better at counting than a computer

207
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:17,800
so so does anyone have idea an idea what

208
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,699
this does

209
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:34,879
let's hear it it's just it's just a

210
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:37,430
basic drum rock drumbeats you can see

211
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,110
that it's you know it's a four loop and

212
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,420
you know every second beat plays a kick

213
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,699
drum every second beat after that plays

214
00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:46,240
a snare and every beat it plays a hi-hat

215
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,240
no I mean those play functions are

216
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,509
abstracting things a bit but yeah I was

217
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:55,100
using the audio that time that wasn't

218
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,540
synthesized so they were they were

219
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:01,220
samples of real drum kits that you have

220
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,870
to load these in if you're going to use

221
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,120
them in the Web Audio API is different

222
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,910
than just using an audio tag you have to

223
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,329
kind of pull the man via xhr and then

224
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:14,240
can it decode them to the context and

225
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,379
say or you have to load them into the

226
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:17,629
array buffer so again I've created that

227
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:21,319
silly little library to do this called

228
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:23,809
Abbey Lord that you can just gather a

229
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:27,110
whole bunch of a audio paths and it'll

230
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,519
give you a call back telling you where

231
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,019
they're all done in decoded and ready to

232
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:36,019
play so with that we can do something a

233
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:38,240
little more complex so we can mix those

234
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,100
live samples with the synth I made out

235
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:58,519
there

236
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:02,050
me being some sort of audio weskit

237
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,959
because I'm not this is just a nice wave

238
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,550
Audio API that's just this enable this

239
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,390
so that's fantastic

240
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,520
okay enough for that okay you have

241
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,790
written your JavaScript pets it's gonna

242
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,029
sell millions what do you do with it now

243
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:19,990
well I guess you just put it on your

244
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,750
website or you can upload it to get hub

245
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,959
and lay it's you know people remix it

246
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:28,630
for free you know you can create remixes

247
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,730
without this idea of throwing around

248
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,790
massive audio fails because the the fail

249
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,160
is already there this is what to go back

250
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,020
to her Punk analogy the Buzzcocks did

251
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,029
when they first started out they didn't

252
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:44,640
have a record label they just thought

253
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,410
did borrow my place borrow money from

254
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,330
friends and family they borrowed 500

255
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,520
pounds and just went into a recording

256
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,770
studio made a record themselves and put

257
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,839
themselves the meter thousand copies and

258
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,390
it sold it sold out almost instantly so

259
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,610
this idea of self-publishing you know

260
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,800
it's more prominent in ever and it's so

261
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,290
easy to do we don't even have to record

262
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,899
things know that we just have a file

263
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:10,630
format that just make sound that doesn't

264
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,420
need to be recorded so that's this idea

265
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,540
that I'm proposing well only really of a

266
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,510
name that I like for it at the moment

267
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,550
let's say I imagine some sort of format

268
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,800
like jisan

269
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,170
called G songs I don't have anything

270
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,990
more than that and so if you do want to

271
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,390
kind of help me with this to make a kind

272
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,360
of JavaScript spec for four songs on the

273
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,029
way it give me it I show you because all

274
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:42,040
I've got is a title okay something even

275
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,320
more exciting happened two weeks ago and

276
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,070
that is that getusermedia for audio was

277
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,459
enabled in the nightly build of Chrome

278
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:53,790
which means that we can now take audio

279
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,140
exactly what it says we can get user

280
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:01,750
media from from the user

281
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,149
so this allows us to take audio from a

282
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:07,839
make or elena n-- and manipulate it in

283
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,490
the exact same chaining method they

284
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,800
described before so let's give you a

285
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:20,030
little demonstration here if this works

286
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,319
slow like i say this is only my go

287
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:27,819
fullscreen this okay this is the

288
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:31,329
conference crusher unless the side the

289
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:35,769
the more audacious the name of any new

290
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,560
product the we dear it sounds okay so

291
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,959
don't expect anything so the first thing

292
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,910
when you when you use the getusermedia

293
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,560
you get this a little option that says

294
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,319
photo doe wants to use your microphone

295
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:49,500
and you'll see oops yes please

296
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,339
okay so we get that there's something

297
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:59,620
there yeah it's quite quiet so this is

298
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,019
this is a guitar there's no plugins here

299
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:03,550
is no GarageBand there's no anything

300
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,740
this is just a browser this is just a

301
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,269
normal web pages that we're now getting

302
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:12,550
so through you know so it's in it so

303
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,139
that's quite a clean sound right so

304
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,790
that's just that we the we the guitar

305
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,610
things through this little bit of travel

306
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,589
on it but what we can do is we actually

307
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:26,050
take that connect it and actually change

308
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:29,639
the we've forums that are going in okay

309
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:45,230
so we can do

310
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,100
so yes there's nothing more annoying

311
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,240
than watching someone messing around a

312
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,230
guitar so I spare you that so that

313
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,000
results just the same way before just

314
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,700
the sound going down bleeped and then

315
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,700
just the waveform it's it's just a big

316
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,970
array buffer that we can just flap about

317
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,829
any way we want we've so much control

318
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,540
over this so you might notice that

319
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,699
there's a little a back to the future

320
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:12,370
button here just want to show you how

321
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,990
much control we have if you have audio

322
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,520
again okay so no I know that how we're

323
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:34,960
doing it so I just do this that's a bit

324
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:50,420
long no let me try again okay try again

325
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:55,150
yeah it's so let's just show you how

326
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,390
much control we can have and that that's

327
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,340
all done with JavaScript I did we can

328
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,780
just take it somebody went and just hold

329
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,980
on to it for a bit and then do everyone

330
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:11,050
okay so I was really nervous about doing

331
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:15,100
this talk because I change because I'm

332
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,900
not typically someone who gets too

333
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,480
nervous but that's being GS calm for

334
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,990
thought these people are the best at

335
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,180
JavaScript whatever that means

336
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,580
I thought I'm going to be ridiculed

337
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:34,330
because I like semicolons and you know

338
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,460
and so I'm not I'm not like say I'm not

339
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,210
an audio expert I'm not a JavaScript eye

340
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,480
expert I'm you know if anyone says to me

341
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,460
that are an expert or anything just

342
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,900
gonna get a little bit sick in my mouth

343
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,370
you know I think it's a very arrogant

344
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,960
thing to claim that you're an expert and

345
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,550
everything because I think we can always

346
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,890
keep learning

347
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,520
no so I I was concerned I was like why

348
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,680
why is this bothering me because I used

349
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,960
to play in various bands when I was

350
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,350
younger and and we were rubbish but I

351
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,330
still got up and just jumped her own

352
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,010
like an idea and had a great time you

353
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,880
know I couldn't sing it didn't stop me

354
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,020
so by just chance I came across an old

355
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,510
notebook there was I had I used to write

356
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,910
lyrics then which was hilarious in

357
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:29,110
itself but I had this quartz described

358
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,740
at the start by David Burton and it says

359
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,690
the singer was talking heads and he said

360
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,030
the better of the singers voices the

361
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,680
harder it is to believe what they're

362
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,760
saying and that's this I think it's a

363
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,520
great man for anyone who doesn't believe

364
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,670
they're good enough for anything because

365
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,280
what it means to me is that I'm going to

366
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,490
take my weaknesses in tournament to

367
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:58,360
strength that okay I may not be the

368
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,610
greatest program in the world but

369
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,530
there's other things other outside then

370
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,270
and these other things I'm good at they

371
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:09,990
give the things I'm a character I'm

372
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,700
passionate about why I do I believe that

373
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,920
if you're passionate and enjoy what

374
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,230
you're doing it doesn't matter what the

375
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,210
end product is I don't make all of these

376
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,280
things because I thought I was going to

377
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,500
change the world which I'm obviously not

378
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,470
but I did it because I enjoyed it and I

379
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,540
love it and I'm passionate about it I

380
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,790
gave everything I've got to it I really

381
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:40,489
really enjoy it

382
00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:43,269
and so that's why I believe that

383
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:45,489
javascript is a new punk rock because

384
00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:48,669
you can make anything from scratch and

385
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:50,710
it doesn't matter how good it is just

386
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,220
that you enjoyed it so there was this

387
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,179
video by The Godfather of punk a eggie

388
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:00,700
pop there really I think echoes that we

389
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,350
I feel about what I do and what I think

390
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,279
we all do and you know he mentions you

391
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:12,220
mentions men but we hope he applies its

392
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,049
women as well and I would just like to

393
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:22,220
finish on that

394
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,280
you

395
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:41,090
thanks a lot

396
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:52,450
thank you

397
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,519
so you can follow me in these places I'm

398
00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:01,460
on tenth if anyone knows any questions

399
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,190
yeah yeah we've any questions don't be

400
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,179
intimidated come on it's one over there

401
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:12,440
worst concerts I don't know what you

402
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:18,350
want to start a band with me think of a

403
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:21,049
good name we're in okay yeah just wanted

404
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,059
to ask really quick you're obviously not

405
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:26,299
using set time out there are you hey no

406
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:31,639
saw what the Web Audio API has it

407
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:34,909
briefly has its own time system when you

408
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:36,320
create a context that has its own

409
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,350
reference point that's and it does use

410
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,879
eight seconds but those just give you

411
00:22:40,879 --> 00:22:42,799
kind of millisecond or even more than

412
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,169
that control over the timing of things

413
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:47,690
so what happens is you schedule things

414
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,480
up front you see I want all these things

415
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,429
to happen at these time these points in

416
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:55,820
the future so it's yeah so I've I've

417
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,350
actually made some things or some things

418
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,379
on my website the usually said time out

419
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,940
like a drum machine when I was being

420
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,190
shifted and it's like who makes a drum

421
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:09,450
machine note step it's a time out idea

422
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,259
you're a great talker how do you make

423
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:14,600
the Sawtooth and the square waves so

424
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,519
yeah so and there are they're kind of my

425
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:22,610
native concepts to the Web Audio with

426
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,279
API that's when we created an oscillator

427
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,210
at the start there that creates by

428
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,759
default a sine wave no we just we can

429
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:34,279
just change that type by giving a

430
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:38,179
different integer and yes so they're

431
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:45,169
kind of native to the API okay great
