00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,540

all right hello everybody my name is

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:10,950
Julie Bush I work at Conde Nast in New

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,160
York there we go okay so I work at Conde

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,170
Nast in New York it's right there and

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,189
we're going to put this on hold for just

6
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,810
a sec because before we get to business

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,750
I have been advised to be relatable and

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,490
so I'm going to tell you a little bit

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,580
about myself

10
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,750
so I actually don't come from a

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,250
traditional computer science background

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,090
I used to be a stage manager for theater

13
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,920
I'm pretty new to this game I've been

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,570
working for a little over a year and a

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,960
half in the industry to be very

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,670
reductive about what a stage manager is

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,260
just so that you understand the context

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,199
during the rehearsal process the actors

19
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,239
and the director are focusing on the

20
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,940
artistic development of a piece and the

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,829
stage manager is figuring out what needs

22
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,629
to be done to make all of those things

23
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,360
happen in real life and communicating

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,710
with the necessary departments and

25
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,680
people and so on so I was drawn to

26
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,600
coding because it has many parallels

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,299
with the organizational analytical and

28
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,400
problem-solving skills required in stage

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,830
management and also because both fields

30
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,549
are highly collaborative and I'm not a

31
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,619
loner so you know I enjoy working with

32
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,960
other people and coming together to make

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,250
cool stuff lastly I'm also a very long

34
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,409
game kind of person so I've always

35
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:36,390
enjoyed being in a position to watch the

36
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,630
evolution of a product over time it's

37
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,189
just as interesting to watch the process

38
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,290
for me as it is to have a final product

39
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,869
and so now perhaps you'll have some

40
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:51,360
understanding behind what my talk is

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,000
focusing on today so now that you can

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,700
relate to me I am going to go ahead and

43
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,189
get started with creative collaboration

44
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:05,790
building a unified design system so we

45
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,020
left off here conde nast new york as was

46
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,720
mentioned Conde Nast has a lot of

47
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,349
different brands many disparate types

48
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:21,569
and topics and the way that things used

49
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:24,989
to be back in the days of yore was that

50
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:28,440
every different brand had its own team

51
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,480
of Engineers and its own code base for

52
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,700
its website and of course this seemed

53
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,950
sensible because this is a company that

54
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,170
started in print publishing over a

55
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,090
hundred years ago and so the way that

56
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,980
the magazine's work is that they each

57
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,540
have their own separate team so as

58
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,400
digital started to be integrated into

59
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,800
the company you just add people to each

60
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,769
of those teams and you know carry on

61
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,760
but consider that despite the very

62
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,690
distinct tones designs and topics of

63
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,879
each of the brand's their digital needs

64
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,720
are actually overwhelmingly similar for

65
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,840
example some shared site needs include

66
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,019
the ability to show aggregated content

67
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:11,099
which is to say something like a home

68
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:15,390
page or a page showing content by author

69
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:21,269
by by subject you also need to be able

70
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:24,209
to show the actual content itself when

71
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:26,190
someone chooses an article to read or a

72
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,040
gallery to look at and that is pretty

73
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,590
much it that's what we do that's content

74
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,900
and you just need to be able to view it

75
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,690
that's a website for us for the most

76
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:42,290
part so with that being the case having

77
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,269
separate teams for all of the different

78
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:47,280
websites starting to make less and less

79
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,129
sense because with the sites being as

80
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,989
similar as they are in terms of what

81
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:54,330
they need it would make sense that any

82
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,040
feature that works well on one site

83
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,689
would work well on another and we would

84
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:00,599
want to pass it along so I don't need to

85
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,780
go too much into explaining how that's

86
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,989
not really efficient in order to get one

87
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:09,900
feature onto every different brand by

88
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,370
having it passed from brand to brand

89
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,090
with dev time in between and so on so

90
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,420
we've said that was enough of that

91
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,480
and we set forth a plan to create a

92
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,940
single application that would host all

93
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,000
of our sites we'd have a library of

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,730
shared components built in react and

95
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,100
these components would not just be the

96
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,970
visual aspects of the designs but they

97
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,890
would really be like truly plug-and-play

98
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,980
pieces of a website like you put in a

99
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,770
newsletter signup form you pop it in

100
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,960
there and you have a newsletter signup

101
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,130
form it's connected to the API

102
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,570
everything works people can use

103
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,230
immediately as once as soon as it's live

104
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:55,010
and so that's that's our lofty goal to

105
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,930
increase our efficiency to reduce or

106
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,700
done didn't see and it's really be able

107
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,770
to move a lot more quickly in terms of

108
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,870
developing products that will help us

109
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,050
stay innovative and ahead in the media

110
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:11,530
industry so this application which we

111
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,830
lovingly dubbed diverso was what we set

112
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:20,510
out to do a little bit before the end of

113
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,090
last year we started making the server

114
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,290
we moved to working on front-end stuff

115
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,040
near the beginning of this year and so

116
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,350
just for clarity's sake in case you were

117
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,160
wondering this is the deal if you want a

118
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,650
feature to be given to many different

119
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,410
brands all we want to be able to do is

120
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,570
develop it one time hence one clock

121
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,630
inverse oh and then it'll automatically

122
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,240
be available to any brand that is hosted

123
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:53,000
therein and we had a few requirements

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,630
around how we wanted to implement this

125
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,980
because you know without some

126
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,790
limitations

127
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,420
it could very easily be messy

128
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,940
so one thing was that we decided but we

129
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,940
would have no brand specific code

130
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,740
reusability was going to be the key in

131
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,060
terms of everything we did because if we

132
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,480
want to add features they need to be

133
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,300
able to be popped into any given brand

134
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,180
site and working immediately

135
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:29,270
so no brands specific code another is

136
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,220
that we needed to make it scalable be

137
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,700
cuz Conde Nast has over 20 brands right

138
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,670
now we need to support all of those but

139
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,100
also we need to support any number of

140
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,930
brands that they may choose to add in

141
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,510
the future and it should be just as easy

142
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,180
for our application to support 40 brands

143
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,500
as it is for it to support two and

144
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,580
lastly we really needed to get it done

145
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,270
as fast as possible that is because I

146
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,030
think that the you know the business

147
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,240
advantage here is clear in terms of

148
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,590
restructuring the team and you know how

149
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,960
the websites work and also because we

150
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,790
don't want to have to support both

151
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,030
legacy websites and this new app

152
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,960
concurrently for too long at the time

153
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,160
and perhaps most importantly because you

154
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,710
can't go to a brand and say hey we

155
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,210
figured out a way to make a really cool

156
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,520
application that's gonna be really great

157
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,100
for everyone in everything and we're

158
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,630
gonna stop working on what you've got

159
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,860
going on right now so we can work on

160
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,790
that and we'll be done in five years

161
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,410
okay bye so with that being the case

162
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:40,419
time was of the essence so really how

163
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:45,919
how indeed mr. walberg JSON JSON is

164
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,940
perhaps not the not what you would

165
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,700
expect for an answer to this question

166
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,190
and you probably also wouldn't expect it

167
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,630
to have exclamation points like that

168
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,820
because I feel like it's not typically

169
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:04,520
so exciting but here it is the the main

170
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,470
way that we were going to pull off this

171
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:10,040
system was by having every brand based

172
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,040
in a configuration in that way we would

173
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,590
be able to not have any unique logic

174
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,910
written within our components and still

175
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,490
have all of the brand's maintain their

176
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,020
you know unique visual appearance

177
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,130
because you know the differences need to

178
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,979
live somewhere otherwise you've made a

179
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:32,539
lot of people really angry and you've

180
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,900
just made one website so how does that

181
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,530
work in terms of the like what does this

182
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:43,610
configuration file look like so this is

183
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,790
an example

184
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,990
of how we started going about with here

185
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,630
colors one of the many many things that

186
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,730
need to be uniquely adjusted for every

187
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,680
brand so you'll see that we have these

188
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,540
different key value pairs and these are

189
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,380
referred to as design tokens the design

190
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,190
token just being the name of the unique

191
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,160
bit that is being used as the dynamic

192
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,850
element of a certain website that gets

193
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,000
changed on a brand by brand basis so

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,360
here our palette has different color

195
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,110
values and then we have different use

196
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,010
cases where we were creating tokens that

197
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,829
were semantically named but still

198
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:34,110
decoupled from their usage again for

199
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,880
reusability we didn't want to name

200
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,829
something you know footer link because

201
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,380
theoretically that everything should be

202
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,720
somewhat consistent and you might want

203
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,910
to use that link token again elsewhere

204
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,720
that's not a footer and you know you

205
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:59,579
don't confuse people so so how does that

206
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:04,730
actually become styles what we did was

207
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,610
set up our JSON to be loaded into our

208
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,279
Styles which we were writing in sass as

209
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,300
a map and then from there we can do

210
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,370
things like make this nifty function you

211
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,160
see at the bottom that just references

212
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,079
the map to get a color value and then

213
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:28,019
you can use that function like so in the

214
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:31,440
sass and without having written anything

215
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,920
brand specific within your Styles you're

216
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,709
getting brand specific values based on

217
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:43,860
what your domain is also how is atomic

218
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,880
design you may have heard of atomic

219
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,029
design if not is essentially just a way

220
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:53,220
of sorting things from the smallest most

221
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,589
indivisible pieces and combining them

222
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,779
into larger pieces

223
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:59,759
this was against a way that we chose to

224
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,350
do things for the sake of reusability we

225
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,360
actually hired Brad Frost who wrote the

226
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,850
book atomic design and who is the source

227
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,399
of this image as a consultant on this

228
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,290
project and he did say that while he has

229
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,629
a ton of experience making design

230
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:20,879
systems for individual brands what we

231
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,309
were really doing was making a design

232
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:25,769
system of design systems and he didn't

233
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,110
really know how it was gonna work so we

234
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,639
were going into uncharted territory here

235
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:37,980
and so without really a case study to go

236
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,730
off of

237
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,449
in terms of workflow and such we set out

238
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:44,129
with our initial process and the way

239
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:46,139
that we thought was best to get started

240
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,540
which was to reverse engineer the design

241
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,420
system from the existing brand designs

242
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,449
because we did want to give the brand's

243
00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:56,689
some assurance that they would not be

244
00:11:56,689 --> 00:12:00,509
losing a lot of their uniqueness in this

245
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:02,430
changeover that we wouldn't be just

246
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,259
producing cookie-cutter websites that

247
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:05,699
just you know changed the logo at the

248
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:07,319
top or something everyone was very

249
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:09,180
concerned about maintaining their design

250
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,350
integrity and so it made sense for us to

251
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,290
start with the original designs in order

252
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:20,699
to maintain that so we would get design

253
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:24,209
specs as usual with just an image of a

254
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:26,910
page make this thing have it look like

255
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:31,110
this have it work there you go and it

256
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,629
would be up to the engineers to actually

257
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:38,040
find and separate out the different

258
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,350
components that would be part of the

259
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,040
atomic model and also to decide how to

260
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,399
make those different dynamic elements

261
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,550
between brands into tokens that would

262
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:54,769
then be part of this JSON configuration

263
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:57,629
getting started we went with two of the

264
00:12:57,629 --> 00:13:00,269
more minimally designed brands and chose

265
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:03,179
them for the pilot run of a templates in

266
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:05,420
this case here was the contributor page

267
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,129
so you'll see we started with Golf

268
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:11,250
Digest and self which are

269
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,950
somewhat similar few things differing

270
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,070
mainly the shape of the images that's

271
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,720
you know the most distinct thing a

272
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,300
couple of quirky nav decorations at the

273
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:27,210
top there and in order to get this app

274
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,870
running we decided to go with two to

275
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,760
start with and then add the rest of the

276
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,420
brands in in stages so we were going for

277
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,640
a process that we intended to be very

278
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,070
iterative so we started with the first

279
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,130
two brands very similar here and here

280
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,340
built an app and then would loop in

281
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,120
another brand that's a little more

282
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,120
complex and another brand and so on and

283
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,720
our theory was that eventually once we

284
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,850
had gotten all of the brands supported

285
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,220
in our application we would be able to

286
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,220
support any other design that came our

287
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,050
way we would have all of the knobs and

288
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,050
switches needed and everyone would live

289
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:13,190
happily ever after

290
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,120
that didn't happen right away so there

291
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,520
were some things that we found in this

292
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,839
approach that were not ideal first of

293
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,150
all I did mention the speed thing where

294
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,760
it was of the essence to get this

295
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,390
project done as quickly as possible and

296
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,980
with the setup that we had multiple

297
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,720
engineering teams couldn't work

298
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,510
concurrently because merging without

299
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,140
conflicts was essentially impossible

300
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,680
that is because with the JSON

301
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,940
configuration with it being up to the

302
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,250
developers to decide exactly how to

303
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,040
abstract different parts of a visual

304
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,750
design into a purely data based form was

305
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,730
well not not only difficult more

306
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,950
difficult than you might think in terms

307
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,930
of making it make sense

308
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:11,300
and having it be semantic and reusable

309
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,680
but people would make different

310
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,800
decisions that would cover different

311
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,839
things thinking that they were different

312
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,610
things but they weren't for example

313
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,870
people would be working on the

314
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,810
contributor page you might set up the

315
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,230
in a certain shape to cover a certain

316
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,900
piece of the design such as let's say

317
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,400
the difference between the image shapes

318
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,220
and another team working on say an

319
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,430
article page would set up a shape of a

320
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,250
JSON config and it would be made to

321
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,460
adjust the image shapes and not only

322
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,680
would those thing pieces of code

323
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,290
conflict but they're duplicates of each

324
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,680
other and so we can't just have 17 ways

325
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,770
of doing everything in this file and so

326
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,080
then we would have to sync up on it and

327
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,890
decide which approach to take that

328
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,260
brings us to another finding which was

329
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,350
that we were having constant meetings in

330
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,150
order to try to keep everybody on sync

331
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:14,279
with this project it was there were

332
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,830
almost more meetings in a day than there

333
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,500
was time to code really because it's

334
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,650
just not really feasible to keep a

335
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,170
multitude of teams or even just a few

336
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,790
teams it's very hard to keep people

337
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:31,800
synced to the moment on a line-by-line

338
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,070
basis in a gigantic JSON configuration

339
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,050
file and know that nobody is stepping on

340
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,820
anybody else's toes that nobody's

341
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,730
duplicating anybody else's work so the

342
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,070
constant meetings were a very valiant

343
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,250
effort I will say to end that but there

344
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,870
just aren't enough hours in the day and

345
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,150
lastly it was hard to create a system

346
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,540
with these problems because with the

347
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,570
ensuing chaos that that's just not a

348
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,030
system if you have all sorts of ways of

349
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:07,630
doing things just looped in there ad hoc

350
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,429
so with this information we decided to

351
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:14,280
completely turn around the approach we

352
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,449
were taking to building this application

353
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:19,079
and focus first and foremost on the

354
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,750
system itself not the end product that

355
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,480
we were trying to achieve but the pieces

356
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,390
that would become the end product so

357
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,210
in this case I think of it as making the

358
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,250
bricks before the house whereas before

359
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,710
the house was coming first and bricks

360
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,190
were being pulled from the house

361
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,140
magically except not because magic spot

362
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,230
real and neither was the way that

363
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:51,750
working on that project was going so the

364
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,429
designers actually needed to get a lot

365
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:56,030
more involved in the implementation

366
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,770
usually as I mentioned they hand off a

367
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,980
design a nice you know flashy finished

368
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,620
product and it doesn't matter how you

369
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,010
make it happen as long as it happens and

370
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,350
in this case we found that design needed

371
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,940
to be the first people thinking about

372
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,070
how to make it happen so that rather

373
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,919
than having all of the engineers

374
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,890
deciding on a day by day basis just as

375
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,260
they were going through tickets what to

376
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,140
turn into a token what not to how to

377
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,640
structure that JSON naming and so forth

378
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,500
the tokens were determined by the

379
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,049
designers up front so we started getting

380
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:35,880
specs like these that were much more

381
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,720
technical where this is also you'll

382
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,260
notice not a brand but just a general

383
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:46,440
brand list template and the designer set

384
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,900
it up so that they could decide all of

385
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,090
the things that they felt they needed to

386
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,039
achieve the unique designs of all the

387
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,789
brands and labeled them upfront and

388
00:18:55,789 --> 00:18:58,710
decided how they wanted to structure it

389
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,299
in a way that made sense to them since

390
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,159
they're the ones ultimately assigning

391
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:05,190
these tokens to their designs when they

392
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,190
create them and then handing it over to

393
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,090
us where we would just need to make this

394
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,590
completely brand agnostic entirely

395
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:17,460
reusable template and fill in the blanks

396
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,530
when it came to what parts of the

397
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:25,590
template were dynamic this is a little

398
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,159
bit more of a detailed view of that spec

399
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:30,330
just in case you wanted to take a look

400
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,000
you can see that each of the blue

401
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,250
circles on the top part our numbers

402
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,750
labeling the different things that a

403
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,580
designer wants to be able to control on

404
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,880
a brand basis

405
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,610
and then they've hopefully listed out

406
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:51,160
all of the things just like a blueprint

407
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,570
so we also had to end the merge conflict

408
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,300
madness which wasn't going to stop just

409
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,310
because the tokens were handed over to

410
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,640
designers for their ideation with the

411
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,160
JSON going directly into component

412
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,770
Styles as people were working on those

413
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,230
new specs that I mentioned there was

414
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,470
still the high potential for chaos and

415
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,310
despair so in order to rectify that

416
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,460
situation we decided to actually put the

417
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,980
JSON configurations in the hands of a

418
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,410
single team who would be the gatekeepers

419
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,410
and set up a layer of abstraction

420
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:30,330
between the JSON and the component

421
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,390
styles that would allow developers to

422
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:37,230
make the component styles safely in

423
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:41,340
peace and so we called it our SAS API

424
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,050
because it was a layer that we created

425
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,150
within the SAS itself in order to

426
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:49,620
isolate the JSON from just the everyday

427
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:54,510
developer making patterns so the SAS API

428
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,790
starts out with the same sort of JSON as

429
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,880
we looked at before and rather than

430
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,850
going directly into a function that gets

431
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:07,710
used to set a style as we saw we first

432
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,920
create a variable that's using that same

433
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,110
function we were using before and it has

434
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:17,160
the information needed for the token

435
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,540
that it represents so we made a one

436
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,910
variable in this case per color token we

437
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,690
made mix-ins for the typography and took

438
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,580
every token that design handed to us

439
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,930
and made some sort of SAS mixin or

440
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:38,490
variable to cover it and in this way any

441
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,860
developer working on one of the

442
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,290
components would just have to use the

443
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,170
variable in order to style it and that

444
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,270
was then safe because should the

445
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,670
structure of the JSON change which it

446
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:55,500
was likely to do or if anything

447
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,560
went wrong or broke anything behind the

448
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,440
Sasse api could happen without us

449
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,710
needing to update every single instance

450
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:07,430
in which a token was used across

451
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:10,410
numerous components all we needed to do

452
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,750
was update the definition of its

453
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,570
representation in the SAS API and then

454
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:21,090
everything would be good again further

455
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,120
we worked on automating the creation of

456
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,720
these JSON files one of the JSON files I

457
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,310
would say one of the smaller ones is

458
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,710
about 1300 lines it just goes up from

459
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,100
there and you probably just don't want

460
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,310
to hand copy that so this is an example

461
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:41,240
of the way that the designers in this

462
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,370
new way of doing things started creating

463
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,530
their sketch files for the brand's

464
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,920
themselves making tables of all of the

465
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,690
different values that they wanted for

466
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,370
the different tokens that would end up

467
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,960
creating unique results within our

468
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,280
application and as I said it's just not

469
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,890
practical in any way for us to be adding

470
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,730
brands by manually coding this into a

471
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,330
configuration so the designers and an

472
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,620
engineer worked together to actually

473
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,890
create a sketch plugin written in cocoa

474
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,850
script that would scrape the files which

475
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:21,540
the designers normalized for us so that

476
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,930
there would be a predictable output and

477
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:27,960
this little button here produces a JSON

478
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,320
file

479
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,690
in a minute listen a minute I mean it's

480
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:35,550
a computer so this is a big game changer

481
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,820
in terms of moving forward just setting

482
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:44,760
up brands adding to our application so

483
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,650
the results as I said multiple

484
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,540
engineering teams were able to work

485
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,210
concurrently on components after these

486
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,700
changes that's because with the SAS API

487
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,570
and without tens of hands mucking around

488
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,510
in the JSON everyone was able to work on

489
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,300
separate templates an article a gallery

490
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,850
whatever they needed without being

491
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:09,240
without

492
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,770
having to interfere with anybody else's

493
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,450
work and that gave teams a lot more

494
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,520
autonomy as well because they didn't

495
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,950
need to have several meetings with other

496
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,600
teams in order to come to an agreement

497
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,130
on how they were going to do things the

498
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,360
way that things were going to be done

499
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,560
was being determined higher up than that

500
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,860
further the design system actually

501
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,960
became a system so instead of it being

502
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,690
just drawn from visual designs by

503
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,510
engineers the designers creating it

504
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,830
really took it and made it what they

505
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,620
needed it to be

506
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,310
and lastly which was the ultimate goal

507
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,890
of verso pages are able to be created

508
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,450
and used by all brands immediately

509
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,130
because before we were going to add

510
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,830
brands one at a time so that our app

511
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,630
would only support what we had already

512
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,350
woven into that sort of diagram there

513
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:04,340
now with brand agnostic components

514
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,980
anytime a brand is added via config to

515
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,710
the app it automatically has access to

516
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,930
everything within the app any feature it

517
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,630
wants or needs and that wouldn't be

518
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,000
possible if we hadn't switched the way

519
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,750
that we start working from design first

520
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:29,340
to bricks and pieces first so that's

521
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,290
what we did and we continue to do that

522
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:34,560
we are actually in the process of

523
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,870
cutting over brands from their legacy

524
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,210
applications to verso little by little

525
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,130
we have some brands at a hundred percent

526
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,710
of traffic going to verso depending on

527
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:48,060
the content type and we just keep on

528
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,820
adding and adding to them and someday

529
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,610
all of our pages will be coming from

530
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:56,640
verso each and every one and the

531
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,060
prophecy will be fulfilled

532
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,880
so thank you very much I'm Julie Bush

533
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,820
I'm a curmudgeon so I only participate

534
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,950
in LinkedIn you will not find me on

535
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,110
Twitter or elsewhere if you want to

536
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,120
friend me or I guess in this case it

537
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,000
would be colleague in me leave a little

538
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,770
note because otherwise I'll think your

539
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:20,410
spam so I appreciate your attention and

540
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:25,780
excellent let's have a good afternoon
