00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,630

when you think about a conference you

2
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,359
can draw some parallels to what a

3
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,880
conference is versus our sort of daily

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,760
work that we do in some ways a

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,189
conference is kind of our Olympics or

6
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,469
its kind of our space launch or our

7
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,079
Grand Prix and I guess we all kind of

8
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,180
just win by being here together I mean

9
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,020
it's not every day that you get to

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,600
launch rockets but I think that this is

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,640
this is one of those such occasions I

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,440
think we should enjoy being here

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,030
together especially at the first CSS

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,230
come here in Asia which i think is

15
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,850
 incredible because Singapore is

16
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,059
incredible because Singapore is
amazing and I am really really happy to

17
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,629
be here as well today my talk is not a

18
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,470
it's not about code it's about being a

19
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,700
coder I guess or designer I'm asking the

20
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,010
question what are we doing anyway and I

21
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,930
talked about the Space Launch is if that

22
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,880
was something that we aren't sort of

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,689
really doing you know we're often like

24
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,180
this is our environment we sit looking

25
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,250
at a terminal with a blinking cursor and

26
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,090
we're typing in there all day or maybe

27
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,740
we're hitting reload all day and

28
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,390
swearing at a browser and looking at the

29
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,020
box model and I think what's really kind

30
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,090
of interesting when you think about what

31
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,390
it is that we do we you know I mean

32
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,869
before the web was this intangible thing

33
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,270
you know when we had big CRT monitors

34
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,299
that sat on the back of our desks you

35
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,810
know it like we had no connection to to

36
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,860
the web but what's really interesting

37
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,520
about now is that we're just surrounding

38
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,719
ourselves in their screens and they're

39
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,280
just smaller they're in our pockets and

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,810
they're in out bags and there are no

41
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,880
tiny laptops and so we don't have

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,119
tangibility over our work really but

43
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,799
it's just closer so we tell ourselves

44
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,149
that it's okay and we're actually

45
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,130
building something visible or not

46
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,390
anyway I'll introduce myself super

47
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,540
quickly I'm Ben I'm from Melbourne

48
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,950
Australia I'd say that I was a designer

49
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,000
but I would be lying I didn't go to

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,100
design school I did art in high school

51
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,620
and that was about my sort of design

52
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,070
background I studied multimedia design

53
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,750
I'd say I was a developer but I didn't

54
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,620
study in computer science so i guess i

55
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,780
would say that i was i just build things

56
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,120
for the web i'm mostly self-taught like

57
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,420
probably a lot of you are I certainly

58
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,310
didn't start doing stuff for the web

59
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,840
because it was easy to describe to my

60
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,440
parents I just did it because I was

61
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,180
working on a computer and I was really

62
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,770
interested in how I created something

63
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,230
and I think that's probably true for a

64
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,030
lot of you here how many people are

65
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,250
self-taught wait sheriff you okay maybe

66
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,550
fifty percent i think i think you know

67
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,440
maybe we get into doing what we're doing

68
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,180
because we have this sort of dedication

69
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,340
to a creative endeavor or we're just

70
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,110
chasing a desire to learn how to do

71
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,700
something also i forgot to mention it so

72
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,670
I'm a contractor I work for sort of

73
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,090
maybe four to six companies a year I'm

74
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,010
one of the three founding members of CSS

75
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,450
conf Australia and I just try to build

76
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,160
stuff that I enjoy doing and that's

77
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,140
that's what my talk today about it is

78
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,100
about but the actual fact is that I have

79
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,540
no idea what I'm doing today I'm going

80
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,930
to talk about fun and goofy or fun /

81
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,440
goofy over profit so let's think about

82
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,720
that for a second what is fun and goofy

83
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,850
funds pretty self-explanatory but what

84
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,239
is goofy goofy means like fully ashore

85
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,400
just harmlessly eccentric and so I'm

86
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,260
talking about the the idea of building

87
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,209
things just for the hell of it just for

88
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:13,739
like the sake of learning or just for

89
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,530
having fun

90
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,120
so I would say im doing this but I have

91
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,240
no idea why I just am Brad bells at

92
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,950
cascadia jeaious said creative clewd is

93
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,910
an experiment with the goal of

94
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,880
surprising and delighting I think it's

95
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,050
much easier to say that something is

96
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,320
goofy but that's just me he also goes on

97
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,980
to say that when you do something that

98
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,820
is an experiment you do it because it

99
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,550
might make you a better engineer you

100
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,169
don't necessarily just quit your job but

101
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:50,580
you know maybe you should just take a

102
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,240
day off and try to build something so

103
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,100
I'm going to tell you a story I bring

104
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,300
water somebody's water I'm going to

105
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:08,430
drink it anyway tasty all right

106
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,870
so I'm going to tell you a couple of

107
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,560
stories today and they're just sort of

108
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,840
points in my career over the last 13

109
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,820
years they're not like the best things

110
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,770
I've ever worked on they're not things

111
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,170
that may be made more money than other

112
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,500
stuff that I've done but I think they're

113
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,330
interesting for the sake of they were

114
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:34,090
really fun but they were seriously goofy

115
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:40,680
okay one afternoon sometime in 2009 i

116
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,510
was i was actually putting together a

117
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,430
series of html5 workshops this is when

118
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,040
here smell 5 was a new thing we still

119
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,680
called html5 her for one thing I was I

120
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,630
went to a meet up and I said hey I think

121
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,240
I'm gonna maybe do some workshops she

122
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,320
would be interested in doing it it's

123
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,540
gonna be a whole day there'll be 300

124
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,530
bucks who wants to come 70 people in the

125
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,330
room with their hands up and I sort of

126
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,920
looked at the ground really nervously

127
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,440
and I said I'll get back to you and two

128
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,880
weeks later I put aside up and I sold

129
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,820
all of my tickets in like an hour

130
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,920
suddenly I had like fifteen thousand

131
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,570
dollars in my bank account and I had no

132
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,360
idea what I was doing I had a date I had

133
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,520
a venue but I still have no idea what I

134
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,730
was doing and I guess what I wanted to

135
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,320
do was I just wanted to know everything

136
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,530
I didn't want somebody to be able to say

137
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,570
well what happens when that doesn't work

138
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,980
in this browser or what happens in this

139
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,590
situation I didn't want to be blah so I

140
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,380
started reading w3c's facts and I just

141
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,210
wanted to know how does everything work

142
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,100
I'll just I'll just read

143
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,960
everything and nobody would be able to

144
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,580
prove me wrong and I started and I

145
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,980
quickly realized that w3c specifications

146
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,560
are not built for normal people they're

147
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,260
built for people he told browsers and so

148
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,150
I mean I was going to get to the

149
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,770
workshop eventually I was eventually

150
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,690
going to start preparing that I mean it

151
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,910
was only in a week and i had only you

152
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,230
know taking a lot of people's money and

153
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,000
by that point and so I was madly

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,010
researching I took like time off work

155
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,480
and I was just reading and researching

156
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,630
and trying to develop this content but I

157
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,070
stopped and I I just did something

158
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,420
there's a little hack project one

159
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,380
afternoon I went into devtools and I

160
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,180
started messing around with the

161
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,440
developer

162
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,800
improved like the spec information I

163
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,720
started changing margins and tweaking

164
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,370
the typography and changing the line

165
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,450
heights of everything just trying to

166
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,460
make everything more readable because I

167
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,520
didn't really want what i was looking at

168
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,150
and I thought hey this is this is pretty

169
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,730
cool maybe I'll maybe I'll show it to a

170
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,860
co-worker and you know maybe I'll make a

171
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,420
little bookmarklet out of this thing and

172
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,390
so I did and I tap you know quickly as

173
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,240
fast as I could in under an hour made

174
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,890
this little bookmarklet that basically

175
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,470
took this pic added these weird styles

176
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,240
that I decided were better than the

177
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,060
other ones for whatever reason and I I'd

178
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,520
showed it to my friend Anthony pushed it

179
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,620
took your hub and a day or two later I

180
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,450
just tweeted like oh hey here's some

181
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:10,230
user styles good luck does it I thought

182
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,730
the project was earlier and for the next

183
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,920
three hours I watched my phone explode

184
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,860
in ways that I had never seen my phone

185
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,710
exploited I have been working on open

186
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,990
source for a long time and I was kind of

187
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,890
building things that I thought were

188
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,140
interesting I wasn't really getting that

189
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,550
much attention and this thing that I

190
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,530
just kind of threw together when I was

191
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,590
just messing about you know

192
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,120
procrastinating essentially suddenly was

193
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,150
making my phone melt on my desk on the

194
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,150
fourth hour Paul Irish retweeted it my

195
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:47,520
phone exploited for this evening and the

196
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,050
next day paul got in touch and he

197
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,820
actually sent me a pull request and the

198
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,380
pleura quest was like oh hey I fixed

199
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,910
your fonts in Firefox because

200
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,650
cross-domain issues it wasn't working

201
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,430
whatever I said hey cool thanks Paul

202
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,320
George did I was like oh my god this guy

203
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,730
actually knows who I am this is super

204
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,780
cool what was one of my heroes and the

205
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,370
next thing was I got an email from him

206
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,430
saying hey what are you on gchat

207
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,810
suddenly pulled message mean he's like

208
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,880
hey what up no seriously the

209
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,170
conversation that was I'd look back

210
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,490
through my message history that was the

211
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,650
message he sent me friendliness guy ever

212
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,890
and what was really interesting was that

213
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,690
like like I said this was something that

214
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,250
I just threw out and I didn't think was

215
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,230
important or interesting even I was just

216
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,080
doing it for the hell of it but I wasn't

217
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,540
just pull other people kept coming out

218
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,830
of the woodwork other people from

219
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,370
organizations like W

220
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,380
see people like Steve Souders and people

221
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,730
who work for browser companies were

222
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,960
actually interested in the work that I

223
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,070
was doing people that I respected you

224
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,690
know it wasn't just dorks on the

225
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,890
internet these were like my heroes a

226
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,089
little while later this is a great shot

227
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:55,089
of me mid-speech I look much younger but

228
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:57,700
still be looking of course so this is my

229
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,230
talk from web directions 2010 so this

230
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,870
was a little bit longer and I was on

231
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,000
this whole tip about how evil the w3c

232
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,370
were that um what was really fun that in

233
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,900
in between those few months of me

234
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,610
throwing out the sort of bookmarklet and

235
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,600
this point here was that mike smith from

236
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,750
w3c got in touch and i actually went to

237
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,120
tokyo for a conference or something else

238
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,020
and mike said you want to grab a beer of

239
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,310
course i wanna grab a beer let's hang

240
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:34,450
out let's let's meet each other and what

241
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,580
followed was really interesting Mike had

242
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,050
actually been working on a specification

243
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:42,400
that he called html5 for authors and the

244
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,810
idea of hicksville five four authors was

245
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,300
that he took the w3c spec removed all of

246
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,370
the crazy browser implementation crap

247
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,220
and just shipped a much smaller version

248
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,900
of the spec it looked the same but it

249
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,520
was the content was slightly different

250
00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:00,490
smaller and we kept talking and you know

251
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,779
we're you know chatting a little bit

252
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:06,400
from the same talk this is from you know

253
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,310
the same the same moment in time during

254
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,440
this talk Mike and I have been working

255
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,160
together and we actually took my my

256
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,660
styles and pulled them out of the

257
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,070
bookmarklet and fix them and worked on

258
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,480
it for a bit and you'll see this is Mike

259
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,170
here and what we did during this talk

260
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,529
was I mean he works for w3c any have

261
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:33,190
access to deploy stuff so we didn't ask

262
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,230
anybody but we just hook the user styles

263
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,380
and put them on his spec on the w3c side

264
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,400
and hit deployed from the front row of

265
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,020
my talk which I thought was the coolest

266
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,820
 thing in the world

267
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,070
thing in the world
and I realized holy my work is

268
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,620
running on their domain I got pulled

269
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,560
down you should really want to but it

270
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,330
lost it a few weeks but some people

271
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,959
weren't so happy it was it was pretty

272
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:04,339
amazing a little bit later on after a

273
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:06,170
few months of nagging whole Irish

274
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,450
convinced me to start joining RC told me

275
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,120
a few channels to join and this

276
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,209
conversation took place I actually took

277
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:19,850
this from the logs from 2010 uh so in

278
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:24,890
hixson okay there we go there it is um

279
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,339
to kick see up here was like oh hey I

280
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:30,140
thought this was really cool the work

281
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,120
that you did what do you say we put it

282
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,209
on what's up ug so we did we we shipped

283
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:41,060
this month or so later he just gave me

284
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,560
access to deploy whatever I wanted and

285
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,050
here we are it's been online for five

286
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:49,250
years now it was the thirst w3c extended

287
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,709
spec that you know obviously what WG so

288
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:53,480
is kind of at that point but

289
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,630
that's a whole other story it was

290
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,700
offline capable so you could go into

291
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,350
your tablet and it would sink down to

292
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,180
your device and I was documentation

293
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,300
looked a little bit better whatever it

294
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,610
was cool but I had no friggin idea that

295
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,100
when i SAT there in 2009 riding a goofy

296
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,630
little bookmarklet that I scared to one

297
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,160
friend that this would happen months

298
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,540
later did I'd be working with these

299
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:22,899
people so as an extension of my talk I

300
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:25,220
wanted to talk more about commercial

301
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,770
versus fun and don't it's entirely

302
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,459
possible that you here will work you

303
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:37,459
know a full visit II busy lucrative

304
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:40,420
career doing good work for good people

305
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,470
and your impact on the world will

306
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,730
actually be minor you're not going to

307
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,860
disrupt an industry you're not gonna

308
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,269
you're not gonna fix anything you're

309
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:48,949
just going to build good stuff forget

310
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:51,199
people and that's okay that's totally

311
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,800
fine

312
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,000
one of the frustrating things about our

313
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,560
industry is that predicts die and when a

314
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,870
project dies underneath you you lose a

315
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,920
little bit of yourself too how many show

316
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,170
of hands how many times have you lost

317
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,010
something after three months of work not

318
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,460
too many six months 12 months like

319
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,990
entire products disappearing there's

320
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:21,670
couple of folks even good for dicks diet

321
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,330
I worked on a few projects that died

322
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,630
after investing a lot of time and money

323
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,190
into them and they've disappeared from

324
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,570
underneath me and I had no idea that

325
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:37,180
they even kind of came or left and I now

326
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,890
I guess you know I work for myself and I

327
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,920
am and celery and I'm I'm the person who

328
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,170
maintains my own happiness and I'm the

329
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,970
person has to pay my salary and my super

330
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,710
and worried about my next contracts

331
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,990
coming in if the contracts good and if I

332
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,760
need to like yell at my client for some

333
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,890
reason it kind of sucks but I think it's

334
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,410
really important that we focus for fun

335
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:08,890
it's this world so this is a project

336
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,610
that started in my office we were

337
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,300
drinking beer it was 35 degrees so it's

338
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,150
kind of Singapore ish we were in a

339
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,590
warehouse office that had no air

340
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,080
conditioning so it was 35 degrees inside

341
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,630
we were you know beating sweat down our

342
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,790
heads and we'd all been doing client

343
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,230
work for the day and we were all kind of

344
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,190
a little bit over it in the office we

345
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,110
had just bought a projector and so

346
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,810
basically we were projecting anything we

347
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,440
could onto the wall funnily enough we

348
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,910
started just projecting gifts because

349
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:48,130
gifts are here are the people who there

350
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,750
there's me eating a doughnut probably

351
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,680
wasn't eating a doughnut right down

352
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,680
there is Glenn Madden there is Tim Lucas

353
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,790
and there's Josh episode disorder myself

354
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,190
Glennon's him or CSS conf australia by

355
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,350
the way and josh is just a rad friends

356
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,860
that was so visiting the office that day

357
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,720
now we sat down and we started working

358
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,480
on this thing called gift city i'm going

359
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,910
to show you give city hopefully just

360
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,200
remember this is the internet and I

361
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,180
don't moderate this content so if

362
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,700
anything comes up that should I'll do my

363
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:37,770
best ok cool ok so this is gift city

364
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,450
gift city as you can tell is full screen

365
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:48,510
gets cool it has basically node features

366
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:55,840
except for this guy

367
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,060
so what gives city does is we take the

368
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,060
name of a tumblr and we hit the tumblr

369
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,510
API and we just look for gifts pretty

370
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,740
great right we have only a couple of

371
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,020
features we have the X button which if a

372
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,459
gift comes up that's a little bit rude

373
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:15,110
for the office it is tumblr after all

374
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,780
you hit X and it will remove that gift

375
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,150
and never ever show it again it's kind

376
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,870
of great and the gifts are random this

377
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,189
is one of my favorite tumblers code

378
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:29,679
classic but in the source we actually

379
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,549
know in source we actually keep a list

380
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:36,200
of a couple of our favorite tumblers in

381
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:43,220
here let's see let's find some good we

382
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,760
got some adventure time fans here no

383
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,330
want just right come on you're lying to

384
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:56,360
me adventure time is the best okay and

385
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,640
so what's happening here is it's hitting

386
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,549
the tumblr API for both the classics

387
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:04,429
tumblr blog and the adventure time gifts

388
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:07,039
blog it's found that many gifts and it

389
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,260
just keeps traversing through the API

390
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,059
and trying to download more and more and

391
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:14,900
more gifts as you'll notice the URL bar

392
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,780
updates and the query string shows the

393
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,460
tumblers that we actually have in there

394
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,360
so if you wanted to you could actually

395
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:30,370
get the URL actually go on edit the URL

396
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,860
just put anything in there it goes and

397
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:39,690
downloads them it's pretty good

398
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:46,930
everything else okay

399
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,040
we set a couple of rules for the for a

400
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,780
gift city we want allowed to use any

401
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,120
JavaScript libraries we went allowed to

402
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,940
use any JavaScript to do the like little

403
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,560
pop down thing for that we're using the

404
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,960
CSS target selector because why would

405
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,580
you use javascript because we're CSS

406
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,700
badasses of course and we didn't wanna

407
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,960
use libraries we just wanted to do fun

408
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,320
and dumb JavaScript you know Smashing

409
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,420
API and put your API key in the source

410
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,870
code of course that's gonna be amazing

411
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,090
we focused on fun and so a couple of

412
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,530
things happened like we were doing this

413
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,850
in our office and drinking beer and

414
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,680
hanging out is pretty great and when

415
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,880
somebody else would come in the office

416
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,500
we would just start like putting gift

417
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,120
city on and showing them gifts and

418
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,030
playing music and you know just inviting

419
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,940
people into our office to hang and we

420
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:39,370
kept going okay cool we kept going and

421
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,900
we thought we were really cool we

422
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,630
started going to hack events and camp

423
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,960
JSE's and stuff like that and there was

424
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,300
one point where we at a New Year's Eve

425
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,900
party we were projecting gifts 40 40

426
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,120
foot high on to a factory building

427
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,710
across from the rooftop that we were on

428
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,350
which we thought was pretty cool kind of

429
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,670
dorks I guess we took a projector to a

430
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,720
camp and dragged out a cable that was 50

431
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,790
meters long the power cable and started

432
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:16,040
projecting onto trees it didn't really

433
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,700
end there for like Tim and Josh and

434
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,250
myself it ended there we were done but

435
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:28,070
Glenn wasn't quite done Glenn kept

436
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,460
hacking we kept as I said going to

437
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,290
parties and playings too often hanging

438
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,390
out and blends like you know what to be

439
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,160
really cool if the gifts were synced to

440
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,650
music would not be great wouldn't be

441
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,390
great if we could like hook it up to a

442
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,010
turntable and like have an analog

443
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,360
control for the gift so we could scratch

444
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,130
it backwards and forwards would not be

445
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,990
great would it be great if we could like

446
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,200
put the gifts in 3d and shoot pixels of

447
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,780
gifts at the camera wouldn't be great

448
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,260
will be great if we could like just have

449
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,290
like gifts decoded in the browser

450
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,080
wouldn't it be great like

451
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,110
it just kept going and we humid him for

452
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,390
a little while but to a point we were

453
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,150
like Glenn I we need to work just please

454
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,280
leave us alone and Glenn kept just

455
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,530
writing code more code and more code and

456
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,450
more killer he was experimenting a lot

457
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,340
doing weird stuff and he was somebody

458
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,220
who had never written JavaScript before

459
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:23,790
not much anyway little bits Glenn went

460
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,580
on and he wrote something called X gif

461
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,300
which is a web component that actually

462
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,070
implements a tag in the browser called X

463
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,160
give it has only a couple of options you

464
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,980
can set a gift a loop you can set it

465
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,200
playback speed and you can do some other

466
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,970
interesting things he made it as a web

467
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,590
component he experimented with doing it

468
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,500
in react and angular and using basically

469
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,270
every library around to try and go on

470
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,130
this pursuit of learning web components

471
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,750
learning Audio API is learning how to

472
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,540
break down a gift learning how to I

473
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,680
don't know what his obsession is but he

474
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,110
I think his business card what does it

475
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:02,910
say no so if you if you don't know how

476
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,650
to decode a gift in a browser I think he

477
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,110
calls you a gift enthusiast but he's a

478
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:11,940
gift pro anyway I'm going to show you a

479
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,220
little demo of X gives anyone seen

480
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,470
excuse before lunch flirts cool ok so X

481
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,160
gift takes a gift you add a tag to your

482
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,170
browser just like you would an image you

483
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,090
say here's the source of the gift and it

484
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,880
plays it just like an image then some

485
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,060
other cool stuff happens you can

486
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,820
actually change the playback of the gift

487
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,850
so you can do this ping-pong effect and

488
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,370
then you can even do other stuff like

489
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,500
how many times do you want the gift to

490
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:50,760
play through just once tempos and that's

491
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,610
all implemented as attributes on Elm

492
00:22:53,610 --> 00:23:01,440
pretty cool you can set the speed

493
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,340
you can set speed so you can say like oh

494
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,190
hey me really fast crazy stupid fast or

495
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:13,120
just one France then he started working

496
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,340
on beats for a minute and he figured out

497
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:58,730
you could actually sing some audio

498
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:08,200
pretty rad so Glenn is super rad he's my

499
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,990
buddy he's the CSS comp guy as well you

500
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,309
should definitely say hi to him because

501
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:13,870
i'm using his demos and I'm kind of

502
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,539
getting to play music look cool but he's

503
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,519
cooler than I but I think what's really

504
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:20,679
interesting here is that XD ax wouldn't

505
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:22,029
have happened if we didn't get drunk in

506
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:23,529
the office and just start hacking with

507
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:26,080
gifts and this took Glenn on a trip

508
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,630
where he started giving conference talks

509
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:32,529
at cascadia jays in portland at JS comp

510
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:35,519
in melbourne at JS coffee in berlin and

511
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:38,500
his conference schedule continues to get

512
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,250
booked beyond today because of work like

513
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:47,470
xq so when it set you a challenge gib

514
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,179
city started as a one hour challenge and

515
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:51,760
it led to hours and hours of learning

516
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,610
and super amounts of fun so I want all

517
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,669
of you to go ahead and just do a dumb

518
00:24:57,669 --> 00:24:59,289
thing whatever the dumbest thing is that

519
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,669
you can come up with that you think you

520
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:02,490
can do in an hour just try and do it

521
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,899
fact is if it's fun and you actually

522
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:06,250
achieve something in now you're probably

523
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,870
working it for the entire weekend that's

524
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:13,059
fine and another dumb project on Fridays

525
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:15,220
we have a thing that we

526
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,620
and our office called jelly jelly is

527
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,380
casual co-working we have a you know

528
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,120
reasonably sized office and we just like

529
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,340
to invite our friends to come in kind of

530
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,289
work and just be around as there for

531
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:29,820
lunch have drinks together again the day

532
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,020
one particular jelly day I didn't feel

533
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,630
like doing actual real work and I've

534
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,669
never used Bauer so of course I should

535
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:40,120
do something with Bauer right never used

536
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,360
it I'd also never ever written any

537
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,990
Python still have no idea what I'm doing

538
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:51,370
and I didn't even use sublime tix either

539
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,960
so of course what am I going to do in an

540
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,280
hour I'm going to write a sublime text

541
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,980
plugin in python that uses bowers so we

542
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,990
can install bauer packages because i

543
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,220
don't know that's the most sensible

544
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,280
thing that I could do in an hour I

545
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,750
pulled something together the kind of

546
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,250
worked by reading other people's source

547
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,830
code and over the weekend but fighting

548
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,860
it up and released it the last time I

549
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,620
checked this plugin have had over 10,000

550
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,140
foot installed and a lot of people

551
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,820
actually use it I don't use it so if

552
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,650
you've got some spare bandwidth and you

553
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:23,260
want to fix the issues have a look at

554
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,750
the issue tracker on there but what was

555
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,730
really interesting here is that after i

556
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,200
worked on the assigned about joining the

557
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,200
bower team which was a totally

558
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,030
unexpected result I didn't ever use

559
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,770
Bower before this point if like riding

560
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,510
this dumb thing python and I had no idea

561
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:40,809
what I was doing and using an editor

562
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:44,710
that i didn't use either which kind of

563
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,980
gets me to a point about open source how

564
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,529
many people write plus ones on issues

565
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:56,559
yeah your old jerks huh i think i really

566
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,000
hate this about open source i really

567
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,559
hate this leg hey please go and spend

568
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:01,179
all of your time and do this for me

569
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:03,370
because it really doesn't give anyone

570
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,320
anything and i want to let you in on a

571
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,200
little secret about open source you can

572
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,360
actually do open source without doing

573
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:16,059
anything this is my strategy watch

574
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:22,810
listen learn and just hope where you can

575
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,989
so the reason I say this was because of

576
00:27:24,989 --> 00:27:27,419
a particular circumstance that kind of

577
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:31,320
came towards me there's the old saying

578
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,509
if you don't know what you don't know or

579
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:36,419
in my case I would say you don't know

580
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:38,220
what you don't know until it literally

581
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:43,320
falls out of your head for a little

582
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,779
while I was not a contributor not hadn't

583
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:51,809
ridden any code the match media polyfill

584
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:53,850
I was interested in the mass media

585
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,649
polyfill and I just started sort of

586
00:27:55,649 --> 00:27:56,759
trolling around the issue tracker

587
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,700
following it and sort of looking at how

588
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,989
it worked it's really simple little

589
00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:04,759
polyfill and I thought it's cool and

590
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:08,519
about two years ago an issue came in

591
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,590
that said that we should remove this

592
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,350
code there was a completely new PR that

593
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,869
rewrote all of this and it was a huge PR

594
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:18,480
basically rewrote the entire library and

595
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,720
I spent hours reviewing it remember I

596
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,059
was not a contributor to the to the open

597
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:26,700
source project and I just reviewed this

598
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,499
and the code was really good and so we

599
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:29,850
talked about a couple of little style

600
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,559
things that we wanted to fix before we

601
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:34,139
accepted it into the project but it got

602
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:39,330
in and months went on one day I was in

603
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:42,590
my team chat with one of my clients and

604
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,059
matt said we've got a production

605
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:47,190
performance issue on mobile does anyone

606
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,379
know what this crazy minified code that

607
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:51,840
says offset with triple equals 42 means

608
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,720
and I had no idea that I would know this

609
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,090
until he pasted it and as soon as he

610
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,830
pasted it I was like that's the match

611
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,389
media polyfill because I reviewed that

612
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:03,149
pull request you know months ago and

613
00:29:03,149 --> 00:29:04,980
that's the only thing that I could

614
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,359
imagine that has code that's this

615
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:09,269
ridiculous and because of that I guess I

616
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:10,619
knew that there was actually a new

617
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:11,999
version of this polyfill which address

618
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:14,039
these performance problems and we

619
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:16,919
upgraded it the bower package and our

620
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,259
performance issue disappeared I know

621
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:20,730
that's a kind of a fun story doesn't

622
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:21,899
happen every time like that but

623
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:29,390
sometimes does

624
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,590
how many of you build things start

625
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,710
building something maybe working it for

626
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:39,850
a few hours and never show anyone got

627
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,140
everyone come on everyone does that

628
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,660
right I know you do you're lying we're

629
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:47,770
just late you're lazy or something then

630
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:50,260
almost forever particularly earlier in

631
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,780
my career I would think of an idea and

632
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,980
then ten minutes later I would be

633
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,770
writing code and my girlfriend would say

634
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,660
are you going to bed anytime soon or are

635
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,160
you going to continue to be hacking on

636
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,650
your laptop and i would say i'm working

637
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,210
on my laptop and i would stay there and

638
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,130
i would be working past two o'clock in

639
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:09,549
the morning on this dumb thing and then

640
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:11,140
i would wake up and I'd be bloodshot

641
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,120
going to work the next day and basically

642
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,309
hating my previous decisions of working

643
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:17,919
on this dumb thing um but for a long

644
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,960
time I didn't ship these things they

645
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,760
were half baked and like they weren't

646
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,559
really thought to the point of like can

647
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:26,890
i actually release this and I think dumb

648
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,419
experiments like that are useless

649
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:29,650
especially if you're not going to commit

650
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:32,049
to actually showing somebody or actually

651
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:33,460
sharing it even with just one friend

652
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,620
maybe if you're at your work or someone

653
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,730
on the internet that you talk to

654
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:40,330
regulate and for a little bit longer

655
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,799
after that I started bringing my friends

656
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:44,500
into my damn projects and I we also

657
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,000
found the situation where we'd start

658
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,350
arguing about the project before we'd

659
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,530
even launch it or showing anyone else

660
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,549
we're arguing about silly things that

661
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:52,870
didn't really matter because nobody else

662
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,000
knew this thing exists except for one or

663
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,520
two people so i'm going to set a

664
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,770
challenge for all of you here the next

665
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,730
time that you're going to build

666
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,290
something that you don't think you're

667
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:07,600
going to ship i'm killing kittens that

668
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:14,559
guy two guys should shoot so don't count

669
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,429
your days make your days count work on

670
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:19,510
projects that you think that you'll

671
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,940
share work on projects that are fun work

672
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,100
on projects that are dumb don't

673
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,480
necessarily do it for money celebrate

674
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,960
your wins when you do something cool

675
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,020
enjoy it may be launched something on

676
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,340
your birthday right so for me I don't

677
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,600
know about you

678
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,860
common birthday is you wake up and you

679
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,999
spend time with your partner or your

680
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:46,669
family and then they say I have to go to

681
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:48,470
work today and you say okay I'm not

682
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,539
working today and then the house goes

683
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:52,460
quiet and sit by yourself looking at

684
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:56,840
Twitter it's pretty boring isn't it so

685
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,119
instead I decided to launch on my

686
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:03,860
birthday this year for the past year

687
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,149
before I'd been working on an app called

688
00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:09,019
caliber which is a quality and

689
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:10,850
performance telemetry suite for the web

690
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:13,879
it runs on chrome or uses chrome

691
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:15,230
devtools everything the chrome dev tools

692
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:18,529
can get caliber runs it runs against

693
00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:19,970
your site every day or when you hit the

694
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,529
API and it gives you metrics about your

695
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:24,639
side like how quickly first paint was

696
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:29,749
what your CSS like quality is like what

697
00:32:29,749 --> 00:32:32,659
your secret codes videos every time your

698
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,100
site loads so that you can compare them

699
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,840
and like look at screenshots of how long

700
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,090
it took something to render or maybe you

701
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,590
can blame a third party for their ads

702
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,929
being slow so I've been working on this

703
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:43,100
for a long time if you want to check it

704
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,919
out later it's caliber optical but I

705
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,440
launched it on my birthday and it was

706
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,119
the best birthday ever just for the next

707
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,919
like eight hours I just watched my phone

708
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,840
be like retweeting and people saying hey

709
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,980
congratulations you launch something

710
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,619
that's really cool so when you guys to

711
00:32:57,619 --> 00:33:02,659
do that too this is one of my favorite

712
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:04,669
quotes by then period been period worked

713
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:07,700
on supply which later sold to eBay which

714
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,860
I think he was maybe not so proud of

715
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,019
after because they did nothing with it

716
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:13,999
they didn't ship it so I'm gonna kill a

717
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:16,700
kitten for that he said as a creative

718
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,139
person you've been given the ability to

719
00:33:18,139 --> 00:33:21,259
build things by from nothing by the way

720
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:24,039
of hard work over long periods of time

721
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:26,299
creation is deeply personal and

722
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:29,570
rewarding and it means that your work

723
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,869
should be rewarding as well and if it's

724
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:35,720
not then something's wrong right we're

725
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,399
spending all these hours working on a

726
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:39,110
computer typing in staring at this

727
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,909
goddamn screen we should be enjoying

728
00:33:40,909 --> 00:33:45,710
that our jobs are pretty great and as a

729
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,809
creative person you need to understand

730
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:49,260
yourself

731
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,300
I don't think you can underestimate

732
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,040
imports of understanding what motivates

733
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,610
you as a person and then working on that

734
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,650
and self analyzing and getting better at

735
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,760
understanding the way that your brain

736
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,180
works you got to figure out what makes

737
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,130
you tick you got to figure out how to

738
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,970
ship and as you do it you should repeat

739
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:13,679
and you should get better you should

740
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,980
make friends kind of hard sometimes and

741
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,790
depression isn't really talked about a

742
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:23,580
lot in our industry and like I said you

743
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,139
and yourself a loner the master of your

744
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:28,020
own mental state but you can help your

745
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,220
friends and you can help your colleagues

746
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,460
and not to mention minority groups as

747
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,540
well in short be better than you are

748
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:43,020
your career is long make it count make

749
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,380
it enjoyable and motor your career on

750
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,850
work that is not necessarily going to

751
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:50,399
make you famous or rich but just work on

752
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,290
stuff that makes you happy iterate on

753
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,540
that and when you succeed then worry

754
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,240
about money it will come because if you

755
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,310
don't it'll leave you hollow believe you

756
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:06,270
mum sometimes you need to quit there's

757
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,920
been many situations through my career

758
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,870
where I've worried about a situation

759
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,520
with a client or with you know when I

760
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,830
worked for companies where I hated every

761
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:17,100
day I regretted waking up I regret it

762
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,630
going to the office I regretted having

763
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,100
to work with that person that I didn't

764
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,750
like that didn't understand me because

765
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:28,200
I'm special and then you quit it all

766
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:34,980
disappears everything can be great be

767
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,010
ambitious if I had followed through my

768
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,110
career the old adage of if you're not

769
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,610
good at something don't ever give it

770
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,430
away for free I don't you start on

771
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,270
amazing opportunities to meet people

772
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,970
have to work on projects and you know

773
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,440
particularly becoming like sort of

774
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,759
friends with my heroes

775
00:35:51,759 --> 00:35:55,569
I've always believed that sort of going

776
00:35:55,569 --> 00:35:56,949
from the gut that I'm doing the thing

777
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:59,589
that is the right thing to do and there

778
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:00,969
are times are out straight away from

779
00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:05,169
that path for a project or a particular

780
00:36:05,169 --> 00:36:09,999
job sometimes your money working

781
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:13,299
blissfully is really important and while

782
00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:14,109
there are times that you're going to

783
00:36:14,109 --> 00:36:16,289
have to suck it up and just do your job

784
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:20,559
those should be exceptions so if I had

785
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:22,659
any advice for me comments to our

786
00:36:22,659 --> 00:36:25,119
industry or any creative pursuit I'd say

787
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,469
figure out what's important to you and

788
00:36:26,469 --> 00:36:30,099
strive to get there and don't be afraid

789
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:32,039
to do what people will tell you stupid

790
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:34,239
because if I had done that I would never

791
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,889
build all these ridiculous things that

792
00:36:35,889 --> 00:36:37,749
have actually done more for my career

793
00:36:37,749 --> 00:36:40,389
and more for me enjoying working with

794
00:36:40,389 --> 00:36:42,819
people and learning from people then I

795
00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:44,559
had ever done in my commercial career if

796
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:46,089
I had just done the commercial thing I

797
00:36:46,089 --> 00:36:48,130
don't know where what I'd be doing I

798
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,209
probably would have quit by now

799
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:54,519
completely asleep so believe in yourself

800
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:56,289
and trust yourself and you'll build

801
00:36:56,289 --> 00:36:59,589
incredible things do work that makes you

802
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:02,619
feel good start an event promote good

803
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:05,709
work make friends encouraged them have a

804
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:13,840
really good time thank
