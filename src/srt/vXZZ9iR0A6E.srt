1
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,990

we'll chill it out who hears heard a

2
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,250
phonegap it's like a third or more of

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,580
the audience which is awesome we we ship

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,680
phonegap like two years ago and no one

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,910
had really heard of it until after the

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,349
first jazz comp and ya know now people

7
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:28,460
are getting familiar with it which is

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,460
wicked oh so this is an 8-bit ninjus

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,250
presentation and where are my speaker

10
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,239
notes according to this I haven't

11
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:45,800
started my presentation yet sweet this

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,170
is what I get for using Google Docs I

13
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:56,179
guess anything shows speaker notes oh I

14
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:57,859
know where it is hold on you guys I'm

15
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:02,539
really sorry about this it's like in the

16
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:12,380
bottom left of this thing haha there we

17
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:19,579
go okay so you probably can't read that

18
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,490
but my name is Brian LaRue and you can

19
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,710
find me on Twitter I work for a night

20
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,810
Toby software which is a small software

21
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,680
consultancy in Vancouver Canada and we

22
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,140
are the creators of phonegap which is a

23
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,549
pretty awesome project for creating

24
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:39,950
mobile applications with HTML CSS and

25
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,600
JavaScript this talk I'm just going to

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,219
go through the current state of the

27
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:47,750
phonegap project so you guys can get a

28
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,979
better understanding of what's been

29
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:52,430
going on and where we're going a lots

30
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,759
changed in the last couple years and

31
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:57,289
it's it's a much more mature project

32
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:59,030
when we started in fact it when we

33
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,909
started it was I don't want to say was a

34
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:03,320
total hack but it pretty much was a

35
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,359
total hack and now it's growing into

36
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,950
something that is being used by

37
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,479
thousands of people and it's actually

38
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,180
seeing some good adoption and a lot of

39
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,880
big companies behind it so when we first

40
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,310
ship phonegap two years ago it was

41
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,290
essentially an extension on the native

42
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,930
web view and for iOS which was only

43
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,930
iphones at that time now we've got

44
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,930
support for our eight platforms eight

45
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,640
different mobile platforms for creating

46
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,370
native mobile web apps and we're getting

47
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,990
tons of support from from different

48
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,230
companies like Sony Ericsson has adopted

49
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,830
phonegap as their standard SDK for

50
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,880
writing apps for symbian and Android and

51
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,650
symbian foundation recently accepted

52
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,660
phonegap as a part of their web

53
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,640
extensions package which would be

54
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,530
shipping in symbian3 so that's pretty

55
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,600
big news you can write web apps that

56
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,880
ship on mobile devices that target not

57
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,990
only symbian Android iPhone and these

58
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,570
big companies are supporting it so

59
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,040
that's pretty cool a lot of people ask

60
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,210
us like how many people are using

61
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,260
phonegap and we have no idea it's an

62
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,490
open source project so there's no way

63
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,140
for us to actually know that because we

64
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,720
give it away but since last January it's

65
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,800
been downloaded over

66
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,620
half a million times that's not

67
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,420
including any numbers on github we have

68
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,150
no clue at night Toby we use phonegap to

69
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,010
write applications for ourselves and

70
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,140
we've shipped over 50 apps and last year

71
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,080
with a team of 15 people that's pretty

72
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,020
impressive phone guide gives you a huge

73
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,130
advantage because you could leverage

74
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,320
your your already existing skills for

75
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,570
the web to create apps faster than

76
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,850
anyone else and and really that's what

77
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,650
it's all about because most apps that we

78
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,520
have to write or do a few weeks ago

79
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:54,830
according to our clients so what one

80
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,490
thing about all this stuff is phonegap

81
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,530
is really more of an interim solution

82
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,370
then then something that we're saying

83
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,170
that you should be using from now on

84
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:10,760
moving forward phonegap is a platform

85
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,910
for writing web apps but really we

86
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,220
should just be writing web apps but

87
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,359
there's times when we can't write web

88
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,890
apps and that's when we want to access

89
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,200
native device features such as the file

90
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,600
system or if we want to access the

91
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,220
contacts or the camera or any of this

92
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,650
other cool stuff and so phonegap really

93
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,780
is just an interim solution the browsers

94
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,010
are going to be doing this stuff

95
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,470
eventually anyways and geolocation is a

96
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,180
perfect example of this and it's

97
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,680
permeating back to all the other

98
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:45,590
browsers so fragmentation these are our

99
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,620
most the major mobile platforms we don't

100
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,230
have samsung bada in there i'm not

101
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,240
mentioning windows mobile because no one

102
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,870
cares OEM inching windows mobile maybe

103
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:03,440
the Europeans care whatever and there's

104
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,300
some interesting developments here if we

105
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,040
look at this there's there's all kinds

106
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,450
of different platforms but a whole bunch

107
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,040
of these platforms actually are already

108
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,900
starting to to support the web and they

109
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,350
hadn't previously and so there is a lot

110
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,910
of fragmentation there but the

111
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,640
fragmentation isn't necessarily existing

112
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,120
so much in how you write the apps but

113
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,830
rather the SDKs that you have to install

114
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,729
to to begin writing these apps there's

115
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,320
another aspect to this whole thing and

116
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,409
that's distribution of your applications

117
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:34,509
and about a year ago I started to get

118
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:36,249
really scared because there was

119
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:39,099
something like 50 app stores and now as

120
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:41,649
if today there's over 90 op stores and I

121
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:42,909
used to think this was a really bad

122
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,289
thing but I'm beginning to believe that

123
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:45,489
this is actually a really good thing

124
00:05:45,489 --> 00:05:49,300
there's initiatives out there is anyone

125
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,879
here familiar with Bondi if you are

126
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:54,099
raise your hand okay have you heard

127
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:56,259
though the wac it's a really terrible

128
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:59,409
name what it stands for something like

129
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:02,589
web application warehouse or something

130
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:04,360
they're looking to standardize the idea

131
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,889
of an app store so that app stores could

132
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:07,239
be federated and this seems like the

133
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,469
right thing to do and I think it's sort

134
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:10,809
of a good idea on paper but it's never

135
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:12,579
going to fly all these people are never

136
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:13,959
going to work together and its

137
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,579
proliferation of app stores seems like a

138
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:17,110
really bad thing like oh no there's

139
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,879
going to be dozens of app stores but if

140
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,319
we think about how like physical goods

141
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,449
get transferred this isn't actually a

142
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,699
big departure I don't want to go to a

143
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:26,769
big box store or mall that it sells

144
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:28,989
everything and it's kind of crummy I'd

145
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,789
rather go to a bespoke store that

146
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:34,029
curates content or and or goods that I

147
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:35,529
expect and you could imagine things like

148
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,110
you could go to the EA app store by EA

149
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,569
Games and this is likely what the future

150
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:43,509
is going to hold but you know this turns

151
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:48,819
into a big distribution nightmare but

152
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:50,529
this kind of fragmentations already been

153
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:52,479
solved for years and you know it's that

154
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,740
whole internet thing that we've been

155
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,869
talking about and it turns out it's

156
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:56,800
pretty good at dealing with

157
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,089
fragmentation and distribution and so

158
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:02,589
once again phonegap is a way for you to

159
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,089
get your apps into these various app

160
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:06,729
stores but you shouldn't invest too

161
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:08,619
heavily and the idea of developing for

162
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:10,269
app stores when we have the internet to

163
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:12,849
to do this anyways so you could almost

164
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,289
consider phonegap as a temporary

165
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:16,449
progressive enhancement technique it's a

166
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:18,639
way to get your mobile web apps built

167
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,829
and in app stores while we wait for the

168
00:07:20,829 --> 00:07:25,339
browsers to catch up with device api's

169
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:28,059
so that that's and another important

170
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:31,029
part about all this we've got native

171
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:34,269
device sensors and native device access

172
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:37,860
and so so what the fuck does that mean

173
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,149
sensors are things like your camera your

174
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:45,820
accelerometer things that that access

175
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,310
data and then there's device data and

176
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,840
thats things like photographs contacts

177
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,230
whatever so these are the problems that

178
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,570
we're looking to solve a phonegap and

179
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,620
we're also looking to provide a

180
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,930
reference implementation for install the

181
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,180
web apps what the hell is an installable

182
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,650
web app I I think like you can look at

183
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,930
an installable web app much like you can

184
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,650
look at device sensors and data it's all

185
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,830
it really is is an icon for the loading

186
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,650
screen a loading screen itself and a

187
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,690
permissions manifest of some kind all of

188
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,310
these various mobile app stores and

189
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,230
mobile platforms have this pattern

190
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,690
encapsulated somehow and interestingly

191
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,570
there's there's a work being done at the

192
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,820
w3c called the device API working group

193
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,349
which is tackling the idea of sensors

194
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,270
and data and there's the widget working

195
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,740
group which is tackling the idea of

196
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,810
installable web apps and then there's

197
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,610
things like the Chrome Web App Store

198
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,700
that are coming so so these concepts are

199
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,620
already out there and being worked on

200
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,940
phonegap is is just another one yeah I

201
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,470
have no idea what that slide has to do

202
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:58,540
with anything okay so current platform

203
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,610
support is that the next big question

204
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,870
people have like what are you guys

205
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,730
working on and what are you doing and so

206
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,410
before I like talk specifically to what

207
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,180
platforms that we're supporting it I

208
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,010
have to talk to about how we plan to

209
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,860
support it and you don't want to start

210
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,080
building this big monolithic system when

211
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,790
you're dealing with devices that have

212
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,530
the computational power of something

213
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,910
from the 90s like these things are

214
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,600
pretty crummy computers and so phonegap

215
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,980
itself has to have the smallest

216
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,920
footprint possible we can't touch we

217
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,630
have to touch as little as possible so

218
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,270
that we remain performant another rule

219
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,710
that we have to play by is that we have

220
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,110
to use the native SDK it would be nice

221
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,180
if we could write our own browser but

222
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,040
that would also be yet another browser

223
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,540
and that would probably cause more

224
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,540
problems and then solve them most

225
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,490
cardinal rule of phonegap is that we do

226
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,740
not fuck with the DOM and there's a lot

227
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,940
of reasons for that the main one being

228
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,190
that the DOM is a mess already no sense

229
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,650
in us making it worse there's plenty of

230
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,390
library authors that are here right now

231
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,020
they can

232
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,940
with the DOM and solve that problem

233
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,280
themselves phonegap should remain

234
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,590
accessible and the idea here is that you

235
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,240
can install your own stuff and keep

236
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,930
working so sometimes people get confused

237
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,300
and they think oh phonegap is for

238
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,130
building web apps therefore it has no

239
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,600
native accidents but this is an

240
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,790
incorrect assertion phonegap is a

241
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,370
starting point for writing web apps that

242
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,160
allows you to write native extensions

243
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,230
yourself so there's no reason that you

244
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,360
can't have native code we just think

245
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,640
it's a bad idea if you can avoid it you

246
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,800
should because it's not cross platform

247
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,240
and then you'll have to implement it six

248
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,500
times if you want to hit multiple

249
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,650
devices that said there is times when

250
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,810
you should write native code there are

251
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,450
certain platform specific interactions

252
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,820
that people look for when they're using

253
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,920
their mobile device and my favorite

254
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,590
example of this is the back button who's

255
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:56,530
got an iPhone who's got an android my

256
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:03,830
brothers who's got blackberry crickets

257
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,690
right okay well it iphone and android

258
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,400
provide a really good example of this so

259
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,630
in an iphone land there's 11 button and

260
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,400
that sort of takes you home but in the

261
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,260
blackberry world we've got four physical

262
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,730
buttons that are almost on every device

263
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,410
and one of those includes a back button

264
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,540
and nothing pisses off an Android user

265
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,520
more than a virtual back button in the

266
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,650
top left which is what you see in

267
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,270
Android or in iphone land in webos

268
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,620
things are even more interesting there's

269
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,990
no buttons at all and there's no virtual

270
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,150
buttons at all use gestures to go back

271
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,910
and forth which is cool but now you've

272
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,950
got a user experience expectation and

273
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,290
this isn't necessarily native UI but it

274
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,910
is a native feature and when you're

275
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,440
writing an app you you probably want to

276
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,360
write the best out possible and if

277
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,680
you're writing the best out possible

278
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,030
then you're going to want to live up to

279
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,490
the expectations of the users and so

280
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,560
here's a case where it makes a lot of

281
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,000
sense to drop in a native code anyways

282
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,530
there's other examples that are a lot

283
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,890
like that and the final thing we we say

284
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,180
we should not pollute the global

285
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,690
namespace

286
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:18,290
and we're working on that so yeah this

287
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,560
is this is most definitely the biggest

288
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,050
problem with mobile software development

289
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,910
right now if you want to write an app

290
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,700
for any given device you'll have to

291
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,340
install an SDK for that device so if you

292
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,980
want to go cross-platform with multiple

293
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,450
devices you're going to have to install

294
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,210
six or eight different SDKs in some

295
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,220
cases those SDKs only can be installed

296
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,290
on one operating system and so then

297
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,150
you're virtualizing windows when you

298
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,160
have to do windows development or or

299
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,720
you're buying a mac mini because you

300
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,660
can't really virtualize OS 10 and it's a

301
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,960
pain in the ass now we're not really

302
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,730
doing much to solve it but I just

303
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:01,160
thought I'd bring that up okay that's

304
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,390
right I was going to tell you guys what

305
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,070
platforms we support so this is what

306
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,800
phonegap currently supports today iOS

307
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,500
which does include ipad ipod touches and

308
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,530
iphones some reason people ask us that a

309
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:17,110
lot all android devices going back to

310
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:27,720
1.5 1.5 1.6 webos symbian windows mobile

311
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,410
we're going to be supporting windows

312
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,510
phone 7 I was talking to Dion about this

313
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,470
earlier and he's like what do you think

314
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,360
of Windows Phone 7 and Phil who's got

315
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,590
the giant hair and he's right over there

316
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:40,040
actually has one so if you you want to

317
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,830
laugh you could check that out windows

318
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,170
phone 7 is interesting because you know

319
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,670
they put the device out there to let you

320
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,470
know go build some apps and try it out

321
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,180
but we can't actually install anything

322
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,339
to the device we can play around with

323
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:53,780
the web browser and stuff so that's kind

324
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,810
of cool so we've got there's a guy out

325
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,120
there who ported phonegap completely to

326
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,740
Windows Phone 7 but we have no way to

327
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,690
test on a physical device because none

328
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,290
really currently exists so once we get

329
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,610
one we're going to bring it in and then

330
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,760
we'll say yes we support Windows Phone 7

331
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,310
me go work has been done this is a

332
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,990
similar situation in which there's not

333
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,760
very many devices out there so as soon

334
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,560
as we've got some to test on we will be

335
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,950
bringing that out

336
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,630
and so that's cool that's eight

337
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:26,310
platforms the goal of phone gapper one

338
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,840
of the early goals we used to talk about

339
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,210
was that we wanted to we created this

340
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,250
project so that the project would cease

341
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,560
to exist and it's sort of a Zen

342
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,440
Vancouver stoner idea and doesn't make

343
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,030
any sense at all but the idea is that

344
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,680
we're providing an implementation or a

345
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,150
reference implementation of the browser

346
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,720
should adopt themselves and it's working

347
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,670
and these these device a pis are coming

348
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,530
out now into the browser's but there's

349
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,030
new problems so there's new gaps that we

350
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,280
need to fill and we're starting to look

351
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,660
at what these might be and if you use

352
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,310
your imagination you can imagine there's

353
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,250
things like eBook readers there's

354
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,930
dashboards and cars these these screens

355
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,280
are getting really cheap and they're

356
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,990
being embedded everywhere and so

357
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,180
phonegap is a bit of an unfortunate name

358
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,680
because now we're looking at devices and

359
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,360
we don't know what those devices are

360
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,890
going to be but it's going to be really

361
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,470
fucking cool especially for web

362
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:19,140
developers I really only added this

363
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,700
slide because I wanted to change that to

364
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:25,320
either math or Malta but I didn't get

365
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,480
around to it and so there's there's no

366
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,800
real reason for this slide other than

367
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,820
the fact that it's kind of cool I'm

368
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,010
going to talk about our API support next

369
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,680
and the the wave phonegap works is that

370
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,500
we instantiate a web browser and almost

371
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,450
every mobile device right now is rocking

372
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,060
a webkit browser so that means that we

373
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,340
get to get all the goodness of html5

374
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,290
that gets bundled in with WebKit things

375
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:54,540
like SQL Lite css3 canvas web workers

376
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,080
eventually sockets eventually so so

377
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,560
that's cool and then we are further

378
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,750
augment with all these phonegap api's

379
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,850
and that's really cool because there's a

380
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,970
lot of power here I'm going to walk you

381
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,470
guys through a few of the more powerful

382
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,170
API is that we have given access to but

383
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,280
it mean if you look at this stuff

384
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,900
there's there's a lot of interesting

385
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,200
things that you can do not the least of

386
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,400
which is getting into things like

387
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,610
accessing contacts and geolocation

388
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,280
natively on the device things like

389
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,680
Magnum eter means compass people ask us

390
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,800
that all the time

391
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,870
I don't know why they call it that

392
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:35,860
sounds cool so I mentioned the device

393
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,080
API working group earlier if you go

394
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,700
check out their site you can see all the

395
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,180
API is that we're tracking the device

396
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,430
API working group i believe was founded

397
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:51,160
in august of 2009 phonegap itself was

398
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,510
created in 2008 so it's good that we

399
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,190
have aspect that we can track towards

400
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,839
but it's constantly moving and changing

401
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:00,399
and so this is a bit of a challenge for

402
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,959
our project but if you're at all

403
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,370
interested in looking at where the

404
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,990
direction of the internet is this is the

405
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,150
place to go look everybody's talking

406
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,720
about what html5 is going to do which is

407
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,220
sort of retarded because it's mostly

408
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,199
already here it's not about what it's

409
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,699
going to do it's what we have to do with

410
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:17,470
it and what's coming next are going to

411
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:25,089
be device api's so it's like HTML 6 yeah

412
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:28,990
so crucial concepts it's it's a

413
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,130
completely different world when you

414
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,470
start writing for for a device that has

415
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,300
really bad connectivity we've been

416
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,160
spoiled by desktop browsers and so we

417
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,600
don't always necessarily know the

418
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,990
context of which we're running or the

419
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,050
speed and availability of the the device

420
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:47,320
that we have so first thing that we have

421
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,030
to check almost all the time is what

422
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,220
platform I running on it would be nice

423
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,020
to use feature detection but this isn't

424
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,490
always reliable when you're you're

425
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,470
dealing with the same browser on every

426
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,580
platform so device top platform will

427
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,590
return something like Android you're on

428
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,130
an android phone device ready is the

429
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,130
most useful event it gets fired after

430
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,870
your DOM is loaded and you have access

431
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,820
to all your device sensors and so this

432
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,760
is the sort of baseline implementation

433
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,290
of a phonegap app is going to use these

434
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:21,070
two events are these two things the next

435
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,929
big thing is whether or not a network is

436
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:24,520
reachable it's a little bit unfortunate

437
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,350
because the spec has changed but we're

438
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,030
going to keep backwards compatibility

439
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,850
for it essentially Network reachable you

440
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,559
pass it a callback on success and that

441
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,050
will return a status that status will

442
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,630
tell you if you're online if you are if

443
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,320
you're on edge Wi-Fi or 3G super useful

444
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,460
for when you're writing

445
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:49,210
applications right so this is sort of an

446
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,310
embarrassing thing console dot log is

447
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,810
pretty ubiquitous and it's absolutely

448
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,330
everywhere except we cannot change it on

449
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,790
the iphone and so on the iphone it's

450
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,100
debug log it's a real pain in the ass

451
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:05,390
but that's how it goes and it's crucial

452
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,010
so testing testing is a tricky one

453
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,750
because you're going to have to do it

454
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,700
and unfortunately you're going to have

455
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,230
to do it on a device which means if

456
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,490
you're going across platform you're

457
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,010
going to have to have all those devices

458
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:20,080
when you install these various emulators

459
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,580
you'll find that they don't really

460
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,910
actually emulate anything and it's hard

461
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,640
to test things like an accelerometer

462
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,160
when it's just on your screen and so you

463
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,260
have to have the devices we have had

464
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,560
other tools where we found some levels

465
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,270
of success and one of those is qunit

466
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,640
it's a fantastic testing library jquery

467
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,010
uses it and it happens to actually run

468
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,430
on BlackBerry's so we use that not

469
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,750
telling you that you have to use that

470
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,130
but if you're going to start writing

471
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,290
mobile web app code it's it's almost

472
00:19:50,290 --> 00:20:02,920
necessary right so debugging support is

473
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,540
something that people always ask us

474
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,040
about like you know you guys have a

475
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,800
debugger for phonegap and the quick

476
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,770
answer is yes it's called web inspector

477
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,940
most of your development can be done

478
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,500
right in a browser and so if you pop

479
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,570
open web inspector there you go you've

480
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,790
got a debugger right there if you need

481
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,720
to take it another level though and

482
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,940
start debugging on actual hardware or

483
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,330
native specific features your best bet

484
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,460
is to actually load up in whatever I de

485
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,160
that platform supports in Windows land

486
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,920
that would mean visual studio in Java

487
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,780
land that means a version of Eclipse and

488
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,690
they have full-on debuggers so there is

489
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,220
debugging support for phonegap privacy

490
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,350
and security is another huge question

491
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,800
people bring up all the time and they

492
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,720
ask us you know what's security like and

493
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,340
phonegap in a quick answer for that one

494
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,919
is it's the web so there is none

495
00:20:54,919 --> 00:21:01,859
and not even a laugh come on man so when

496
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:04,080
we're doing web development we're in an

497
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,549
inherently insecure environment you have

498
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:07,739
to assume that your inputs are going to

499
00:21:07,739 --> 00:21:09,629
be harmful that you're gonna have to go

500
00:21:09,629 --> 00:21:10,889
through proxies you don't want to leave

501
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:14,340
keys on your device and so really that's

502
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:22,159
it there is no security right so

503
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,570
phonegap was originally written at night

504
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,549
obion worked on primarily by night Toby

505
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:28,320
employees but that story's changed a lot

506
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,499
in the last year and now IBM is

507
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,419
contributing more code to phonegap than

508
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,309
we are which is frightening an amazing

509
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:38,519
at the same time these guys are kicking

510
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:40,710
serious ass and we're seeing a ton of

511
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,659
improvements especially on android and

512
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:45,450
blackberry recently Simeon's kicked in

513
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,519
Microsoft has been helping us rim

514
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:50,399
recently launched their widget SDK which

515
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:53,820
is based on the w3c widget spec and

516
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,409
they've got a WebKit running on there

517
00:21:55,409 --> 00:21:57,690
and they're totally on board for helping

518
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:02,009
us build web apps natively palm of

519
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:03,869
course is amazing and Sony Ericsson and

520
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:07,289
so yeah there's some pretty heavy

521
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:11,200
hitters getting involved it's awesome

522
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:14,849
also couch is now a mobile which is

523
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:20,580
super interesting yawn guy check it out

524
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,840
he's like down there and he's helping

525
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,690
Ryu against the evil Ryu fire guys I had

526
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:31,229
a lot of fun with that slide so couchdb

527
00:22:31,229 --> 00:22:33,840
runs on Android right now apparently

528
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,720
it's been built also for iphone and I

529
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,889
can't really tell you what this means

530
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,139
because I'm not sure myself but I know

531
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:41,999
that it's cool because persistence is a

532
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:43,889
tough problem and synchronization is an

533
00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:45,659
even tougher problem and couch solves

534
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:48,509
those really well so having a little

535
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:50,009
couch running on your phone means that

536
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:51,659
you also have a little mini web server

537
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:53,429
running on your phone which means that

538
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:55,379
you could view phonegap as a tiny window

539
00:22:55,379 --> 00:22:58,169
to your couch and we've done a little

540
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:59,789
bit of experimentation with this which

541
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:01,919
means you could update your app say in

542
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,599
the cloud and then that replicates down

543
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:05,580
to your phone

544
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,160
powerful concept and so this is going to

545
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,230
be something to watch it's early but

546
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:15,000
it's fascinating also if you're looking

547
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,860
for a really ghetto alternative to couch

548
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,480
I wrote in library called lawn chair

549
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,660
which is pretty funny yeah google that

550
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,310
so we wouldn't be good citizens of the

551
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,780
open source community if we didn't talk

552
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,600
about where we fail because we need your

553
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,420
help to not fail anymore and there's

554
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,810
there's you know stuff to be worked on

555
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:41,730
there's lots of problems and and so what

556
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,260
kind of problems do we have i love how r

557
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,270
i turned out to be this white guy with

558
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:49,650
awesome hair so device resolutions and

559
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:52,860
pixel densities is a kind of a huge

560
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,930
problem we're seeing this massive

561
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,190
fragmentation and people are getting

562
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,850
worried and what about standardization

563
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,900
you may as well give up on that dream

564
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,400
there's not going to be any there's

565
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,690
going to be all kinds of weird shape

566
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,850
devices and we should really be viewing

567
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,260
this as an awesome opportunity to

568
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,630
innovate on what you eyes are we're

569
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,110
taking pretty pretty tiny baby steps

570
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,300
right now into the tablet space and in

571
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,340
to even the phone space and we don't

572
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,080
really know we're doing so far it looks

573
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,640
like lists and buttons I'm fairly

574
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,080
certain that that actually won't be the

575
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,300
case in a few years you see you eyes

576
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,550
like Flipboard and there's some really

577
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,440
expressive interesting stuff going on

578
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,690
and all these different screen

579
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,670
dimensions are an opportunity for new

580
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,010
micro libraries that will target these

581
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,470
different types of situations

582
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:40,710
specifically and so device resolutions

583
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,120
and pixel density is a huge pain in the

584
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,160
ass Dom inconsistencies is another big

585
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,430
pain in the ass we've got all these

586
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,410
various web kits and PPK likes to say

587
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:52,200
there's no web kit on mobile and he's

588
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,190
kind of right in a way but really all

589
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,020
these web kits are pretty similar and

590
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,880
there is only small differences between

591
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,890
them but there's a lot of heavy way

592
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,450
people out there that are tackling this

593
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,330
problem the seneschal guys have their

594
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:09,150
library jQuery Mobile has a bunch of

595
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,810
pngs which may turn into a library

596
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,730
Yahoo's working out dojos working on the

597
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,500
you zebu guys are working on it with

598
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,290
embed Jas Thomas Fuchs just released

599
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:22,020
cept ojs we wrote a ghetto library

600
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,200
called whoo I like septo it's cool it's

601
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,120
like even smaller than xui which is

602
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,620
library we wrote to solve the problem

603
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:36,600
what one vapor Dodgers are you joking

604
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,560
okay you're not joking it's an

605
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,770
unfortunate name for a software library

606
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:47,670
favored yes is it that small 0 bytes

607
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:56,840
yeah man it's fast it already loaded um

608
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:02,550
sweet okay and so our final biggest

609
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,420
problem is that we're dealing with a

610
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:07,230
movie in spec and actually that's not

611
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,700
our final problem we have another one

612
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,490
I'll get into that one soon so we've got

613
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,400
a moving speck and basically we're

614
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,140
breaking backwards compatibility right

615
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,400
now but we're going to stop doing that

616
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,710
very soon the device API working group

617
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,810
is starting to ratify on a few of the

618
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:24,030
core API s and so very soon we're going

619
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,920
to be able to say okay line in the sand

620
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,730
this is what phonegap looks like the

621
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,700
final toughest problem which I saved the

622
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,250
best for last is getting started getting

623
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,140
started in mobile is is really tough

624
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,240
because unfortunately while our promises

625
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,040
that you can do web development at the

626
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,150
end of the day you're still going to

627
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,190
have to install these native SDKs in

628
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,640
some cases it's not that bad you know

629
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,760
the iphone sdk it only takes like three

630
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,380
or four hours to download but once you

631
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,420
got it it's sweet and all you had to do

632
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,120
is double-click something and it's their

633
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,200
case of android it only takes a few

634
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,550
minutes to download and it only takes

635
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:03,060
three or four hours to update so I mean

636
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,890
whatever and like ones on Java ones

637
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,540
objective-c and it's a little bit hairy

638
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,480
because you got to learn a new IDE but

639
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,130
we're looking to solve that one too and

640
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,160
so there's two projects that are

641
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,140
brand-new that night Toby's just pushing

642
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,360
out at this very moment one of them is

643
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,310
built up phonegap com and I'm going to

644
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,930
give you a demo of it in a second but

645
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,550
it's a hosted build solution that

646
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,100
encapsulates all the phone gaps work on

647
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,910
to the server side you push up a in dec

648
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,730
HTML or a zip file or you give us a get

649
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,130
repo we'll turn it into a native app for

650
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,020
every platform and send it back down to

651
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:45,960
you sweet right the second project is it

652
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,070
so we might OB came out to Europe a week

653
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,110
early and we decided that we would you

654
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,810
know really lock down and focus and get

655
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,940
some work done but we stayed in

656
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,930
Amsterdam so none of that got done and

657
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:04,440
but we did we did ship some of it and if

658
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,450
you if you have an Android device if you

659
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,040
do a search for phonegap dev browser

660
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,830
there's an app out there and it's it's

661
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:14,280
phonegap the first two links in it are

662
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,290
for our documentation the second one is

663
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,810
to run our test suite the third one is

664
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,580
to add an arbitrary bookmark to anywhere

665
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,350
on the internet and you could load that

666
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,390
within phonegap and so it allows you to

667
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,100
start playing with phonegap right now

668
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,810
without having to install anything but

669
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:33,150
this app which is pretty cool so how am

670
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:41,250
i doing for time five minutes sweet okay

671
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:50,570
so

672
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:55,090
eight seven six so this is build a

673
00:28:55,090 --> 00:29:01,830
phonegap com which you can always sigh

674
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:05,440
that's not it I'll show it to you guys

675
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:11,710
here and so our working name for it is

676
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:15,130
the okay API or oh cappy which is this

677
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,780
bizarre creature if you look it up on

678
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,340
Wikipedia it's pretty cool but that's

679
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:23,590
just like a whatever a working name that

680
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,480
this is going to be the whole user

681
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,820
interface for creating apps eventually

682
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,510
we want full get push bowl support and I

683
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:35,910
kind of put that in but it kind of broke

684
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,650
10 minutes before my presentation so I'm

685
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,080
not going to demonstrate that this is

686
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,970
slow because it's running on a macbook

687
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,700
air with like 10 mobile SDKs on it so

688
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,590
I'm just going to hop to this one to

689
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,210
show you what a final build will look

690
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,540
like it's really bare bones the idea is

691
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,220
that this will be more of an API and

692
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,990
less of a web app we're hoping that

693
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,550
developers will use this to build our

694
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:03,000
own tooling on top of it and that's it

695
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:11,760
thanks a lot everybody

696
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,620
there any questions or do we not do that

697
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:26,660
at JS conf yeah what's our experiences

698
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:36,110
with app stores yeah so it takes about

699
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,910
10 minutes to publish to the android

700
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:43,600
marketplace with a iphone a week tops

701
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,210
Apple's actually gotten pretty quick how

702
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,730
long does it take for blackberry a week

703
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:52,760
or so takes twice as long to develop for

704
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:59,000
blackberry but yeah yeah the guidelines

705
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,720
are fucking crazy dude I mean I don't

706
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,850
know like it's not build a web app if

707
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,320
you think it's retarded that's what we

708
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,870
would do right if you need to access as

709
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,060
the core native device features then

710
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,170
you're going to have to play by their

711
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,660
rules which means anything arbitrarily

712
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,000
that they decide android's market place

713
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:25,990
isn't like that any other questions

714
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:38,980
nothing oh yeah you're back okay

715
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:47,400
no windows 7 is based on ie6 yeah just

716
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,690
when you thought we were done with that

717
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:53,820
one it's still alive although PPK was

718
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,480
saying that Microsoft is promising that

719
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,910
ie9 is going to ship on on Windows Phone

720
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:03,420
7 my belief is that if that doesn't come

721
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,160
with a date that that could be you know

722
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:13,270
10 decades into the future so who knows

723
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:18,690
yes yeah it's running the simulator how

724
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,760
did they do it they instantiate ie6
