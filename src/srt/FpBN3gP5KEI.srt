00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:14,070

hi everyone but we've got at least six

2
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,430
alive people which is a good thing and

3
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,320
all right so I was very I was very

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,970
surprised when I got accepted to Jas

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,859
cars because I don't write JavaScript

6
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,199
that much in fact I don't write any

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,150
JavaScript sometimes I played with

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,849
node.js because I like to look around

9
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:31,199
but what I got accepted the reason is

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,390
because I wrote something I wrote an

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,370
experiment because I like breaking stuff

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,050
I like playing with technologies I like

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,079
seeing what's out there so what I did is

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,969
a real dis experiment that will see

15
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:44,190
later on which is essentially mixing PHP

16
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,190
and nodejs together it's nothing from

17
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,680
production it's just for fun really but

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,480
over the course of the past few months

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,910
I've evolved I've changed a lot and

20
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,860
initially this stock was supposed to be

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,710
bitching about node.js and PHP but

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,199
instead I decided to just call it mixing

23
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,409
technologies instead of breaking them

24
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:07,979
this this came from last week actually I

25
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,200
was a i was at phone conf and i saw one

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,479
of the speaker from this afternoon which

27
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,090
is mark Chris Williams which you should

28
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,280
go see a stock by the way and he

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,000
reminded me that I can't tell too much

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,080
because I don't want to give away what

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,140
he's going to be talking about but he

32
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,030
reminded me that we were more than a

33
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,829
language so hopefully that's that's what

34
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:32,970
I'm going to be telling you today I'm

35
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,380
going to tell you about my experiences

36
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,820
and i'm going to show you the experiment

37
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,470
at the end

38
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,350
alright so here's a story of myself I'm

39
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,930
a perpetual learner that's all I do all

40
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,970
I want to know is more stuff my brain is

41
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,520
like a fractal the more you deeper you

42
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,430
go in the more I want to learn stuff and

43
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,920
there's one thing I've been there is one

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,600
thing I really hated in terms of it when

45
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,310
it comes to engineering and its its

46
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,020
constraints I really really hate

47
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,619
constraints to some extent constraints

48
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:08,539
make sense but to some other extent it

49
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:11,270
limits your imagination it's not only

50
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,250
engineering anymore it's arts that

51
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,690
that's that's what we do and what we

52
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,239
have to really focus on is thinking

53
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:20,630
outside the box and when I say thinking

54
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,989
outside the box it's not only when

55
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:25,850
you're coding something and when you're

56
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,640
developing something let me give you an

57
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,739
example all right there's there's this

58
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:34,820
guy and I'm gonna try to do it as he did

59
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,209
it yeah so hey it's a teeny Tina and I

60
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:41,360
am from Naples Italy and oops sorry

61
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,519
there i am from Naples Italy and the

62
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,580
Queen Margherita is visiting yeah so

63
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,280
it's like this and he says my name is

64
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,130
Rafael Esposito what could I do what

65
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,160
could I do he says oh ho I can take the

66
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,720
bread yeah and the slap-a- soma cheese

67
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,549
and then the slap-a- summer tomato sauce

68
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:01,160
and then the guy thought outside the box

69
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,810
that's what he did and he created one of

70
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,360
the most popular dish in the world which

71
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,180
is pizza that the modern pizza with

72
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,630
tomato sauce which is pretty cool and

73
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,130
you know that there are various examples

74
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,070
like this for instance someone had the

75
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,590
idea I have a Charlie and had a suitcase

76
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,320
what can I do with this and then he

77
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,500
created a suitcase with wheels and

78
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,700
there's another example that's really

79
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,070
really that I fell in love really when i

80
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,709
got here at JS conf it's it's the guys

81
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:32,299
downstairs they thought outside the box

82
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,070
they said hey hold on if i have foosball

83
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,350
have an arduino have cloud computing

84
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,140
have html5 nav CouchDB what can I do

85
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,090
with this there you go you end up with a

86
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,730
digital foosball table which is pretty

87
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,760
slick in my opinion well yeah there

88
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,250
there there there

89
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:56,140
so I the gooks table talk yesterday but

90
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,510
I would have included them in there but

91
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,180
I didn't other examples of thinking

92
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,040
outside the box was mixing pearl and see

93
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,910
about 12 years ago I created PHP and

94
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,930
then created CPP in v8 and some awesome

95
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,400
sauce and he ended up with nodejs which

96
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,470
was pretty groundbreaking in my opinion

97
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,290
in our industry but more importantly its

98
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,120
intrinsic to us engineers and developers

99
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,459
and it's it's something that's inherent

100
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:25,740
to our use of technology because

101
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,419
everything we use is a mix everything we

102
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:31,180
use is a mash-up of previous

103
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,850
technologies pretty much and there's one

104
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,660
thing that I really can't stand and I'm

105
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,280
a victim but I'm also one of the

106
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,650
perpetrators of this issue is we all

107
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,010
have God complexes you write JavaScript

108
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,570
you think you can write everything in

109
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,700
JavaScript you write PHP you want to try

110
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,100
to solve every single problem in PHP you

111
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,080
write early and you say oh it's so much

112
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,290
better at least there's one no actually

113
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,550
I love our long as well but I'm not

114
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,320
gonna bitch about it about this whole

115
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,200
thing and there's one important thing to

116
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,490
remember when you mix technologies or

117
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,080
when you write your language you're

118
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,810
merely the owner of your own realm you

119
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,580
need to get out there you need to to see

120
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,020
what other technologies are doing

121
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,820
because remember one thing your users

122
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,030
are worth more than technology they are

123
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,950
who is going to pay your bills or who

124
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,660
are going to pay your bills they are the

125
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,780
ones who are affected but all those wars

126
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,910
when we fight between javascript PHP or

127
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:33,820
ruby and PHP or pearl and what else but

128
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,290
there's there's a great man that once

129
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,600
said al words deception and I'm a big

130
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,660
fan of Sunzu and and I think this

131
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,850
applies very well to reading hacker news

132
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,090
and seeing this this new technology is

133
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,400
so much better than everything else

134
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,350
because all words deception in our world

135
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,930
it doesn't affect us ourselves engineers

136
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,690
too much however it affects our users a

137
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,910
lot our users are confused they come to

138
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:58,940
you they say

139
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,100
I want to television that's going to

140
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,080
play html5 and that runs on Ruby and

141
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,810
that can write C they don't know what

142
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,580
they're seeing they are being deceived

143
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,560
by ourselves we need to get better than

144
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,330
we need to get better we need to sort

145
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,830
ourselves out and start interacting

146
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,180
together because every single technology

147
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,830
has a different use case pretty much and

148
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,850
they can be useful so um I'm gonna give

149
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,440
you a little example that I actually had

150
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,240
that was something that happened to me

151
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,690
on the way here from the airport and

152
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,060
dublin and i'm going to start this by

153
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,020
saying polyglot isn't this just I write

154
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,120
a lot of languages all right see I write

155
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,940
PHP I write Python i right airline I

156
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,490
love languages so on the way to the

157
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,910
airport I also speak it a few languages

158
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,230
as well because I love languages and

159
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,970
they're easy to learn so this taxi

160
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,670
driver that's going to be an example of

161
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,770
mixing technologies and mixing languages

162
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,330
this taxi driver says what are you going

163
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,190
to do in Berlin I said well I'm going to

164
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,780
a technology conference speaking about

165
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,470
technologies he says oh really and then

166
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,120
at this point when the taxi driver said

167
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,820
really can you tell me more I knew this

168
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,060
was not going to end well so I said yeah

169
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,310
it's talking about languages and you

170
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,660
know he wanted to know more so I started

171
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,730
explaining its its its JavaScript

172
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,260
conference and I'm going to talk about a

173
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,169
different language and he's like huh so

174
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:23,480
he stayed stoic there for about five

175
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,240
minutes driving and then he says how

176
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,380
many languages do you speak at this

177
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,650
point I had the perfect example for my

178
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,490
talk today and I couldn't stop I

179
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,200
couldn't just tell him no look it's not

180
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,169
linguistics it's actual engineering and

181
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,090
this example came to me and I said when

182
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,740
I say use the good technology for you

183
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,600
it's the same thing in languages i don't

184
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,070
speak German but there's a German word i

185
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,090
really like with his shot and hood and

186
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,950
when that taxi was talking about

187
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,110
technology mixed with linguistics but he

188
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,570
was very confused I couldn't help myself

189
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,300
but think about this word because it's

190
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,220
exactly what it was I enjoyed this

191
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,230
because schadenfreude is basically the

192
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,560
pleasure derived from a misfortune of

193
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,510
others and I could see his bad luck

194
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,820
trying to get into technology and trying

195
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,370
to get trying to understand more it was

196
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,229
it was interesting but in this

197
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:19,729
particular use case I couldn't use that

198
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:21,500
word with him I couldn't explain this to

199
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,770
him because we're not robots when we use

200
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,840
technology you know we have to use what

201
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,680
makes sense in what use case makes sense

202
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,539
so what I'm gonna do is now is a rapid

203
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,000
rant hopefully I'm gonna try to the

204
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,770
mitten I'll make this work in 30 minutes

205
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,810
so it might be really hard so let's talk

206
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,539
about no chance for a little bit who

207
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:49,900
uses no Jas here Wow who uses Python PHP

208
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,180
yeah don't be shy don't be shy yeah I

209
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,410
know look all right no jess is trying to

210
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,990
be the next PHP am I wrong saying that

211
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,850
isn't that what Ryan said a few times

212
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,800
through emails and sure the mailing

213
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,470
lists let's start relaxing all

214
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,209
right because PHP is trying to be the

215
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:11,060
next PHP we don't even know where we are

216
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,630
yet no jezik is probably the most

217
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,339
interesting project I've seen in years

218
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:19,130
because it redefined the status quo it

219
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,990
it completely taught outside the box i

220
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,170
said well it got popular obviously but

221
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,390
it's an want to do something i want to

222
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,680
solve in your use case i want to i want

223
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,130
to try something new and I don't think

224
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,350
no jess has to be the next PHP or the

225
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,070
next anything else I mean why why would

226
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,360
you want to do this you have a great

227
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,010
vibrant community you have a great

228
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,810
package manager you have great people

229
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:42,220
you

230
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,380
great core developers and companies to

231
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,540
back you up whereas on the other hand

232
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,930
ourselves PHP myself I'm a time to time

233
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,880
core contributor at the PHP I don't even

234
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,100
have time anymore to argue because PHP

235
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,870
is in a different league than nodejs I'm

236
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,850
not saying it's a better League I'm just

237
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,500
saying it's a different league it's

238
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,820
different issues there is no other

239
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,280
project out there apart maybe from Java

240
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,140
but Java is very different there's no

241
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,780
other project apart from PHP that has

242
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,030
the same issues that the same growth

243
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,450
that has the same use on the web and you

244
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,610
know what when when I see people trying

245
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,110
to be the next PHP I think that's wrong

246
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,450
PHP is there it's doing its thing no

247
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,770
Jess it's doing its other thing and it's

248
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,950
 sweet and it works so there's

249
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,740
sweet and it works so there's
this book that's pretty much changed my

250
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,050
life I think or my way of thinking about

251
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,910
businesses and products and it's called

252
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:35,770
the innovators dilemma to do like a too

253
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,560
long didn't read resume of this it

254
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,110
basically means for me is the incumbent

255
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,530
PHP the one that was the leader in the

256
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:48,070
web we pretty much sat on her holes for

257
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,170
a few years because we were at the top

258
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,170
of this we were used by everyone whereas

259
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:58,300
when node.js came it forced us to rid of

260
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,800
redefine ourselves redefine our

261
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,170
processes see how other technologies are

262
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,060
doing things see how new platforms are

263
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,660
growing and and this is great PHP has

264
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,540
been stuck in a loop for many years then

265
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,610
it started growing again once we saw how

266
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,100
no jess was bringing new things but now

267
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,600
what's happening no Jess people are

268
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,400
trying to make PHP and PHP stranded of

269
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,580
features of no Jess it's it's a bit of a

270
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,990
mix-up that I don't agree with but

271
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,330
either way I think it's very interesting

272
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,550
to see how how the two worlds can

273
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,860
collide together anyways I'm rambling

274
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,020
know how much younger about 15 minutes

275
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:38,530
just about here 15 all right so what I'm

276
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,730
going to present you now is an

277
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:46,150
experiment that I did um it yeah I don't

278
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,340
even know how to just define it I'm an

279
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,140
engineer I like when things are pure but

280
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,610
i also like learning new things and i

281
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,320
like to redefine what I'm doing

282
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,020
I like to improve myself an open source

283
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,940
is my life so obviously when something

284
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,660
comes out I need to train however I'm

285
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,710
very very lazy and I have a lot of work

286
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,200
to do and I don't have time to start

287
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,240
rewriting on my code to pour it into a

288
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,680
new language or port my old thing to a

289
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,920
new it's a new platform or to something

290
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,040
crazy I mean I love html5 I love PHP I

291
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,070
love JavaScript I love web sockets I

292
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,790
love Python I love our line for fuck's

293
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:30,190
sake I love technology and as I said I

294
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,650
had a lot of code I wrote a lot of code

295
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,920
in my life in at least 15 languages and

296
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,710
i still use whatever language works but

297
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,110
one night it was a Friday night and I

298
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,520
was pretty drunk sitting in my office

299
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,010
working and sipping on some wine what

300
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,650
had this idea what if I could run PHP

301
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:52,210
from nodejs because the funny thing is

302
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,610
PHP has been very boring for many years

303
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,610
but since the arrival of PHP 5.3 we have

304
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,750
some pretty cool things that i'm going

305
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,880
to show you even though I they're

306
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,560
completely overkill for the code

307
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,120
examples i'm going to show you we have

308
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,670
namespaces we have closures more

309
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,290
importantly we have a much better fast

310
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,100
CTI processor now called fpm and I

311
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,840
figured hold on no Jess could replace my

312
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,550
engine X and I could use web sockets

313
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,700
directly from this so I started hacking

314
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,850
away and that that's what happened it

315
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,380
turns out that it worked so what we're

316
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,910
going to do now is I'm actually going to

317
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,120
show you off what you know what this

318
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,060
experimented and hopefully there's Wi-Fi

319
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,110
hold on you see terminal there alright

320
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,960
so I'm going to start by showing you a

321
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,740
very simple yeah yeah don't say anything

322
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:50,200
all right I know and I shouldn't pseudo

323
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:56,490
alright so if people want to go to this

324
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,630
address that I'm gonna get someone to

325
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,730
chat with me sorry camera I have to step

326
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:08,250
out of the lights let's get someone to

327
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:15,220
chat with me all right

328
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,920
they're trying to chat with me do you I

329
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,000
want to go in there if you have a

330
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,220
computer feel free hold on this one's

331
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,510
gonna be very short don't worry because

332
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,450
it's kind of boring so let's say a

333
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:37,940
speaker that's me oh hi so ah stupid

334
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,330
thing hold on oh I got a litter Thank

335
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:46,370
You xss people alright so that's a very

336
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,950
boring example of nodejs and web sockets

337
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,690
I think we all heard everything that's

338
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,380
that's there to be sad about node.js no

339
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,430
no that's why I said thank you very

340
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,240
successful very nice hold on that's not

341
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,970
sockets in PHP n so the thing is I don't

342
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,560
want to give a talk about nodejs because

343
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,790
everyone knows everything about nodejs

344
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,360
already so let me just open the terminal

345
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,970
here what we're gonna do is just so

346
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,530
you're the server is very simple is that

347
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:16,370
too small to big in the back does that

348
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,010
work alright so let's do this very

349
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,740
simply I just include socket i/o because

350
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,210
I'm i said i'm very lazy i'm not gonna

351
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,530
write my own implementation of web

352
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,720
sockets obviously so i use socket i/o

353
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,820
and then you know the usual you said

354
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,040
your I use Express as well because it

355
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,140
manages my relative out this stuff then

356
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,400
that's the app the app receives a

357
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,830
connection receives next nicknames and

358
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,340
then it disconnects it's very very basic

359
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,640
it's the default example from socket i/o

360
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:51,580
so I figured what if you have a business

361
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,130
you need some real time web chat or some

362
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,050
real time access some real time

363
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,810
interaction but you also have a lot of

364
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,840
business logic developed to compute your

365
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,110
financials or any imaginable kind of

366
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,700
piece of code that would run on PHP that

367
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,880
everyone already has somewhere post to a

368
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,500
vanilla bulletin board something well

369
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,120
what we're gonna do now yeah

370
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,500
alright sorry it went back to the PHP

371
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,390
initially the example I wanted to do was

372
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,810
a very very cool anyone knows humming

373
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:30,320
bird which is like live and analytics of

374
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,300
your website in traffic and it's super

375
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,760
super slick and I wanted to mix this up

376
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,019
with because I'm a bad citizen and I for

377
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:40,610
the example here I wanted to snip the

378
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,560
network so what I wanted to do is send

379
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,970
everyone to a network at to the

380
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,959
hummingbird page find their address

381
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,610
compute that through my PHP script via

382
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,649
nodejs and get the information back and

383
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:52,970
display something else but it was kind

384
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,060
of boring it was over complicated and I

385
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,100
think one of the main themes that I

386
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,410
remember or Die that i can think of when

387
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,709
i when i think about know j/s conf it's

388
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:07,790
pirates we all love pirates so I decided

389
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:14,600
to write something funnier um so for now

390
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,600
I'm gonna show you the code first I'll

391
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,370
show you a server that's the actual

392
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,929
interesting bit all right we start a

393
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:22,760
server remove this yadda yadda that's

394
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,319
the main road that displays the index

395
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,510
just like the other one but not that's

396
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:30,919
where the funny bit comes in yeah back

397
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:34,460
on that you process true notice to

398
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,669
express it identifies the route and what

399
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:39,410
it does by a surf PHP it doesn't it

400
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,870
doesn't do a request to apache or two

401
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,929
engine X what it does is I wrote this

402
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:46,910
think of node PHP which allows you to

403
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,950
interact with fast CGI directly true no

404
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,309
it's Halle invented it's all very fun so

405
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:54,530
that's what you do you just have a route

406
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,110
and what we're going to do is show you

407
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,410
how that actually works so let's just

408
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,040
switch back to our yeah yeah there you

409
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,240
go

410
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:13,200
alright start that server

411
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:19,840
of course of course what I didn't get it

412
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:28,500
today

413
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:32,340
alright

414
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,860
oh sorry there you go

415
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,940
alright if you guys want to refresh use

416
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,170
the ipod to refresh or use your

417
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,970
computers to refresh go to the same

418
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,580
address Oh a penis connected this is a

419
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:48,230
very kinky night so all right start

420
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,090
start saying you know normal chat room

conversation say how are you and how's

422
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,860

oh my god what the alright here's

424
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:02,750
what I'm gonna do now i'm gonna click on

425
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,940
this here now if people could start

426
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,380
chatting with me yeah sorry that's the

427
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,840
default so you said hey say say how are

428
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,590
you are where's the party tonight i

429
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:17,390
don't know if that's gonna work yeah see

430
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,299
what's actually happening here is Oh

431
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:26,210
someone clever someone very clever see

432
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,210
what it does is it grabs your you're the

433
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,679
string you're sending when it receives

434
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:33,050
it translates it using a translator it

435
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,870
translates it to pirate talk true PHP

436
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,110
PHP feeds that to a cache and then just

437
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,330
displays whatever data is with return

438
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,320
from it where is that party tonight yeah

439
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,540
PHP GS Frankenstein is a pretty goddamn

440
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,050
good express a good way to explain it

441
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,040
sorry I'm not mirroring this place

442
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,990
alright so let's see here its a mix of

443
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,309
node.js but you can also see the

444
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:00,980
incoming requests for PHP so I actually

445
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,660
only started learning express last night

446
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,920
because I said I don't write JavaScript

447
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,110
I don't write those crazy stuff and I

448
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,420
was the first version of note PHP was

449
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,700
only a server you would basically run

450
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,200
from your directory and it was finally

451
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,870
index PHP and it would run but last I

452
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,610
decided if I could use Express that

453
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,690
would be interesting because I could

454
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,220
manage my rug and just send that

455
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,480
directly to your fast cgi so right now

456
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,929
what it does is it mixes the PHP outputs

457
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:29,630
it's all event driven and very fancy and

458
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,100
for those of you that don't actually

459
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,980
know PHP as it actually has some of the

460
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,590
event-driven methods for instance you

461
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,460
can write all your sessions

462
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,530
synchronously using the new minecraft

463
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,440
extension you can write the files online

464
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,110
use a synchronously using the event loop

465
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,340
there's even live events

466
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,330
that I'm not going to talk about because

467
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:51,679
it's absolutely huggly not ugly holy so

468
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:52,789
let me just show you a little bit of

469
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:55,580
code because I like to show off what we

470
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,070
have now in PHP so this is absolutely

471
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,140
overkill don't worry about this such as

472
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,760
the requirement CC we have we have

473
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,640
namespaces that's right that's right huh

474
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,179
and check this out we have lambdas as

475
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:09,770
well that's right you can associate

476
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:14,179
functions the so variables this is

477
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:16,309
 sweet so what we do is we

478
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,980
sweet so what we do is we
essentially retrieve on the cash if the

479
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,440
word that yours passing is in the cache

480
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,899
it finds it otherwise it will ping some

481
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:26,779
URL that's up there post like pirate

482
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:30,890
calm which is kind of self explaining

483
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,039
say self-explanatory and yeah that's it

484
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:36,830
that's that's very it's very it's very

485
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,779
basic it's not complex but you can run

486
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:41,270
your PHP script true you know Jas which

487
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,720
means you might have like I said you

488
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,059
might have some real time chat and other

489
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:48,440
things that you want but at the same

490
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,029
time when someone comes you have some

491
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:52,010
business logic behind you send the IP

492
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,870
process the financials how much they owe

493
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,460
you and all this stuff you can all do

494
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,539
this and that's what I find beautiful

495
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:01,120
about technologies you can start

496
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,289
interacting together like this i'm not

497
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,370
saying this is something that should go

498
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,460
in production far from it but it shows

499
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,700
you that nodejs that was created pretty

500
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,399
much as its own language can interact

501
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:14,779
directly with other languages you could

502
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:16,309
run python scripts from this you can run

503
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:18,880
Ruby because I think there's a ruby ish

504
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,070
nodejs thing that interacts and that

505
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,659
that's very sweet let me just show you

506
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:27,590
another little piece of code see

507
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:34,399
namespace huh how sick is that so hold

508
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:39,869
on where am I

509
00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:46,920
yeah let's do this for that

510
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:52,360
so in conclusion III don't i'm not

511
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,580
saying use PHP I'm not saying use Python

512
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,800
i'm not saying use nodejs I'm saying

513
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,110
pink and stop fighting stop fighting

514
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,070
between languages because as I said our

515
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,050
users are worth way more way more than

516
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:11,650
our technology and it's it saddens me

517
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,390
every time I see posts on Hacker News

518
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,580
are on TechCrunch ER of tech rush

519
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,050
doesn't really count as a tech blog one

520
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,630
on how can use that bitches about other

521
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,820
languages I think it's very important

522
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,580
for us as a community to to start

523
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,260
talking together that's something I've

524
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,390
been doing or trying to get going for a

525
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,150
few years now it's trying to talk with

526
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,380
other languages trying to see what

527
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,030
they're doing trying to see how we can

528
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,290
interact out to make a better

529
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,640
interaction for our businesses and our

530
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,190
money and our lives because you know

531
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,380
there's not enough time in life to fight

532
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,780
all the time so hopefully you weren't

533
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,550
expecting some kind of in-depth talk

534
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,950
about note PHP because that there's not

535
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,750
much to be said really it's just an

536
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,150
interacts with fast cgi true note PHP

537
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,010
it's all invented and it's all very nice

538
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,500
everyone's very happy so think next time

539
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,540
you start bitching about another

540
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,100
language or you start bitching about

541
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,170
some technology think about it think

542
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,600
could I can I use it how could I use it

543
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,580
do I have to rewrite my script do I have

544
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,130
to hire someone else to redo the whole

545
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,590
thing or is that the right use case for

546
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,080
me no SQL is a great example of this no

547
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,750
SQL has so many different no SQL I hate

548
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,990
the term just saying it gives me shivers

549
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:24,570
there's so many no no SQL database and

550
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:27,010
they all have a different use case so

551
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:30,220
don't say don't say react is much better

552
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,860
than couchdb for everything because

553
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,240
that's not true for some cases it's

554
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,300
gonna be better pink pink pink think

555
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,820
outside the box think as well that's if

556
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,960
there's one thing you have to get back

557
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,500
or taking bring back from this talk is

558
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,470
you have to consider other possibilities

559
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:49,450
don't be self restraint don't don't

560
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,150
impose constraints on yourself impose

561
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,680
constraints when you're developing but

562
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,480
not when you're thinking it's not only

563
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,740
engineering it's arts remember that

564
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,740
so we're going to take any questions or

565
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,030
something i think i have five six

566
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:06,330
minutes left according to my timer so if

567
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:16,660
anyone has any questions

568
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:33,900
no questions yes no next

569
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,750
I was there

570
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,790
so the question is is no PHP actively

571
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:42,390
maintained um I don't use it for work

572
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,790
i'm i'm one of the co-founders of a PHP

573
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,310
platform called orchestra and obviously

574
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,810
we don't use this for production because

575
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:52,020
it's a test but what i did is my wife

576
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:56,220
and I are very competitive to say the

577
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,010
least and we like playing games online

578
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,330
against one another and it's really hard

579
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,540
to do this on miniclip and such so i

580
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,950
wrote this battleship game that we can

581
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,080
interact together but I have some old

582
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,640
code for a card game that I'm doing now

583
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,160
in PHP that I wanted to use to note so

584
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,560
as I said I'm a perpetual learner so yes

585
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,600
it's still maintained I i use this

586
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,880
pretty much once a week and even the

587
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,170
reason why i actually started know PHP

588
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,920
is because prior to PHP 5.4 PHP didn't

589
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,920
have this very nice built-in web server

590
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,270
so you have to install apache create a

591
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,010
new feos create a new host name entry

592
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,750
whereas now I could just type node

593
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,640
server PHP boom and start right from

594
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,370
there and start developing so I don't

595
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,620
only use this for games or fun I also

596
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,830
use this for development on my own so

597
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,870
yeah there's that there's a bug right

598
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,060
now because since last night because I

599
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,670
parted half of it to express the jas and

600
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,950
the other one is imported but uh yeah

601
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,260
it's on github if you want to go I think

602
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,910
if you go to the lanyard page I added

603
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,950
the slides and at the link to the getup

604
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,990
code you can you can see how their the

605
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,840
examples are there and you should see

606
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,840
note PHP from there as well any other

607
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:11,550
question come on all right so just how

608
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,820
much time left previous ah good stuff so

609
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,410
I like to talk to people usually and

610
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,880
that's something I didn't do today

611
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,260
because i only have 30 minutes so i

612
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,930
tried to cut it very short I I like to

613
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,790
know about your experiences what who

614
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,670
uses more than one technology on a daily

615
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:32,010
basis what what kind of what kind of

616
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:44,060
technology mixed you like say Joe

617
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,690
see that's the same thing joe says he

618
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,560
uses JavaScript Python PHP and as I said

619
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,660
we have a PHP platform caloric Australia

620
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,610
and the funny thing is pretty much

621
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:57,400
everything that's that's in the back end

622
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,620
not the API but every job everything

623
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,300
that interacts with Amazon is all

624
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,040
written in Python because it makes more

625
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,260
sense there's a this is great library in

626
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,960
Python called boto and boto is is well

627
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,690
maintained and it's super slick

628
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,950
sometimes it breaks but it works most of

629
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:14,500
the time and see I think I think Joe

630
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,320
just just a spark of this this good idea

631
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,220
in me because or extended the idea and

632
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,980
my view and mixing technologies

633
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,600
sometimes you have to it makes more

634
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,000
sense from an economics perspective and

635
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,100
from just technology it's it's fun to

636
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,810
learn new things anyone here it doesn't

637
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,720
like to learn new things like people

638
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,990
walking in kind of thing sure John a

639
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:41,170
chair though anyways thank you very much

640
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,490
for your time and if you have any
