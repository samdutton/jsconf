00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,030

Cheers

2
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,259
so yeah I'm hurry my talks called

3
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,059
normalizing design for better quality

4
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,480
CSS it's a real mouthful my thread it's

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,949
also got a second sort of title

6
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,779
rationalizing designs they're really

7
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,970
sort of subtly different but quite

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,609
significantly sir so the next sort of 40

9
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,439
minutes I'm going to cover the kind of

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:29,820
stuff I've done for us to innovate years

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,610
in my day job which bit it boils down to

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,760
saying nerdy designers a lot of the time

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,860
as CSS developers we spend building

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,620
people's PS DS when they're not designed

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,850
them ourselves but we spend most of our

16
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,040
time implementing them and a lot of my

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,170
time is spent actually not implementing

18
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,760
stuff and telling designers no you can't

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,910
have this as a result I've kind of got a

20
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,039
third title for this talk which is why

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,059
designers here at me

22
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,300
I think after working so closely with

23
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,309
designers for quite a few years they

24
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,170
have stopped here to me quite as much

25
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,210
but it's still a real interesting

26
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,760
dynamic I have with design teams because

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,200
I do push back on a lot of things that

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,060
they want and initially when you join a

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,860
new team when I joined my team when I

30
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,680
was a move to Sky it was a really

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,420
awkward kind of hurdle we had to get

32
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,830
over where I spent a lot of the time

33
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,840
telling these really talented designers

34
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,150
that I like what you've done but you

35
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,799
know I can't build that we shouldn't

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,830
build that and the reason I've chosen to

37
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,200
talk about this today is as Nicole

38
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,659
mentioned all the speakers who are here

39
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,210
weren't chosen weren't asked to speak we

40
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,920
were we everyone submitted a proposal

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,170
and I really wanted to be here so I

42
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,670
submitted this because I thought it

43
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,810
might something that generate a lot of

44
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,189
discussion it's potential bit

45
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:44,369
controversial so yeah I want to open

46
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,470
some discussion up and if any wants to

47
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,990
share anything after all I mean we'll

48
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,270
chat over lunch or over a beer but in

49
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,229
the meantime if we put anything on

50
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,399
Twitter I'd live to see people's

51
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:54,630
opinions on the kind of stuff I'm about

52
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,579
to talk about I know that a lot of

53
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:57,840
people don't take too well to it

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,250
particularly designers I don't if

55
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,200
they're any sort of designers in the in

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,659
the room but I'm yeah I'd really like to

57
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,250
open up discussions see whatever annex

58
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,409
of the kind of stuff that that I do and

59
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,869
I think people should do more off and

60
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:11,430
any disagreements are really welcome

61
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,290
because I want to hear sort of the the

62
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:13,800
opposite

63
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,270
the coin so if anyone has heard of

64
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,350
anything I've done before it's probably

65
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,440
through CSS wizardry which is an mi

66
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,430
really here now I'm stuck with that and

67
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,040
I'm kind of I I've done lots of speaking

68
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,250
open source stuff I love writing about

69
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,600
sort of CSS architecture for last few

70
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,940
years and I'm a quite an exciting point

71
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,320
at the mint because I just kind of quit

72
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,270
my day job and I want to do CS it was at

73
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,120
least a full-time pastor so that's so

74
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,320
taking this kind of idea of

75
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,850
rationalizing designs and taking up to

76
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,910
other companies so I'm currently in the

77
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,740
process of leaving sky now I believe

78
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,300
you've probably heard of sky you've

79
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,610
heard of sky over here right it's a real

80
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,190
big sort of UK sort of a multimedia sort

81
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,190
of organization I've been there for two

82
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,840
and a half years as a sort of a senior

83
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,690
UI developer and kind of the only UI

84
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,730
developer so I was plunked between a

85
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,770
team of software engineers who are super

86
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,960
clever at what they do and a bunch of

87
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,100
designers who were really talented

88
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,140
really creative really clever smart guys

89
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,450
and I've sort of sat in between these

90
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,040
two roles and acting like a bridge

91
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,350
between engineering and design it's

92
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,420
really fun role to have it also means

93
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,560
that I've had to deal a lot with that

94
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,570
with people and people's opinions and

95
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,810
sort of keeping people happy and the

96
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,070
kind of work I've done at Sky as being

97
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,040
fairly big sites slice it take months

98
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,489
and months to build heavily traffic

99
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:38,310
sites science that have sort of dozens

100
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,380
of engineer's working on them and the

101
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,300
thing is with these sites they start off

102
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,350
fairly big but they're only getting

103
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,690
bigger there's one site that I built

104
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,040
two-and-a-half years ago I've started

105
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,360
building two and a half years ago and

106
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,190
right now they'll be people in the

107
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,140
office working on that site today

108
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,330
it's a codebase that's lasted two and a

109
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,890
half years and it's going to keep

110
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,400
growing

111
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,350
and it's really important to to be able

112
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,390
to manage that it's all well and good

113
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,550
building a big website but if you get

114
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,739
lumbered with a badly built big website

115
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,209
you can have a ton a happy team so it's

116
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:08,160
been my job at Sky to keep and front-end

117
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,239
as small as I possibly can anyone who

118
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,070
worked product genuine work product or

119
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,530
in-house or for like a start or anything

120
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,419
like that we've got your own code base

121
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:20,850
that you work with every day right so

122
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,400
quite a few of you actually could you

123
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,900
imagine having to go to that job every

124
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,490
day if the code base was a nightmare

125
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,830
I worked at places where that's the case

126
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,440
and if your day job if every day you're

127
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,640
working on code that you've grown to

128
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,610
resent that's not a nice place to be

129
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,260
so I might drop to keep code bases as

130
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,810
small as possible as soon as possible

131
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,400
but first and foremost and most

132
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,010
importantly maintainable one thing I

133
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,080
learned quite early on at Skye was the

134
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,760
easiest way to keep a code base maintain

135
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,490
is just to keep it small it stands to

136
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,900
reason that the smaller your code base

137
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,880
is the less problems you'll have you

138
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,260
know less things are out to go wrong

139
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,360
statistically less can go wrong because

140
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,700
there's less of it the less you have to

141
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,100
look after just keeping things small is

142
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,750
the simplest single where to keep

143
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,760
something maintainable and easiest where

144
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,620
to keep it small instead of a white less

145
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,180
stuff and this is where I come back to

146
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,880
telling designers no I think it's really

147
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,370
important even if you've got a business

148
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,960
led decision that we as developers

149
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,960
designers programmers still sort of dig

150
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,430
our feet and if we think something's a

151
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,050
bad idea or dig our heels in and say no

152
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,050
to things or what of the time I've spent

153
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,730
a this guy has been saying no to design

154
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,680
features design treatments that I think

155
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,530
might look nice but won't really benefit

156
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,060
the codebase what we've got to remember

157
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,830
is that we're delivering websites and

158
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,050
websites are built on curd we're not

159
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,910
delivering designs not delivering prints

160
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,980
if we're not delivering PSD s that's

161
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,110
part of the process what we're giving

162
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,660
users is curd basis you know the users

163
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,740
don't know that they didn't need to know

164
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,660
about the curd behind it but that's what

165
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,010
we're building and we need to take care

166
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,820
of that first and foremost it's really

167
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,560
important I fire a quick disclaimer in

168
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,140
here though because I'm gonna talk sort

169
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,160
of for the rest of this for the rest of

170
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,310
this talk a little like it's me versus

171
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,080
that and I really don't want that to

172
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,440
come across I don't like I'm patronizing

173
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,850
designers I don't know sound like I'm

174
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,430
looking down on them it's certainly not

175
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,590
the case so this talk is an anti design

176
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,470
and this talk is about keeping designers

177
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,020
and developers and the business and

178
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,750
users happy I've got a really good

179
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,640
professional and working relationship

180
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,470
with my design team from the design team

181
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,640
at sky

182
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,530
they do some fantastic work they're very

183
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,790
clever guys and we've got a mutual

184
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,220
respect so this talk is an anti design

185
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,810
I'm not saying designs a bad thing at

186
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,479
all another thing to know is this the

187
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:38,950
kind of stuff I'm talking about it won't

188
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,790
work on every site and

189
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,280
we shouldn't the kind of sights I'm

190
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,380
talking about a bigger website which I

191
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,710
refer to a sort of a UI based I think

192
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,800
about the Facebook's the Google+ apps

193
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,290
that people keep returning to that

194
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,630
people spend a long time on things that

195
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,070
are inherently big but need to be

196
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,180
consistent

197
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,620
this kind of stuff wouldn't be really

198
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,840
appropriate for a photographer's

199
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,060
portfolio or a single paid marketing

200
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,330
site so yeah list of apps to talk about

201
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,770
might not be appropriate for the kind of

202
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,600
stuff you are working on or all the kind

203
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,860
of projects you might have worked on

204
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,560
previously and you might just disagree

205
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,660
with me like I said and we've got a

206
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,340
hashtag if you do just think I'm talking

207
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,450
out to the rubbish I'd live to know

208
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,340
because then I have worked fairly soft

209
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,870
solar for the last two and a half years

210
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,550
and this is something I found has really

211
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,120
worked for me

212
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,880
and I've never had opposition from other

213
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,620
developers because there haven't been

214
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,200
any I find opposition from designers so

215
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,580
I'd really like to get your opinions if

216
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,890
you have any yeah if you disagree I'd

217
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,780
love to know why or what potential other

218
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,910
ways of working that you you guys sort

219
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:47,630
of work to and a lot of the stuff I've

220
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,180
done with sky has been based around

221
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,980
making compromises now compromises a

222
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,690
really negative sounding word people

223
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,060
think of it as a bad thing but

224
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,470
compromise is actually really really

225
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:57,770
good

226
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,020
because what compromise does is it keeps

227
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,180
more than one person happy compromises

228
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,390
like the opposite of selfish it's been

229
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,470
really important for me that I've

230
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,910
established a good working relationship

231
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,070
and personal sort of friendships with

232
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,170
that with the design team we have

233
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,940
massive respectful one of those jobs I

234
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,740
know that I need to get out of their way

235
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,300
and let them do their thing but there

236
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,100
now understand that I'm a developer I

237
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,590
think differently to how a subjective

238
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,660
and creative person would think I think

239
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,750
very objectively one thing it's really

240
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,900
important is I never just sin so I kind

241
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,100
of made it sound like a doob I always

242
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,590
discuss everything but I'm thinking

243
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,349
everything I want to do and explain why

244
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,540
this is really important for two reasons

245
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,120
it allows this collaboration to happen

246
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,560
it allows them to fire back their

247
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,430
opinions but it also allows them to

248
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,920
understand why I think how I do and it

249
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,300
allows them to start thinking that way

250
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,890
as well so I'm going to open up the

251
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,600
discussion for alternatives

252
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,610
to preamp the kind of things I would see

253
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,970
as sticking point yet we collaborate to

254
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,970
reach ideals now I'm sky and I'm aware

255
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,709
that several larger companies still do

256
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,649
have quite a slow moving process and

257
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:07,910
that's probably a business rather than a

258
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,370
dev problem you know the business want

259
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,709
to see PS DS so we get those and then we

260
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:13,759
take them into the brows and we build

261
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,399
them bigger companies people that talk

262
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,110
about often enough but bigger companies

263
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,790
do move a lot slower and it's harder to

264
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,860
have a complete design in the browser

265
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,690
culture and we don't have one at sky

266
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,660
what we have is a phrase that someone

267
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,190
coined recently and I can't remember who

268
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,620
it was and decided in the browser I

269
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,940
don't if you heard that iPhone only

270
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,279
knows who who who came up with that if

271
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,990
you could tweet that maybe brilliant I'd

272
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,360
love to attribute them we decide in the

273
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,649
browser and I do that alongside

274
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:43,730
designers because a PSD for it might

275
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,190
look nice you've got no idea how or if

276
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,529
that can work in real life so we have

277
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:50,000
this process where yeah they'll come to

278
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,829
me with a Photoshop file and I'll start

279
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:53,269
building and I'll say well hey look look

280
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:54,500
at this I don't think this is very good

281
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,300
because you know it's a bit half key so

282
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,279
what can we change so we decide in the

283
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:02,240
browser but importantly no means no if a

284
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,639
designer says to me look no you're not

285
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,069
changing this we have to have this I

286
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:08,959
will argue my case and I'll discuss why

287
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,720
I think it's a bad idea but their

288
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,279
opinions are just as valid as mine and

289
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,329
if they're adamant that they want

290
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:15,949
something to stay in want something to

291
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,709
to remain as is I will respect that and

292
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:20,899
if no means no if they don't want me to

293
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:22,730
change the thing then there are some

294
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,759
times when I weren't a lot of the

295
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,259
discussions are half with designs at sky

296
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,060
based on what our rounds of like cheesy

297
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,560
one-liners I'm a sucker for a sound bite

298
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,790
this is something I put in an article a

299
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,310
few years ago I can't remember which

300
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,870
article it was but people still quote me

301
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,899
on this a PSD is a clue and not a

302
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:45,709
contract so yeah a designer will come to

303
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:47,990
me with a PSD there's no guarantee that

304
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,310
I'm going to build exactly what they've

305
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,970
put down people see is this contractual

306
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,220
obligation this is the first a shop file

307
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,649
therefore this is what we're going to do

308
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:58,790
and that's a really bad way of thinking

309
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,110
it's very stubborn way of thinking it's

310
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,480
very very detrimental to the entire

311
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,120
process because if you draw a line at

312
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,279
PSD stage you've got the entire

313
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,019
rest of the project where you stuck with

314
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:10,189
a decision that you made far too early

315
00:11:10,189 --> 00:11:12,170
on I like up like I said we need to

316
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,699
decide in the browser it's far too early

317
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:15,920
on to commit to anything when it's just

318
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,519
pixels in Photoshop

319
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,529
what PSD will do is this is the clue

320
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:23,720
aspect gives me an idea of what the

321
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,309
designer wants it gives me an idea of

322
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,839
the kind of feel they want the site to

323
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,790
have it'll tell me what brand treatments

324
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,999
what colors are used you know what can

325
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:34,850
I've turned the page will set it can

326
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,019
give you a really good cysteine and it

327
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:37,879
might be very complete and very polished

328
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,620
PSD it might look like it might look

329
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,930
like it could be a complete design but

330
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:42,860
you should see there's no more than

331
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,249
clues and and kind of yes steers and

332
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:47,990
pointers to where the design should be

333
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,240
headed under quiet calls if the design

334
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,350
atmosphere which i think is a really

335
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,079
really nice term it's not in third

336
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,149
design it's how the design feels and you

337
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:59,720
can glean a lot from a PSD just just in

338
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,699
terms of the design atmosphere tick is

339
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:03,170
clues and hints as to what the designer

340
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,600
want and not as a gospel agreement as to

341
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,920
what they shall get another thing I find

342
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,870
myself saying to the team a lot is um

343
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,269
it's doable but you know I weren't or

344
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:16,250
it's doable but I don't want to or I

345
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,040
shouldn't we find that we can build

346
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,839
almost anything and we're all good

347
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:23,209
developers and there aren't many

348
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,910
problems we come across that we can't

349
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,579
yeah we can't build something but

350
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:30,350
doesn't mean we should just cuz we can't

351
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,180
find a solution doesn't mean that we

352
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,170
always should use it

353
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,629
basically we pride myself on writing

354
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,000
reams and reams of CSS to build crazy

355
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,160
designs that some would come up with if

356
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,540
you ever got a PSD of a print designer

357
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,910
right I used to get really proud I was

358
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,410
like oh I could build up and I'd have

359
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,089
like a style sheet this long to build

360
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:49,250
one header and I used to really love

361
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,839
that you think I am so good at my job

362
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,279
look I've made this look exactly like

363
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:55,610
the PSD and assumed why actually wasn't

364
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,899
even that soon I'll admit it was a years

365
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:58,309
before I realized this is very very

366
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:00,410
naive this is a very silly way of

367
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,179
working because there's so much more to

368
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:03,499
building a front-end than just

369
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:05,319
replicating a PSD

370
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:07,939
you shouldn't have a right curd that's

371
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:09,740
terrible just a satisfier design that

372
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,089
could have been changed like I said

373
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:12,980
where we're building products are based

374
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,230
on curd we should never have curd suffer

375
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,259
for the sake of something superficial

376
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:19,190
especially working on a product that you

377
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,380
after for several years the codebase is

378
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,640
what you work with day-in day-out

379
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,070
don't sort of sacrifice the quality of

380
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,020
that code base for something that could

381
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,650
have been avoided current leads mentor

382
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,970
just because you can doesn't mean you

383
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,530
should and I've spelled doesn't wrong

384
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:37,850
that's embarrassing so this pearl of

385
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,830
wisdom is from Jurassic Park of all

386
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,590
films right that the bitly URL is a

387
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,320
scene in Jurassic Park where they're

388
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,060
discussing the fact that sure we can

389
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,550
bring dinosaurs back but is that a good

390
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,500
idea should we do it it's actually a

391
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,090
really good scene it's quite a metaphor

392
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,980
for a lot of other things and in their

393
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,420
case bringing dinosaurs back wasn't too

394
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,180
wise so yeah just because I can

395
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,800
or because you can doesn't always mean

396
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,800
you should avoid problems don't try and

397
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,090
just show off and write complex

398
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,550
convoluted code just to satisfy a design

399
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,220
team think about the the end user can

400
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,830
you write something that's fast satisfy

401
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,330
other developers make sure that and

402
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,890
inherit your code and they just sort of

403
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,870
look at it blank Fair's wondering why on

404
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,880
earth you did something just because you

405
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:25,200
can doesn't mean you should

406
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,110
performance is a really big thing for me

407
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,630
I tend to say this - designers quite a

408
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:33,890
lot of sky they're really into sort of

409
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,800
you know retina stuff retina looked real

410
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,270
nice and you always notice an on retina

411
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,370
experience but it's a performance

412
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:43,990
overhead it's a hit to your site speed

413
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,920
you've always got to think about things

414
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,660
a little wider than well it looks nice

415
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,040
isn't gonna how nice it looked if it

416
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,570
takes 20 seconds to get onto someone's

417
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,460
device it's kind of a misguided effort

418
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,430
users do live an appreciate good design

419
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,960
they interact more with beautifully

420
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,580
designed things nicely designed things

421
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,640
are typically easier to use if you work

422
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,810
on a product or an app that you want

423
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,730
people to engage with and use over and

424
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,450
over again a nice UI is very important

425
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,370
but studies have shown time and time

426
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,710
again that users will leave before they

427
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,930
even get to see that UI if your site is

428
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,580
slow they won't stay around to see how

429
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,930
nice you've designed it they will

430
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,580
disappear so you've got to think about

431
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,870
how fast you can get something that

432
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,720
looks almost as good on to that users

433
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,230
device it's something I'd like to work

434
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,680
to performance first

435
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,209
stuff like mobile first and content

436
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:36,920
first a really good noble sort of

437
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,680
schools of thought but I like to go back

438
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,660
even further and start performance first

439
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,730
because performance first will benefit

440
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,529
everyone it's a matter of feeling of a

441
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,450
fiber connection on a brand-new shiny

442
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,190
mutton book or you're going through a

443
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,660
tree internal honor on a blackberry

444
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,839
performance first will benefit everyone

445
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,560
and this is something we've moved

446
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,779
towards the sky I'm really proud of the

447
00:15:56,779 --> 00:15:58,190
designers that we've done some great

448
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,480
work together we've sort of managed to

449
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,949
form this good working relationship

450
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:02,870
where I had a designer come to me a

451
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,000
couple of weeks ago it's like a hurry

452
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,680
I've designed this but I was thinking if

453
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,880
we get rid of that we can save a couple

454
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,740
of requests and I thought that's really

455
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,600
cool to have a designer because we've

456
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,920
got a very traditional split we have

457
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,910
designers me and engineers so we still

458
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,070
have a very tiered approach but the fact

459
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,089
that I'm getting designers to think

460
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:22,040
about HTTP requests while they're

461
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,260
tinkering in first a shop that's really

462
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,339
good news for the product it's really

463
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:26,690
good news for the codebase it's really

464
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,639
good news for the team so I've kind of

465
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,230
got our designers thinking performance

466
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,600
first everything that design will have a

467
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,310
performance impact and how can we

468
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:38,630
mitigate and lessen that something I

469
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,180
will readily admit I completely made up

470
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,029
is the 80/20 rule again these were

471
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:45,440
conversations I have with the design

472
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,560
team at Sky and any designers I work

473
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,380
with typically an 80/20 rule loosely

474
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,699
sort of states that um if we can achieve

475
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:58,699
80% of a design in 20% of the curd then

476
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:02,149
we should always take that option if it

477
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:04,669
was pick some really easy numbers if

478
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:06,650
we've got a design and it would take a

479
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,780
hundred lines to code it perfectly to

480
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,459
get a hundred percent of that design it

481
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:12,799
would take a hundred lines of code if I

482
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,870
could build 80% of that design something

483
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,540
that's almost the same in 20 lines of

484
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,339
code I will pick that on every time

485
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,319
because like I said before the easiest

486
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,910
way to keep a code base maintained was

487
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,770
to keep it small the easiest way to keep

488
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,449
it small it's just a trim things out

489
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:28,339
anything superficial anything that

490
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,679
doesn't really really matter if we can

491
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:32,419
get rid of it then we're gonna we're

492
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,100
gonna start seeing benefits across the

493
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,620
board if you scale this way of thinking

494
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,240
across a site that's two and a half

495
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,160
years old and you trim everything you

496
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,200
can for two and a half years the amount

497
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,600
of savings are huge all these things

498
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,020
sound like micro optimizer

499
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,180
I got a friend called Jamie Mears and a

500
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,730
fantastic JavaScript engineer and he

501
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,530
says if you look after the bit the bikes

502
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,780
will look after themselves so a lot of

503
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,270
micro optimizations will add up to over

504
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,640
a project that spans years they all add

505
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,870
up to sizeable servings this is

506
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,070
something that designers actually said

507
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,030
to me

508
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,310
my boss is a lovely guy I met in five

509
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,440
years ago he worked an agency together

510
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,570
five years ago Rob Farnell really clever

511
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,480
guy but we've got such a friendship that

512
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,950
he kind of really takes the piss out of

513
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,510
me at work and he tells me this all the

514
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,760
time if I said to him I'm not building

515
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,350
that he'll say like well I thought you

516
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,940
could couldn't are you not up to it can

517
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,500
you not do this and it really annoys me

518
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,820
I know he's I know he's winding me up

519
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,770
and but it's kind of the same thing as

520
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,180
before just because I come doesn't mean

521
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,270
I should um but telling a team of

522
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,740
designers but I won't build something

523
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,520
often makes me look like a bad developer

524
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,810
they often questioned why unemployed

525
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,240
what why am i there to do this job when

526
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,330
they know they could build it again it

527
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,860
was so much more to being a front-end

528
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,240
developer than just pixel perfect

529
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,470
matching PS DS a front-end developer has

530
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,970
to think about the quality of occurred

531
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,240
base the the product as a whole and the

532
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,490
rest of the team and you'd never judge a

533
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,790
builder's ability or his worth on his

534
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,710
ability to lay bricks because that's

535
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,460
looking far too far to sort of fine you

536
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,010
judge a builder's abilities on how well

537
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,050
you can create a big strong structure

538
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,760
that will last for hundreds of years

539
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,950
to measure a front-end developers worth

540
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,920
on his or her ability to some match

541
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,600
designs in the browser is really

542
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,550
something I even close minded way of

543
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,330
looking at things

544
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,750
there's far much more to it than that so

545
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,470
you've got to look at the bigger picture

546
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,870
that's why you know we think performance

547
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,580
first that's why we think about how we

548
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,190
can scale this website how we can keep

549
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,480
it maintained about how we can keep it

550
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,760
nice to work with I can guarantee that

551
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,890
if my day job was just seeing how while

552
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,180
I could match designs

553
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,620
this site is two-and-a-half years old

554
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,690
we'd want to scrap that by now and two

555
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,980
and a half years isn't in a long time

556
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,000
and this site is going to go on

557
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,440
indefinitely it could end up being five

558
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,840
years old and you know five years worth

559
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,570
of just matching PS DS pixel for pixel

560
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,430
would lead to a terribly complex

561
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:04,930
convoluted and nasty codebase one thing

562
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,430
I've noticed particularly among the

563
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,920
might of engineering friends people far

564
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,080
cleverer than I am is the better you get

565
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,520
at writing code the less you want to

566
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,240
write so it's happened to me I used to

567
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,220
live right in terms of CSS to perfectly

568
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,730
replicate a PSD the batter I've got at

569
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,520
my job the more I've learned the more

570
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,960
I've realized that I don't want to lie

571
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,120
anymore code I own occurred this I don't

572
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,740
want to get any bigger I want to do

573
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,210
everything I can to keep it small to

574
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,880
keep it nice to you to work with I've

575
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,430
got what why I resent writing any code I

576
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,880
feel I could have avoided any time I

577
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,800
write something sort of bespoke that I

578
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,900
know will never get reused it's kind of

579
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,550
a hit and it's going to happen of course

580
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,840
it's going to happen you couldn't have

581
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,630
two page headers you know there's

582
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,920
certain things you will only have one of

583
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,710
I hear having to write anything bespoke

584
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,130
because anything bespoke is like it's

585
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,170
like it's dead wet and later it will

586
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,320
happen that avoid all costs I would like

587
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,960
to recycle things if I see anything like

588
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,670
I think I could have borrowed from

589
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,790
elsewhere but I've missed an opportunity

590
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:13,390
that's time to go back and refactor it's

591
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,970
some people sort of accuse me of her

592
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,070
premature abstraction which is kind of

593
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,390
ferreting I see the point it's like a

594
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,520
rule of thumb don't abstract until

595
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,530
you've used something two times and I

596
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:27,010
don't do that or cover this in a second

597
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,440
and I was try and write everything to be

598
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,390
reusable from the outset because

599
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,910
anything you can reuse is free of charge

600
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,650
and free of charge is a really important

601
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,660
thing in growing a curd base free of

602
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,370
charge means it already exists but it

603
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,840
costs you nothing to use it again

604
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,090
anything you can get free of charge is

605
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,100
really really nice it's a nice thing for

606
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,590
a code base to have the way to write

607
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,020
less code to the simplest ways are to

608
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,960
normalize and abstract these are food to

609
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,490
to computer science terms normalization

610
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,350
usually deals with data sets and and

611
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,000
trimming down repetition in those an

612
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,370
abstraction deals with them sort of

613
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,100
taking design patterns and putting them

614
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,020
elsewhere in like a reusable deep purple

615
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,640
state that's a normalization

616
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,990
it's not spotting repetition so Nicole

617
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,570
I'd give a really good talk it's quite a

618
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:18,120
while ago now I imagine called our CSS

619
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,460
best practices are killing us and and

620
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,260
this dealt with normalization and and

621
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,110
the idea that if there's a lot of things

622
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,700
repeated across a design then there

623
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,220
should be sort of gathered together

624
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,420
spotting repetitions are really useful

625
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,790
skill to have allows you to gather these

626
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,130
things and normalize them but more

627
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,450
important than that is opting the

628
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:39,150
potential for repetition so someone

629
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:42,570
might have used you know the same color

630
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,760
in ten different places you can abstract

631
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,440
that out but what if they've used

632
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,390
similar colors in ten different places

633
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,860
can we distill that down into different

634
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,780
one and this is things that are these

635
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,770
are things that Nicole's dealt with

636
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,560
quite in-depth so if we take this

637
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,470
example we've got a header footer on a

638
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:01,380
content div they've all got really

639
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,020
similar padding values they're only two

640
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,080
pickles apart will the user notice that

641
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,110
the footers two pixels smaller than the

642
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,450
header I don't think they will so why

643
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:15,060
why have that departure can we distill

644
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,070
this down into just one number can we

645
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,690
make them all twenty pixels and I'm

646
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,510
pretty sure we come so this is

647
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,130
normalization and this is a really timid

648
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,950
example if you if you take this school

649
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,600
of four and apply it to a full front end

650
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,820
you will find lots of potential for

651
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,630
repetition you can normalize out so

652
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,340
normalization is the start but their

653
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,590
neck needs do is abstract this we need

654
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,900
to take these things and wrap them up we

655
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,110
need to decouple them from their initial

656
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:46,050
purposes there are little use cases we

657
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,790
take these normalizations put them in

658
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,200
little bundles that we can reuse

659
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,740
anywhere that are completely agnostic to

660
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,940
the Dom or to whatever they were

661
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,670
initially spawn from so if we look at

662
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,160
this we've now normalized this design

663
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,410
pattern we've we've shared that 20

664
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,450
pixels across these three things but

665
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,940
it's still very tightly coupled we can't

666
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,590
reuse that anywhere else without adding

667
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,440
another selector to that list so we've

668
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,520
kind of got half way that we've

669
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,260
normalized this really simple design

670
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,060
pattern but now we need to put it to

671
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,940
work and only to abstract it the first

672
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,040
thing we'll do is pop it in a variable

673
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,080
and of course using SAS because

674
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,430
well there's no other alternative as far

675
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,490
as I'm concerned let's not start off a

676
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,810
war about that one on Twitter there

677
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:30,780
please so yeah she's popping something

678
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,570
in a variable pre processes are really

679
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,810
good at helping you use abstractions

680
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,760
they're built for that very purpose to

681
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,530
avoid you repeating things so the

682
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,420
simplest single step we can take is just

683
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,780
dropping this 20 pixel into a variable

684
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,920
take that step further we can drop it

685
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,440
into abstracted clusters so we have a

686
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,900
class of box this didn't tie itself to

687
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,880
any type of content this is this is now

688
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,920
a free thing to reuse this is an

689
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,840
abstraction that we can play it wherever

690
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,820
we want

691
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,470
we'll use a solid class and drop into

692
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,300
markup which is my preferred way of

693
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,700
working but you know if you don't like

694
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,580
that then we can use the we can use the

695
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,250
silent class and use extend this is a

696
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,020
way of taking those normalizations and

697
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,150
now moving them completely away from

698
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,650
where we originally found them into

699
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,930
something totally reusable it's all

700
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,610
decoupled and now it becomes free of

701
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,890
charge and you know these are really

702
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,960
timid examples these are just well they

703
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,420
are just our examples and you can spot

704
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,430
these yourself and and we can put these

705
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,940
to work for us this is a real simple use

706
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,190
case but there are hundreds or infinite

707
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,420
amounts more that you can spot for

708
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,010
yourself and it's doing stuff like this

709
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,720
if - to keep code bases where I've

710
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,710
worked nice and small so I mentioned

711
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,480
that sort of get accused of premature

712
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,390
abstraction I make sure I got the right

713
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:52,980
word there so like I mentioned before a

714
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,720
lot of people will say don't abstract

715
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,630
something until you've used it twice

716
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,590
that's a lot of the engineers at sky

717
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,320
have sprints where they've just got

718
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,180
refactoring work to do and I hate

719
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,420
refactoring I think it's so dull so what

720
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,860
I do is I have strapped everything up

721
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,290
front everything I write I like to think

722
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,450
is going to be reusable it may never get

723
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,190
reused but for the circ of it why not

724
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,840
just do the job properly the first time

725
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,570
round so whenever I get accused of

726
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,120
premature abstraction I kind of prefer

727
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,790
to call it prepared abstraction if

728
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,950
you're going to spend a complete sprint

729
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,380
refactoring your curd or I'll just do my

730
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,420
own thing and not have that of boring

731
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,970
stiffly because I've already done my job

732
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:35,000
as well as I come from the outset

733
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,130
doing it that way from the outset does

734
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,300
mean that there will be things that will

735
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,100
never get reused so there is some sort

736
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,590
of there is a hit upfront but if like me

737
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,210
you don't enjoy refactoring kurd then

738
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:50,280
this is probably the best way to go

739
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,880
another sort of cheesy soundbite I use

740
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,220
with with designers is that they're

741
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,170
called rule sets for a reason and again

742
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:59,060
this isn't really true it's just like a

743
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,470
metaphor so designers will come up with

744
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,480
really sort of subjective and a nice

745
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,160
looking creative designs with free rent

746
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,690
I believe that you know you shouldn't

747
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,420
bog designers down too much with

748
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,520
overhead and and sort of comic strips

749
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,650
because that will limit what they can do

750
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,990
and so I like to do it sky so design

751
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:23,240
what you think is the best solution and

752
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,730
then we all work together to flash out

753
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:28,970
into a proper production solution that's

754
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,200
what I said them is they're called rule

755
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,300
sets for a reason so what I do is armed

756
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,250
whatever you've designed I now as a

757
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,080
developer with my sort of developer hat

758
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,440
on I have to distill down into rules but

759
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,350
the good thing there is consistent user

760
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,790
interfaces are all based around rules

761
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:49,100
anyway yeah and I sort of I mentioned

762
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,480
sort of sites like our Facebook and

763
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,230
Google+

764
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,210
these are big sites you want users to

765
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,830
interact with for a long amount of time

766
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,200
if everything's consistent it kind of

767
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,460
gives them a little more faith in that

768
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,070
product in that site they can trust it

769
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,690
more because they know what to expect so

770
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,790
good consistent user interface is best

771
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,920
run rules anyway so if we can set these

772
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,050
subjective designs and distillers down

773
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:12,380
into rules that we stick to the codebase

774
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,300
are going to stay a lot smaller it's

775
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,190
been easy to manage but also the user

776
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,110
gets a better experience the user can

777
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,820
have more faith in a product or service

778
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,060
because it always responds and looks and

779
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,690
behaves the same this is something I

780
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:29,330
actually drew about two or three weeks

781
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,620
ago in a meeting and I thought would

782
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,830
snap at first wait for this talk Rob the

783
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,060
guy who were mentioned earlier who takes

784
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,370
a Nick out of me we were discussing a

785
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:40,100
component I don't know which one it was

786
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,050
it I think it was just any generic

787
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,460
component we're building a component

788
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,220
library at Sky and in the middle line

789
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,590
you see that comes up straight out

790
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,630
a straight line that has enough you know

791
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,659
that is the longest one that is the

792
00:28:53,659 --> 00:28:56,179
ideal lifespan of a component that you

793
00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:57,950
don't touch if you don't touch like if

794
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:00,169
you stick to the rules that is its happy

795
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:01,309
a little lifespan and nothing ever

796
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:02,480
changes you'd have to worry about

797
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,270
anything any departure from that becomes

798
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,549
a fork in the curd so let's say we've

799
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:09,380
got a component and on one page it needs

800
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,330
to be a little bigger in something

801
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,820
that's a fork in the curd on another

802
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,559
page or for whatever reason you might

803
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:18,590
want to have a different font I don't

804
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,480
know why you'd do that but yeah that

805
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,440
could be the case or there might be an

806
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,539
error state in which you know it becomes

807
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:27,200
red all these modifications all these

808
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,360
variations of a component or extra

809
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,120
commitments every of a breakage of any

810
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,559
rule is a commitment what if we change

811
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:38,840
the the topmost version how will that

812
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,320
impact anything else because CSS

813
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,480
inherits and shares so much we have to

814
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,399
know that if we change one thing we need

815
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,919
to know how it will affect any of the

816
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,380
six or seven others every fork in the

817
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,899
curd is more overhead and the more you

818
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:55,940
can reduce those Forks the better of

819
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,260
course if something does need to be read

820
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,700
in an arrow state then we can live with

821
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,830
that we can have one fork but every

822
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,090
single thought that tries to be

823
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,770
introduced every kind of rule anyone

824
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,880
wants to break needs to be really

825
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,000
carefully considered I think if you're

826
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,870
gonna if you're going to come up with

827
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,120
rules all the from we've had previously

828
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,799
as a we'd come up with rules and the

829
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,390
business would be like we're gonna have

830
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,399
this button a little bigger so you can

831
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,470
it's really easy to do but now we've got

832
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,000
to have one different type of button

833
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,490
just to satisfy that request is that

834
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,960
really worth it and it's it's really

835
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,520
interesting place to be when you have to

836
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,260
sort of tell designers they can't have

837
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,909
this until the business they can't have

838
00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:29,840
that and you're in the middle of it all

839
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,029
and it all comes back to this sort of

840
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:33,289
sorting out your relationships with the

841
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,960
people you work with and rules are

842
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,580
really really nice where to get people

843
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,840
to agree to things up front

844
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,179
and like I said I will break rules if I

845
00:30:41,179 --> 00:30:44,330
need to if it's a really valid reason we

846
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,440
can work to that and we can work around

847
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,809
that so I've got some I got some quick

848
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:53,840
examples now when I submitted the

849
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,210
proposal for this talk I was like that

850
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,280
sounds quite interesting then about ten

851
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,790
minutes later I was like

852
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,590
how am I gonna write like a 40 minute

853
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,720
talk out of this and then I started

854
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,340
writing it I realize it's like this this

855
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,160
should be like a half-day workshop so

856
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,120
I'm gonna blitz through some stuff

857
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,250
fairly quickly I've tried to have this

858
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,900
above a theoretical talk than a heavy

859
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,810
soft curd led talk and one of my

860
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:18,480
favorite UI and design based rules when

861
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,490
I would share happily with everyone and

862
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,970
I will recommend to everyone is a rule

863
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:26,730
that you can set when the first of four

864
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,910
lines of your new project and any new

865
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,140
project you start you'll probably do

866
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,970
something like this you will decide on

867
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,410
the best font size and the best line

868
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,000
height this is a real fundamental

869
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,470
decision that hopefully you'd write it a

870
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,990
little more like this but what it all

871
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:40,980
comes down to is the fact that you've

872
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,830
chosen a base font size of 16 pixels and

873
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,730
a baseline height of 24 pixels

874
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:50,340
24 is a very very important number the

875
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,810
first decision you make about a build

876
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:56,010
can underpin the piece of the sizing and

877
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,720
the either build of your entire project

878
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,150
that 24 pixels now becomes our base

879
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,490
spacing unit and this is something I've

880
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,620
done on every single site I've built

881
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,470
every single site I've built for us two

882
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,910
and a bit years and it's never let me

883
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,310
down yet so I'm really quite confident

884
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,920
about this and how it works

885
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,620
this underpins the sky back on the site

886
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,330
that I keep referencing that took sort

887
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,760
of two and a half years so I've put this

888
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,020
into practice and its really worked

889
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,890
quite nicely our base spacing unit so

890
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,110
I'm probably fairly confident you've all

891
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,360
seen code like this before

892
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,790
and initially nothing looks too too bad

893
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,550
with that but I I cringe when I see code

894
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:38,640
like this because well 38 pixels is a

895
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,770
really specific number to be on such a

896
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:43,770
loose selector why why 38 where's that

897
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:44,250
coming from

898
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,500
a code base that you can't rationalize

899
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,830
that you can't trust is is bad news

900
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:52,590
because I see that there's 38 pixels a

901
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,920
margin on my h1 I don't touch that that

902
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,600
number sounds so specific that there

903
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,490
must be a reason for it somewhere so I

904
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,050
won't change that and most developers

905
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,000
weren't so you'll add another class and

906
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,710
you'll add more code to try and get

907
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,650
around this 38 that's inexplicable this

908
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,540
isn't very say incured this is hard to

909
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,040
rationalize it's hard to make sense of

910
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,470
and if you got this in a big codebase

911
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,440
it becomes really hard to work with so

912
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,679
my solution did the best spacing unit is

913
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:21,390
give every block level element the same

914
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,909
initial margin bottom the link at the

915
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:26,120
bottom there is a that I'm covering is

916
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,450
so article I wrote about this this base

917
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:32,460
spacing unit can be used to sort out

918
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,190
your entire site spacing and the nice

919
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,110
thing is because 24 pixels in our base

920
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,360
line height as soon as we apply that as

921
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,909
the margin bottom we get perfect

922
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:43,830
vertical rhythm for free so we get a

923
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,840
nice reading experience completely for

924
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,630
free here and this is this is like a

925
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:51,120
rational seer number that has a reason

926
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,620
behind it applied to very loose

927
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,659
selectors now if we want our page title

928
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:57,539
to be double what we can do that quite

929
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:59,159
easily as a rule we can break because we

930
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:00,510
can rationalize where that number came

931
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:03,179
from in the first place but it's not

932
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:05,070
about margin bottoms either sir I wrote

933
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,780
an article called the island object

934
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,790
which is better a more abstract way of

935
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,669
thing like a box so now we pad that

936
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:15,090
Island object by 24 pixels that number

937
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,440
has a purpose we know where it came from

938
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,889
because it underpins our entire UI but

939
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:21,780
if we want a smaller box an eyelet for

940
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,690
example we can just have that number

941
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,919
which leads us on to the next thing a

942
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:28,290
really nice ruler I haven't managed to

943
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,460
write this up yeah I just haven't at the

944
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,929
time I real to write an article on this

945
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:35,010
and called UI sizing scales so we've got

946
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,080
this 24 pixels that underpins our our

947
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,810
men sort of spacing so we can do things

948
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,960
like this we can spin off any variations

949
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,389
of a component that we might need just

950
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,310
by having this BAM inspired naming

951
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,409
convention here we can have things we

952
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:51,839
can double them we can quadruple them so

953
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,940
for example yeah here we've got there 24

954
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,520
pixels again but the tiny version six

955
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,710
pixels and these rules that we can stick

956
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,240
to we can rationalize all these numbers

957
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,920
if a designer wants to make a button a

958
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,839
bit smaller we can do that we can use

959
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,210
the tiny modifier and these are all

960
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,800
based around simple rules that we

961
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,530
actually set up in the first decision we

962
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,060
made the first decision we made about

963
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,230
this build can underpin the entire UI

964
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,970
now the reason designers dislike me is

965
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,440
this is a very very methodological

966
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,560
methyl I won't try and sell up word it's

967
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,000
a very sort of sort of clinical approach

968
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,860
to design it's hard to tell the design

969
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,810
of it I'm gonna distill your design down

970
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:33,870
to numbers it's really hard thing to get

971
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,340
across to them that well you might have

972
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,750
designed this because it looked right

973
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,580
but I want to change it because the

974
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,080
numbers work and I can trust these

975
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,760
numbers now and and it doesn't always

976
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,770
work isn't always work correctly and

977
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,750
they don't always appreciate that and

978
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,490
it's something that I have to solve I

979
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,500
have to live with but if we can distill

980
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,390
things incurred down to numbers and

981
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,310
rules we can have much more confidence

982
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,840
in growing occurred that's because we

983
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,380
know what to spin out from where so

984
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,660
typography is another really a really

985
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,260
sort of important thing here again this

986
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,850
is kind of a piggybacking the work that

987
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:09,090
Nicole's been doing or has done so we've

988
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,550
got our fifth 16 pixel based font size

989
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,440
and also can we've got a read more link

990
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,540
that's one pixel smaller than that and

991
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,890
we've got a caption that's one pixel

992
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,900
larger here we've got skirt for

993
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,490
normalization why we got this slight

994
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,530
departure users probably weren't nervous

995
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,300
that one pixel difference so why even

996
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,240
have it in the first place we can

997
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,860
piggyback here Kamel elements we've

998
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,050
already got here as one through to your

999
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,990
headings one to six and body copy and

1000
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,820
small print that's already eight

1001
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,460
different sizes of thumb out of the box

1002
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,170
we shouldn't really add to that if we

1003
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:43,350
can avoid adding to that unnecessarily

1004
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:46,350
then we really should so your body copy

1005
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,930
is your default I always really get sort

1006
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,340
of concerned when I see people setting

1007
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,220
font sizes on paragraphs or on lists

1008
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,920
because if you set that higher up if you

1009
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,270
sell on the hit from element that will

1010
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,160
trickle down anyway and again this is

1011
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,810
just micro optimizations to cut bits out

1012
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,730
of a code base you shouldn't need a font

1013
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:03,990
size on a paragraph because that should

1014
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,130
be given by something that's happened

1015
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,500
we're further at the Dom it's a body

1016
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,150
copy is the default the thing you put on

1017
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,130
the HML element the the font size you

1018
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,120
give that should trickle down to

1019
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,160
everything and headings in small print

1020
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,050
are the kind of exceptions and there

1021
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,400
will be other exceptions you might want

1022
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,750
a big call to action that needs to be

1023
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:22,710
huge you know you can you can bend the

1024
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,180
rules but if you stick to as many as you

1025
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,560
come you're going to find it on the come

1026
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,890
on rational and say incurred this yeah

1027
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,750
so this is this is how it kind of looks

1028
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,850
you could sort if you were to do a blog

1029
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,100
for example I'm just a real text heavy

1030
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,410
site that was mainly for reading that

1031
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:39,660
should be our entire site's typography

1032
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,839
sorted you shouldn't really need any

1033
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:45,410
but if you do this is something again

1034
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,390
from Nicole sort of a double stranded

1035
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,819
heading hierarchy we can normalize an

1036
00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:51,560
abstract any other font sizes we need

1037
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,210
into this kind of thing so we can cross

1038
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:56,630
over h4 looks like a hitch one and this

1039
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,160
is all part of normalizing and

1040
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,859
rationalizing and abstracting designs

1041
00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:04,490
for the sake of our code quality I've

1042
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,710
got some real quick real life examples

1043
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:10,280
then real quick so the last that I built

1044
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,950
was n skype.com it's a mobile specific

1045
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,710
site for a sky's biggest and most

1046
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,050
profitable online property really cool

1047
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:21,980
product to work on we had this now I was

1048
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,599
concerned about this I don't know if you

1049
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,060
can see this this blue grid of nine

1050
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,220
icons can you see like the blue divider

1051
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,680
lines that split the icons apart from

1052
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,030
each other I've kind of pulled it out

1053
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,569
into this more stark example so the

1054
00:38:35,569 --> 00:38:37,970
designer said well between each icon we

1055
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:40,250
want less grid and this grid has to fade

1056
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,640
out from dark blue to light blue now we

1057
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,160
could probably build this we could use

1058
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,079
some pseudo elements and CSS gradients

1059
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,810
or we could have used images like

1060
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,430
background images but that's actually

1061
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,369
requests we could have best 60 for those

1062
00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:57,619
images the last kilobytes electricity is

1063
00:38:57,619 --> 00:38:59,359
a stress for the sake of these really

1064
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,260
trivial simple looking design treatments

1065
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,550
so ideas I went back and said well look

1066
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,230
why don't we treat why don't we use

1067
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,750
illusion so now I'm sort of grading the

1068
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,609
borders out we put a real subtle

1069
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:12,470
gradient on the container then nav

1070
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:15,319
container and now those borders are

1071
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:18,140
solid colors now we can use one pixel

1072
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,900
solid whatever and give the illusion

1073
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,030
that these borders sort of fade out to

1074
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,589
nothing and they don't at all it's the

1075
00:39:24,589 --> 00:39:26,359
background that fades but we've managed

1076
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:29,180
to save tons of CSS and using just a

1077
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:32,210
single one line border rules to replace

1078
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,470
that entire thing so if we switch back

1079
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,329
to this I really don't think they're

1080
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:37,430
able to see it but the horse racing bit

1081
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,230
that's the lighter part of the nav and

1082
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,050
the edges are what gets darker and all

1083
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,970
of those borders are just solid one

1084
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:46,670
pixel CSS borders nothing tricky nothing

1085
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:50,089
complicated the trick is to cheat and

1086
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:50,780
use illusion

1087
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,640
there are clever sneaky things you can

1088
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,520
do

1089
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,350
yeah I'm gonna have to really blitz

1090
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,880
through these number Fred another really

1091
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,670
simple example was um you can see we had

1092
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,190
this enough and again it's this

1093
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,840
gradiated border a really simple design

1094
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,610
treatment something that we could all

1095
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,340
build again how would we build it it was

1096
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,050
the same story we could use a background

1097
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,450
image or base64 or CSS gradients and

1098
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:16,570
pseudo elements that seems like a lot of

1099
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,310
stuff to have to do just to satisfy this

1100
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:21,670
one tiny design treatment I would hit

1101
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,860
after use ten lines of CSS gradient to

1102
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,080
get one border between two list items it

1103
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,300
seems really over the top and if you

1104
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,310
scale one across an entire site the

1105
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,900
amount of extra curly off stuffing in

1106
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,700
there just to make simple things happen

1107
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,640
it seems really sort of it seems really

1108
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,730
backward so in this time I didn't use

1109
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,870
illusion I just changed the design

1110
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,610
completely instead of having gradiated

1111
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,520
borders we did this kind of a try effect

1112
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,650
I'm sure you've seen this where you you

1113
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,810
put two sort of similar colored borders

1114
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:52,150
and it creates like a bevel effect so

1115
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,650
now the nav looks entirely different to

1116
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:54,730
what it was designed us but it still

1117
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,080
looked good for the user won't miss that

1118
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,660
but it's the 80/20 rule we've got

1119
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,130
something similar we've got a divider in

1120
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,050
there but now it takes one border left

1121
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:04,060
and one border right property that's all

1122
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,220
it took to build that instead of pseudo

1123
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,530
elements and ten lines of prefixed CSS

1124
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:11,290
gradients so they're kind of moral is if

1125
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,790
something seems unreasonably difficult

1126
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:15,070
to build then don't build it if you look

1127
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,530
at something trivially sort of a quite

1128
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:20,140
quite a simple treatment and you think

1129
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,780
it feels a bit hacky then stop

1130
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,760
seek alternatives and rationalize and

1131
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,310
normalize and alter the designs don't

1132
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,990
write bad code just to keep the design

1133
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,120
team happy the code base is what you

1134
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,120
have to look after first and foremost if

1135
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,620
speak to the designers but don't just go

1136
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,410
and do it but rationalize and pare

1137
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,270
things back and really really change

1138
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:40,810
designs

1139
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:44,890
to sort of suit the code quality take

1140
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,810
the easy route I kind of I'm very

1141
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:48,160
unashamed with the fact that I'm a lazy

1142
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,650
developer and everyone should be there's

1143
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:52,450
no point causing yourself work showing

1144
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,850
off doing convoluted of the top things

1145
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,130
for the sake of you know like you know

1146
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:59,530
for keeping designers happy keep

1147
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:03,940
everything as simple as possible so yeah

1148
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,500
MDOT sky back on the last sort of

1149
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,330
examples I showed you this is the most

1150
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,370
brutal I've ever gone with sort of

1151
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,140
rationalizing designs are worked very

1152
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,940
closely with a designer at sky and it

1153
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,110
was fantastic it was surgically

1154
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,480
experienced for for the birth of us it's

1155
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,850
the most pared back design we have ever

1156
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:21,850
built it's the most brutal post about

1157
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:22,870
thing I've ever worked on

1158
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:25,060
it looks fantastic all the users love it

1159
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,370
we get lots of great feedback but the

1160
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,440
best feedback we get every single time

1161
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,170
is how fast this site is we've got a

1162
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,520
suite of performance engineers who work

1163
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,830
on the tech stack but I am the front-end

1164
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,510
performance guy and I get great pride

1165
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,800
out thinking that me and the designers

1166
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,660
have built a site where the users can't

1167
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,610
wait to tell us how fast it is we

1168
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,080
constantly get told that we are faster

1169
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,700
than all our competitors and it's all

1170
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,990
down to us of rationalizing and

1171
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,940
normalizing these designs just to keep

1172
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:52,450
code bases tiny really I'm gonna rush

1173
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,370
through this now then see if we don't

1174
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,020
deliver designs users don't interact

1175
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,120
with PSD interact with web sites so the

1176
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,060
curd quality should become our foremost

1177
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:04,570
concern make compromises for the sake of

1178
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:05,920
the build for it discuss things with

1179
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,020
your team and and really work on the

1180
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,060
best solution to deliver a product

1181
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,880
rather than a design and stick as many

1182
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,770
rules as you can and just be lazy and

1183
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:17,860
cheat and that's me with one minute left

1184
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,130
so thank you all for listening thank you

1185
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:31,089
very much

1186
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:39,800
you
