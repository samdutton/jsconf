1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,430

thank you so much in it great this is

2
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,450
like one of the best problems to have

3
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,680
our community is getting so big that

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,300
people are meeting each other for real

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,369
and like then recognizing who each other

6
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,470
are we actually have too much content

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,700
for 30 minutes so we're going to move

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,430
pretty fast the first thing I'd like to

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,650
talk about is there is a JavaScript

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,590
robotics book out now this is the amazon

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,750
page for it it's available in kindle two

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,200
and most of the authors are here raise

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,060
your hand if you reach a peer for make

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,320
JavaScript robotics yeah I think nine or

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,330
ten and authors are here I need just try

16
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,450
to move this up a little bit but yeah so

17
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,550
check it out it's on amazon and it's a

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,140
great book and if you have a paper copy

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,720
um most of us will find it i think if

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,220
you walk up and ask I mean none of us

21
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,910
are that mean we don't bite do we no no

22
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,360
so one or two people asked and it was

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,009
kind of weird it was like a weird moment

24
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:09,479
I never thought that anyone would ever

25
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,420
ask me for an autograph for a book that

26
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,070
was kind of cool yeah that was

27
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,900
definitely that was simply a culture

28
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,210
shock for me too so the first thing we

29
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,800
talk about is the stuff that happened

30
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,320
yesterday so one of the questions have

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,390
got a few times is I didn't sign up for

32
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,000
node BOTS but I want to build what was

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,040
at the node BOTS workshop so what do I

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,860
need the main thing you need is one of

35
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,800
these runt Rovers kits we use the PE at

36
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,680
the workshop yesterday it's less than

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,000
twenty dollars for the kit you do need

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,190
an Arduino Uno to go with that Rick

39
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,630
can't I'll a little more about that

40
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,510
while I show some photos of so um I'm

41
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,830
super stoked that you brought that up

42
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,260
because after robots con I published a

43
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:55,409
five four or five part blog post series

44
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,400
on Bo kuz a company blog that was how to

45
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,380
assemble the robot that you got at

46
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,100
robots cough so as it turns out i plan

47
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,409
on doing exactly the same follow-up for

48
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,500
this project in the coming couple of

49
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,080
weeks it'll be an article on boku that

50
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,739
is how to build the the peewee runt

51
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,620
rover that you may or may not have

52
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,950
acquired at jsmith warsaw somebody else

53
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,080
had and would like to build the same

54
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,740
thing yourself

55
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,500
of parts list of course instructions

56
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,850
videos pictures all the above it'll be

57
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,700
reviewed and revised thoroughly and look

58
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,020
forward to that yep so how also have

59
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,550
some really great photos of the node

60
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,530
boats event and while Sarah talks a

61
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,240
little about what happened there Rick if

62
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,490
you want to get set up with your your

63
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,110
setup awesome then all at Sarah taken

64
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,690
away and then we'll go to your demo yeah

65
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,910
yesterday we had the second annual node

66
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,030
boots event here at jay's comp it was

67
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,340
pretty awesome we had about 60 people I

68
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,390
think here building boats with us and I

69
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,070
think every team except for one and it

70
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,480
gained their boats in the water sailing

71
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,130
around at the end of the day and the one

72
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,430
was because they were trying to be very

73
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,580
ambitious and like hack digital cameras

74
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,060
to include them in the boat somehow or

75
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,280
disposable cameras or something it was

76
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,270
pretty cool but very ambitious uh and uh

77
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,590
yeah we actually saw a couple of new

78
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,200
designs come out of this year's i know'd

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,540
boats we had someone build a sailboat

80
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,060
which was really awesome that was like a

81
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,920
really cool design we haven't had sell

82
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,570
boats before we've had motor boats and

83
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,130
paddle boats but this was the first

84
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,290
sailboat and it worked which is cool so

85
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,150
I'll put the Ducks I heard there were

86
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,430
ducks oh yeah so at the end of the day

87
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,800
that's the best at the end of the day we

88
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,500
went down to the big hotel swimming pool

89
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,140
and we had a race across the pool with

90
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,030
boats or you know just boots what you

91
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,890
know going around in circles when the

92
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:03,480
Wi-Fi cut out and stuff like that um and

93
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,930
so to get around the Wi-Fi issues a

94
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,080
couple of Road attendees just hardwired

95
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,180
the motors directly to the battery so

96
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,280
they could go on and forwards and and

97
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,290
like didn't have much other control but

98
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,480
that was fine and while these boats were

99
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,670
zooming around the pool a duck came and

100
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,980
landed in the pool because it wanted to

101
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,850
win the best new book award obviously

102
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,950
and so the boat or the duck was was just

103
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,600
kind of swimming around checking things

104
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,520
out and then one of these out of control

105
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,380
node boats just like started going

106
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,840
straight at the duck just full speed

107
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,669
ahead and the dexter swimming out of the

108
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:39,420
way it was like no

109
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,890
this book is getting too close for

110
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,410
comfort and took off and flew away but

111
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,600
we also had some really dedicated

112
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,160
attendees this year we had one team

113
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,050
where they went to Walmart to get like

114
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,080
pool noodle noodles to use to like prop

115
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,210
their boat up better and they actually

116
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,900
like got uh yeah they got a Barbie doll

117
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,760
and shaved her head to turn her into

118
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,050
like the the girl from Mad Max yeah yeah

119
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,960
Louie was helping with that members I

120
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,700
was delivering coffee to the members and

121
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,620
carrying items around it was all them

122
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,150
okay it was pretty awesome coma doofen

123
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:24,270
furiosa at the same time arioso uoy all

124
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,860
that movie oh that movie I want to be

125
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,070
imperative figure so what I grow up oh

126
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,880
alright so Rick you have a demo for us

127
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,370
sort of for a before it before I talk

128
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,610
about this I want to mention that Sarah

129
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,880
is actually the author of a chapter in

130
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,450
the JavaScript robotics book and her

131
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,690
chapter is about building a node boat so

132
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,240
if you want to build a node boat you

133
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,660
purchased the book and get instructions

134
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,550
directly from the experts so that's

135
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:02,160
pretty exciting also second thing a lot

136
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,500
of times a robotics research uses

137
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,140
animals in the wild as models obviously

138
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,130
for new types of robot designs and it

139
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,170
just occurred to me that if we strapped

140
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,230
a node boat to a node copter you would

141
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:23,670
have a duck bot that might have to be a

142
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:27,510
workshop next year duck quacks oh no no

143
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:32,910
ducks no no doc bot a team building a

144
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,530
boat where the way it was constructed

145
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,180
when it got to the side of the pool we

146
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,180
climb out of the pool Oh amphibious node

147
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,970
boats oh how did it do that like these

148
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,340
folks with paddles on the ends and so

149
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,690
the spokes would end up doubling as

150
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:49,580
wheels one thing oh my gosh amazing okay

151
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,660
we can do it out on that for like the

152
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,360
next 30 minutes

153
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,360
yep so this I don't know if I'll hold it

154
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,320
up so this is a thank you Francis that

155
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,730
I've been working on this for a few

156
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,390
months now and it was inspired by a blog

157
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,320
post that I saw by dr. esther kim she

158
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,170
had done a little demo where she was

159
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,660
doing video streaming from an Intel

160
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,870
Edison I was like that is so cool I want

161
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,140
to try that so I decided to do that

162
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,580
might notice you might actually

163
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,010
recognize the chassis this is like the

164
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,560
older sibling of the Pee Wee it's called

165
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,230
the Scout I believe these chassis czar

166
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,240
awesome it's like snapped together it

167
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,880
was so easy to build and drill holes

168
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,380
into to customize there's actually a

169
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,410
bunch of them up there yep it is wait

170
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,570
which one are we yeah oh no I'm sorry I

171
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,690
lied it's the whipper snapper yeah why

172
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,150
per se this is whippersnapper I get

173
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,720
scout from anyway so what makes this fun

174
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,970
and interesting and special to me is

175
00:07:53,970 --> 00:08:00,300
that I can stream 128k 30 frames per

176
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,200
second over sockets to a browser and get

177
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:10,410
full like real-time video stream and to

178
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,500
a browser with a set of controls

179
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,570
actually a video that I took with my

180
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,690
phone at my computer of me driving this

181
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:23,790
thing around from my couch on the floor

182
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,410
of my apartment and crashing into my

183
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,630
french bulldog who seemed to not care at

184
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,110
all and of course this is running

185
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,290
entirely independently on the Intel

186
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,360
Edison board so the javascript is

187
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,780
running a node on the board so you just

188
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,599
plug it in and wait for it to boot up

189
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,820
and there it is it's a robot being

190
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,670
programmed by JavaScript running a node

191
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,310
that can also stream amazing video

192
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,010
beautifully over web / sockets to a

193
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,250
browser and it allows for this control

194
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,930
interface that's just buttons in a

195
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,660
browser that allow me to you know click

196
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,100
buttons like it's like a you know

197
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,450
command center control

198
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,580
ol center or whatever in my browser and

199
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,360
drive it around completely remotely and

200
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,990
it's a lot of fun oh did I mention also

201
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,320
that it's completely like standalone

202
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,510
like how incredible is that so this has

203
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,490
been like a passion project of mine for

204
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,700
past couple of months right now I'm

205
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,590
struggling a little bit with supplying

206
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,880
the right amount of power just to the

207
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,260
board everything else has the right

208
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,540
amount of power but the board i'm having

209
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,820
problems getting it right once i sort

210
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,580
that out i will be really excited and of

211
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,010
course publish some kind of article on

212
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,350
the boku blog about how to build it

213
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,650
yourself and i guess i'm looking forward

214
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,510
to when that day happens it might be a

215
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,120
couple maybe a couple months on from now

216
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,030
but but yeah it's what's super cool

217
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,640
about it to me is that it is all

218
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,880
JavaScript running on this board so it's

219
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,250
it's embedded JavaScript on an embedded

220
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,350
device so i have a bad joke for you tell

221
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,210
me about Reggie say this bot does

222
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,500
reconnaissance here's not uh I mean I'm

223
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,080
gonna thwart your joke yeah guess what

224
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,690
this robot is called what recon ball so

225
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,490
it's really funny that recon bought was

226
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,860
holding your recon vine yeah absolutely

227
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,870
so I I named it after Francis yeah very

228
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,770
significant a really funny when Francis

229
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,450
picked it up because it's Marie con

230
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,160
bought holding the Recon but the other

231
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,240
thing is for those of you who've never

232
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,400
adult with an Intel Edison what it is

233
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,220
it's a stamp-sized computer it's got

234
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,500
just hubli bluetooth all he built into

235
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,120
it or is it just know it's Wi-Fi it's

236
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,230
got Wi-Fi but let's undo it and it's

237
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,670
stamp-sized and it's got several

238
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,670
different shields that you can put it on

239
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,960
sparkfun has some shields that are

240
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,700
actually really tiny and so you can

241
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,320
build what looks like a smart watch out

242
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,420
of an Intel Edison and an OLED and we

243
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,310
actually oh we do have a heart care oh

244
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:59,490
yeah there you go so his the Edison is

245
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,410
on a larger shield you could also get

246
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,750
shields like this that are and this is a

247
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,160
full computer right there pretty great

248
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,690
yes because it runs linux how much do

249
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:16,140
they run okay modulo sorry he didn't

250
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,180
make module itself is 50 bucks and then

251
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,100
the shields are anywhere from like 22 42

252
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,600
what you get like the old LED ones like

253
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,310
about 40 because it got a little wet on

254
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,470
it I asked it seems like maybe there

255
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,110
should be a cheaper single chip computer

256
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,480
that is a fantastic Segway indoor first

257
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,019
hey isn't that cool segment so our first

258
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:36,870
hey isn't that cool segment is a I

259
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,040
actually found out about this when I

260
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,230
asked Twitter hey what should we talk

261
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,790
about it no BOTS live this is called The

262
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,569
Onion Omega it is a nine dollar computer

263
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:48,839
yeah yeah what exactly um it's got Wi-Fi

264
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,149
it's Wi-Fi enabled you can install note

265
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:53,579
on it it's it's not available yet they

266
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,410
are currently still making it they have

267
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,149
docs much that remind me a lot of like

268
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,220
this marks the spark I Oh she'll do have

269
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,470
an Arduino shield doc so if you want to

270
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,329
use our do we know shields with it but

271
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:05,220
yeah it's apparently nine dollars for

272
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,380
this little Omega onion and it's got

273
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,980
Wi-Fi built-in and it's amazing how the

274
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,050
price points are dropping on these Wi-Fi

275
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,480
enabled microcontrollers they're also

276
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,690
happy to run JavaScript this is amazing

277
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,509
we have one more demo well one more demo

278
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:23,160
and then a small talk so we've got a

279
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,350
video demo from Donovan of what is yes

280
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,569
this is donovan and you didn't explain

281
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:32,009
the demo because it's seriously one of

282
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:34,380
the coolest things i've i've ever seen

283
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,560
so about a year ago maybe it's been less

284
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,139
we added an animation library to Johnny

285
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:43,079
Five which allows you to instead of just

286
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,480
saying servo dot to to send a server to

287
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,579
a particular position you can script a

288
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:50,310
servo over time think it's a lot like

289
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:54,180
animating something in flash so you're

290
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,130
able to set a servo to go to a certain

291
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,800
position at a certain point in time and

292
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,079
you can set up as many cue points as you

293
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,209
want and we support easing and different

294
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:04,589
kinds of functions so that gives us the

295
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:07,529
ability to do pretty complex scripted

296
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:10,050
movements with the robot that's how this

297
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,490
hexapoda it's not what you're saying

298
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,709
here actually that's how the text apod

299
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,110
walks is with these scripted movements

300
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,000
using the animation class but it's also

301
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,600
possible to override the the rendering

302
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,519
method that we use in in the animation

303
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,990
class when you override the rendering

304
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,850
method on a servo and we can apply a

305
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,620
rendering method to an array of servos

306
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,279
Johnny Five has a servos class and you

307
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,699
can override the rendering math

308
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:36,939
and pass it through an inverse

309
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:38,739
kinematics solver that's what we're

310
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:41,230
seeing here it's responding in real time

311
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,779
to my movements my hand movements over

312
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:46,059
elite motion controller and it's solving

313
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,549
the angles for each of the legs in real

314
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:50,980
time and rendering that leg to the to

315
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,179
the proper position so that everything

316
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:54,609
stays in the right place you know

317
00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:55,629
everything's in contact with the ground

318
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:58,899
and that's going to be an add-on module

319
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:01,359
for Johnny 5 called Tharp and it should

320
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:03,429
be out hopefully in a week or so so what

321
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:04,899
we're looking at here is that you

322
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:07,209
controlling the hexapod with your hands

323
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:09,009
that is me controlling the hexapod with

324
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:10,329
my hand with a leap motion controller

325
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:13,149
yes so funny story I remember when you

326
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:14,529
first sent me this video I was at home

327
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:17,049
and I was watching that and my sister

328
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:19,209
was behind me and she immediately asked

329
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:22,029
me that's CGI right she she oh she

330
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,609
seriously thought that someone had CGI'd

331
00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:26,049
your hexapod in there because she's like

332
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:27,399
wait he's controlling it with his hand

333
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,220
I'm so scared right now and I said why

334
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,290
and she goes I could just imagine my new

335
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,910
robot overlord like with a guy just

336
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,649
standing on a balcony doing this and

337
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:39,100
robots to start attacking like one thing

338
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,660
I've learned is that we don't really

339
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,489
have much to fear because they fall down

340
00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:49,480
and break a lot that's comforting did

341
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,649
you tell us a bit about inverse

342
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:52,329
kinematics and like what that does for

343
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:56,289
you so I'm totally unqualified to talk

344
00:14:56,289 --> 00:14:59,319
about this but here goes kinematics is

345
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:01,829
the you know the art I guess of finding

346
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:04,209
the position of an end of the in

347
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:05,529
defector being the part of the robot

348
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,269
that interacts with the real world in my

349
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:09,369
case it's it's the feet of the robot a

350
00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:11,079
lot of robots it's the hand the serial

351
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:13,749
manipulator kind of thing but it's the

352
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:15,970
the art of finding where forward

353
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,799
kinematics is the art of finding where

354
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:20,319
that in defector is in space given the

355
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,389
length of all your joints and the angle

356
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:25,389
I'm sorry the length of all your limbs

357
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:26,949
and then the angles of each of the

358
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:29,379
joints inverse kinematics is doing that

359
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:31,569
in Reverse you're giving a point in 3d

360
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:33,669
space and an origin point and you're

361
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:35,470
solving all the angles and links that

362
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,269
you need in order to get your foot where

363
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,410
it needs to be or you're into vector

364
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,980
where it needs to be

365
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,750
something to add is that for every joint

366
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:48,490
you add to the chain the calculation

367
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,640
becomes exponentially more complicated

368
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,100
so you can imagine a hexapod with 18

369
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,430
servos on board how so that's through

370
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,220
wait how many prim like I'm brain dead

371
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,399
right now three per leg yeah so that's

372
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:06,670
not trivial and as a reminder that's

373
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,880
JavaScript from the top down it's

374
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,540
totally JavaScript totally Johnny 5 but

375
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,100
actually will have to solve three servos

376
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,350
we like to solve one leg at a time but

377
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:22,450
still it made my head hurt yeah but now

378
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,070
everybody can do that well you know it

379
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,720
takes a lot less math because of the

380
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,550
animation library and this is also a

381
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,589
good segue into Johnny 5 has a new

382
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:33,250
website at Johnny vaio it is no longer

383
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,560
just a wiki page we have nice styling

384
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,930
this was developed at beaucoup not not

385
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,370
that the wiki page wasn't awesome this

386
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,459
is just awesome Merc so you can now look

387
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,980
at the API documentation the other thing

388
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,020
that I worked on yesterday is if you

389
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,760
used at the dash documentation

390
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,709
application the one that downloads all

391
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,240
the doctors for you and shows have been

392
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,940
offered i launched yesterday a doc set

393
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,980
for Johnny Five that is now in beta and

394
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,510
so soon i'm going to actually get back

395
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,610
tributed in the dash so that then no

396
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,230
more switching between browsers to like

397
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,000
write your court oh don't applaud me

398
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,100
applaud Donovan like that was that demo

399
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,030
is amazing um well so that is so our

400
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:16,110
next really cool topic yes sure uh just

401
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,220
real quick note about the website all

402
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,640
the content on the web site comes from

403
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,620
the Johnny Five the existing Johnny Five

404
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,140
wiki and the existing Johnny Five repos

405
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,290
example programs so if you edit the wiki

406
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,010
and like updated and improve it somehow

407
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,110
or whatever the next time i deploy the

408
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,150
site your changes just automatically are

409
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,309
included with that you guys open source

410
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,650
for the win right so if you also want to

411
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,679
write like new examples for for anything

412
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:46,450
you're like oh this is some cool use

413
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,550
case that I came up with you can

414
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,200
contribute that and it will be

415
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,690
automatically included in the website on

416
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,650
the next deployment

417
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,910
so your work for all to see and share

418
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,160
which is like my favorite part about the

419
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,620
website so sorry you can move on now and

420
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,810
if you're new to electronics this is one

421
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,430
of the things I'm super proud of with

422
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,050
Johnny photos documentation there are

423
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,820
Fritzing diagrams for just about every

424
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,010
example in every API page so if you've

425
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,200
never done electronics before and you

426
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,610
need to know how to wire something or

427
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,050
you're afraid you'll you know you don't

428
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,720
know how Johnny Five docks are very very

429
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,760
good about having Fritzing diagram for

430
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,860
just about every example we write so

431
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,080
that you can replicate our projects

432
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,600
fairly easily so our next really cool

433
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,810
topic / product is Bluetooth le is

434
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,240
getting really easy to get a hold of and

435
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,880
it's get we have a node module that

436
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,520
makes Bluetooth le a lot easier to use

437
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,040
is called noble the maintainer is

438
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,810
actually at the conference I don't know

439
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,360
if he's here at the taping but Sandeep

440
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,540
is here at the conference and yeah it's

441
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,940
really easy to use Bluetooth le and with

442
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,490
with node now and one of the really cool

443
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,920
products is a light blue beam which is

444
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,920
pretty cool $30 little it's tiny it's

445
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,150
it's a about actually about that big and

446
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,890
so it's got bluetooth LE on it's got its

447
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,200
own battery which is pretty neat and it

448
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,230
wirelessly synced and you can use node

449
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,600
with it via Louie you actually wrote the

450
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,370
Bluetooth the Johnny Five plug-in right

451
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,800
there's a bean dash I Oh Johnny Five

452
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,470
plugin so yeah if you put a specific

453
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,990
fremada sketch on the beam and connect

454
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,170
to it with will have your bean io

455
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,450
instance connect to that bean you're

456
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,490
doing Johnny Five on all the gpio is on

457
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,840
it and then the other way you can run

458
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,120
node is it does a sport no dread out of

459
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,440
the box which is a it's more of a

460
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,630
point-and-click programming language

461
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,980
that will allow you to do stuff with it

462
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,750
in the cloud so if you're dealing with

463
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,490
kids or people who are new to coding in

464
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,930
general no bread is also a really good

465
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,150
way to use that with it and Bluetooth

466
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,370
modules that we can attach make we mean

467
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,900
we can have more wireless Johnny Five

468
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,520
bots because you can do a serial port

469
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,020
over Bluetooth just like you do with

470
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,700
your USB cable and so if you have a

471
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,140
bluetooth module working either on your

472
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,750
arduino or with a microcontroller you

473
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:06,730
can have wireless no bots because and

474
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:11,160
yes so node blue and octo blue these

475
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,590
flow designers they actually reach down

476
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,190
into a way of some sort or no dread

477
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,310
itself and they can talk to to bluetooth

478
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:24,570
sideways across in the local area an

479
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,340
interesting thing also about this

480
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,650
awesomeness being all JavaScript that

481
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,440
that Rick wrote here with Johnny Five is

482
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,070
that we are able to do things like have

483
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:37,710
bean dash I Oh Johnny Five running on

484
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,170
say a tablet or a mobile phone because

485
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,570
we could just shim may be using Cordova

486
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,380
the same noble libraries and then you

487
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,600
can make a phone UI using Johnny Five

488
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,340
code talking to a light blue clean

489
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,870
connecting to GP I was controlling

490
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,510
something like this and it's all just

491
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,790
one set of JavaScript code from the

492
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,670
Johnny Five API standpoint we've been

493
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,290
really quiet so far so who likes

494
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,000
javascript in here audience that has

495
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,540
been super quiet like it all right there

496
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,790
we go there we go it's been really quiet

497
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,490
in here today um so I just have a

498
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,480
question though so can I do this today

499
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,150
you can do this today so there is it's

500
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,680
actually uh it was one of the things

501
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,300
that octuple would put together they

502
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,880
commissioned me to write a shim for

503
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,420
Cordova to do a to do a noble a noble

504
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,480
shim for Cordova right so you you can I

505
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,370
actually have an example on the ice dev

506
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,130
blog of how to do that so you can use a

507
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,860
beam from yeah from an Android and iOS

508
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,510
device whatever so that's a cool segue

509
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,410
we were talk about stuff we could you

510
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,630
today I want to use a node bot in my

511
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,240
browser can I do that say that funny you

512
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,770
ask yeah you can't so there's actually a

513
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,170
few projects going on so in the

514
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,570
education space you know Chromebooks are

515
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:58,110
you know 150 bucks really cheap tablets

516
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,340
you know are getting really cheap so

517
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,080
we'd like to do all this stuff because

518
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,000
it's written in javascript in in

519
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,310
browsers because you might not have the

520
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,380
ability to easily install node on one of

521
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,490
these things that's really just running

522
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,550
a browser so Pavel over there David

523
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,530
everybody involved with the Robotnik

524
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,600
application really cool this is browser

525
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,850
base it is blockley so using blocks to

526
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,760
create johnny five objects and run those

527
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,770
really awesome check that out on

528
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:31,080
Robotnik I believe it's on Pablo's repo

529
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,740
on github also so what I said was doing

530
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,660
we're taking approach of having Johnny

531
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:40,880
Five code specifically and we've got a

532
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,950
an IDE called chrome bots we haven't we

533
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,900
had an early version we demoed at robots

534
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,429
comp it was it was really just a proof

535
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:49,530
of concept Blaine over there has been

536
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,600
putting a ton of work into this and it's

537
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,940
actually becoming a good IDE now in a

538
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,880
browser for Johnny Five or for robotics

539
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,950
in general but with file management and

540
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,140
and everything and so keep an eye on

541
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,090
that because it's it's going to be

542
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,799
really good no so we're getting to the

543
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,080
point now where someone could pick up an

544
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,659
Arduino or a board and not even after

545
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,340
install node they could just open Chrome

546
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,860
your Firefox or a browser right some

547
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,179
JavaScript and controller robot

548
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:16,860
absolutely you're getting and which

549
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,970
really close you don't even need the

550
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,650
Arduino IDE or command line or do we

551
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,539
know anything because of work at Jacob

552
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,309
Rosenthal may or may not be in here um

553
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:27,299
that's done so that it actually will

554
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,909
write be from autosketch so yeah grab

555
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,830
Arduino plug it in and go I'll be great

556
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,299
for the Johnny Five website that way

557
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:34,530
like you wouldn't use Johnny Five with

558
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,520
node you wouldn't have to install the

559
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,020
Arduino IDE we can just put a button on

560
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,780
the website absolutely oh I see a pull

561
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:44,429
request got work to do I just want to

562
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:47,039
say about Robotnik last year at node

563
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,990
BOTS day which is july 25th this year so

564
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,090
right last year at node BOTS day my son

565
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,370
used Robotnik to build a pablo BOTS and

566
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,280
get it running all by himself he's just

567
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,710
he was 9 years old at the time no

568
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,120
scratch pretty well and the whole

569
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,130
interface is very much like scratch so

570
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,169
if you have kids it's a great tool so

571
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:06,090
that segues into our last two topics we

572
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,409
only have a couple of a couple minutes

573
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:10,919
left one is node BOTS day coming up in

574
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:12,510
July 25th so it was kind of a cool segue

575
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,840
um who here has been to a node BOTS day

576
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,020
before in their City or anywhere ok cool

577
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,480
this year I want all those hands to go

578
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,820
up node BOTS day is an amazing event its

579
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,370
worldwide so basically check your home

580
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,990
city if there's not an event run one

581
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,240
it's way easier than you think um so

582
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,010
well actually I got someone to do all

583
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:32,429
the work

584
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,840
for me in Austin so maybe I shouldn't

585
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,419
say that but it's so worth it um so

586
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:38,460
anyway uh you should definitely

587
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,830
participate in nodebots day

588
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,789
international event really great way

589
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:44,009
even if you just to barely started doing

590
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:46,919
no bots or are brand new to it a great

591
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,119
way to go sir I think most of us have

592
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,179
run a node wats the event at this table

593
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:55,440
most yeah yukino did it one and yes yeah

594
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,759
so the last topic i have is node bots

595
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:02,369
live the podcast so this has been cool

596
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:04,769
like doing it every six months on video

597
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,330
chris williams has been super great

598
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,009
about letting us use track be to record

599
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:10,049
a podcast which seemed really weird but

600
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:13,019
it worked out i actually want to take

601
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:15,480
this to a monthly podcast so i am

602
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,330
starting a patreon to get funding

603
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,070
because i do not have any podcast

604
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,139
equipment i do not have any editing

605
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:23,879
experience and so i'm going to try to

606
00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:26,549
like get this going for y'all so check

607
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:27,779
the note box live twitter if you're

608
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:29,879
interested in helping out there will be

609
00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:33,360
a patreon up soon and we have a couple

610
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,039
more oh yeah we have like two or three

611
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,909
more minutes so what out one more really

612
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:42,330
cool product that is coming out the

613
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,330
Esper e no pico is pretty cool if you

614
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,309
haven't seen it yet so if you never the

615
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:48,720
S Perino that's actually what's powering

616
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,970
this it's a controller that it doesn't

617
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,409
run note it runs like a modified version

618
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:55,409
of java script but it's very simply

619
00:25:55,409 --> 00:25:57,240
writing it you don't really notice so

620
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,470
much of a difference from javascript and

621
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,019
he just released a new version that is

622
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:03,960
8080 bitty my tabs are tiny so i'm

623
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,309
having trouble playing there we go this

624
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:07,169
is about like like three quarters of

625
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:08,879
this long at about half an inch wide and

626
00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:11,399
it fits in a USB socket and very

627
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:14,100
interesting project so any other cool

628
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,539
stuff that you all have thought of

629
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:19,379
before we run well i just want to give a

630
00:26:19,379 --> 00:26:21,480
shout out to this team of developers a

631
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,460
year ago I was sitting in the audience

632
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,409
thinking I would like to contribute the

633
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:27,269
open source and I was nervous and scared

634
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:28,769
about doing it and I got involved with

635
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:29,850
Johnny Five and they have been

636
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,070
incredibly supportive and I have learned

637
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,200
so much so much more than I ever would

638
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,179
have just doing my work every day it's

639
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,740
maybe better at work it's maybe better a

640
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,899
better developer so thank you guys all

641
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:42,780
the field

642
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:47,200
I I'd like to add it Donovan is also

643
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,990
like my right-hand man now on the Johnny

644
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:53,350
Five project like code wise like I go to

645
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,090
him for advice about every single thing

646
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,830
like every major decision we have to

647
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:00,280
make I seek his advice and also David

648
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,780
Reza gay who is in the crowd as well

649
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:05,650
these two have become sort of like my I

650
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,990
don't know what you call it like I can't

651
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,520
run the project without them so it's

652
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,920
become less of an eye and definitely

653
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,260
much more of a wii and it continues to

654
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,920
become a bigger we which is exciting

655
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,930
over 75 raise your hand if you're a

656
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,460

left if you get a little music like any

661
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:37,170
music is fine because we have to dance

00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:55,310
it's a duration

663
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,820
