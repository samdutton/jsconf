00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879

hi my name is Burke and I love user

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:03,750
interface

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,490
I've always loved user interface I

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,639
remember staring at the glory that was

5
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:10,650
compact tab works while I played this

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,690
game called the incredible machine and

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,059
listen to the Tears for Fears greatest

8
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,580
hits album now don't judge me I was

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,500
listening to mad world way before that

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,930
Donnie Darko in that creepy rabbit movie

11
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,580
that's an old and obscure reference you

12
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,680
may not get that that's okay what I'm

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,539
trying to say is it's not you it's me

14
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,640
that's Costanza would say that's another

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,140
old and obscure reference you know what

16
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,989
forget all that let's move on I got my

17
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:35,700
first computer when I was in the

18
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,350
military actually I was in boot camp and

19
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,879
they pay you in boot camp but you can't

20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,680
spend the money you know because you're

21
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,050
doing push-ups and stuff and so after I

22
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,730
got out of boot camp my dad encouraged

23
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,079
me to buy a computer so I got my first

24
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,520
computer oh you can see this ledger here

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,760
which was a compact HP Pavilion it

26
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,010
looked just like this and it came with

27
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,890
Windows 98 all my sounds aren't working

28
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,430
yeah there we go

29
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,039
and I loved Windows 98 I spent so much

30
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,379
time just changing the themes the

31
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,119
different themes looking at the icons

32
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,100
and the text I mean each theme was

33
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,659
better than the previous theme it was

34
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,540
incredible it was so good and if only I

35
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,700
had known then if only I had known what

36
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,610
was coming if only I had known about

37
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:22,920
Windows XP okay this was do you believe

38
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,119
in love at first sight does love at

39
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,729
first sight exist no of course it does

40
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:28,320
it no be ridiculous love is a very

41
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,060
complex human emotion but let me tell

42
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,030
you what does exist infatuation and I

43
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,400
was infatuated with Windows XP I mean

44
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,740
the curves on the Start menu the blues

45
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,960
and the greens the way the windows are

46
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,530
layered in space it was beautiful I know

47
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,299
it's weird but I wasn't that socially

48
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:46,740
popular so I had a lot of time to sit

49
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,149
around and do weird things like stare at

50
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,009
an operating system and then this

51
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,930
spawned a big hacker community and a lot

52
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,750
of tools to ask in Windows XP and when

53
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,979
you can do that obviously you want to

54
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,689
make it look like OS 10 that's the first

55
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,759
thing you do so this one goes out to

56
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,500
startup now as much as I love UI I'm not

57
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,240
a designer as much as I want to be a

58
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,039
designer I am NOT a designer he's a

59
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,959
designer I'm not a designer now what I

60
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,209
can do is assemble building blocks so if

61
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,410
you give me

62
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,450
lighters and dropdowns and modal windows

63
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,520
then I can build you UI and I used to

64
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,050
work for this company called kendo UI

65
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,510
and so I've been fortunate to be a part

66
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,060
of some great UI products but you

67
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,590
wouldn't hire me to build a website for

68
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,400
you ok

69
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,650
unless you were my mom otherwise you're

70
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,000
not gonna hire me to do that that would

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,390
be subpar results and so what I've

72
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,400
realized through all of my time working

73
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,800
with UI is that really the best user

74
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,130
experience is is no UI at all so let me

75
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,870
talk about that for a second UI is kind

76
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,120
of a middleman it's a conversation it's

77
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,640
pre-canned and it's it has boundaries

78
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,370
right so we try to code for the simplest

79
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,350
possible scenario to get a user through

80
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,170
the process or all the processes in the

81
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,290
world right and this is so this we could

82
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,210
improve upon this UX probably a little

83
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,860
bit now there's been some great feats of

84
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,750
UX genius I'm still a fan of

85
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,850
skeuomorphic design if a baby can pick

86
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,500
up and use an iPad without any training

87
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,350
you know that's kind of an amazing thing

88
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,300
now that said the reason why we have UI

89
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,830
in these wonderful buttons and sliders

90
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,140
is because historically we haven't been

91
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,320
able to talk to computers until now

92
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,880
natural language processing is the field

93
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,950
of computing that deals with not just

94
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,959
speech recognition but extracting a

95
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,230
user's intent from what they just said

96
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,250
you may be familiar with this in a

97
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,900
couple different forms we have Alexa

98
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,230
Cortana Siri and Google home or ok

99
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,150
Google or Google assistant or whatever

100
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,030
the heck you call that thing a lot of

101
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,050
people have these I'm gonna give you

102
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,030
three examples of how I think no UI is

103
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,350
better than a UI

104
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,720
the first one is creating reminders so I

105
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,300
can say hey Siri remind me to email my

106
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,190
mom and that experience is way better

107
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,989
than going in to the reminders app and

108
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:56,820
doing this no matter how beautiful the

109
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,920
reminders app is it will never be as

110
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,709
easy as me just saying do it another one

111
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,840
is home automation here's an example of

112
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,510
me turning lights on and off with an

113
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,010
well actually here's the app that you do

114
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,750
it with so here's me turning lights on

115
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,400
and off with the app very nice and now

116
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:23,480
here's me doing it

117
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,409
Alexa turn off the lights in the master

118
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:33,279
bedroom now watch this okay Alexa can

119
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,520
you turn on the bedroom turn on the

120
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,620
master bedroom lights and that is

121
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,060
natural language processing right I

122
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,919
completely botched that command seven

123
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:46,300
different ways and it still was able to

124
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,860
pick it up and do it you know what's

125
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,210
even better is if you have a nest

126
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,039
thermostat you can lay in bed and

127
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:54,069
control the temperature with your voice

128
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:55,960
and now that I've said that sounds

129
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,550
really pathetic you know what never mind

130
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,219
I don't ever do that the last example

131
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:01,750
I'd like to give you as a service called

132
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,840
digit digit is a remarkable little

133
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,210
service that saves for you using machine

134
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,590
learning based on your spending patterns

135
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,659
and it will give you savings updates I

136
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:12,250
blurred this out so you don't get too

137
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,979
depressed by my low balance and the

138
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:17,020
whole interface is conversational so it

139
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,360
has an app now but before all you did

140
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,669
was chat with it to save to withdraw and

141
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:23,830
it was pretty resilient at understanding

142
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,939
my commands I didn't have to know what

143
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:27,879
to say I just said it and I thought that

144
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,199
that was quite remarkable so the

145
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,159
question now is is UI as we know it dead

146
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:37,629
the answer is no no absolutely not there

147
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,520
are accessibility concerns you wouldn't

148
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,770
want to activate take photos with your

149
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,909
voice you wouldn't want to scroll

150
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,229
through pictures with your voice right

151
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:45,879
like scroll up scroll down scroll that

152
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,399
that's not a good user experience but it

153
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,800
does give us a chance to rethink some of

154
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,629
the ways that we build UI is that maybe

155
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:54,639
we don't need to build a UI and instead

156
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,469
what we need to build is something

157
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:58,060
that's more conversational in nature

158
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,430
that uses natural language processing

159
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,719
because that's now available to all of

160
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:04,419
us and if I'm gonna end a little bit

161
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:05,289
early ooh

162
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:07,240
several seconds early you can check out

163
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,729
the Luas project here this is a

164
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:11,319
completely free tool it's a visual

165
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,669
interface you can build and then as long

166
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:14,830
as you know how to make an AJAX call you

167
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,960
can add natural language processing to

168
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,659
your applications and or build a bot or

169
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:23,729
a conversational UI thank you so much
