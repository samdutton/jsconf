00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,269
COBOL and now in JavaScript my talk was

5
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:34,250

8
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,350
sang algorithms and perspective about

9
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,159
javascript on artificial intelligence

10
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,129
artificial intelligence is a broad term

11
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:57,860
is bad I present some demos using

12
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,000
genetic algorithms neural networks an

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,549
evolutionary problems in JavaScript for

14
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:08,990
browser and fro for nausea yes why

15
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,430
javascript an artificial intelligence

16

17
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,439

22
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:33,770
frame language we need more expert

23
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,140
systems for example for home automation

24
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,909
are reacting to sensors that is I think

25
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,450
