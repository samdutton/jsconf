11
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,420
my favorite part of CSS comp is always

12
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,700
the meeting new people and hearing the

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,460
conversation it gives developers and

14
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,840
engineers and designers a chance to

15
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,120
connect with each other in a way that

16
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,380
they don't get to in their normal

17
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,020
day-to-day work inspire each other and

18
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,390
talk about the work that they do with

19
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,550
people outside of their own companies or

20
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,870
organizations and so it can open

21
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,270
developers minds to context and

22
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,280
situations that they don't encounter in

23
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,260
their daily work I think community

24
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,000
events are really important because I

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,800
came from a really small town in the

26
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,470
southeastern United States and I didn't

27
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,060
really find a sense of belonging there

28
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,040
and it just it blows my mind that I came

29
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,990
to Berlin and found this amazing

30
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,940
community so far away it's nice to be in

31
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,200
a place where everyone can come together

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,240
and celebrate CSS and all its quirks

33
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,150
together see what's coming up and see

34
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,890
what we can do to make it even better

35
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,920
for everyone in 2015 I was one of the

36
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,960
scholarship holder I had a lot of

37
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,600
opportunities to be a speaker and also

38
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,690
landed up in a job in Berlin this

39
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,780
scholarship is a is a great means to

40
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,530
help diverse candidates explore

41
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,040
opportunities new opportunities

45
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,220
this has confessed run by a volunteer

46
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,650
team the curation like all the little

47
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,480
details that we see here the design is

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,849
all done by volunteers that have known

49
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:33,989
each other for years

50
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:36,269
and all of us still remember the very

51
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:38,280
first year where we just all had this

52
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,620
desire to set up an event to talk about

53
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,750
CSS because there was no place for it

54
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:57,329
before my talk was about how we can

55
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:00,450
build safe teams and a better culture

56
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,489
and environment East Asian photography

57
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:04,440
and how it can inspire more than web

58
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,870
layouts building a dev tools extensions

59
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,359
API that people could use to create

60
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:11,849
their own tools for web designers on top

61
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:13,620
of dev tools I thought was about Design

62
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,639
Systems as facilitators and applying

63
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,109
facilitation lens to products that we

64
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:21,030
use I would say my talk was about

65
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,109
empathy and the fact that you really

66
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:27,419
need multiple layers when you're talking

67
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:29,590
about empathy
