1
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:46,240
>> Hello, everyone. My name is Michael. I'm
a 13-year-old boy and I enjoy all things Pokémon,

2
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,550
Lego, Star Wars, and now play video games
and VR all day if you'll let me!

3
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:57,810
>> My name's Jason, his dad, CEO of a company
called Codeup in the States, and we teach

4
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:08,240
adults how to code. I know a little bit about
Pokémon, and video games are all right. Before

5
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,229
teaching kids to code and giving you tools
to go back home? And teach kids to code. , let's

6
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:19,520
talk about why teach kids to code? I think
most people in the audience have some opinions

7
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,039
about that, but I wanted to find out from
a kid. Michael, why do you think kids should

8
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:27,399
code?
>> Kids need a better understanding of technology.

9
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:37,229
Most kids think technology is Google, YouTube,
and Fornite. There's a not close to the possibilities.

10
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:43,390
Coding makes you creative and makes you want
to do amazing stuff, integrate and teach children

11
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:49,170
logic, like if something happens, do something
else. You also learn how things work. You

12
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,149
can learn how to send an mail, or learn how
a computer works. It's cool to build Lego

13
00:01:55,149 --> 00:02:04,600
and play games. It's cool and awesome to programme
things. It's also really fun. I do on a daily

14
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,819
basis.
>> Awesome. So before we get into the right

15
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:11,510
way to teach kids how to code, we figured
we would go over a few of the things we think

16
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,260
are the wrong way to do it, and last summer,
Michael was super excited to go to a camp

17
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,430
where they were going to teach Minecraft mods
learning Java and we learned a few things

18
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,310
that are the things to avoid when trying to
teach a code.

19
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,990
>> First thing to start with is a hard language,
Java or C. During that camp, I used Java,

20
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:40,170
and it was not fun. I don't know how it works
to date. All I know is like C - I don't know.

21
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:52,710
Make them learn to type. I still use my four
fingers, and using complicated tools like

22
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:57,330
Eclipse. I have no idea how to go back to
my previous projects. I have no idea how that

23
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,020
even works. Vocabulary, like conkat ...
>> Concatenation?

24
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:09,620
>> I don't even know what that means. And
they need you to learn maths first - a terrible

25
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:15,090
way to start.
>> If you want to teach a kid a musical instrument,

26
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,620
you would probably teach him a strong before
you made them learn music theory or read music.

27
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,480
I found as parent once Michael was out creating
video games, all of the things in the slide

28
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,880
he became more interested in. If this is where
we start, then it's really heart to get them

29
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,670
excited about writing code. That being side,
we want to know what kids want to do?

30
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,100
>> This picture definitely shows what I want
to do all day, every day.

31
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,000
>> All day long if I let him. Michael, what
do you think the kids want to do when they

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,961
are learning to codes?
>> They want to see results. They don't want

33
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:54,240
to wait ten seconds -
>> You're telling me kids aren't patient?

34
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,770
>> I've been waiting for you to say that.
And they like to create things that are fun,

35
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:06,840
like game or Lego. They like to create things
that they are interested in. And sharing that

36
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,450
creation, again back to logo, they love to
show it after they build the set, even I do,

37
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:17,291
I like to show it to my parents showing what
I'm capable of. To make new graphics, like

38
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:23,039
doing artwork, or fan art, or anything like
that, they love to do that, and building things

39
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:28,540
that they love once again, Legos. They love
them, but last but not least, they like to

40
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,590
play with the results. Guess what? Lego. They
love to play with Lego before they put it

41
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:40,220
on the shelf before letting it dust and rot.
>> Awesome. So, we've talked a little bit

42
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,330
about the wrong way and why kids want to do
it, and what kids are into, so we would like

43
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:50,970
to present what we think is a great solution
for teaching kids to code, and, in this solution

44
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,350
that we want to show you, do you have to learn
how to type?

45
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,949
>> No, it is drag and drop.
>> Took weeks?

46
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:03,060
>> No, it was easy learn, and I learned how
make a game in the first day.

47
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,070
>> You're only a few of you online doing that?
>> There is a ginormous humungous community

48
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,870
of users.
>> Why don't you write us a piece of software

49
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,380
that you think you're being punished?
>> Almost fun to use, almost close to video

50
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,389
games.
>> Was anybody able to help you?

51
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:21,430
>> Yes, it's pretty easy to learn, but if
you do need help, anyone can help.

52
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,460
>> What about downloading games? Did you have
to create special stuff?

53
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,190
>> No, I created one in the first hour without
downloading.

54
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:32,330
>> What if you want graphics in there?
>> Graphic designs are included.

55
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:37,770
>> Awesome. We would like to show you the
solution that's worked for us, and that scratch

56
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,921
by MIT, it's super cool! Miming, tell us what
is Scratch?

57
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:49,660
>> It's a programming language developed by
MIT in 2003, it's for ages eight and up. I

58
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,810
started around seven or eight. Right now,
it has over 22 million users, and roughly

59
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,340
around 25,000 new members join every day.
>> Wow.

60
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,560
>> And guess what? It's in German, it's in
Spanish, it's in Japanese. There are over

61
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,340
70 languages it uses. And it only requires
internet access, and, because of the recent

62
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:18,280
3.0 update, no Flash! [Applause].
>> Thank you, JavaScript community for saving

63
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:26,260
us. Awesome. To get Scratch, it's super simple.
You point your browser to scratch.mit.edu,

64
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:36,110
and you're created with an IDE that looks
like this. In the top-right corner is the

65
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,639
stage.
>> That's where everything is going to happen

66
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:46,020
where Sprites are going to be moving and changing
president they are the objects on the stage

67
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,860
that, as I said, they're going to change,
move, do something. Those are the backdrops.

68
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:57,070
Those are the stages of the stage - play on
words there - and it changes, it can write

69
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:02,360
the code, all that. In the middle, there's
the coding area. That's where you're going

70
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:08,240
to be putting your code to make either the
Sprites stage change. Next to that are the

71
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,520
blocks. Those are the chunks of code that
we are going to be sticking together and making

72
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:19,370
your thing work. Above that are the tabs.
Pretty simple code. I just told you what that

73
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:34,120
was. Costumes is where either Sprites or backdrops
can change, and sounds describes itself.

74
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:41,331
>> So what we would like to do is a typical
Hello, World using Scratch. Michael will come

75
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:48,479
over and do live coding for you today in Berlin.
Scratch Cat is the Sprite that is default.

76
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:59,240
How about you show us a hello world script.
>> First, we go to events and grab the winflag.

77
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:06,759
You need this for every piece of code we do.
Then we go to looks. Grab a hell. Make that

78
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:18,699
a simple hello, world. Still using my pointy
fingers. Going over to motion with ten steps.

79
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:27,990
>> Let's blow it up and hit play. That kid
that you're trying to kitchen to code can

80
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:33,209
have the hello world script not learning how
to type or having all of those things that

81
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:37,349
kind of get in the way, so the next what we
would like to do is create a game for you

82
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:42,460
live, right here, and Michael already went
to the background and used the graphic tools,

83
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:47,520
created all of us own graphics and what we
see there is Jeff staying at an airport holding

84
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:54,640
a beer. Tell us the premise of the gale, Michael?
>> So Jeff is German dude, and I'm not going

85
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,170
to do anything weird. He is there, and he's
going to be throwing wiener schnitzel off

86
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:08,120
bearded dads coming off 48 aeroplanes with
only three hours of sleep, and he's going

87
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:17,500
to be super angry. He has to throw beers and
schnitzel to make him happy. Angry bearded

88
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,830
glasses dads..
>> Where did you get this idea?

89
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:26,670
>> With Grey Beard.
>> We want Jeff our main character moving

90
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:32,350
around. Show us how we can make Jeff move
left when you hit the left arrow button?

91
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:38,649
>> First, of course, we have to go events
and grab the click block. Again, you're always

92
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:44,980
going to need this. Go to control and grab
a forever and an if. It's forever going to

93
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:51,070
be asking the question: if something happens,
then do whatever is in the loop. The thing

94
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:56,399
we are going to be asking is going to be keyspace
press, but it's not going to be left, it's

95
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:05,240
going to be left arrow. Go to motion. We are
going to point in the direction left, which

96
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,800
is negative 90. And then move ten steps.
>> All right, so we hit the flag. We hit the

97
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:20,870
left arrow button.
>> Wait, wait. There's something wrong.

98
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,070
>> Do we have internet?
>> Do we have internet?

99
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:39,070
>> Okay. What's going on here?
>> I'm on the wrong Sprite.

100
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:46,089
>> Live coding is always fun! Every Sprite
is its own object. We headed in the wrong

101
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:51,511
piece of code. Now Jeff moves left! All right,
good job! Thank you.

102
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:54,700
>> Thank you very much.
>> So now we've got Jeff moving left but I

103
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,279
think he needs to move right as well. How
do we go in there and make him move right?

104
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:04,290
>> Easy. You right-click and duplicate, something
amazing about Scratch. You go right arrow

105
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,170
and make that right.
>> Perfect.

106
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,390
>> Zoom.
>> And so we've got moonwalking Jeff.

107
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:17,780
>> Yes, Michael Jefferson!
>> Let's make him move in the other direction,

108
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,540
pointing in the direction he's supposed to
be moving.

109
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,330
>> Before that, I would like to show you the
costumes. I have a right and a left costume.

110
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:32,740
These will be important to make it move. We
go back to code. You go to "looks". We go

111
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:39,339
down here and switch costume to right. Put
that there as well, with this left. It's in

112
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:41,470
place.
>> So that when he moves left and right, he

113
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:46,240
will be facing that direction. Jeff can't
move up and down. How hard would it be to

114
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,310
add that?
>> Not very. Just expand, and right-click.

115
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:56,500
Boom! There we go.
>> Duplicate two more if statements, so four

116
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,310
nested if statements in there checking to
see if it's going up, down, left, or right.

117
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,930
Michael's going to get all of those set up.
We will remove the Switch costume for the

118
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:16,120
up and down. Accept the directions to down
and up. And when we click Play, we should

119
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,610
have a fully moving Jeff. He moves everywhere,
even diagonal. Check that out. In a few minutes,

120
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,450
you're able to get the basics of a 2D game
going but right now, it's just Jeff running

121
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:31,430
around on a stage. Let's bring in one of the
aeroplanes and see if we can't get some of

122
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:36,060
the angry dads to come off.
>> "Aeroplane Michael coming in for landing".

123
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:43,270
>> All right. Now we have another Sprite,
this is the aeroplane Sprite, its own object.

124
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:47,990
Michael will start having angry dads coming
off the plane and chase down Jeff trying to

125
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,600
get that beer and schnitzel.
>> Of course, go over to events, when the

126
00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:04,230
flag is clicked. Go to control, do "forever".
Wait one second. And so it's going to wait

127
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,910
one second and then create a clone of myself.
>> That's quick.

128
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,699
>> It's a bit too short.
>> Let's make that a little more random.

129
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:18,870
>> Let's go to operators, pick random one
to ten. Expand. Make it 2, 2, 6.

130
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:24,230
>> Every to two six seconds, this Sprite will
create a clone of itself and Michael will

131
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,970
show you what we can do with that clone.
>> When I start the clone, and you're also

132
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:39,890
going to grab a "repeat until", go to motion,
you're going to point towards a Jeff. And

133
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:45,790
move ten steps. There you about.
>> So let's see what happens here. And we

134
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:50,610
wait two to six seconds randomly, and angry
dad!

135
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,030
>> Dad!
>> That's another aeroplane! All right. So

136
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,230
how can we fix that? Instead of aeroplanes
coming out of aeroplanes, we have angry dads.

137
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:03,170
>> First, I like the costumes. There is plain
and there is Jason.

138
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:10,330
>> He looks a little familiar. So let's find
a way to get him off the plane.

139
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:16,470
>> So go back to code. Go to looks. The plane
is not going to be plane.

140
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:23,399
>> Every time a clone is created, it should
of angry dad. Jeff's going to run around.

141
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:27,630
Here they come. Angry dads coming off the
aeroplane, chasing down Jeff. I have never

142
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:31,530
run that fast in my life? You can't convince
me that was based on me.

143
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:36,930
>> Let's make it six, then.
>> We will make him run a little slower. When

144
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:42,800
they are catching Jeff, should they not disappear?
>> If you want.

145
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,790
>> Let's show how we could do that?
>> Okay, fine. Go over to sensing and do touching

146
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:55,410
mouse pointer, change that to touching Jeff.
>> How we have a until loop like a "do while".

147
00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:01,529
Go to ...
>> Go to control again. Delete this clone.

148
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:05,560
>> So once that loop completes, the clone
will be deleted.

149
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:12,500
>> Yes. So now let's go back in.
>> All right, so Jeff's out running around

150
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,850
the airport. Every two to six seconds, there
comes angry dads off the plane. When they

151
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,680
click Jeff, they go away. Wouldn't it be great
if we could get them beer and schnitzel before

152
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,390
they caught Jeff?
>> Indeed. Let's go to food and drink. We

153
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:31,420
have a beer. We have a schnitzel. I like the
beer better than the schnitzel!

154
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,040
>> When we click on this third Sprite now,
we see there's no code there for that object.

155
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,360
We say whenever the game starts.
>> When the flag is clicked, whenever the

156
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:51,350
game starts, we are going to go to control.
Forever. If also grab while we are here. Then

157
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:59,399
we go to our sensing. We keep it there. Go
back to control, grab it here.

158
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,490
>> We are creating a clone every time the
space bar key is pressed.

159
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:10,550
>> Then we go to random position and we go
to Jeff, and then - grabbing so much stuff

160
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:17,670
while I was here. "Repeat until", and then
we are going to have the motion, move ten

161
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:22,750
steps. There you go.
>> So now every time he hit the space bar,

162
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:27,690
a clone should be made of the food object
and it should start moving ten steps from

163
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:35,280
where it originates.
>> Like CSS you have show and hide for your

164
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:44,279
Sprites. Now we need to show. Perfect. Awesome.
Wait! But that's like an endless supply of

165
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:48,550
schnitzel, and they're sticking to the end.
Let's make it where you have to let go of

166
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,639
the space bar in between?
>> I want you -

167
00:16:52,639 --> 00:17:01,950
>> Let's clean that up a little bit.
>> There come the angry Jasons. Shall we fix

168
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:06,179
first machine-gun?
>> Let's make it where you don't have machine-gun

169
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:12,089
schnitzel.
>> Okay. So we go over to Control, wait until,

170
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:22,110
putting on the operators. Grab a "not duplicate
this" so now it's going to repeat saying if

171
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:27,949
the key space is pressed, make clone but you
can't repeat until the key space pressed is

172
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:31,350
not being pressed.
>> You've got to let go of the space bar every

173
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:37,070
time. Let's see how that is working?
>> I'm holding it.

174
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:42,180
>> Perfect. But they are sticking to the edge
of the screen there. We should probably make

175
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,980
them disappear when they get to the edge of
the stage.

176
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:52,730
>> So we are making it, we are touching the
edge. We are going to make it where it deletes

177
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,320
the clone.
>> So, when it falls out of the repeat loop,

178
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,480
the while loop, they won't stick to the sides.
That's perfect, but what I what I noticed

179
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,110
is when the angry dads come off the aeroplane,
they keep coming, so we should make that angry

180
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,850
dad disappear as soon as he gets that beer
and schnitzel.

181
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:19,220
>> Let's go back to plane one. We're going
to operators. Grab an or. Duplicate Jeff.

182
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,710
And boop.
>> So it's going to repeat until it's either

183
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:27,150
touching the food and drink Sprite or the
Jeff Sprite, and then they should disappear,

184
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,500
and we should have angry dads coming off,
getting ready to get that German beer and

185
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,239
schnitzel, and there it is. Able to feed them
and make them happy. [Applause].

186
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:40,420
>> But, it's only schnitzel coming out.
>> Yes, the game's a little easy right now.

187
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:46,470
You can stand in front of the plane and spam
angry dads. What if we had a expected plane?

188
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:52,029
>> Easy. So you cannot just copy code, you
can also duplicate Sprites.

189
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:57,950
>> If you notice, when he duplicated the Sprite,
all the code duplicated as well. When you

190
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,659
hit play, we have a video game that is twice
as hard and fast.

191
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:12,270
>> I forgot something: aeroplane Michael coming
into landing.

192
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:20,140
>> It's only shooting schnitzels to the left.
>> We need a variable. If you don't know what

193
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:31,100
they are, you're at the wrong talk!
>> It's going to be our direction variables.

194
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:38,660
It's variables in Scratch or global. Any Variable
you create can be accessed from another Sprite.

195
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,149
Michael's going to set those variables to
whatever Jeff is pointing left or right.

196
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:47,300
>> It's either negative 90 or 90. Right or
left.

197
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,950
>> You can see for debugging that the variable
is visible on the stage but you can uncheck

198
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,340
it if you don't want it to be there.
>> Real quick drag a dir.

199
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:03,600
>> So we are back on the food and drink Sprite.
>> So point direction dir.

200
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,900
>> Choosing that variable, whichever way Jeff
is pointed, that's the way the schnitzels

201
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:15,850
are coming. I thought we said beer and schnitzels?
>> I can fix that. There you go. Now we go

202
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:22,630
on to looks. And do switch costume to beer,
and to the beer, we are going to go to the

203
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:27,090
operators, and switch it to pick random one
to two. If you look in the costumes, it's

204
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:37,460
numbered one and two, so if I do this, -
>> So now randomly shooting beer and schnitzels.

205
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,470
They want to get that beer from Jeff but he's
able to deliver one for them before they get

206
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:48,440
to him. We have the basics of a 2D video game
in about 15 minutes, written by a 13-year-old.

207
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,840
This is something you can all go home and
do! [Cheering and applause]. Thank you. If

208
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:00,600
you give him 30 or 45 minutes, he can build
out a fleshed-out video game. I want now to

209
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:07,860
show you the final version of angry dad and
Jeff. On the bottom right-hand corner, it

210
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:14,220
will be the beer mug, the life of Jeff. Let's
watch him play around. So it's the same game

211
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,990
that you saw, except this time when angry
dads come off and they drink Jeff's beer from

212
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:23,169
him, he starts running out, and so we can
see that when they do catch him, his life

213
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:27,940
meter goes down -
>> But there is a keg which refills your beer

214
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,539
meter.
>> As long as he is shooting beers at other

215
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:40,690
people, they stay unhappy. They drink all
of his beer! Game over!

216
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:52,760
>> It didn't go to End Screen. That's what
we were looking for. Thank you.

217
00:21:52,760 --> 00:22:02,110
>> We would love you to get in touch with
us. You can contact me on Twitter.

218
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:08,340
>> Thank you all for coming to our talk!
>> Good job.
