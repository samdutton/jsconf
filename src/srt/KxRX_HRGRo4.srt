00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:19,740

[Music]

2
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:25,670
so yeah like here one I'm Kenneth I'm

3
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,340
originally from Copenhagen Denmark I

4
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,740
recently took a little rocket or plane

5
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,370
and moved to Canada and I work for this

6
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,449
tiny little company called Microsoft and

7
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:40,519
what I do at Microsoft is really all

8
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:43,129
about dev tools so I'm a program manager

9
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:45,829
so that means I do product strategy I do

10
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:47,690
a lot of prototyping working closely

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,909
with my engineers to basically figure

12
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:51,679
out like what the diff tools of the

13
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,229
future should be and I think personally

14
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:56,239
I spent the past many years in the

15
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,709
community doing a lot of diff tools kind

16
00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:59,269
of hacking and then this year joined

17
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:01,369
Microsoft to do it as a full-time paid

18
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:04,070
job I think we as developers is like we

19
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,170
really care about the tools we use each

20
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,450
and every day so I'm basically here to

21
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,670
talk about how we think about the future

22
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,440
for furtive tools and how we think about

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,150
we can maybe do things a bit in a

24
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,640
different way but first I would like to

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,760
quite a bit of context I am on the web

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,740
platform and and how we need to think

27
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,100
about dev tools and going forward so I

28
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,510
think it's pretty clear for all of us

29
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,150
that we all real big developer Joel

30
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,680
using javascript and but the big

31
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,620
platform has changed quite significantly

32
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,910
over the past I would say five years

33
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,160
like when I started building from the

34
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,020
web it was all about documents doing

35
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,600
simple text documents and that was

36
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,770
basically like that's why we have

37
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,540
hypertext markup language to do a

38
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,580
scientific report we had a CSS we would

39
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,590
style the documents but if you actually

40
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,480
look at like how the majority of us are

41
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,120
using the platform and the browser today

42
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,190
is all about applications this is just

43
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,170
animated gave her like Netflix that

44
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,909
majority of America is used in each and

45
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:00,710
every day and which actually quite a

46
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,210
complicated application when you think

47
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,270
about it and even if you look at the

48
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,860
devices we're using each and every day

49
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,369
they've also changed and I remember like

50
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:13,410
the good old workstation Mac or like the

51
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,210
the good old laptop I had plenty of

52
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,010
these with the noble guys over the years

53
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,070
so like if you look at the devices were

54
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,020
using today they at least from Microsoft

55
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,340
they look quite a bit different we have

56
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,900
like service to studios all about

57
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,120
charged surface where services if used a

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,280
macbook if you're the ipad the devices

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,020
has changed quite fundamentally from

60
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,120
being this workstation kind of thing to

61
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,580
something thats a bit more mobile and

62
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,190
and really when we talk about the what

63
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,900
devices people are using to browse the

64
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,330
web it's really about mobile devices and

65
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,150
like today mobile phones and then large

66
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,040
phones tablets kind of thing comes in a

67
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,810
lot of different sizes and that's been a

68
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,190
lot of stuff happening in terms of i

69
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,800
remember my good old naka 3210 that way

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,200
i could play snake to like my my iphone

71
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,080
7 i'm using today right so our mobile

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,350
devices has changed quite a bit too and

73
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,180
even the browser's all of us are using

74
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,950
every day our customers using every day

75
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,470
has changed like today we have like

76
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,600
chrome as a market leader we actually

77
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,810
have safari a hat with if we include

78
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,420
like a iPads as a pretty significant

79
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,040
disk top market share because the ipass

80
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,920
are grown so big today and and then we

81
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,360
have like if you look at our market

82
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,850
share like for Microsoft our itch marga

83
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,740
chair still growing we're still trying

84
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,110
to kill the remaining bits of IE but one

85
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,780
day I'm sure we will succeed and so like

86
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,640
that this desktop landscape has changed

87
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,310
quite a bit and I just want to touch

88
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,950
upon like I'm i'm on the edge devtools

89
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,860
team and as a part of a new our effort

90
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,650
of I've actually reinvesting in the web

91
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,560
then we decided to kill I we doing edge

92
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,440
and that was basically because what

93
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,970
Microsoft did previously was basically

94
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,160
just Mike dropping out of the the stage

95
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,750
after doing re 6 because there was an

96
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,060
awesome browser at least back then and

97
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,130
but we're basically reinventing or

98
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,670
trying to reinvent a our approach to how

99
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,930
we build for the web and and another

100
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,550
interesting thing we look alike our

101
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,860
devices has changed our browsers we use

102
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,450
each every day has changed but also

103
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,450
internet adoption has changed and like

104
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,480
now I know now we're in Singapore but

105
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,400
but when I show this and in the Western

106
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,650
world people are amazed there are more

107
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,900
people living inside the circle and then

108
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,640
outside of it let's just so show

109
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,150
something

110
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,759
about how the next billion will go

111
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,350
online or what markets are that are

112
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,150
relevant and what kind of devices people

113
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,520
use in when they go online and we need

114
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,169
to think about this when we build our

115
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:39,300
websites when we optimize our user

116
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,650
experiences but also when we build our

117
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,370
tools and it's just another interesting

118
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,050
fact that I think many people tend to

119
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,520
forget it's like that's more people

120
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,370
online in China then there's population

121
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,680
in Europe it's a mind-boggling number

122
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,419
when you think of it but people forget

123
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,449
and to me that's interesting because it

124
00:04:57,449 --> 00:04:59,250
shows a lot of opportunity yeah but it's

125
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,380
also tells me that we maybe need to

126
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:07,199
rethink our approach to 225 tools and I

127
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,570
just want to code Bennett Evans here

128
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,150
it's like saying mobile Internet is the

129
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,820
same as saying color TV it's kind of

130
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,919
implied when you watch TV today that is

131
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,020
in color and kind of when you go online

132
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,940
today it's kind of implied that you do

133
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,560
it from your mobile phone or you do it

134
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,900
for from a wearable like this mobile

135
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,470
thing is just the way we do things and

136
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,680
and when we think about mobile the

137
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,419
mobile landscape has also changed quite

138
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:36,930
a bit and actually if we look alike over

139
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,180
market shares you see browsers more

140
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,120
popular than sapphire mobile that's

141
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,380
almost eighteen percent of the global

142
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,419
market share we are still seeing a

143
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:48,180
significant chunk of Android the stock

144
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,500
android browser on all the android

145
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,539
phones we're seeing new browsers like

146
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,699
the purple one that is sam some internet

147
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,840
growing the triple-digit market shares

148
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,849
every every month because it's now the

149
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:01,590
new default browser on samsung devices

150
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,110
so we're basic seeing a whole shift here

151
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,510
from traditional browsers to new players

152
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,400
that are entering the market we're also

153
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,500
seeing players like grave and Yandex

154
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,060
actually gaining pretty good market

155
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,150
shares so the more interesting thing is

156
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,310
we responded engineers of web developers

157
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,289
what we care about is like the engine We

158
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:21,240
Need to Talk it and we're seeing like

159
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,729
you you three engine actually being

160
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:25,380
larger than safari but most of us don't

161
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,510
know how you you see browsers working on

162
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,760
the inside because it's a proprietary

163
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,400
lipid fork no one has access to it and

164
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,470
that's interesting and then we have like

165
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,779
the good old players like Babe kid we

166
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:38,669
have playing HTML our engine we have

167
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:39,009
cake

168
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:41,349
but we also see like new browsers coming

169
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:43,419
around like brave that is just using

170
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:45,189
whatever engine that is available on the

171
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:47,110
underlying platform so when you use

172
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,779
brave on Windows is right now as an

173
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:52,330
electron app if you use it on your

174
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,939
iPhone is using lip kit if using on all

175
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:56,830
Android device it's using Android

176
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,479
browser so kind of switching the

177
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,360
underlying engine when it's relevant and

178
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,279
to me that's interesting because this

179
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,039
shows that that the web world and we

180
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:07,599
have gained so much compatibility that

181
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,339
just doing the engine itself it's the

182
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:11,469
longer competitive advantage this also

183
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:13,479
changes our perspective when we build

184
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:17,469
stuff for the web and then we are seeing

185
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:21,099
all of this the this whole trend of the

186
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:23,439
progressive web and we like my bed here

187
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,050
is that in a few years you introduces

188
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,759
and you as the developer won't know that

189
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,770
you're using a browser anymore because

190
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,469
what we are already seeing on mobile

191
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:34,149
platforms is the bit being embedded

192
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:36,339
inside native we see that on Android

193
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:38,349
with chrome custom tabs as the Pinterest

194
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:40,599
app that can just embed like an advanced

195
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:42,819
VIP you inside the native shell we're

196
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:44,830
seeing it on iOS chew with Safari view

197
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,199
controllers so we've seen this full

198
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,419
emergence of like native platforms and

199
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:50,680
the web melding together in this

200
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,439
combined experience and on a desktop

201
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,419
we're seeing the bib used as a runtime

202
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:58,269
too so we see that in slag that she's an

203
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,519
electron app at Microsoft we should we

204
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,169
shall studio code our open source editor

205
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:04,899
it's just a bit app chip inside electron

206
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:07,689
and so we're basically seeing the VIP

207
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:09,939
being being merged into all of the

208
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:12,249
different categories of apps we use from

209
00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:13,990
our mobile phones to all desktops and

210
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,580
that's really exciting because that

211
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,870
means we can ship more as with

212
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,419
developers and and then we have this

213
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:21,339
whole progressive web app movement where

214
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:23,559
we're suddenly a you can go to a ul and

215
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:26,080
the website can be promoted to your home

216
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,659
screen and and live outside of the

217
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:30,159
regular browser you are in the browser

218
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:31,749
Chrome which I find really interesting

219
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:33,760
and that's some of the thing is that it

220
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,529
would be a Microsoft spending a lot of

221
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:37,750
time looking at so right now we have

222
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,300
service worker fetch cash push bit

223
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,130
manifest all in development in edge and

224
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,959
the reason for this is because we want

225
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:45,490
to bring the progressive bit to the

226
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,829
desktop and we have still have quite a

227
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:50,380
significant chunk of users using a

228
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,480
our platforms and specially using

229
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,670
desktops and right now we find it

230
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,380
relatively that you have to install an

231
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,590
electron app and it's a kind of a clunky

232
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,600
experience what if the desktop

233
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
experience could just be you go to

234
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,020
Netflix and certainly it's on your

235
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,150
desktop the terms a lot of interesting

236
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,250
questions because what is a home screen

237
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,900
around this top how does all these

238
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,580
things work what if you open up the

239
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,200
desktop browser and you go to Netflix

240
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,780
should open up the PVA you have on your

241
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,980
desktop or should you stay inside the

242
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,150
browser that's a lot of interesting

243
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,530
challenges with that will be working

244
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,120
hard and trying to crack this not

245
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,820
because we think that's the way and that

246
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,760
is the future for the web and another

247
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,170
interesting thing when we look at all

248
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,450
this changed new devices new platforms

249
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,790
do rendering engines we also seen this

250
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,070
next paradigm shift that is going to

251
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,050
happen it's basically bit assembly so

252
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,150
all major browser vendors are shipping

253
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,980
at least an experimental implementation

254
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,930
of live assembly that basically allows

255
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,930
any native developer to take their C++

256
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,480
code compile it by a.m script not

257
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,610
something that can generate bassam code

258
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,800
and run it inside the browser that is

259
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,320
being that vapor simply code bassam code

260
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,300
is being run by the JavaScript engine

261
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,280
and then ultimately is being rendered by

262
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,040
a bit GL and this it like it's an

263
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,450
interesting challenge a lot of us whip

264
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,730
developers because here there's no HTML

265
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,130
or JavaScript involved anymore it's just

266
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,870
your native game the Sun can run in the

267
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,890
browser and kind of my point here is

268
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,330
that the front-end role is being

269
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,640
redefined these years like a lot of us

270
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,430
we care about HTML and JavaScript but as

271
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,340
the VIP and native ameri and we're

272
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,090
trying to bring more advanced

273
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,910
capabilities into the platform front end

274
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,490
is being redefined and a good example of

275
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,620
this is for example my my android watch

276
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,780
that can show push notifications so I

277
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,000
can get a push notification from chrome

278
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,340
running in a service worker that it was

279
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,350
excavated but by a few lines of

280
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,780
JavaScript and the question I'm asking

281
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,420
myself are you a front-end developer if

282
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,910
you write JavaScript in a service worker

283
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,040
to show push notification that is

284
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,430
rendered natively no HTML know CSS on

285
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,340
your watch I your front-end developer

286
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,660
because you just wrote a back at an

287
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,880
integration right and i think that's

288
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,660
that's going to be an interesting

289
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,300
challenge for us

290
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,830
when we think tooling but also we think

291
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,610
our identity because JavaScript

292
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,330
emergencies this might not be as

293
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,990
relevant in the future as you think and

294
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,240
kind of my job at Microsoft is to think

295
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,950
about all these things and and try to

296
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,600
make sense of it and say so how does

297
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,230
devtools fit into all this and and kind

298
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,089
of when I look at like the dev tools we

299
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:25,680
are shipping today they all were we

300
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,190
similar if we look at like and if you

301
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,079
look at the dev tools we shipping we

302
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,269
ship an edge like Google shipping chrome

303
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:35,910
and they're all kind of the same kind of

304
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,579
had the same functionality and my point

305
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,620
here is that I think our industry has a

306
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,720
dev tools dogma we kind of had this

307
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,370
preconception and a diff tool is

308
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,110
something that is installed as a patio

309
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,820
desktop browser so it has to be docked

310
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,649
at the bottom of your screen it has to

311
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:51,390
have like a dominicks lower script tab

312
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,850
maybe a network tool and then is a divot

313
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:57,060
tool and I'm really asking myself like

314
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,490
is this really can we do better here

315
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,870
because if I look at AG mark what my

316
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,430
team did back in the good old days like

317
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,779
2007 I developer toolbar yay and and I

318
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,010
look alike the tools we're shipping

319
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,709
today they're quite alike the Dom

320
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,390
Explorer you can see like some some

321
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,180
style but technically is kind of the

322
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,100
same tool and if I look alike what

323
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,350
chrome is shipping it's kind of the same

324
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,560
from each tip tools they they have the

325
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,990
same kind of thing like network sources

326
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,870
and like I'm really asking myself in a

327
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,459
world where the web is running outside

328
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:32,579
of the browser running on a new range of

329
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,740
devices is this really the best we can

330
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,970
do when we think about the whole

331
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:40,170
development experience and because if

332
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,790
you try to break down like the tools

333
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,860
that all of us shipping today modern div

334
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,660
to the basic a collection of tools it's

335
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,820
a mini ide that has a dom explorer

336
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,470
console debugger network tool

337
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,570
performance profiler maybe has some

338
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,190
memory profiling has some emulation

339
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,630
features it's actually really

340
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,190
complicated set of tools that all

341
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,820
browsers are shipping and yet again they

342
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,410
are like at the bottom of our screens

343
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,240
they're basically in a fraction of our

344
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,920
of our screens and we use them when we

345
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,959
are debugging so we could sit in our

346
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,750
editor we open our dev tools which debug

347
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,520
something and then we switch back to our

348
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,820
authoring context

349
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,490
and basically if you think about this is

350
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,130
what we do all day long which have

351
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,870
between debugging and authoring

352
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,290
debugging and watering and I'm just

353
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,760
trying to like is this really optimal

354
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,340
when we actually think of it because if

355
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,650
i look at the wire workflow like it's

356
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,390
completely broken because our authoring

357
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,160
tools is not the same as our debugging

358
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,130
tools and if i actually look alike the

359
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,890
workflow then this is still a typical

360
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,570
development workflow we open your editor

361
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,430
or your browser you navigate your page

362
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,500
you'll find the file you editor you make

363
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,510
a change you go back to your browser

364
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,340
refresh the page you open the dev tool

365
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,810
you go to the scripts tap you find the

366
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,790
same value just edit it you go to the

367
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,500
Edit line you set your break point you

368
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,840
debug you figure out what's wrong you go

369
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,520
back to your edit so you make a change

370
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,470
step back to to the browser and then you

371
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,870
repeat this all day long unless you have

372
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,220
installed like I guess Saudi enough all

373
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,540
the tools that are running in like five

374
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,370
different command lines and refreshing a

375
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,290
lot of things for you but this is still

376
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,850
the de facto way that you're building

377
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,790
for the web this was fine when the web

378
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,530
was just about the scientific documents

379
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,300
but when we're building applications is

380
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,760
this really good enough and the funny

381
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,320
thing here is like when I talk to

382
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,830
developers and I developers don't

383
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,840
realize that this is a problem they

384
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,610
don't realize that we can do better as

385
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,500
an industry and I call this the bib

386
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,450
develop of Stockholm Syndrome that we

387
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,310
think is perfectly all right and it's

388
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,590
perfectly okay the way we both for the

389
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,050
web and I think I really think with an

390
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,990
industry we can do better add just a few

391
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,180
thoughts here like if you take a step

392
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,890
back and look at our tools that all of

393
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,750
us using every day why do I have to

394
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,370
learn a new diff tool for each browser

395
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,810
why is it given in 2016 why do I have to

396
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,460
use different tools which in autumn and

397
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,460
debugging why is that still a thing why

398
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,170
is my edits a bit more integrated with

399
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,570
Mario browsers and like why addicts will

400
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,700
still bundle with our disturb browsers

401
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,850
it's not like you can open a iphone app

402
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,440
and open motive to land your iPhone or

403
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,170
on your iPad why is diff tool still this

404
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,760
thing we consider mandatory power of the

405
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,700
browser and if you look at it that's

406
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,080
basically this massive disconnect

407
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,350
between and the authoring side and the

408
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,970
debugging side and there's some of the

409
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,070
things like weird Microsoft over the

410
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,220
past months

411
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,450
and some time trying to figure out if we

412
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,970
can do better and because the way we

413
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,920
view about the tools that we think that

414
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,350
the diff tools and editors are basically

415
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,820
complimentary to each other they

416
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,020
shouldn't replace each other but they

417
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,640
should have a way to work together

418
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,520
somehow ahem plus basically what we've

419
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,200
been spending a little time and trying

420
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,120
to basically connect the two walls and

421
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,590
having a more integrated experience when

422
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,120
you're building for the web because it's

423
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,890
too goddamn complicated to build for the

424
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,740
web these days and so what if the

425
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,940
workflow was more like you open your

426
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,590
editor it will be your file you make a

427
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,630
change inside your editor you open your

428
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,570
browser you set a breakpoint inside your

429
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,700
editor you debug it from your editor you

430
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,840
make a change and you just see the

431
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,000
browser update what if you get this cut

432
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,290
the same experience where you're not

433
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,320
forced to use a lot of different tools

434
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,420
so actually back in March we ship like

435
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,980
was something we call vias code chrome

436
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,660
debugger and basically what you're

437
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,630
seeing here is basically animated gif of

438
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,330
vs cote bug in chrome and so you can

439
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,680
basically just say press the debug

440
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,840
button and then vs code connects to to

441
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,400
to chrome and you can set your break

442
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,070
point straight from your editor no need

443
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,630
to leave the editor where you're a

444
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,000
co-author and write the code so this was

445
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,130
like a first experiment we did and I

446
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,840
should turned out that this is quite

447
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,220
popular because this is like the most

448
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,900
public extension we have for Felicia

449
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,640
pieces to decode these days because

450
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,280
people love this integrated experience

451
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,540
so we thought hey like we have our own

452
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,970
proud of what can we do here and so a

453
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,520
few months later we did a blog post or I

454
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,870
did about Poe story announce that we are

455
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,700
now integrated edge with sublime text

456
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,560
and visual studio code because

457
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,180
developers kind of wanted the same

458
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,780
integrated experience and the way we did

459
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,000
this was kind of in in a new i would say

460
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,100
nun microsoft way because we released a

461
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,080
component called the HD Gnostics adapter

462
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,270
and that is basically the protocol

463
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,700
adapter that enables a third-party tools

464
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,770
to interface with edge but instead of

465
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,930
inventing yet another API a proprietary

466
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:21,680
API and then we did that because if you

467
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,150
look at like modern dev tools they're

468
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,470
both upon something called remote

469
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,870
debugging protocols and tools like

470
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,090
Visual Studio code or chrome tip school

471
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,860
so any other tool were already

472
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,330
integrating with the chrome a bargain

473
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,580
protocol and so we just wrote an adapter

474
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,770
for edge to implement the same API so

475
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,110
that way then we could enable our

476
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,490
existing debuggers for visual studio

477
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,230
Visual Studio code and other two

478
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,790
we'll just work with H out of the box

479
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,570
and kind of the point I want to get

480
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,580
through here that we do support an open

481
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,130
ecosystem web browser and torn vendors

482
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,679
can work together we don't want to like

483
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:56,900
in enable this closed ecosystem in this

484
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,600
closed world where we try to force you

485
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,940
to use one particular product we want to

486
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,220
enable as many tools working with our

487
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,520
our platform and another interesting

488
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,340
thing here in happened recently

489
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,370
devastating an effort by google is

490
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,990
google committed a new project called v8

491
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,179
inspector to note and that basically

492
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,790
means that node now has embraced the

493
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,549
same a chrome debugging protocol so you

494
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:23,780
can use chrome dev tools you can use

495
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,690
Visual Studio code to debug node because

496
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,679
it's the same API and this opens up some

497
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:32,660
really interesting possibilities that

498
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,080
hasn't been possible before because by

499
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,490
having the same API for both the line

500
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,169
side and the back end side of the server

501
00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:44,540
side that means we can actually have

502
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,870
simultaneous debugging and I call this

503
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,760
like the knee ivana of debugging because

504
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,900
that basically means you can keep up

505
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,910
both parts of your application if your

506
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,950
full stack developer as many of us are

507
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,500
today and so I just want to show a quick

508
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,850
demo on how how that actually works so

509
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,830
what I have open here switches to decode

510
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,240
it's the text biggest big enough to the

511
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,840
zoom in ok I didn't hear any or anything

512
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,299
so I think it's ok so basically what I

513
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:13,910
have here is a visa to decode have a

514
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,580
little note abusing express what you

515
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,860
guys can see here is I serve my my

516
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,179
bundle da housecat allocation with

517
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:22,570
browserify so it's was bundling my full

518
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,830
application and generating a source map

519
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,820
and and my console application is just

520
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,740
an angular app it can basically view

521
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,169
like a time zone I can see what time it

522
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:34,940
is in Vancouver and what is in Singapore

523
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,220
and that's about it but the cool thing

524
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,500
here is like what I now can do is that

525
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,559
again just go to the debug mode in visit

526
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,720
to the code and press debug and what

527
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,360
your then seeing is like now I'm avid

528
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,000
the debugger enabled so if i go to my

529
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,100
server side code here i can set a

530
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,750
breakpoint always set it so if i refresh

531
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,020
the page

532
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,610
what you're seeing here is that I'm now

533
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,460
debugging my note code I can step debug

534
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,560
and continue if I go down here I have

535
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,450
the full call stack or what's going on

536
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,190
you know back in time and I going to say

537
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,980
continue that's that's like cool because

538
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,170
then you have visual visual debugging if

539
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,660
a node but one of the things that we

540
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,370
just released and that's a part of like

541
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,920
at the insider build officials to decode

542
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,510
that's why the icon down here is green

543
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,540
is that we have a support for move to

544
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,180
target debugging so what I can do while

545
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:28,020
my my my debug has now attached to note

546
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,280
is that I can actually just select

547
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,840
chrome up here if I press a debug again

548
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,910
what you're seeing is that I have

549
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,260
another instance of chrome running I'm

550
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,910
now hitting the same server side break

551
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,640
point because the page is loading and

552
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,410
then my avocation is open but now i can

553
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,420
do is that i can just open up my client

554
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,280
side code so i can time to go to a

555
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,500
controller here let's just browse a bit

556
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,640
around on add new click i want to set a

557
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,730
breakpoint i was to see what happens

558
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,980
here is that what you're seeing is like

559
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,690
chrome is now being tossed because

560
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,360
support from Visual Studio code and I

561
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,910
can do step debugging of what's

562
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,770
happening in my client side code and

563
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,900
what you see here is basically you have

564
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,790
like both threads because the our debug

565
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,990
is connected to both parts of your

566
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,760
application and you can basically just

567
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,010
continue to have a continuous debugging

568
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,950
experience across run times and also

569
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,020
across stacks I think this is like the

570
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,400
first step we're taking on bringing a

571
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,260
more simple workflow to your development

572
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,240
workflow because you why would you knew

573
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,100
why would you use a different tool and

574
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,100
when you can just use the same

575
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,270
experience regardless what you need to

576
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,100
debug and kind of the point here that

577
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,950
this is just node and chrome our

578
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,810
architecture of Visual Studio code

579
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:42,330
allows you to debug edge with you and

580
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,580
would you go back end because we have

581
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,230
debuggers available for that so we can

582
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,550
provide this consistent experience

583
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,710
across your stack you could imagine

584
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,170
you're hitting an API that is running on

585
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,400
your staging server you could just

586
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,730
configure the debugger to connect a tool

587
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,500
richer to your staging server wish I

588
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,130
find really really cool so another thing

589
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,930
we did was basically we thought okay if

590
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,390
the web is all about mobile devices why

591
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,980
don't we just enable

592
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,380
on iOS so we did the same experience and

593
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,960
while you can debug your iOS device when

594
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,580
we should suit your coat same same

595
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,840
intimate experience but the key thing

596
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,730
here is that this was actually the first

597
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,940
time if your Windows you could debug iOS

598
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,710
from your Windows machine before we

599
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,270
release this you could you had to go out

600
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,850
and buy a mac or mac mini just a debug

601
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,280
your iOS device that's no longer needed

602
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,549
and it's the same concept again we used

603
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:34,620
our same debugger we use the same API

604
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,530
and then we use a protocol adapter to

605
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,179
enable iOS devices to work with our

606
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:43,559
stuff and a thing i want to touch upon

607
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:46,049
here it's like when we think about it

608
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:47,340
it's like now we have like a more

609
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,900
integrated web development workflow

610
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,669
where we can try to avoid a lot of

611
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,010
different tools as a part of our stack

612
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,590
but why is the web one of the few

613
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,510
platforms also bundles a full

614
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,880
development environment with the runtime

615
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,780
i can if i do an android app but do a

616
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,419
native c++ ever my desktop there's no

617
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,370
full ID included as a part of my

618
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,200
application it's not a part that the

619
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,910
user can hit like f12 and suddenly they

620
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,990
see a magic editor right because if you

621
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,390
look at what what induces are

622
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,340
experiencing normal VIP users are

623
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,179
confused this is a screenshot of a

624
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:27,000
confused user talks about like child

625
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,309
abuse and like it's really being it

626
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:30,960
feeling confused and the point of this

627
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,090
is because of this is because there's a

628
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,740
warning witnessing here force all of his

629
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,290
children to be wrapped in a block and

630
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,440
like it makes sense likes toolbox for

631
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,270
development contains an inline span

632
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,700
child what the heck is that right and

633
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,059
like imagine that the do of regular whip

634
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,460
used and you just by mistake press

635
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,910
inspect element open this then like

636
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,650
cyber attack what's going on here right

637
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,410
this is really crazy and the thing is

638
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,809
like this is Firefox this is from our

639
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:03,480
backtrack and edge like normal BIP users

640
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,820
don't know what inspect element is here

641
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,290
there's a person that has played a

642
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,720
facebook game a suddenly clicked inspect

643
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,730
element and now the devtools been open

644
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,979
for three days

645
00:24:13,979 --> 00:24:16,389
like they don't know what's going on

646
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:20,019
right which is which is kind of scary

647
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:21,909
because to us as developers is the most

648
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:25,539
natural thing in the world and if you

649
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:27,039
open up chrome devtools and you go to

650
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,049
Facebook and Google property your basic

651
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:30,580
seeing the same that normal dip users

652
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,739
are hacking themselves so Facebook is

653
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:35,080
forced to like at this massive like

654
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,879
console warning this is a browser

655
00:24:36,879 --> 00:24:38,739
feature in Jennifer developers don't

656
00:24:38,739 --> 00:24:40,720
copy paste stuff in here because

657
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,779
apparently people are copy pasting weird

658
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:45,519
javascript in here to get more friends

659
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:47,499
or bit more likes or whatever right but

660
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:49,840
to me like when we look at this

661
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,429
holistically this is kind of a problem

662
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:53,679
for the web platform that users of the

663
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,419
web basic hacking himself or feeling

664
00:24:55,419 --> 00:25:00,609
feeling scared right so um we will at

665
00:25:00,609 --> 00:25:02,049
least a blog post the thing was like

666
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:04,989
yesterday or the day before because in

667
00:25:04,989 --> 00:25:06,909
the edge team we've been looking at our

668
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:09,309
relatively simple telemetry we have for

669
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:12,970
its dev tools and this is a graph that

670
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,739
shows that this distribution on on

671
00:25:14,739 --> 00:25:16,779
basically how long how many seconds

672
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:19,119
people are using our tool and we

673
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,889
basically saw that the majority of our

674
00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:23,289
users of assistive tools are opening the

675
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:25,539
tools clicking a bit around and then

676
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:28,690
closing it within 15 seconds and we

677
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,519
basically seen this as an indicator of

678
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,289
people are opening the dips pools by

679
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:36,099
mistake and because we also can we can

680
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:38,739
see like if people click inside the tool

681
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:41,139
and people open it have it open for

682
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,059
maybe six six seconds and then they find

683
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:44,229
the close button and it closed it again

684
00:25:44,229 --> 00:25:46,239
they're really confused about this thing

685
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:47,379
and this makes sense when you think

686
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,080
about it because H is right now is

687
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,779
mainly in user browser not a lot of

688
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:54,220
developers are using it because our

689
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,649
compel compatibility are great but that

690
00:25:56,649 --> 00:25:58,690
basically meant that we looked at this

691
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,249
data and as a part of our last release

692
00:26:00,249 --> 00:26:02,409
we should be a few months ago we've

693
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:04,359
decided to hide a chip tools by default

694
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:06,820
so all the developer options like view

695
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,559
souls and inspect element are now hidden

696
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,869
because regular users don't care about

697
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,639
these things they just want to go to

698
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:15,820
Netflix or go to Facebook and and yet

699
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,349
again we are trying to balance the

700
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:19,509
balance like the user experience so you

701
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:21,519
can go to about flags and you can it

702
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:23,799
like enable it here and say you want to

703
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,119
show you souls in a speculum in the

704
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,289
consequent you click it a new habit

705
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:26,950
again

706
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,139
like Safari but we also have kept in the

707
00:26:29,139 --> 00:26:31,360
this top shortcut so if you press f12 or

708
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,070
put something that can open the dev

709
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,840
tools to Meereen able the mode again but

710
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,210
we basically like doing this as an

711
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,950
experiment and looking at the data and

712
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,350
then reevaluating it and like I would

713
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,730
love to hear your feedback and turn

714
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,380
stuff like if this is confusing for you

715
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,299
as a developer we basically just trying

716
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:48,399
to shield and use a much as possible for

717
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:52,389
these really powerful tools and I just

718
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:55,299
want to open I don't have like an answer

719
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:57,669
to this question but why a dev tools

720
00:26:57,669 --> 00:26:59,529
them still bundled with our browsers if

721
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:00,940
you look at all the change that has

722
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,230
happened to the web is about

723
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,269
applications that the biggest now

724
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:07,090
running in pwas without any browser

725
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,620
chrome the babe is running inside

726
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,179
electron shells on your desktop

727
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:12,250
basically the browser chrome the address

728
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,720
bar the refresh button all these things

729
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,090
are now gone and if you look at like the

730
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,340
devices people are the next billion are

731
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,080
going to experience a web app it's going

732
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,909
to be none desktop devices it's going to

733
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:23,980
be mobile phones it's going to be a new

734
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,720
kind of variables whole lenses kind of

735
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,669
new experiences that doesn't have the

736
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:30,490
traditional keyboard and mouse and then

737
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:33,460
yet again we as an industry we insist on

738
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,950
shipping the diff tool use each and

739
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,990
every day to debug or all of these other

740
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,840
devices in a desktop browser and bundle

741
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,090
it at the bottom percent of your screen

742
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,830
for example if you want to debug samsung

743
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,130
internet and i am not aware that samsung

744
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,960
shipping a desktop browsers all right so

745
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,490
maybe we need to take a step back and

746
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:54,100
enable the dev tools to work out of the

747
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,809
desktop context that maybe work with

748
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:57,700
some of these new device factors in the

749
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,840
future and really when i think about the

750
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,360
future of diff tools is looking rather

751
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,010
complicated because the future of diff

752
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,019
tools is basically going to be a bunch

753
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,539
of different tools we use microsoft we

754
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:12,340
will probably continue to ship it stiff

755
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,899
tools will public continues ship Visual

756
00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:16,059
Studio Visual Studio code but what we

757
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:17,700
imagine is basically world where these

758
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,049
different tools are more integrated

759
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:21,820
because you as a bit developer you

760
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,080
should have the choice if you want to

761
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,340
use a step to the chrome dev tools

762
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,740
without browser and we already enabled

763
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,630
that and the world is also going to be

764
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,010
that you need you want to have your

765
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,419
favorite editor that could be at them

766
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:32,919
there could be them or whatever but that

767
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,480
needs to be more integrated with the

768
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,610
runtimes and game developers when we

769
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,610
need to publish their

770
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,340
the games like we cannot force them into

771
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,350
a trip to the chrome dev tools and say

772
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,880
you need to debug your paper simply game

773
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,710
in this bottom of the screen they will

774
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,510
probably prefer to sit inside the editor

775
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,000
where they wrote the code and so we need

776
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,640
to enable all these tools to work with

777
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,799
all the runtimes and we look at the run

778
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,240
time to run times are going to be much

779
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,370
more complicated because as Sam some of

780
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,170
the internet that's UC browser this edge

781
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,570
so far I that's a whole new range of

782
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,010
devices that's probably going to be like

783
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,830
five different variants of electron wave

784
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,570
runtimes you need to check it so these

785
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:11,330
tools need to be able to work with a

786
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,240
broad set of run times before you as a

787
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,650
developer can be successful and

788
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,390
productive and then if you look at the

789
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:21,290
basis that that these tools these

790
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,640
browsers or run times are running on

791
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,200
it's going to be a broad range of

792
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,630
devices and if you are sitting here in

793
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,309
Singapore and you need to roll out in

794
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:30,710
India maybe you need access to devices

795
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,140
Japan up by hand Singapore because they

796
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,330
use a different set of hardware so I

797
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,190
also imagine a future where we have

798
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,260
device clouds where you can say I want

799
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,240
to roll out in Indonesia give me the

800
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,299
five most used devices and then you get

801
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:46,100
them screencast to you or something like

802
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,720
that we need to solve this because

803
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,630
availability of low-end high-end

804
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,880
hardware is a problem for for all of us

805
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,290
regardless of where we are in the world

806
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,200
so I imagine that you can use s dev

807
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,500
tools to debug safari internet or Sam

808
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,049
some internet and you can add have the

809
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:05,179
code running on a stream device coming

810
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:06,890
from the cloud I think this is the

811
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,559
direction we need to go go towards to

812
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:12,620
enable you as an us as developers to be

813
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,120
much more successful and as the bib

814
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,650
grows out of the browser which is

815
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,910
happening these days as the whole

816
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:22,190
progressive bit movement we need to

817
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:26,030
reimagine our dev tools and and at

818
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,380
Microsoft free spending a lot of time

819
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:30,650
trying to figure this out and as of a

820
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,990
few weeks ago we decided to scale up our

821
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,360
or a stiff tools quite significantly so

822
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,710
if you're interested in trying to help

823
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,540
out and build the future of dip tools

824
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,600
like check out this ul and by that I'm

825
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,660
20 seconds over time so thank you so

826
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,820
much thank you for having me and if

827
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,570
you're interested tag along on Twitter

828
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,670
that's the decibel the future clips all

829
00:30:51,670 --> 00:31:01,620
together thanks
