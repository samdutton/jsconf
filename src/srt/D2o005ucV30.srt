00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:13,290

Thanks ok hello everyone today we are

2
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,929
going to talk about bio inspired from

3
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:22,109
engineering so I'm Kylie I've been doing

4
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,330
from and engineering for more than help

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,439
a decade so this is my the link to my

6
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,040
github profile you can follow this link

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,059
actually I've been trying to get into

8
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,170
the twitter thing but and you know I I

9
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,879
wasn't very too successful so if you are

10
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,620
interested to follow me on twitter you

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,180
can use the same hand though it's just

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,340
it's the same but i'm not going to

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,980
injury included here just in case you're

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,989
interested so i'm currently working as a

15
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:55,620
staff engineer a kkbox IQ in taiwan and

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,170
doing a sort of you know from n and

17
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,710
javascript stuff and now i'm not sure it

18
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,220
is also common place for everyone's home

19
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,320
country but here in taiwan a good

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,900
portion of them from engineers in the

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,360
industry aren't you know i'm coming from

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,150
a computer science background so

23
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:19,200
including me so just being curious well

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,990
we are added so how many of you aren't

25
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,299
coming from a traditional computer

26
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,100
science background please raise your

27
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,780
hand please just in curious it's like um

28
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,000
a dozen or more people and okay so it's

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,630
not it's not a lot of people so maybe

30
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,020
I'm you know I'm not a common people and

31
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,119
I don't know so okay well just like like

32
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,430
I've said before I'm not coming from a

33
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,649
computer science background my academic

34
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:54,840
background is actually having nothing to

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,409
do with computer science at all so

36
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,180
actually I used to be a telescope

37
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,390
operator um manalo are in the Big Island

38
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,000
of Hawaii so it's not a very big

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,250
telescope either is a radio telescope

40
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,610
and we're trying to you know observe

41
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,470
some cryptic

42
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,960
properties of the microwave background

43
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,690
radiation so it's not very interesting

44
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,150
but I have a long-standing passion for

45
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,240
astronomy since my youth actually I'm

46
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,630
and giving my school years Mike timid

47
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,840
years i'm starting chemistry and biology

48
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,590
molecular biology cellular biology and

49
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,650
so on so i would not say they are

50
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,870
interesting but they can be enchanting

51
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,320
at links so you may be wondering that

52
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,870
like astronomy chemistry biology these

53
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,450
things sounds totally different again

54
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,640
there are you may think they're

55
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,670
unrelated to each other but actually I'm

56
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,640
trying to let you know that all of them

57
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,520
are like becomes a beacon of light point

58
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,150
into some of the archaic making the most

59
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,400
ancient and most profound questions for

60
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,290
us human being since the dawn of

61
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,850
civilizations so you may not notice yet

62
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,590
but they also have some striking

63
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,800
resemblances in places that you may have

64
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,400
yet to discover so maybe you would think

65
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,440
that this claim is very in like you

66
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,989
beers unbelievable but after all you

67
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:33,209
will see because while you may think

68
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:35,760
that the differences is astronomical

69
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,850
versus atomic home you know how can they

70
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,070
be you know how can I share any

71
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:46,410
resemblance is how could it be well it's

72
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,200
not only orders of magnitude apart we

73
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,260
are basically talking about two very

74
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,940
different ends on the scale of our

75
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,780
universe right so how could that be any

76
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,880
calculate here any kind of responses you

77
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,060
know so let's take a look at this

78
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,950
picture you know this background picture

79
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:11,740
what is it what does it look like to you

80
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,090
does it look like a group of cultured

81
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,500
cells on the package or maybe it's like

82
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,729
a representation of our neural network

83
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:25,259
in a brain

84
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,880
now that the answer is the real answer

85
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,919
is this is a computer simulation of the

86
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,590
Prairie based on real observational data

87
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,710
that's the very large structure of our

88
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,699
universe it's the largest known

89
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,900
structuring out your universe we are

90
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,759
calling it like a full amount of our

91
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,030
universe so as you can see our our

92
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,919
galaxy's you know that skitter doesn't

93
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,479
really scatter around the universe

94
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,259
layout you know they sit down certain

95
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:02,020
filaments along a straight a string a

96
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,909
straight line and there's nothing

97
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:08,310
between it's just boy nothing else so

98
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,360
the simulated similarities in the

99
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,539
visuals not mere coincidence actually

100
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:17,889
scientists are saying that there may be

101
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:21,069
some system dynamics that we haven't yet

102
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:24,400
fully understand having been in play

103
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,900
here and you know this may be a more

104
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,180
in-depth research into this area may

105
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,930
show some you know unknown science so

106
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,099
let's take a look at another example so

107
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:43,630
here's something yeah it looks like an

108
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,900
embryo you know in very early stage

109
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,940
embryo now we actually have a

110
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,699
specialized turn for the symbology

111
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,460
ice-coated Maaloula so it's immortalized

112
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,240
a fertilized egg undergoing a few splits

113
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,020
like from a single cell with you like 16

114
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,669
or 20 or 30 two cells you know this is a

115
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,789
very early stage of a single life it's

116
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,550
only a few days after fertilization so

117
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,259
it looks like because it looks like the

118
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:19,900
memories so it's called a morula okay

119
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,270
you say let let him freeze now

120
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,599
apparently this is not a fertilized egg

121
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:27,639
this is not a very well so I'm not

122
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,159
otherwise I won't be showing here so

123
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:33,669
it's actually a planet planetary nebula

124
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:35,110
code asked

125
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,540
nebula it's a few thousand light-years

126
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,860
away from the earth so ironically this

127
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,530
planetary nebula or should I say every

128
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,770
planetary nebula is formed at the end

129
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,820
stage of a time star so comfortably

130
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,600
counter into two to the early stage in

131
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,970
brio well so when a red giant reaches

132
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,960
the end of its life spin it will kind of

133
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,560
like just explode well actually it's not

134
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,100
explosion but the actual kinds of

135
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,290
pushing the other show of it of itself

136
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,450
into the interest level there are steps

137
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,360
space and these materials will get

138
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,870
ionized they will form the nebula you

139
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,570
see here and in a core will like

140
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,350
condensed into a white dwarf and the

141
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,240
white dwarf will be left alone in a

142
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,780
space and undergoing a eternity of

143
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,790
thermodynamic death so and this this

144
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,400
chem is that this is the very real part

145
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,940
of the central star of this planetary

146
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,550
nebula and this will also be the fat of

147
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,400
our very own son so you know this is not

148
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,820
fiction this is going to happen some in

149
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:00,070
some distant future so maybe you think

150
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,380
this is a sad thing but I'm going to

151
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,990
tell you that this is not necessary as a

152
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,260
bad thing because if not of these dying

153
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,280
stars you know we won't be here today

154
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,840
life on Earth will never happen at all

155
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,880
because the planet is the planetary

156
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,940
nebula and the explosion of stars is

157
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,540
very crucial to the generation of life

158
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,160
so Pete a tiny embryo or a diner a star

159
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,860
they both play in several inseparable

160
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,250
part in the burst of life so that's

161
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,580
because we're all star children so more

162
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,620
than ninety percent of our bodies masks

163
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,130
were forged by some long gone star in

164
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,390
the distant past

165
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,380
some jacket jetstar that is so for

166
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,450
example if you are like 70 kilograms 63

167
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,990
kilograms of your body mass is made from

168
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,080
alan's forge in some distant past inside

169
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,240
the core of a star a giant star so well

170
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,310
that's because you know in the beginning

171
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,120
the beginning is the big man that is

172
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,040
there's all the hydrogen and helium so

173
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,350
every heavier element like lithium or

174
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,520
carbon are formed in a later date during

175
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,010
a process with code nucleosynthesis

176
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,830
which is basically in Creole fusions I

177
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,550
stars so elements that are substantial

178
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,340
to organic life-forms like carbon

179
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,940
nitrogen oxygen there won't be here

180
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,750
today it is not because of this process

181
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:48,190
so now that you can see that well as

182
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,190
charming and chemistry and biology you

183
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,430
know they are not that different or

184
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,850
should I say the both of them going to

185
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,780
some you know single greatest mystery of

186
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,590
all time the origin of life so they will

187
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,560
give answers to questions like how we

188
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,380
here and you know why we are here and

189
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,380
what a hack this is jae's calm damn it

190
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,200
this is not like philosophy Kong you

191
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,880
know so what are you talking about this

192
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,160
where's my refund damning I'm going out

193
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,980
I'm getting out no please please don't

194
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,100
do this okay or you know Thomas will be

195
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,850
mad at me yeah so what I would like to

196
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,130
really talk about is that why we are

197
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,250
here today Theresa do is talk so I'm

198
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,040
hoping that we can agree these three

199
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,690
things which is convey ideas and

200
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,720
thinking process trying to you know

201
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,110
exchange ideas and see how ideas flow

202
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,850
and

203
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,190
to let you know that maybe we should

204
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,509
value cross disciplinary knowledge and

205
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:06,639
how to draw inspirations from the nature

206
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,440
the universe and we will use a classical

207
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,079
example which is a class composition as

208
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:20,620
an example for our general talk so first

209
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,199
just making sure that everyone is on the

210
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:26,259
same page when we are using now we're

211
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:30,069
talking about yes six classes very

212
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:35,649
quickly so this is how yes this class

213
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:39,190
works I'm sure that most of you should

214
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,829
know this but just in case you haven't

215
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:43,720
seen this before this is how it works

216
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,459
and it can be you know translated to es5

217
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:53,769
in reality this road like this and as

218
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:56,860
you can see this is a well-known pattern

219
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,660
or you know for classical JavaScript

220
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,060
development so it's not nothing special

221
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,480
here and there's also subclassing in

222
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,040
year six which is which goes like this

223
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,560
you can extend from a base class and you

224
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,449
can use super kohls so it can be

225
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:23,560
translated down to es5 like this it's a

226
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,889
little bit more complex but it's nothing

227
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:31,839
really hot you know basically it's just

228
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,480
telling you that how actually you are

229
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,079
extending from the productive chain and

230
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:40,389
how you are doing this super cold so

231
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:45,519
that's a special here as well so maybe

232
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,730
more interesting is the another proposal

233
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,649
for es 7 which is a class property

234
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:55,959
declarations I actually still in a very

235
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:59,850
early stage I'd still in stage one but

236
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,160
you can use it today and it looks looks

237
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,050
like this previously you have to attach

238
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,290
some properties in the

239
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,579
but if you are using this news proposal

240
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,769
you can you know attach the property of

241
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:20,399
class like this in Tucson I'm makes it

242
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,190
moral feels like a more integral part of

243
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:28,199
the class so and you can do you can do

244
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:30,300
all this stuff if you are using better

245
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,259
already but just in case you don't know

246
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:36,839
about this you can go to the Lebel

247
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,540
website and you know grab grab the

248
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,420
excuse it's good to the ball and you

249
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,870
know try experimenting some of this new

250
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,500
syntax and there's also a ripple a trip

251
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:55,319
or you can get to play about so let's go

252
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:59,880
through some quick back so first um yes

253
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,269
six classes are designed to be maximally

254
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:05,899
mini mall so what it what does this mean

255
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:09,269
maximal Ludmilla my so so strange you

256
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:14,519
know well the actually it means that the

257
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,620
committee spend a lot of time trying to

258
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,790
make sure that they put the tiniest bit

259
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,069
of things into the new specification

260
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:27,319
while enabling it to do a lot the

261
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:31,279
maximum the possible things yeah so

262
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,459
that's why they only settle down some

263
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:38,750
very basic features like extend and

264
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,190
super cold so there's nothing like

265
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:47,160
mixing centrist and so on so and just

266
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,510
make sure that you know this year six

267
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,680
classes is not actually a classical

268
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,920
inheritance it still protocol and it's

269
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,560
just trying to formalize on a very

270
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,589
specific pattern of the protocol in

271
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:06,630
Hilton's which is the constructor

272
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,060
pattern because everyone seems to be

273
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,519
using it so it's not actually trying to

274
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,290
actually trying to unburden the function

275
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,010
key word because before the es6 error

276
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,380
function key words you know being used

277
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,699
in so married so

278
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:26,639
so many places like you know declaring a

279
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,129
method that construct turn a call back

280
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:32,160
whatever and you are seeing this cure

281
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,809
everywhere so this is actually a good

282
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,819
thing for static analysis and

283
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:43,499
readability you know because it makes it

284
00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:46,470
more clear that what you are trying to

285
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,109
do with this block of code and conveys

286
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:53,970
convey your intent more clearly so so in

287
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,089
my humble opinion yes six classes appear

288
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,939
at xle where the next level of language

289
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:04,589
abstraction would appear and yeah it's

290
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:08,609
just here for our usage but you know

291
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:12,299
there are a lot of naysayers and during

292
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:15,689
the formalization process and even now

293
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:18,029
there are a lot of people who are

294
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:21,600
opposed to this news feature but I'm my

295
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,929
take is this technology by itself has no

296
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:28,169
good of evil and the same should apply

297
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:33,480
to technique so what really matters is

298
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,629
the intent the intent of doing same

299
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,879
thing why are you doing this it's not

300
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:41,100
actually the technology or the technique

301
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,369
itself so there are some you know some

302
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:48,319
high-profile figures being very vocal a

303
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:52,350
cup about you know the inclusion of

304
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,769
classes in year six but i think the

305
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:58,679
inclusion itself is neutral it's what

306
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,809
you are trying to use it on that matters

307
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:07,500
so one of the biggest reasons develop

308
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,010
housing you know classical inheritance

309
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,039
or inclusions itself is because of the

310
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:17,429
fragile based class problem which means

311
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:19,139
that you know something bad will happen

312
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:21,870
if the injury emergence chain gets too

313
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,350
long like for example you can citizen in

314
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:29,159
a lot of places like for example in CSS

315
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:32,820
basically CSS itself is a giant inherent

316
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,890
in style sheets

317
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,280
you know it's called cascading style

318
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,340
sheets after all so you know each style

319
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:46,470
applies to cascading down you know the

320
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,950
stout stellar chain and basically the

321
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,000
whole design of CSS was encouraged

322
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,400
encouraging the use of Global's so this

323
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,920
is a bad thing for developers and

324
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,780
developers have been struggling with

325
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,960
this for so long and there's also the

326
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,670
extending sauce you know while extent is

327
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,400
very powerful it can cause some troubles

328
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,810
for if you are using in a round pattern

329
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:19,100
or just using it in a round time yeah so

330
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,480
there are actually a lot of you know a

331
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,030
lot of online tutorials or tutorials

332
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,940
trying to tell people when and when you

333
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,520
should you and when shouldn't you use

334
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,140
extending sauce and you know this is

335
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,450
weird by itself because it's if

336
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,550
something is good and you shouldn't have

337
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,460
to worry about this yeah you know you

338
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,940
should be not very prone to error and

339
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,490
now the thing is the you know the scope

340
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,710
chain in angularjs I basically a very

341
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,400
long productive inheritance chain down

342
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,960
each scope so I it's also been you know

343
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,630
very prone to error and a lot of people

344
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,720
have been complaining to this but i'm

345
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,810
not sure if there is any good solution

346
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,390
to this problem maybe he's a maybe

347
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,660
there's one it's you know i'm not sure

348
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,840
this is in angularjs but overall you

349
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,480
should do conversation over in here jens

350
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,070
if if the situation allows cause long

351
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,440
and shaky convergence change is very bad

352
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,890
and it's very not very easy to handle

353
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,100
with so you know if you you pinned here

354
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,820
yesterday maybe you heard the one both

355
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,480
talked about CSS modules

356
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,470
so on the I CSS format yawn if you've

357
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,850
been here yesterday then you should know

358
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:51,080
about this new solution used state of

359
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,770
art in the front end development area I

360
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:58,360
like you know we can use CSS modules to

361
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,460
marginalize the CSS we're using and

362
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,640
avoid the global scholarship problem and

363
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,710
maybe you should stop using cascading

364
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,610
after all at all don't use it and you

365
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,860
know and it says modules also provides

366
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,410
some capabilities upper class

367
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:18,290
composition and itself can notify the

368
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:21,650
problem of SAS extend and for angularjs

369
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,799
maybe you should check out really rare

370
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,179
for you know for a healthy work maybe

371
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:33,049
because react process is doing this in a

372
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:35,510
very different fashion than the scope

373
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:39,320
channel thing gorgeous so by design it

374
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,760
avoids the problem at all so just in

375
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,450
case you haven't check out react already

376
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,780
you can you know go figure it out on

377
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,790
their website they have a very extensive

378
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:57,350
documentation and here's a little bit

379
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:00,980
about remixes and basically there was

380
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,520
there was a mixing implementation in

381
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:10,940
react prior to version 0.2 thing when

382
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,540
you're using the old react react class

383
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,990
method we can do that is but after a new

384
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,410
update several most before they you know

385
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,960
they strip is the way so if you are

386
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,710
trying to use es6 quiz riad there is

387
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,840
nothing you can do now you know to

388
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,510
include the mix-ins which is you know

389
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,990
it's kind of sad you know you know yeah

390
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,990
because pure in the mixing IP artisan

391
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,350
react you should know that this is very

392
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:45,020
essential part of react because it helps

393
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,750
a lot to reduce the performance to

394
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,630
improve the

395
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:53,190
of the page so there was a debate over

396
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,740
the internet about you know trying to

397
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,690
bring mixings back to es6 react

398
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,990
components but my tech is that this is a

399
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,570
bad idea because mixing sentries have

400
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:10,920
their own problems now they're men their

401
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,280
main problem is that there are two too

402
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,790
weird or delhi uses because both mixing

403
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,970
centrate trying to address a problem

404
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,630
which is when the method overlaps they

405
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,320
are trying to resolve the method either

406
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,580
either implicitly or explicitly like for

407
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,850
example mixings is doing this implicitly

408
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:40,200
so for example like in ruby me by my

409
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,930
memory serves me correct in ruby it will

410
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:46,110
try to resolve your mixing in a right

411
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:50,670
first depth first order and in python

412
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,180
there is a another very delicate

413
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,110
operation code c 3 linearization that's

414
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,090
trying to you know do all this thing for

415
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:03,030
you but the problem is is to influence

416
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,800
it and you don't know what happening the

417
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,360
honest thing so there's another you know

418
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,890
conversation method which is trades is

419
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,670
trying to do this explicitly so you have

420
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,600
to you know declare on each method what

421
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,820
you are trying to do with this method

422
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,000
when there is a you know conflict so

423
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,760
they are few a few options like you know

424
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,520
symmetric song which is addition and

425
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,020
removal or you know renaming but it is

426
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,540
getting to you know excessive for your

427
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,390
daily use if you're not going to want to

428
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,790
do this for all your message if you are

429
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,460
you know maintaining a large scale

430
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,550
project this is going to be a lot of

431
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,770
work and you know the chances you are

432
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:54,110
using this is new nearly zero future so

433
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,230
maybe not

434
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,720
using this approach so that's where I

435
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,540
start to explore some alternative

436
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,350
methods for composition which led me to

437
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:09,640
the following inspiration so I start

438
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,429
trying to look for you know some

439
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:15,400
naturally occurring structures and it

440
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,740
turns turns out that sells the vesicle

441
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,169
component for life is a very very good

442
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:26,580
example for you know for this case and

443
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,160
we're going to go through this very

444
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,000
quickly I hope because this is not you

445
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,190
know maybe not very interesting to some

446
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,070
of you but we have to learn some basics

447
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,390
about cells it is one of the most

448
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,340
interesting and molecular structures of

449
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,520
our universe because you know there's

450
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:54,580
nothing like life and it has do with

451
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,179
students of revolution to come to this

452
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:02,650
current state and it's the so far the

453
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,290
only known fundamental and universal

454
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:08,980
building block of life so what's the

455
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,990
secret and maybe wishes from you should

456
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:17,549
do it from the very beginning of life

457
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:22,200
let's talk about how light begins so

458
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,320
actually there is no definitive answers

459
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,669
here to this problem but the most common

460
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:34,890
thing you know Syria right now is a

461
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,480
biogenesis which means that you know

462
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,990
life basically happens at a very deep

463
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:44,669
sea floor and there are a lot of like

464
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:50,230
hydrodynamic bands you know screwing hot

465
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,360
hot springs from the core of the earth

466
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,110
and life forms there because it provides

467
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:59,740
heat and the necessary chemicals or you

468
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,250
know reaction is

469
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,610
to begin kicking off some biochemistry

470
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:07,430
process and he also provides some you

471
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,990
know necessary environment to form the

472
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:15,950
the membrane of the cell so we have

473
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,470
mentioned that the formation of the

474
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,390
membrane of the cell is very important

475
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,600
because without a compartment you can Co

476
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,450
it a cell so this is the first thing we

477
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:30,500
are going to look at I've been trying to

478
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,310
avoid this kind of diagrams but you know

479
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,040
this is unfortunate we have to face it

480
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,170
you know we have to face it some some of

481
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,660
my children's talk I don't want this son

482
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,490
like some some from the

483
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:48,140
textbook but yeah let's face it so this

484
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,800
is a protocell but actually it is not a

485
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,330
sale it's just a ball being informed by

486
00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:02,150
a you know a nut so sick or later so all

487
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,720
these all these small molecules here are

488
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,850
each are a 000 molecule and a very good

489
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,490
good way of thinking what it is is that

490
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:16,640
you can think of it as a you know an

491
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,160
object and naturally occurring object

492
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,040
and is it an empty object is not

493
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,800
something just an empty object so well

494
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,500
some some people are not very acceptable

495
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:32,060
to the idea that life kind of cell

496
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,000
originated but think about this it takes

497
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,960
the earth a billion years to build a

498
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,900
empty object no did not that's not very

499
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,920
small right so if you come to think

500
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,380
about this it's not very you know very

501
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,760
surprising so someone you know some more

502
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,530
millions of years later and there are

503
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:00,470
some more advanced not so advanced but

504
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,080
more advanced than a protocell sales cup

505
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,630
of code prokaryotic cell though which is

506
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:09,560
basically bacteria okay so as you can

507
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,379
see in this diagram

508
00:28:12,379 --> 00:28:15,059
inside a prokaryotic cell there's

509
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:18,749
basically no structure at all so a very

510
00:28:18,749 --> 00:28:20,249
good way of thinking about this is that

511
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:23,849
you know think about pojo tango java

512
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:25,769
squared an object we're playing with ja

513
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:28,229
sweet ya just bring our JavaScript

514
00:28:28,229 --> 00:28:31,799
objects so how do we use a plain old

515
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,749
java object you know there's basically

516
00:28:33,749 --> 00:28:36,259
no structure you just open a lot of

517
00:28:36,259 --> 00:28:38,909
properties and throw integers and

518
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:40,979
screens and methods and bullying's and

519
00:28:40,979 --> 00:28:43,529
all kind of things inside and this is

520
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:45,869
what you are seeing here you know there

521
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:49,229
is no compartments you know DNA and RNA

522
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:52,440
and all kind of stuff are you know

523
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,019
mixing together inside the compartment

524
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:58,769
so you know it's it's actually not a bad

525
00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:01,529
design I'm not sure I'm not here to

526
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:03,899
judge but you know it gets things down

527
00:29:03,899 --> 00:29:07,919
so come to think about this a you know

528
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,879
the heaviest biomass on earth is formed

529
00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:16,399
by clock down which is pro Celtic and

530
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:22,079
productive life form but you know they

531
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,940
can form something to advance because

532
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,039
you know this kind of structures can

533
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:29,309
only can only go so far but they are

534
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,889
still nowadays very efficient you know

535
00:29:31,889 --> 00:29:36,989
they can get in town but yeah just go so

536
00:29:36,989 --> 00:29:42,349
far so after some more millions of years

537
00:29:42,349 --> 00:29:45,299
you know after some interesting process

538
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:50,669
a more advanced more domest a variant of

539
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:54,089
sales emerged which is called eukaryotic

540
00:29:54,089 --> 00:29:57,509
cell which is are what we are formed you

541
00:29:57,509 --> 00:30:00,509
know everyone here your body is won by a

542
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:03,419
lot of product chaotic cells which is

543
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:05,969
the you know so far the most advanced

544
00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:09,479
kind of self and the advanced cars they

545
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:12,539
have a lot of you know components you

546
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:17,069
know components encapsulation structure

547
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:20,479
you know all these are good things so

548
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:23,440
just look at it you know this is sang

549
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,110
good stuff you know it's like a real

550
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,590
component instance with a lot of light

551
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:34,809
metal hooks for your usage so another

552
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:37,330
interesting thing to think about is that

553
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,049
you know there's a not so small gap

554
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:43,600
between a prokaryotic cell and the

555
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,000
eukaryotic cell you know there's so much

556
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,029
more structure so much more compartments

557
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:51,100
actually they have a specific name code

558
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,389
a organelle okay now it's like literally

559
00:30:55,389 --> 00:30:58,120
a small organ so there are a lot of

560
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,450
organelles here and how did how do they

561
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,700
come into its existence you know this is

562
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,309
another unanswered questions in

563
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:09,480
Canterbury contemporary science but

564
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,470
there are some very convincing series

565
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,929
right now that tries to address these

566
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:19,779
problems want them one of which is

567
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:24,159
called a sim biogenesis process which

568
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,139
basically means that you know our

569
00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:31,419
primitive cell ancestors try to it is

570
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:34,750
eat some some other cells and they found

571
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,539
out that you know instead of eating them

572
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:41,110
fisting on them they can try to coexist

573
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:44,649
with them so a whomped example is the

574
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:48,549
psycho past which is what you will find

575
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:52,210
in all the plant cells SATA place itself

576
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:56,980
is believed you came from symbolic

577
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,639
Genesis so their ancestor is very likely

578
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:03,870
some you know some germ some

579
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:07,870
cyanobacteria and you know in some

580
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:12,100
ancient ancient has you know some cells

581
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,269
try to get this kind of small cells and

582
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,940
after they eat them they found out that

583
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,509
you know instead of shared them and you

584
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:25,000
know feast on their substances it's much

585
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
more better to your let them stay there

586
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,279
and you know that they do their stings

587
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:32,139
because it's actually they are basically

588
00:32:32,139 --> 00:32:33,020
some

589
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:36,200
you know sugar generating factory so you

590
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,230
know free sugar why not so you know so

591
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:43,040
they just stayed and co-evolved with you

592
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,770
know some primitive cells and this also

593
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:48,910
happens for another organelle another

594
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:53,720
cell organ called mitochondria so you

595
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,990
know the odor is actually first there's

596
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,610
mitochondria cause coexisting with

597
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:02,330
primitive cells then call a tow rope

598
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:07,850
last so a lot of this process happened

599
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,800
in ancient times that we are not yet

600
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,640
very sure that happened or not but we

601
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,920
believe that is the one of the very

602
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,360
possible hypothesis about the

603
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,710
origination of Advanced Cell so come now

604
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,230
that we have come to know about this how

605
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,720
about that you know learn from the

606
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,000
nature and try to implement this kind of

607
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,180
structuring our code so while inspired

608
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:40,460
class composition so let's tweak our

609
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,580
earlier implementation a little bit we

610
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,540
are not going to declare a organized

611
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:50,450
organism we are going to define a cell

612
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:53,330
instead so here are a few you know

613
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,810
properties for sale age the amount of

614
00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:00,590
glucose molecule and you know there are

615
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,870
actually energy molecule but I'm not

616
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,180
going to explain here they are just I'm

617
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,940
going just to represent them in some

618
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,490
drought in the integer and there is also

619
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:14,630
a very basic method code grow okay so

620
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:19,040
very basic and you know grow basically

621
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,070
consumes energy and grow the cell and

622
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,820
increases age and hear how we would like

623
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,960
to define our mitochondria and

624
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,600
chloroplasts cause basically in essence

625
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,630
they are still sells you know they still

626
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:39,860
preserve a lot of trades trade about

627
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,929
cells they hid their own DNA they have

628
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:47,190
on our a synthetic process and you know

629
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:50,940
a lot of similarities with a normal self

630
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,559
so we're just you know extend them as a

631
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:57,869
best class of using the cell as a best

632
00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:02,520
class and mitochondrial is actually like

633
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,859
this you know power plant for ourselves

634
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:07,710
so it creates energy you know it

635
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:10,410
consumes glucose and turns them into

636
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:13,020
some energy molecules know the ratio is

637
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,109
not actually 12 wine but i'm not i'm

638
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:19,220
trying to keep things simple here so

639
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,170
there's also chloroplast chloroplast is

640
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,740
not do those simple things that they use

641
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,760
the energy from photon the light and you

642
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,150
know some or carbon dioxide and

643
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,770
transform you know somehow generate

644
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:39,750
glucose and oxygen now this can be a

645
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,990
little bit daunting but you know just

646
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,660
I'm going I'm just going to let your

647
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,390
skin test this really quickly but if you

648
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,400
are interested we have a link to the

649
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,099
code later so basically I'm you know

650
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:55,380
defying some more messes for a client

651
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,280
cell you know it can basically the main

652
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,099
things that it can do something like you

653
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:05,430
know divide an exiting micro country to

654
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,640
make it into tube and there's also some

655
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,510
way to channel energy and glucose

656
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:15,390
molecules we sing the cell and its

657
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,900
Oconee organelle right between you know

658
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,760
set up past and mitochondrial and this

659
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,700
is how we use it you know when you know

660
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,609
just the same with new a plant cell then

661
00:36:29,609 --> 00:36:32,730
we can you know invoke the masses

662
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,579
attached onto it and if you are

663
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:39,089
interested here's the result and a link

664
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:42,990
for you to play it links to a paper

665
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:46,500
wrapper page which you can you know try

666
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,470
to play around and see if you can find

667
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,690
something more interesting now this is

668
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:54,099
more like a proof of concept so

669
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:56,829
you know if you are trying to do

670
00:36:56,829 --> 00:36:59,200
something you can add more abstractions

671
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,690
into it I'm not I didn't add too much

672
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,400
abstractions because I'm just trying to

673
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,999
get the point across but you know

674
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:09,579
there's so much potential to this new

675
00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:12,670
way of class composition but actually

676
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:15,160
I'm trying to tell this is I'm letting

677
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,349
you know that I'm being honest here this

678
00:37:17,349 --> 00:37:20,499
is I seriously doubt that this is the

679
00:37:20,499 --> 00:37:22,809
first time someone using this technique

680
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:26,890
because this is actually not a very hard

681
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:30,309
technique right so for example if you

682
00:37:30,309 --> 00:37:31,569
are trying to explain this to a

683
00:37:31,569 --> 00:37:33,759
five-year-old you can just say something

684
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:36,970
like oh I'm you know Instant agent in

685
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:39,489
some you know some objects in the

686
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:41,440
constructor method no that's basically

687
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,190
it but the point is what matters here is

688
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:48,130
that why you are doing this the

689
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:52,119
reasoning behind and you know the

690
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:53,769
different thing in the different

691
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:55,839
thinking process will use different

692
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,119
results in your scepter way for example

693
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:01,539
you know Flux Facebook flops you know

694
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:04,569
every if you have check into the

695
00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:08,079
structure of flux structure in that you

696
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,299
will know that this is like basically a

697
00:38:10,299 --> 00:38:13,599
mediator pattern in disguise but there

698
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,660
are some subtle differences or you know

699
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,390
details in in the flux structure to make

700
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:22,769
it shine through other similar

701
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:26,890
implementations so what's more important

702
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,489
is why you're doing this and the idea

703
00:38:29,489 --> 00:38:32,759
you're thinking process behind and

704
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:36,759
perhaps now you you will come a little

705
00:38:36,759 --> 00:38:39,969
bit closer to my ideas that cross the

706
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:43,119
circle mineralogy is somehow useful and

707
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,150
you can do not draw inspiration from the

708
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,359
nature because you know it's like a

709
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,700
giant simulation playground and the

710
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,769
nature is doing older hard looking for

711
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:57,759
you and coming out some of the best you

712
00:38:57,759 --> 00:39:00,270
know that's way of doing things

713
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:05,550
so look around the nature and also it's

714
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,730
not necessary not necessarily a bad

715
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:11,340
thing to you know do the same thing that

716
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,920
other people have done before because

717
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,660
for example the eye the eye the window

718
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,740
of a soul has been you know evolved or

719
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:26,850
like 50 to 100 times independently no

720
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:29,430
it's not a single shot it's has do a lot

721
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,950
of evolution and so long independently

722
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:35,100
so you know there are actually a lot of

723
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,070
kind of eyes existing on this earth

724
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,800
there are some sea animals that can see

725
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,770
like you know a lot more colors than

726
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:49,590
humans can can do so yeah it's not

727
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:54,900
necessarily a bad thing so yeah so how

728
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,850
about we you know pay some more

729
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:59,250
attention to our environment and you

730
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,260
know maybe there are some inspirations

731
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,620
with him to be drawn okay now thanks for
