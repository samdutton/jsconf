00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,100

ah

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,580
I'm Kevin that's right mr. Patrick

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,559
country and we are both members of

4
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,779
mozillas Bespin team so we're gonna be

5
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:19,390
talking about betta vestments best in

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,810
today and this is best bin whoops

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,839
there's messmann screens a little bit

8
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,119
tall but best bended basically a text

9
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:29,109
editor that runs in your browser

10
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:31,060
specifically a programmers editor that

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,040
runs in your browser the whole idea that

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,989
you can write code manipulate it and

13
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,039
we'll see why you might want to do that

14
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,809
so why would you want to do that there

15
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:44,320
are actually a bunch of reasons so one

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,960
is that the web is a great open platform

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,219
that we've you know we've all come to

18
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:50,859
know and love and why not have our

19
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:52,059
developer tools built on that same

20
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:55,000
platform that we're developing for at

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,350
this point the platform's gotten to the

22
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,690
point where we can do that kind of thing

23
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,320
and is getting even better with html5

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,030
html5 is actually as a whole bunch of

25
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,370
features that really do add a lot to the

26
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,290
platform now if you ask these guys is

27
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,210
html5 ready yet demo tell you it's not

28
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,210
gonna be ready until 20 22 but they're

29
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,729
wrong html5 is ready today as long as

30
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:17,590
you know what your users are like if

31
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,119
your users are among the thirty-five to

32
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,829
forty percent of the people running an

33
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:23,530
html5 compatible browser then yes this

34
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:24,759
is the time to start using this stuff

35
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:25,930
because there's a lot of great api's

36
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,460
here and I know that there's been a

37
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,229
bunch of other talks that have touched

38
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:32,350
on an html5 so we take we take advantage

39
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,299
of those api's investment because we

40
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:36,759
know that probably everybody in this

41
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,170
room unless there's somebody in string

42
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:43,930
will work for Microsoft cool then okay

43
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,759
doesn't have canvas yeah we should talk

44
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:54,659
don't worry um okay well anyway I so so

45
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,700
people in this room most likely who our

46
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,320
target target audience for best been are

47
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,140
likely using compatible browsers and so

48
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,460
another reason why is that there are

49
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,070
lots of cases of this on the web this is

50
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,229
a shot from WordPress theme editor where

51
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,149
you edit code in a text area which is

52
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:13,150
really really crappy so there are a lot

53
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,440
of cases like that these days where you

54
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,910
have some code that you want to edit in

55
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,069
a browser and we want we have a best

56
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:18,760
been embedded

57
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,900
gage that's kind of designed for this

58
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,400
purpose so you can actually pick up that

59
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,370
package stick it on your server and just

60
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,860
all just JavaScript and it will you can

61
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,269
replace your text areas with something

62
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:32,650
better one of the other use cases is is

63
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,510
basically being able to get access to

64
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,739
your code wherever you are so if you

65
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,629
have actually like the best BIM server

66
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:39,069
environment where you can code in the

67
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:41,140
cloud the idea is you can go to any

68
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,140
computer sit down there and have you no

69
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,310
immediate access to everything you're

70
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,200
already working on this is not one of

71
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,400
the things that I was originally geeked

72
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
about when it came to besten but

73
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,120
repeatedly I've heard from college

74
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,500
students they really like this aspect

75
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,569
and you know as we get start getting

76
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:00,190
devices of different form factors where

77
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,659
you might want to access your code in

78
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:04,359
the cloud you know these these kinds of

79
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:07,060
things phones and bigger phones are

80
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,129
going to become really really

81
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:10,900
interesting for coding wherever you are

82
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,950
and they want to really have all your

83
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,019
files on there so that is actually a

84
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:15,760
growing use case and it is the number

85
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,720
one request I'm uservoice yes ipad

86
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,980
support for best bin is actually the

87
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,329
number one request under user for say

88
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,720
right now so that's kind of interesting

89
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,370
remote pair programming it you know most

90
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,989
of the way that we collaborate by and

91
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:30,609
large Morganne code is through version

92
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:32,859
control systems but there are times and

93
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:34,030
its really nice to be able to sit down

94
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,709
with somebody else on a piece of code

95
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:36,910
that and they're not necessarily in the

96
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,099
same time zone with you which actually

97
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:40,510
is a case on the best been team every

98
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,739
single number the team is a different

99
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:44,560
time zone it's really nice to be able to

100
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,019
code collaboratively right now the

101
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,180
current shipping version of best been we

102
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,620
are actually the process of getting the

103
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,329
collaboration features to a new state so

104
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:56,650
this is a use case that very soon we're

105
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,590
gonna have a good answer for so one of

106
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,519
the things that makes best been

107
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:03,220
different from the many many other ones

108
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,870
we're kind of going after the big major

109
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,419
editors that people live in all day

110
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:09,159
they're probably 403 I'm just making

111
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,150
this number up there are a large number

112
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,250
of code editors that people have already

113
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,430
written for the browser but the thing is

114
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,639
most of them are kind of avoiding going

115
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,510
after the big guys they don't actually

116
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,710
try to make an environment they try to

117
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,539
make an environment that's good for you

118
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:27,880
know quick bits of code not so much for

119
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,070
the things that you do the better that

120
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,380
you leave

121
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,960
an all day long and writing code so

122
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,860
we're trying to go after some of those

123
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,690
things so what are some of those things

124
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,770
some of those things are like

125
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,870
customizability obviously for all

126
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,430
programmers and we're all working on

127
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,570
different kinds of projects we want to

128
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,640
be able to make our tools do the right

129
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,880
things for our projects so

130
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,780
customizability is a big thing in any

131
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,010
one of those editors I just mentioned

132
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,150
you know if you look at textmate there

133
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,560
hasn't been a real text me release for a

134
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,060
long time but there are new bundles

135
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,140
coming out all the time to do all kinds

136
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,570
of stuff syntax highlighting I mean that

137
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,100
you know even the basic web editors do

138
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,080
that but it's pretty critical because

139
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,250
you know it makes it a lot easier to

140
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,930
read your code good use of keyboard

141
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,640
since we use the keyboard we hate

142
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,850
reaching for the mice when we have to

143
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,020
behave well for code like indentation

144
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,400
that's one of the most annoying things

145
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,200
about text areas obviously is that you

146
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,910
know you can't hit tab and if you you

147
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,840
know it doesn't keep your indentation

148
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,910
level and all that kind of stuff and

149
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,010
these things since they have since

150
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,330
they're very customizable and a lot of

151
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,250
these editors been around for years

152
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,380
there's usually lots lots more that

153
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,810
these editors do for you and we're

154
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:27,980
trying to get best been to the point

155
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,020
where we can actually be competitive at

156
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,000
that level yeah a lot of editors have

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,770
scripting languages and being in

158
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,180
JavaScript we have the advantage of

159
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,070
having a scripting language already

160
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:43,430
there for us thankfully yes sure you

161
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,260
guys thinking about a shell extension

162
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,970
like with text me there's a meat

163
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,279
extension where your

164
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:53,499
and in a file that's conceivably

165
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:56,379
possible in like some specific depending

166
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:57,849
on the packaging's investment i mean if

167
00:05:57,849 --> 00:05:58,749
there are lots of different ways to

168
00:05:58,749 --> 00:05:59,889
package this up and that would be one

169
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:02,199
one possibility i'll go into more detail

170
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:05,710
on the packaging at the end so on the

171
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,689
customizability front you know we've

172
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:09,639
just been we've been actually for the

173
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,229
past several months completely

174
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:13,259
overhauling the way best been works and

175
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:14,889
customizability is one of the big

176
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:16,689
factors so we have we created up a

177
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:18,520
plug-in system for best bin that

178
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,830
basically each plug-in has a bunch of

179
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,349
metadata that says what it does Intel's

180
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:24,520
best me what does and all that metadata

181
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,259
gets eagerly loaded up to the browser so

182
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:28,180
as soon as you had best been best been

183
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,740
knows all the functionalities available

184
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,969
but it doesn't load all that

185
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:32,559
functionality until you need it so you

186
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,449
can have 50 syntax highlighters for you

187
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:36,490
know different languages and only once

188
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,439
and none of those get loaded until you

189
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,300
actually open a file in that language so

190
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,699
that saves all a lot of loading and

191
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:44,169
these plugins will be able to do all

192
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:45,459
kinds of things right now we've got a

193
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:46,930
handful of different kinds of things but

194
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:53,110
that will grow so one example of using

195
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,120
the plug-in system basically is

196
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,889
basically as we've got a little command

197
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:58,959
line best friend has a command line I'll

198
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,459
get into that a little bit so you type

199
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:02,289
hello and it says hi there and this is

200
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,029
the plugin that's doing that so I'm

201
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:05,499
changing the code in best been right

202
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:06,969
here so best ones actually great

203
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,740
environment for editing vestment plugins

204
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,330
because you can say plug-in reload hello

205
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,729
run the command again and then it gets

206
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:14,409
the the change text so it automatically

207
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:16,479
will dynamically reload plugins so you

208
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,039
can do a plug-in install and it'll just

209
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:19,479
install a plug-in while you're working

210
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:21,789
live you can remove plugins and the

211
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:23,709
commands go away all that kind of thing

212
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,149
it's very dynamic environment which is

213
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:27,699
nice and you can even publish to so that

214
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:29,949
other people can use them yeah that's

215
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:30,819
right there's a there's a plug-in

216
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:32,169
gallery that currently lives in best

217
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:33,159
Bend and we're also gonna have one on

218
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,509
the version of that on the web so that

219
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:35,709
people can browse through the different

220
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:39,189
plugins available syntax highlighting

221
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:42,039
Bespin has actually pluggable syntax

222
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:44,169
highlighting engines so you can change

223
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:45,669
out the way syntax highlighting is done

224
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:48,309
and the one the current shipping engine

225
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:50,349
basically works on right regular

226
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:52,180
expressions and States so you can

227
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,349
actually have a bunch of regular

228
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:54,519
expressions parcels through the code

229
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,680
figures out how it should be colored and

230
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,149
then change the states if it needs to

231
00:07:58,149 --> 00:07:59,979
because it's you know your work you've

232
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,870
gone into a like a multi-line comment or

233
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,780
something like that

234
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,620
so that's the current syntax

235
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,129
highlighting engine I mentioned commands

236
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:11,129
basically everything you do investment

237
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:13,439
at this point is a command from like

238
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,319
changing some text from being mixed case

239
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,449
to being all uppercase or hitting the up

240
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:20,759
arrow key to go up that does or commands

241
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,270
to and there's a command line that we

242
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,909
offer that can rather than having great

243
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:28,500
big heaps of menus and views and stuff

244
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,780
we actually have a tricked-out command

245
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,310
line this is not like your unix command

246
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,870
line this is it's anna graphical

247
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,829
environment so we can do all kinds of

248
00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:36,450
cool stuff will give you documentation

249
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,740
right in line as you start typing the

250
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,839
command there's a bunch of cool stuff we

251
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,630
do there and it's a great way to sort of

252
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,919
bootstrap some new functionality you

253
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,820
want to get some functionality and

254
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,529
they're just write a command for it it's

255
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:48,029
pretty good good commands it have the

256
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:51,690
bottom avail so I like typeset and it

257
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,600
popped up the help for set the complete

258
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,740
help and then you start adding

259
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,360
parameters to that it will tell you this

260
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,320
is what you're supposed to do here and

261
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,160
tell you when you do something wrong

262
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,269
yeah it's actually the command line

263
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:01,920
that's doing it so you if you were

264
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,810
writing a command you wouldn't have to

265
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,880
write all that stuff that you just write

266
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,529
some documentation and then you

267
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:08,370
automatically get all those

268
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,570
functionalities that's kind of baked

269
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:14,940
into the command line one of the things

270
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,800
commands can do also is they can provide

271
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,589
they provide a default key binding so

272
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:22,560
like I mentioned pressing up to go up if

273
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,600
you're VI user you might be used to

274
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,930
pressing a different key to go up so we

275
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,310
have key mappings key mappings can be

276
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,470
provided by plugins so here's an example

277
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,699
where it's kind of going up and going

278
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:34,680
down by pressing J's and KS then I

279
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,839
pressed i started typing to insert for

280
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,940
us escape to get back into into normal

281
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,820
mode so I'm moving back and forth so

282
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,949
we've got key mapping plugins and you

283
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:45,930
can also use individual users can change

284
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,060
their key mappings so you can say no you

285
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,339
know what I really want I really want

286
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,040
the pound sign to be go up because I'm

287
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,610
masochistic okay so but an individual

288
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,470
user has that power to sit to remap the

289
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:04,140
keys however they want behaves well for

290
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,449
code Bespin actually is I don't think

291
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:07,470
we're quite to the level of the desktop

292
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,540
editors yet but you know we at least get

293
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,220
the indentation levels right like you

294
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,779
know it stays the indentation level

295
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,450
these are spaces not tabs and

296
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,950
I hit backspace it'll actually really

297
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,250
really erase all four spaces this is it

298
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,720
we've got all the infrastructure there

299
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,220
so at this point it's just a matter of

300
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,050
adding a lot of the little behaviors

301
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,150
like when I hit the brace there it

302
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,590
didn't automatically indent me that'll

303
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,720
be like the next step that you get a lot

304
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,400
of editors we can turn off right yes

305
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,450
well yeah that's that's the other thing

306
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,190
we want to be configurable and you know

307
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,020
give the power to the user as much as

308
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,890
possible so sometimes you can help yeah

309
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:48,920
absolutely true you know yeah sure sorry

310
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,630
it's probably not question time continue

311
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:55,340
please okay all right okay all right

312
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,480
sure ok so the lots more aspect you know

313
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,590
been working hard on the infrastructure

314
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,380
side of this and the lots more is going

315
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,880
to come this year we're actually now

316
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,510
that we've got a lot of the

317
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,920
infrastructure out of the way we're

318
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,000
adding all kinds of cool features this

319
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,560
year mercurial and subversion support

320
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,690
we've already got there's actually so we

321
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,400
went through this reboot were majorly

322
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,820
refactored best been around plugins and

323
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,590
we're just coming out of that so there's

324
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,400
some features we actually need to

325
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,010
portforward version control system

326
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,690
support is already there yes get support

327
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,940
will come one of these days is on his

328
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,060
like you just have to schedule it in

329
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,680
collaboration like i mentioned we're in

330
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,760
the process of getting that feature

331
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,950
going it's largely working but there's

332
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:38,090
some more work to finish it off SFTP

333
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,170
deployment this one of those features

334
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,360
where you can use Bespin in the cloud

335
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,040
and then deploy your website to another

336
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,620
server vs ftp that's a feature that we

337
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,180
that we had and just need to portforward

338
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,400
from our code base and that's actually

339
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,710
largely a server feature so that's

340
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,710
probably be coming soon so expect a lot

341
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,720
more features this year especially as

342
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,040
others two people start writing plugins

343
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,510
that's a great thing to about a plug-in

344
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,080
system so now I'll hand over the mic to

345
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,590
Patrick so I'll just be talking about

346
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,660
some of the internals of best bin this

347
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,100
is not going to be extremely technical

348
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,350
but it's just to kind of piqued your

349
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:23,130
interest so as Kevin mentions

350
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,710
no that wasn't what I wanted it to do

351
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,440
that is interesting keno quit

352
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:47,030
unexpectedly nice Apple anyway so what

353
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,140
that slider was going to say is that

354
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,490
that we have lots and lots of plugins

355
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,610
and as kevin was saying the entire

356
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,490
editor is based around plugins and here

357
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,110
are some of the here are some of the

358
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,270
ones that we support so these are bunch

359
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,490
plugins that come with it and they're

360
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,710
even more that are in the labs

361
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:09,440
experimental sort of category and the

362
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,210
the cool thing about this is that not

363
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,770
only can you write your own plugins so

364
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,510
you know if you really don't like our

365
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,840
theme and you want a different one or if

366
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,980
you want to not if you don't want to use

367
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,500
the standard syntax and you want to say

368
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,510
load textmate bundles for the syntax

369
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,690
highlighting then you could do that too

370
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,580
so so you can swap these out but they're

371
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,470
also totally reloadable while the editor

372
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,140
is running so you can you can hack on

373
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,390
your plugin and then reload and even if

374
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,620
it's one of these core ones it'll just

375
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,750
reload the appropriate parts we have I

376
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,560
have some things where I've been editing

377
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,930
the overall app controller and it'll

378
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,580
just reload the whole thing so it reload

379
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,770
so it's pretty smart about reloading

380
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:56,390
things so this is how the text editor

381
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,580
itself works this is a really familiar

382
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,230
diagram if you've ever done any UI

383
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,960
programming at all it's all MVC and it's

384
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,670
especially familiar to you if you've

385
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,710
done cocoa programming so this is

386
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,810
actually pretty much exactly how Coco's

387
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,740
text API works which I we thought was a

388
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,140
pretty good model because first of all

389
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,700
it's like the poster child for MVC and

390
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,040
second of all it's been around since the

391
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,380
80s and hasn't changed much and so

392
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,700
obviously it's it's doing something

393
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,780
right and so i'll just go briefly into

394
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,030
all these into each of these big parts

395
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,510
so the text storage to make the editor

396
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,470
as flexible as possible

397
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,230
the model that it displays is actually

398
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,030
as close to a mutable string as you can

399
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,320
get in JavaScript so it's an array of

400
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,520
lines and when every ends so you can

401
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,990
basically take an editor and hook it up

402
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,210
to anything you want as long as it

403
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,250
follows this this really simple protocol

404
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,800
and then you can just go in and change

405
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,300
any of these lines it'll just show up in

406
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,860
the editor and it can be read only or

407
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,690
read right so the idea is you can use

408
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,480
the editor for not just text editing but

409
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,240
also text viewing you know code code

410
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,460
review tools all sorts of other things

411
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,910
can be used because well because it's

412
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,160
pretty decoupled from from the actual

413
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,500
storage on the file system it also lets

414
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,720
you do different storage api's you could

415
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,520
store in memory you could store on the

416
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,220
file system you can store you know from

417
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,280
the Dom you could all right you could

418
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,710
even store on the local disk there's a

419
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,060
plugin there's actually a fork

420
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,050
investment that someone has created

421
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,500
called Espen that uses the Mozilla

422
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,290
platform and asks for local storage if

423
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,670
you tweak is heading in your about

424
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,380
config you can actually get allow files

425
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,590
to allow web pages to edit your local

426
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,380
files and so despot lets you do that so

427
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,470
that that's a pretty cool fork so the

428
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,170
view is just a text view it is our claim

429
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,790
to fame is canvas and there's also a

430
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,400
hidden textarea behind there now which

431
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,290
was which we still can't get away from

432
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,730
because we need it for internationalized

433
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,040
text input until Dom level three text

434
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,320
input events come around or are actually

435
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,210
supported we've got to have a hidden

436
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:06,510
textarea but on the plus side people in

437
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,950
Europe can actually enter curly braces

438
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,310
now that wasn't true in earlier versions

439
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,720
which made it kind of hard to actually

440
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,170
edit code but yeah so we're using canvas

441
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,610
and why canvas well because of

442
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,920
performance with the Dom it's just

443
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,670
really hard to get the kind of priya lee

444
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,260
good performance because code tends to

445
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,180
be big we want to scale to thousands and

446
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,000
thousands of lines and you can do

447
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,700
incremental rendering in canvas but you

448
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,440
can't make it perform as well when you

449
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,570
have edit with editing and content

450
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,950
editable is one of those things that

451
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,170
they tend to be dark and scary parts of

452
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,350
of browser engines that people haven't

453
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,790
looked at in a long time I know because

454
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,010
I've looked at the Firefox code for this

455
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:51,350
and so for the actual editing canvas is

456
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,380
what we use and not everything is canvas

457
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,920
so our UI is actually mostly Dom but the

458
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,290
actual core editors can is canvas and I

459
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,610
think that's part of the reason we've

460
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,780
been able to have a really good

461
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,209
experience so the browser that we

462
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:08,850
support obviously Firefox that was the

463
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,790
first then Safari came along and added

464
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,560
even though they started canvas they

465
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,990
didn't add text support for canvas for a

466
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,980
while so and Safari and then chrome so

467
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,589
those are the browsers that you can use

468
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:24,530
the browsers that you can't use our

469
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,990
opera right now because they have canvas

470
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,340
before but they don't have text and text

471
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,490
is kind of important for an editor so

472
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,650
can't use it right now but 10.5 is

473
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,510
looking good in that department internet

474
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,150
explorer 6 no canvas supports and you

475
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,880
know frankly I think that's that's made

476
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,070
life easy for us not having to support

477
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,830
that but you know we are open to

478
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,110
supporting internet explorer if they add

479
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,400
canvas and internet explorer 9 hopefully

480
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,620
so we don't have anything against IE we

481
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,630
just want to use the canvas so the

482
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,400
controller part that's fairly straight

483
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,550
it's fairly straightforward we do all of

484
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,290
our layout manually because we are using

485
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,900
canvas and we have a pluggable syntax

486
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,360
highlighting engine that is not only

487
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,700
totally pluggable it's also can run in

488
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,760
the background so you could put things

489
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,470
in a web worker and run J eslint on your

490
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,840
JavaScript for example to do this index

491
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,310
highlighting so it's it's pretty

492
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,370
powerful and here are some of the use

493
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,160
cases we have in mind so you can

494
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,180
obviously replace a text area and when

495
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,070
we first started Bespin we thought most

496
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,940
people would use it here but actually i

497
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,200
would say over half of the interest is

498
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,630
coming from what people wanting to add

499
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,520
besten on to their sites so when we

500
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,950
rebooted it we really wanted to focus on

501
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,580
that embedded providing a good a p.i for

502
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,830
embedded users so you could add it on to

503
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,810
a site like github or sourceforge you

504
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,100
can obviously use the editor on best

505
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,280
friend mozilla labs com and since it's

506
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,630
all open source both the client in the

507
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:00,840
sort

508
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,950
where you can install it on your own

509
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,590
servers you can do custom projects new

510
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,740
intranets or you can package it up

511
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,039
locally so with titanium or zool runner

512
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,640
it actually does run under zool so you

513
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,529
could have so you could do a local

514
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:19,289
package of vestment as well and if

515
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:23,010
you're interested you can check out our

you can check out the editor yourself at

521
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,299
Bespin up mozilla labs com and we'd like

522
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:44,730
to hear your feedback questions a little

523
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:51,659
bit more into sports sure so though

524
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:53,309
that's mean that's a server-side

525
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:55,320
function basically so the best one

526
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,980
server handles that there's a so there's

527
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,500
a there's a couple different ways that

528
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,990
works actually we have a command command

529
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,870
set that the commands are actually VCS

530
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,580
so you can say like VCS update commit

531
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,590
and those actually those commands work

532
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,700
regardless of which version control

533
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,840
system is in use for that particular

534
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,909
project they work the same way whether

535
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:16,649
it's so it's kind of interesting with it

536
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,110
largely takes the distributed look model

537
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,240
so you can commit and I commits locally

538
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,710
and then you can push to get it to the

539
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,470
report remote repository we also

540
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,990
something that hasn't hasn't been ported

541
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,090
forward yet is support for like svn

542
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,500
commands like you just type svn under

543
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,419
the command you're used to from the

544
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:34,950
command line so that that that will come

545
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,789
back sometime soon and then so that's

546
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:40,200
the basic support those commands run on

547
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,669
the server side two runs against files

548
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:43,679
in the project on the server side we

549
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,840
actually basically have files sitting in

550
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,970
a file system for each of the projects

551
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,730
and so it just uses the normal command

552
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,250
the hood yeah when we're editing best

553
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,559
when we actually just are i actually

554
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,720
just sibling the best bin directory into

555
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,700
the server and it just works so it's

556
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:05,490
actually file sitting there help hey

557
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,830
what status on students or bringing that

558
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,559
up to or is it still gonna be written in

559
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,470
JavaScript yes it will be in yeah I'm

560
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,809
hoping you know we we don't yet have it

561
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:17,010
on the actual schedule but I'm hoping

562
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,049
it'll be this year that that'll be a

563
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:20,610
relatively major project I don't play

564
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,830
this year well our desk we're talking a

565
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,210
little bit of that performance of campus

566
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,549
and rendering monster text files India

567
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:31,350
is so do you just repaint portions your

568
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,660
paint one line at a time MSP changes are

569
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,809
ya it's only it's actually pretty

570
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:39,690
optimized well it actually does what

571
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,160
most you I toolkits do so it actually

572
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,620
does not only lines but rectangles so

573
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,600
it'll only rectangle only paper will

574
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,580
rectangle that you're using and that

575
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,890
works for syntax highlighting too so

576
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,540
it'll only syntax highlight the part of

577
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,980
the file that you're actually looking at

578
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,960
and as you scroll down it'll catch up do

579
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,220
you render the whole file that as time

580
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,870
is a huge canvas for really big file or

581
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,059
indirect of it is no it's just a chunk

582
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,820
of it and currently when you scroll rear

583
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,320
enders the entire chunk but since it's

584
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,429
only a few lines that you're looking at

585
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:06,900
that's pretty fast if that's a

586
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,640
performance problem in the in the future

587
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,380
we thought about other solution that we

588
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,760
can do but so far it hasn't been you're

589
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,400
saying ipad support was the number one

590
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,130
yeah it is what's not working what you

591
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,230
have what do you have to do it's

592
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,790
something with text input the invisible

593
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,070
text area is not actually I've had

594
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,270
doesn't get that farther so there's

595
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,590
something out really login screen

596
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,660
apparently like just trying to get the

597
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,480
login form to work isn't working so we I

598
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,400
mean it's you know obviously it's a

599
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,420
two-week-old request so you know we

600
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,460
haven't really had that chance to sort

601
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,170
of prior my lab figure out I got some

602
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,270
other things got it they're well

603
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:49,620
basically we look at for sure a lot of

604
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,640
what I do which the text editor is

605
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,110
pretty much tightly integrated into into

606
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,580
the operating systems file system

607
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,130
structure so like for example opening a

608
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,600
multiple file searching and replacing

609
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,190
across multiple files like all at once

610
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,410
that just it just best if it happens

611
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:11,880
capability well it let me show you I'm

612
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:18,180
gonna um see if i can get this window to

613
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,560
be a size where we could actually see

614
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,110
what's going on can I oh not exactly

615
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:28,620
okay you're not take the mic basically

616
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,080
so the short answer is yes let me right

617
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,160
now right now we actually don't have the

618
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,450
search and replace across files that is

619
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,610
still a feature we need add but we will

620
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,320
because best been already has but it has

621
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,670
a notion of what the files are that are

622
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,430
in your project and already so one of

623
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,230
the things you know prior to vestment

624
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,910
I'm a text mate user so I'm used to

625
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,410
command T so it's like for anybody who

626
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,580
doesn't know command T like let you open

627
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,930
a file by typing a little little teeny

628
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,750
snip at a file named best been already

629
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,550
has that I was going to demo it but it's

630
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,770
gonna be hard to see in here molla

631
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,560
status you can just I maximize it or

632
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,180
pull that up a little bit so that it's

633
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,529
insane

634
00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:05,419
oh yeah maybe is that just the wrong

635
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:06,620
brother that's the wrong window your

636
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:11,899
browsers open yeah well anyway basically

637
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:14,090
if you if you type open space and you

638
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,860
start typing some part of your file name

639
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,570
it actually pops up a little list of the

640
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,100
files that match and you can select one

641
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,870
so it already has an idea of what the

642
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,309
files are that are in your vestment file

643
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:25,190
system what about like yes like putting

644
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:30,350
on 252 Wow side by side not yet but

645
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,669
actually what so one of the things

646
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:33,980
architectural II now best bin is

647
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,090
actually in a much better position to

648
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,340
support like split views and things like

649
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,510
that that architectural II would have

650
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,510
been very difficult before so you know

651
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,559
all these things are features that we

652
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,769
want to have about a coding offline

653
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:47,690
since years in turn to deal with ie can

654
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,299
you use local storage to you know to

655
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:51,860
order your own internet connections that

656
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,990
insane we already use local storage for

657
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,750
settings definitely and we're actually

658
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,250
the next thing that we're going to do on

659
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,019
the file system is to make like mount

660
00:25:00,019 --> 00:25:01,549
points sort of things that you can have

661
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:02,690
multiple files and back ends because

662
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,059
already I projected out that way so if

663
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:07,190
you could it would definitely be

664
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,740
feasible to have like a local mount sort

665
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,840
of thing and the files all of the

666
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,210
positive calls into school against the

667
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,559
SPO light or something you make that

668
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:16,970
work well in there are a number of

669
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,320
different ways to potentially do this

670
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,299
because one is some like imagine a

671
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:22,010
jetpack for example that lets you access

672
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,429
a certain part of your your local disk

673
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:26,419
did you get that best man can talk

674
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:28,880
through so you could mount you can like

675
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,200
a mountain your best man file says you

676
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,269
can up like mount a slash local it talks

677
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:33,860
to a certain certain projects directory

678
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,380
on your local disk through a jetpack so

679
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,669
that'd be one way to do actually be

680
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,260
working with local files and have access

681
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,620
to eat all your horrible local tools but

682
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,760
edition being able to use best fit I

683
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,570
mean there are a whole bunch of

684
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:45,990
different ways that

685
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:50,400
had that direction may our file system

686
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,460
is is objected on the client side so you

687
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,020
know we can plug anything we want in

688
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,760
there do you guys have plans to support

689
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,460
languages that require where are you at

690
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:10,640
the whim of the Kansas I'm sorry oh yeah

691
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,190
we definitely do that now Japanese is a

692
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,020
little tricky because then you lose the

693
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,270
you lose fixed-width in that case

694
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,830
because the characters are different

695
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,470
widths like you know our characters are

696
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:26,550
tall and there's our square so that's

697
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,250
actually been the biggest stumbling

698
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,809
block but actually if you enter japanese

699
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:33,360
text it does work avengers in well yeah

700
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,070
it doesn't render probably but it does

701
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,840
render it actually voters properly once

702
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,679
you take the problem is it doesn't

703
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,450
actually display while you're typing

704
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,480
only when you oh yeah yeah now that

705
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,070
problem is because of the invisible text

706
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,750
area and there isn't a whole lot that we

707
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,140
can do about that one yeah really the

708
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,400
solution for that is going to be dom

709
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,000
three it in text input events I'm which

710
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,410
you can read about to suspect for it

711
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,360
it's just that I did a lot of research

712
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,500
into this and that's that's really why

713
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,120
those exist but no browser has

714
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,630
implemented them yet chrome sort of does

715
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,000
but not but only enough to say there was

716
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,380
a text input event and not tell me what

717
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,230
it was so that so really there's a lot

718
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,190
of work that needs to be done to the

719
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,450
browser department so that you have no

720
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,830
access to for example like move it to

721
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,330
the character it's like for example on

722
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,070
tightly

723
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,590
three kristee one goal like it would be

724
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,240
like there's three like you're actually

725
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,309
I can tab between the characters but

726
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:26,779
like the actual offset it's not right

727
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,399
like you're actually assuming that it's

728
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,799
like a regular yeah we actually measure

729
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,409
the width of a capital M right now um

730
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:35,330
which that is actually gonna have to

731
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,950
change pretty soon because that breaks

732
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,139
down in the face of tabs that are

733
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:40,549
actually tab characters as opposed to

734
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:42,080
spaces so that's probably gonna have to

735
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,019
change pretty soon so be looking for

736
00:27:45,019 --> 00:27:48,769
that but um yeah but as for actual like

737
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:51,409
ime supports that's just really hard due

738
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:53,929
to the platform but i mean fortunately

739
00:27:53,929 --> 00:27:55,370
we're no worse than I mean we're no

740
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,480
worse than text may hear textmate

741
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,500
doesn't even try to support that so

742
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:06,920
which is not you know what excuse but oh

743
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,870
what do you say that you've had supply

744
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:23,850
problems or oh no no it is that Bespin

745
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,250
is just a word that sounds nice it has

746
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,260
no relation to any property of Lucas

747
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:33,210
bahaha oh it's something it's something

748
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,980
I neglected to mention I don't know how

749
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,360
I got away with not mentioning this in

750
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,400
the presentation Bespin plugins are

751
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,170
actually super set of common J's

752
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,390
packages and cabbages packages can be

753
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,390
used investment and we and so if it so

754
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,860
nobody can tell me that you can't use

755
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,940
coming chance modules in the browser

756
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,990
because I can tell you that you can I

757
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:53,130
don't know why you guys for working with

758
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,650
for did that pan out is that that one

759
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,530
must reboot so well most of the reboot

760
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,660
is actually about re architecting and

761
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,490
building around plugins the GUI that you

762
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,690
see here is actually rendered by sprout

763
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:08,940
more okay how have you a 2-cm widget you

764
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,970
need all this crap order the embeddable

765
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,680
widget is currently heavyweight but we

766
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,660
do actually have a goal for this corner

767
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,460
to fix that but it depends what you mean

768
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,430
by heavyweight I mean it is just one CSS

769
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,020
and one Jas that you just copy and paste

770
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,360
it they just have to be big yeah they're

771
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,280
they're big CSS and JS files but they

772
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,040
are just one CSS in one case file um

773
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,520
like seven ok or something yeah the

774
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,220
kirtland is like maybe an 800 k really

775
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,950
large yeah but that's actually something

776
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,320
that it is our our goal for this quarter

777
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,000
we're gonna fix so yeah and actually all

778
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
you have to do is just put a vest bint

779
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,660
at our best in class class some yeah on

780
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,490
any of your divs and then it just turns

781
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:53,190
into a best but so it's actually pretty

782
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,110
lightweight in terms of how much effort

783
00:29:55,110 --> 00:30:00,659
you need to advent best with embedded
