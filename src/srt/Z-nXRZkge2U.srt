00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,500
[Applause]

00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:29,290
[Music]

4
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,790
so what were you doing in 1995 hands up

5
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,620
if you're alive in 1995

6
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,260
okay good hands up you're on the

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,710
internet already okay a few good hands

8
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,180
up if you're getting paid to work on the

9
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,390
internet like commercially No a couple

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,150
of hands okay

11
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,980
1995 this browser Netscape Navigator 2

12
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,080
was released and amongst other things

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,730
did include a little language you might

14
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,590
have heard of called JavaScript now you

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,720
might be thinking why at a conference

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,330
where people are talking about the

17
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,950
future of JavaScript future front-end

18
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,810
development I'm talking about a 20 year

19
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,820
old browser mostly just seemed like a

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,040
fun idea kind of look back and try and

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,140
implement something that we might build

22
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,300
today in the browser in a old browser

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,270
that wasn't really designed for it and

24
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,890
so really just a bit of nostalgia

25
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,899
because I was kind of around for not

26
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:21,840
quite this early but early enough mostly

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,820
though I'm getting old and you kids

28
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,960
these days don't know how good you've

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,820
got it with all the dev tools and

30
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,240
everything you've got access to it my

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,610
journey with JavaScript started my first

32
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,990
job out of university probably about

33
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,340
1999 and commonly we use JavaScript to

34
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,170
implement this kind of navigation you

35
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,610
couldn't do this with CSS at the time

36
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,470
you had to use JavaScript this is

37
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,880
actually one I found on web archive that

38
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,619
I built probably about 2002 or so and so

39
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,020
when I started that first job one of my

40
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,149
co-workers had built this library that

41
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:56,190
could work in all the browser's we have

42
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,420
to support which at the time would have

43
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,750
been like IA 5 ie6 netscape for Netscape

44
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,970
6 or with slightly different ways of

45
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,459
doing dynamic content and so it was

46
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,000
really impressive

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,009
just like how much effort you had to put

48
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,340
in to get that working but all that

49
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,709
still was five years after Netscape

50
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:17,370
Navigator 2 so to understand why we're

51
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,569
going to have limitations when we try

52
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:20,400
and implement modern techniques in this

53
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,740
old browser it's worth looking back at

54
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,290
what this browser what JavaScript was

55
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,110
created for in the first place even

56
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,520
though it's in the name JavaScript has

57
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,849
very little to do with Java was just

58
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:35,730
really Netscape wanted to take advantage

59
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,800
of the popularity of Java at the time

60
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,810
with Java applets and they got a

61
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,580
trademark agreement with Sun to use the

62
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,580
Java name during development javascript

63
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,740
was actually called mocker initially and

64
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,660
then live script in the first navigator

65
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,850
betas before it finally came out as

66
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,200
javascript the Netscape 2 documentation

67
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,540
described JavaScript as a compact object

68
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,070
based scripting language for developing

69
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,770
client and server internet applications

70
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,670
that's what I found interesting I didn't

71
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,170
realize this that server internet

72
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,450
applications were actually something

73
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,730
that was intended for JavaScript from

74
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,280
the beginning so Netscape had something

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,430
called Netscape Enterprise Server and as

76
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,230
part of that there was a component

77
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,670
called livewire which let you write

78
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,130
server-side JavaScript it was more like

79
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,520
PHP than no j-f in that you had a HTML

80
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,230
page with a server tag and in that

81
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,220
server tag you could write the

82
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,840
JavaScript that would be evaluated on

83
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,120
the server to make database calls and

84
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,400
things like that but that kind of died

85
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,900
away with Netscape Enterprise Server and

86
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,090
it wasn't for another whether it is 10

87
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,760
15 years until back in JavaScript became

88
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,390
a thing again mostly what javascript was

89
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,350
used for was performed elevation as now

90
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,010
back then Network round trips were

91
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:53,220
expensive potentially and so anytime you

92
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,450
could save the user by telling them

93
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,860
they'd fill in the form incorrectly

94
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,360
was very helpful and so at the time

95
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,680
though you couldn't do any nice

96
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,480
client-side stuff you basically had to

97
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,280
pop up an alert to tell them what they'd

98
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,300
filled in so I didn't want to just do

99
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,910
something aim for something simple so I

100
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,100
wanted to set myself a goal to try and

101
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,769
build something in Netscape 2 that I

102
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:19,530
knew was going to be challenging and so

103
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,199
I decided to choose to do MVC mainly

104
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,180
because to-do lists are familiar for

105
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,370
everyone for those not familiar with to

106
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,710
do MVC it's coming out near project

107
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,500
started by a teaser just spoke and it's

108
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,720
basically a repository of to do MVC

109
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,090
basis to do lists implemented in various

110
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,850
frameworks I knew I wasn't going to be

111
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,319
able to get it to look like this or I

112
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,930
wasn't even sure how how I was going to

113
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,960
be able to get in terms of functionality

114
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,140
but I gave it a shot anyway

115
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,780
so I faced some early challenges before

116
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,890
I even started working on the to-do list

117
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,480
first of all I have basically so I got

118
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,580
my virtual machine setup I got Netscape

119
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,850
running and one thing I couldn't do one

120
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,260
thing I want to do was just try and load

121
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,360
a script show an alert box just to make

122
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,370
sure everything was working and so I had

123
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,570
a web server running on the host machine

124
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,210
which is how I could still develop on my

125
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,830
Mac and just load pages on Windows and

126
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,790
so the life of me I just couldn't get it

127
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,090
to load like it would the script wasn't

128
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,740
loading looking my web server logs there

129
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,600
was no request for the script and I

130
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,280
wasn't sure was going on eventually

131
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,990
somewhere in the documentation I found

132
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,960
that the source attribute wasn't

133
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,490
actually supported for the script tag in

134
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,430
Netscape to ASCII all scripting had to

135
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,800
be in line

136
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,320
the next challenge was going to be that

137
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,060
that there was no Dom API there was no

138
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,270
way to rewrite elements that were on the

139
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,310
page or even access most elements on the

140
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,880
page basically Netscape like most

141
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,280
browsers would render the page you could

142
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,020
have script tags on the page while it

143
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,670
was rendering and write out dynamic

144
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,680
content but once the page was finished

145
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,480
if you say as a result of an event

146
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,060
handler or a set timeout you did another

147
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,360
document right then it would clear out

148
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,770
what was on the page and start a new

149
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,250
page

150
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,200
I just want to cheat by just having my

151
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,030
whole dynamic app being a document dot

152
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,760
write I didn't think that'd be fair so

153
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,290
before I talk about how I actually

154
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,880
implemented what I did let's just have a

155
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,610
look at how far I go so this is to do

156
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,930
MVC running in Netscape 2 so dynamic so

157
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,730
you can actually check and uncheck items

158
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,160
and the content updates you can add new

159
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,770
items I need to relax after this

160
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,690
filtering works you can clear the

161
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,140
completed items yeah so the basics are

162
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,720
there that's like that

163
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,790
so let's rather than just showing this

164
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,050
let's talk about how it was actually

165
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,840
implemented the key to all this was

166
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,540
frame sets for those not familiar with

167
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,980
frame sets and you may not be if you

168
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,330
haven't been doing web development for a

169
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,610
long time because it's now a deprecated

170
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,160
feature frame sets you can basically

171
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,720
instead of a body tag on a page you can

172
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,520
have a frame set

173
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,830
and in there you can define frames of

174
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,060
content to be loaded from different

175
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,979
sources it's essentially what evolved

176
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:08,979
into iframes eventually and along with

177
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:10,509
that you can net frame sets and you

178
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:12,130
could lay them out using these row and

179
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,440
column attributes so it was kind of like

180
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,449
the early days of CSS grid if you want

181
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:21,009
to think about it that way and so frame

182
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:22,210
sets were the key because I was working

183
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,910
at the Netscape to dock so this is the

184
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,860
documentation that Netscape provided for

185
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,490
JavaScript and it was used to frame set

186
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,960
so the navigation was on the left and

187
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,639
then the content was on the right but

188
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,960
one thing they had was down the bottom

189
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,370
these height content buttons when you

190
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,990
hit that button it would hide and show

191
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,789
it and that was dynamic and I thinking

192
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:41,169
how they do that and looking at the

193
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,419
source for that was what inspired my

194
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:47,919
solution so I built what's called a

195
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,160
pseudo dynamic app basically you have a

196
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,320
frame set and the state lives in the

197
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,120
frame set itself so in the script tag

198
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,789
you set up some JavaScript state then

199
00:07:57,789 --> 00:07:59,229
they have two frames and the reason for

200
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,490
this another one of those things that

201
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,259
took me a while to work out was that you

202
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:03,789
need at least two frames otherwise a

203
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:07,090
frame set won't render at all and so the

204
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,580
content frame is the dynamic part it's

205
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,310
written out using a combination of

206
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,610
static HTML and document rights so to

207
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,800
have a quick look at that she got the

208
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,180
state and then you've got document dot

209
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,400
write tags that access the state from

210
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,380
the parent frame and then you've got say

211
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,449
a button and if you want to update

212
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:27,370
something in the state then you have an

213
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,289
event handler that calls a function in

214
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:31,960
the parent frame set now the key to it

215
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,329
is this this is effectively the

216
00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:36,789
equivalent of document reload which

217
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,209
didn't exist and so basically we're

218
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:41,469
telling the content frame to reload

219
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:43,419
itself and when it reloads itself it'll

220
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:46,420
read the current state and so that's how

221
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,610
the application works now when you think

222
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,209
about it you've got the state the state

223
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:54,399
gets reflected by the view and any

224
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,020
actions that happen on the view get fed

225
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,520
back into the state so essentially what

226
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,170
we've done is implemented the flux model

227
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,320
for Netscape to

228
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,429
[Applause]

229
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:08,269
but apart from just the challenge of how

230
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:10,249
to actually set up the architecture for

231
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:13,759
this there was some just challenges in

232
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,499
terms of limitations in the language and

233
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:17,119
limitations in the dev environment that

234
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:20,029
I want to take you through so studies

235
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:21,529
was error handling when a JavaScript

236
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:23,480
error occurred you'll just get this

237
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,999
modal pop-up you couldn't click outside

238
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,609
it was useful I could told you what line

239
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,139
the error was on told you what the error

240
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:32,600
was conveniently they used a lot of

241
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,429
keyword reserves a lot of keywords from

242
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:37,609
C and Java so const was already reserved

243
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:40,509
back in 1995 which is convenient now and

244
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:42,919
yeah when you dismissed it if there was

245
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,749
another error then you would get the

246
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:46,549
next error would pop up and so for

247
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:49,100
example if you visit google.com in

248
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,799
Netscape 2 you get this whole bunch of

249
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,949
errors from their analytics code and you

250
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:56,359
basic after you can't really tell from

251
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:57,859
the framerate of the gift but I'm

252
00:09:57,859 --> 00:09:59,540
basically just missing dialogue after

253
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,759
dialogue after dialogue just to be able

254
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,749
to see the page underneath so these days

255
00:10:05,749 --> 00:10:09,559
when we develop we're used to writing to

256
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,299
the console like we just want to quickly

257
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:12,889
output a state of a variable at a

258
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:13,970
particular point in time we use the

259
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,389
console Netscape didn't have a console

260
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:18,919
there was a Java console for Java

261
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,660
applets - right - but there was no

262
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,089
JavaScript console so basically instead

263
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,410
we would use alerts you'd basically

264
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,419
pop-up alert and with the contents of

265
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:30,649
your variable at a particular point in

266
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:32,959
time and sometimes this was the only way

267
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,269
to debug something in case of event

268
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:37,519
handlers there was some event handlers

269
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,730
that some event handlers would just fail

270
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,139
silently they wouldn't even pop up the

271
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:43,819
standard error dialog so you had to

272
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:45,529
basically put an alert after every line

273
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:48,619
of your event handler and try and work

274
00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:50,629
out which one fired last and from there

275
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:52,759
work out what the actual error was at

276
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,899
least you knew which line it was on

277
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:59,149
probably the other thing we're used to

278
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:01,189
when developing applications these days

279
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:03,410
is being able to use like the elements

280
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,259
panel in dev tools and C or the elements

281
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:08,239
on the page what current state they're

282
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:10,759
in but all you had was view source in

283
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,769
there - gate - and it wasn't even view

284
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:13,790
source

285
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,890
of a frame you can only view the source

286
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,510
of the page itself which wasn't very

287
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,340
useful when all the page contained was a

288
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,320
frame set and so a common technique a

289
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,810
common technique when building dynamic

290
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,940
content with document rate would be to

291
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,670
put the string in a variable first alert

292
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,730
that and you have to manually inspect to

293
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,410
see where you've missed a bracket or

294
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,670
quote or something that was causing it

295
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,010
to render incorrectly and potentially

296
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,690
you would if it was a big string I

297
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,600
remember times copying the contents of

298
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,810
the alert and pasting it into a document

299
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,280
where I could use like HTML tidy or

300
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,550
something to try and format the HTML to

301
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,190
see where I'd missed miss some bit of

302
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:59,480
HTML next challenges were around the

303
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,520
language itself so there's no short

304
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,860
object shorthand so it meant creating a

305
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,460
state a nested state took a lot of

306
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,130
verbosity and the other thing you might

307
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,080
notice there is that my two dues aren't

308
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,870
an array they're an object and it looks

309
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,880
like an array like it's numerically

310
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,890
indexed and goal length but the reason

311
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,300
for that was JavaScript one didn't even

312
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,760
actually contain an array data type it

313
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,140
didn't actually come until JavaScript

314
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,840
1.1 which was like nine months after

315
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,810
Netscape to the documentation mentioned

316
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,970
this had said just use objects they're

317
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,210
similar enough to arrays basically and

318
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,040
provide like a little helper function

319
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,100
for creating an array from like a set of

320
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,020
arguments there was no the only way you

321
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,850
could declare a function was globally so

322
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,230
you couldn't declare a function inside a

323
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,270
function you can declare an anonymous

324
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,490
function you couldn't have a function as

325
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,830
a result of an event a callback for like

326
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,110
a set timeout so that was pretty

327
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,800
limiting one workaround for for example

328
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,050
to set timeouts and things like that was

329
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,720
you'd use the eval syntax of set timeout

330
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,460
with IP Goodpaster string and that

331
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,740
string would be eval after the timeout

332
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:16,400
had expired the object model in Netscape

333
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,500
2 was also very limited as I mentioned

334
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,510
Netscape was really designed for form

335
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,480
validation was just so javascript was

336
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,980
intended mainly to perform validation

337
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,020
and smaller things like that so it's

338
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,250
reflected in the object model you

339
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,990
basically attacked as access to forms

340
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,180
and within those forms just the various

341
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,130
elements there was no arbitrary access

342
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:42,330
to any element on the page

343
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,660
similarly the event model was quite

344
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,200
limited

345
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,310
there was no add eventlistener you

346
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,190
couldn't programmatically add event that

347
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,690
was still five years away and I guess

348
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,420
with inline scripting it wasn't much

349
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,040
benefit to being able added

350
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,960
programmatically and the event handlers

351
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,380
themselves were limited so for example

352
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,610
now where you might expect a mouse-over

353
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:05,240
to work on any element that have a size

354
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,300
and is visible in Netscape 2 it would

355
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,890
only work for an anchor but it wouldn't

356
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,720
work for an image for example anybody

357
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,190
had to just look at the docks to see

358
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,960
what elements events were supported

359
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,720
where obviously the last challenge with

360
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,330
styling so I had to use tables for

361
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,400
layout although that really didn't go

362
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,520
away for at least another 10-15 years if

363
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,780
you've had to work on email templates

364
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,790
you may have even written a table last

365
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:37,370
week for layout and colors were fairly

366
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,920
limited so you could set basically you

367
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,210
could set the background color of the

368
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,830
body but you couldn't even set the

369
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,480
background color of a table or a table

370
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,640
cell which is why the layout of that

371
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,290
to-do list was just all white pretty

372
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:53,300
much so basically the or you had access

373
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,220
to so in terms of styling was the font

374
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,080
tag and font tag you could set the size

375
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,470
and the color of the text and again it

376
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,350
was limited in that the size wasn't a

377
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,200
pixel size it was basically a fixed

378
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,940
number like 1 to 7 you could set it to

379
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,130
and that was basically decided by the

380
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,260
browser what those seven sizes were you

381
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,640
can also use relative sizes so

382
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,220
plus/minus based on the size of the

383
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,210
containing element they might notice I

384
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,620
said there you could set the font size

385
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,660
and font color one thing you couldn't

386
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,880
set is the font face so the font face

387
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,530
attribute wasn't actually part of the

388
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,830
HTML 3.2 spec even so Netscape didn't

389
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,850
let you actually change the font the

390
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:32,840
only reason you're not looking at Times

391
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,980
New Roman right now is because I've just

392
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,600
changed the default browser font to

393
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,930
something that's a bit more pleasant

394
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,000
and so yeah the face attribute was

395
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,860
something that Microsoft actually added

396
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,810
as a custom attribute initially in their

397
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,529
browser so powerful note there was a

398
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,700
couple little quirks I just want I

399
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,690
wanted to show you was like a little

400
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,190
memory corruption issue I ran into if

401
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,779
you really rapidly click on those items

402
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:55,029
you suddenly get memory leaks from

403
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:58,120
outside of your page like the URL or

404
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,730
sometimes HTTP header or something so

405
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,920
that was fun and at one point I think I

406
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,480
had something where if I didn't force

407
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,940
the encoding to utf-8 I would just get

408
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,380
like weirdness with the font but that

409
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,290
may have just been a VirtualBox issue so

410
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,080
we've kind of taken Netscape to as far

411
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,420
as we can take it I want to kind of move

412
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,160
forward at least a little bit in time to

413
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,190
a browser that was supposed to support

414
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,220
building dynamic applications that

415
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,370
browser wasn't Netscape 3 Netscape 3

416
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,380
came out pretty quickly after Netscape 2

417
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,420
had some JavaScript improvements like

418
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,270
arrays but it didn't have any Dinah I

419
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,650
had the same programming model for

420
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:38,380
dynamic content so instead let's move on

421
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:44,230
to next cake fall so Netscape 4 was the

422
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,060
first netscape browser to support what

423
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,300
was called at the time dynamic HTML did

424
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,620
anyone own a copy of this book at any

425
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,830
point in time there's a few I didn't

426
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:54,850
know in the third edition but I looked

427
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,290
back at my Amazon purchase history and

428
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,730
this is like one of the first books live

429
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,130
aboard in like 99 when I started working

430
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:04,179
and the way Netscape implemented dynamic

431
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:10,630
HTML was through the use of pelea tag so

432
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,809
layers were an element that you could

433
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:17,380
reposition you could modify its content

434
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,559
you could resize it so finally you could

435
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,500
sort of build some dynamic dynamic

436
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,880
content on your page without jumping

437
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,540
through in theory too many hoops so

438
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,309
let's have a look what the to-do list

439
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:32,200
apart from just with layers and with all

440
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,370
the other features in there care for

441
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,950
what it looks like so you have a looking

442
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,929
a little bit nicer we've got different

443
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:39,610
background colors leaves with a little

444
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,890
key line in between items source tool

445
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,070
tables for layout mostly but it is using

446
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,020
layers as well so we can still add an

447
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,190
item

448
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,049
yeah all that work so I'm not going to

449
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:53,570
go through all this part again so let's

450
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,340
talk about how the implementation in

451
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,960
Netscape 4 differed from what I did in

452
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,760
that scape 2 so now instead of using

453
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,350
frame sets we're using layers to

454
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,520
implement this now something that's not

455
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,309
reflected in these slides was that I

456
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:08,179
built like a little component

457
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:10,700
abstraction around the layers so I could

458
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,620
have essentially like the application

459
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,860
was an object and had child objects for

460
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,660
the different components or that knew

461
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,010
about their layer and could re render

462
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,890
their own layer in terms of the data

463
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,530
model it still looked pretty similar in

464
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,110
terms of the state they maintained in

465
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,080
the parent and the children being able

466
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,840
to re render themselves so you can see

467
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,440
their layers basically they implement

468
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,179
their own document each layer is its own

469
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:39,919
HTML document so your three years

470
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,230
document right to update a layer and you

471
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,820
still face the same restrictions in that

472
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,650
as soon as you start writing to it it

473
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:51,060
resets the content that's already there

474
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,990
but because these smaller components it

475
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:57,110
means probably not as bad that you've

476
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,659
got basically fast HTML in strings

477
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:02,030
everywhere and so I've kind of used like

478
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,429
a again to use the analogy like a

479
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:07,070
reactive type model where when I want to

480
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,780
update I just basically told all the

481
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,460
childhood components to update with the

482
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,960
current state and they you had a

483
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,059
rerender themselves so what challenges

484
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:22,490
whether when building for Netscape 4 so

485
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,020
first we already talked about briefly

486
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,549
about what the challenges were with

487
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:26,900
layers now the big thing about layers

488
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,510
was they're always absolutely positioned

489
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,669
so you couldn't have a layer inside

490
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:35,720
another element you could have a layer

491
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,429
inside a layer that you couldn't have a

492
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:39,110
layer like within the layer of an

493
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,940
existing page so for example that

494
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,200
example I gave before with the

495
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,500
navigation menu in your normal HTML

496
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,240
layer you just leave a gap and then you

497
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,850
would absolutely position the layers to

498
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,669
fit in there the challenge with that was

499
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:54,260
that for example for a to-do list which

500
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,690
is dynamically size depending on the

501
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,340
number of items you need to have a way

502
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,890
for those components to be able to say

503
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,160
how tall they are based on

504
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,750
number items they've got said if you

505
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,650
want a position like the footer

506
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,450
underneath for example and obviously

507
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,480
debugging is difficult as I mentioned

508
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,760
before there's no elements panel student

509
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,040
existed in Netscape four and so it meant

510
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,410
if say a layer disappeared off-screen

511
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:23,220
you have no way of telling why you

512
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,140
couldn't tell if it was because you'd

513
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,210
set the exposition incorrectly or

514
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,890
whether you'd hidden it inadvertently or

515
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,680
some other some other bug so again it

516
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,680
was a lot of manual alerts and waiting

517
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,560
for errors and things like that

518
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:43,350
the layer API kind of looked like forms

519
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,420
before so we still couldn't just

520
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,920
arbitrary get any elements you can only

521
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:51,360
get layers by name or by ID and once you

522
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,800
had access to a layer you can access

523
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,800
this document to which document property

524
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:00,570
you could set the attribute sub layers

525
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,170
are kind of like almost like CSS styling

526
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,940
type properties and also have these

527
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,260
convenience functions for things like

528
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,050
relative positioning relative sizing

529
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:12,960
which could be useful at times and if

530
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,400
you really want to go crazy and you had

531
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,250
nested layers then you could access them

532
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,280
like this probably not recommended

533
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,810
though and one thing I wanted to point

534
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,490
out there was for visibility it was

535
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,580
actually wasn't a boolean it was three

536
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,410
states so you can have hide show and

537
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:33,220
inherit I think was the other one

538
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,570
debugging in Netscape 4 wasn't much

539
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,250
easier but it was a little bit easier no

540
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,440
longer did you get a modal alert that

541
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,960
would block what the page you would

542
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,250
instead get told there was a JavaScript

543
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,350
error and p-type JavaScript colon have

544
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,660
suggested there you'll get the

545
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,180
JavaScript console now this wasn't the

546
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,280
console as we used to today it was

547
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,380
fairly limited but it would show you all

548
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,760
the errors that had occurred not just

549
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,470
the first one that probably a bad

550
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,360
example but if you had like a set

551
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,010
timeout or set interval that was firing

552
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,540
every 100 milliseconds and throwing an

553
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,400
error it would eventually tell you that

554
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,570
there was too many errors and that would

555
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,460
stop processing them though this

556
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,350
JavaScript type in that you typ in an

557
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,080
evaluate arbitrary JavaScript but there

558
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,130
was limits to what it could do as well

559
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,410
you typed in window or you got was

560
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,580
object window there was no way to

561
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,650
inspect the properties of an object

562
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,210
unless you knew what they were in

563
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,410
advance if you typed in window location

564
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,120
then you would get the location of the

565
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,950
JavaScript console not the page you

566
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,780
opened it from which wasn't necessarily

567
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:36,330
very helpful and so lastly styling in

568
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,910
Netscape 4 was a little bit better and

569
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,290
it was the first Netscape version to

570
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,720
implement CSS but it wasn't really CSS

571
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,070
had a lot of issues

572
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,760
what made it was CSS basically the

573
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,230
history of that is Netscape had

574
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,850
originally been working towards

575
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,350
implementing JavaScript style sheets and

576
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,910
I think there's a talk on JavaScript

577
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,990
style sheets later on this conference

578
00:22:54,990 --> 00:23:00,030
and and they were hoping javascript

579
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,020
associates what was going to be

580
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,180
standardized but in CSS got standardized

581
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,770
and they have to have scrambled to

582
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,750
provide the implementation of CSS in

583
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,880
Netscape 4 and so it shows with the kind

584
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,120
of bugs that that occur this wasn't

585
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,590
necessarily a bug but a limitation at

586
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,650
the time was only one class name third

587
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,140
class attribute so you couldn't compose

588
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,840
classes which meant that there was a lot

589
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,310
of repetition of styles if you wanted to

590
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,190
have different variants of a class

591
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,450
inheritance was buggy or missing at

592
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,190
times if you set the color of the body

593
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:32,670
text if you create as a table then in

594
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,020
the table the color would be reset again

595
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,150
so a lot of duplication and the fonts as

596
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:36,890
well

597
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,570
lastly the styles were just buggy in

598
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,850
general like padding on that last list

599
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,680
item and it's added the padding to the

600
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,910
body but it hasn't actually

601
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:50,700
resented ver bullet so just to wrap up

602
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,550
what have we learnt nothing you can

603
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,470
probably apply to your day job but

604
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,510
hopefully what you've gotten out of this

605
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:01,650
is an appreciation for just how

606
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,810
difficult it was to work with these

607
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,050
early browsers basically that there was

608
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:10,770
a lot of challenges involved and so if

609
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,850
you're around in the early days of the

610
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,980
web and you saw some cool websites you

611
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,150
can hopefully have an appreciation of

612
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,380
just how much work would have gone into

613
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,250
making those work right and just in

614
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,399
general I really want to personally and

615
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:24,869
hopefully from everyone here thankful

616
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:26,759
the people that work on developer tools

617
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:31,019
probably a few of them in this room it's

618
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:33,269
really awesome the tools we have today

619
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:35,009
and it just makes it so much easier to

620
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:39,869
work with the web so with that this one

621
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:50,990
is done and thank you
