lot of really cool stuff happening in

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,940
JavaScript and the magic internet land

9
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,710
lately and really couldn't figure out

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,180
just one thing to talk about so we

11
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,199

00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:46,850
seven yeah so like if you get bored just

00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,309
wait like five minutes so first we're

14
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:51,620
going to talk about education so I'm

15
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,360
Nick I wanted to find a picture for us

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,949
to all get to know each other a little

17
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:56,809
better that's really I was at the

18
00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:00,670
dentist recently so these are my teeth

19
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:06,229
um my name is Edward apparently this is

20
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:08,840
me I swear this is not photoshopped the

21
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,180
other guy is another guy teach with so

22
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,560
we both work at Shopify which is a

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,020
really cool ecommerce and Jess and rails

24
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,780
company right and we decided that we

25
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,600
wanted to do more teaching I've had a

26
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,049
big big background in like rails

27
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:26,119
developments ruby stuff than i did some

28
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,640
developer advocacy and then I went to

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,009
Toby the Shopify CEO and I was like hey

30
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:32,810
I would really love to do more teaching

31
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,299
and he's like no problem we just struck

32
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:37,399
a deal with these guys called hacker you

33
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:40,909
and they're like a beginning hacker

34
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:45,079
school and we got to use our lounge to

35
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,149
teach the school in so this is about

36
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:51,109
like 30-something students not all of

37
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:53,600
them here but this is a picture of

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,579
Shopify lounge the students came from

39
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:58,039
across the world it was awesome in order

40
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,139
to do this thing I needed a co-pilot so

41
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:03,079
I like loop Nick into this was kind of

42
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,819
voluntold that I would be teaching

43
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:06,799
JavaScript and I kind of thought that it

44
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,690
would be like oh yeah one day JavaScript

45
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,150
course it was not you know as a whole

46
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,069
time nine eight weeks course where we

47
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:15,980
just like info dumped everything we know

48
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,930
about full stack web development into

49
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,970
these students I did not find this out

50
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,349
into about three weeks into the program

51
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,290
but is fantastic we decided to take a

52
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,610
different approach than a lot of other

53
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,819
boot camps we wanted to you instead of

54
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:30,800
like being a super pressured stress

55
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,170
environment it was learn at your own

56
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,110
pace you've got nine weeks and what's

57
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,270
also cool about this scenario is that

58
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,220
room is full of like professional

59
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,080
Shopify developers during the day and

60
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,760
designers and all the people who work at

61
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,130
Shopify so it meant that if you were

62
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,630
interested you can hang out and like

63
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,040
talk to people about what their lives

64
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,780
are like you know like things beyond

65
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,540
just the technical portion this really

66
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,130
worked out for us yeah it was an awesome

67
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,290
program and we learned a lot of really

68
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,300
cool stuff it's the first thing we learn

69
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,460
or the first thing we want to say is if

70
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,440
you're thinking about teaching anything

71
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,510
or even if you're not you just do it

72
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,000
anyways everybody ends up learning

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,010
something from it it's not just the

74
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,420
students it's the people around the

75
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,950
students it's the teachers and the

76
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,110
people who are connected to the students

77
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,820
lives it's awesome next slide right we

78
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,560
also discovered that the teachable

79
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,470
moments happen in those environments

80
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,690
where you let them happen just like

81
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,940
talking to somebody about how to do

82
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,860
something is not such a great way to

83
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,320
teach it's really like I'm going to

84
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,930
prepare a space in a time and a

85
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,780
comfortable place for you to like figure

86
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,760
out what questions you need to ask me

87
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,930
and which questions you need to ask

88
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,420
yourself in order to like index and

89
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,830
unlock some stuff in your own head

90
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,720
basically we started off the class by

91
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,220
basically giving the students a textbook

92
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,470
and saying here let's go through this

93
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,209
together and ask us questions when I

94
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:54,860
have them I was like I learned from a

95
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,870
textbook this is the best way and then

96
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,130
like seventy-five percent of the

97
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,780
students were like this is it did

98
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,920
work for twenty-five percent of the

99
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,540
students yeah that's like the important

100
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,680
lesson is that everybody learns

101
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,150
differently and what works for one

102
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,340
student won't work for for others to

103
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,570
write and like the whole like some

104
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,430
people learn visually some people learn

105
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,090
orally whatever also not really the case

106
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,020
people switch modes like everybody same

107
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,750
day yeah so we had some students who

108
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,250
were like I don't understand anything

109
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,900
but the moment you sit down with them

110
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,580
and you like draw a picture for them

111
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,410
about like this is what happens when a

112
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,030
request comes in and it goes through the

113
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,160
stack you like see lights turning on its

114
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,540
the best possible feeling you can have

115
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,150
so whatever interaction may be whether

116
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,530
it's sitting down with them answering

117
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,680
questions drawing pictures or building

118
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,450
apps together like that's when students

119
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,400
are going to learn the best right so we

120
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,410
decided to like not just do full

121
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,729
lectures this was something that we

122
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:48,830
figured out later on we lectured for

123
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,140
like 5-10 minutes would be stopped class

124
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:51,889
and then we

125
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:54,460
little workshops for like 15 minutes so

126
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,840
again like if you were bored you just

127
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,819
had to wait 10 minutes and you get

128
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:00,289
something totally different and during

129
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:01,999
these workshops it's not just like one

130
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:04,039
person working by themselves we really

131
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:06,349
encourage them to pair program and talk

132
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:08,300
to each other and get better at like the

133
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,219
non technical stuff like how do you give

134
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:12,349
feedback how do you take feedback how do

135
00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:15,590
you work together on a team exactly that

136
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,909
kind of stuff so while they were working

137
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:19,009
on their own basically that gave that

138
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:20,389
freed us off to be able to walk around

139
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:22,669
answer questions help students out with

140
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:24,169
whatever they need it but the problem

141
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:27,139
that we ended up having was our time was

142
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:30,710
being to monopolize by single question

143
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,080
yeah there's only two of us asking and

144
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,090
answering questions from like 30 people

145
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,909
so instead of one of our students decide

146
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:39,259
to make a solution to the problem like

147
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:41,840
this was his first rails app awesome I

148
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,240
learned how to build this in class saw

149
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,839
problem in class that it was too hard to

150
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:49,279
get questions answered so he built

151
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,009
hacker q get it like heck are you but

152
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:54,169
with the Q rhymes like okay yeah right

153
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:57,110
so um what was amazing about this was

154
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,180
this was not something that we asked for

155
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,039
this is a student who was like this is a

156
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,539
problem in my own life I'm going to use

157
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:03,949
the things that you just taught me to

158
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:06,339
build out a better solution super cool

159
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:08,360
this is what you want to have happen

160
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,370
when you're a teacher it's really nice

161
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,289
it uses web sockets so people can make

162
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,779
submit questions pseudo anonymously we

163
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,580
see them immediately can login as

164
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,740
instructors or mentors answer the

165
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,089
question students can answer each

166
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:21,949
other's questions that reduced our

167
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:25,669
workload as well but like have any of

168
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:27,500
you ever taught and done something like

169
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,550
this like who here has a problem with

170
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,020
what we're doing right now is everybody

171
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,149
comfortable is this okay everyone

172
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:37,909
understands it's the worst it is so

173
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,620
crappy like basically you ask that

174
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,659
question do you guys understand is are

175
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:43,250
we good can we keep going and all you

176
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,849
see is yeah yeah like how many times

177
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:49,219
have you ever seen someone go like yes I

178
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:51,620
do actually have a problem could you

179
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,419
stop the class for a moment and like

180
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:55,009
tell me more never have happened

181
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:57,710
everyone is like either uncomfortable

182
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,719
they just say nothing or they nod their

183
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,129
head because they're like I don't want

184
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,240
to be that person that holds up the

185
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,580
class so

186
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,129
I may have flipped out in one class and

187
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:09,470
may be called people some terrible liars

188
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,900
I don't feel good about it but while I

189
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,669
was apologizing to a large group of

190
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:16,580
people some of them took it to heart and

191
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,639
decided to fix that problem with the

192
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,050
stuff that we were teaching them so they

193
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,639
built this thing called curry it has

194
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,870
nothing to do with the fact that one of

195
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,819
the team members is Indian that stuff is

196
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:28,460
delicious so curry is short for

197
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,110
curriculum and basically what it allows

198
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,960
us as teachers to do is go through our

199
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,030
curriculum at our topics for the day put

200
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,009
in different learning objectives and the

201
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:39,199
different topics and first of all this

202
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,969
really helps the students visualize and

203
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:43,039
like get a mental model of everything

204
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,419
that they're going to be learning so we

205
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:46,280
type this in they can see it during the

206
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,569
class they've got an idea of where they

207
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:50,349
are and then whenever we're like hey

208
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:55,009
does anyone feel uncomfortable like can

209
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:57,020
we continue do you understand instead we

210
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,150
just ask them to go to this URL and then

211
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,669
they anonymously hit one of these things

212
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:03,229
for where they are in the curriculum and

213
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:05,389
then we instantly get feedback that

214
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,669
looks like this so this is another

215
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:10,430
WebSocket app I to node server and a

216
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,650
rails back end and basically as a

217
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,389
teacher we can see this analytics view

218
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:16,669
and every time a student submits

219
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:19,340
feedback we immediately get this bar and

220
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,199
we can gauge how well the students are

221
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,270
doing do we need to slow down speed up

222
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,319
where do we need to spend more time

223
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,900
reviewing so this was super super

224
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,620
helpful yes we did not ask for this

225
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,729
super cool the students are actually

226
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:33,349
taking this and turning it into a

227
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:36,890
startup like tears falling magic dreams

228
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,630
this is exactly what you want to happen

229
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,719
yeah probably our students props to shop

230
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:44,180
vie for letting us teach the love of the

231
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,560
web all right very sweet ok next is

232
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,699
commerce guess we're doing neat stuff

233
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:51,560
with JavaScript at Shopify which is

234
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,470
incidentally a company that lets you

235
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,959
open up the store online exactly so we

236
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,790
want to talk about how javascript is

237
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,100
helping our merchants somewhere where's

238
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,949
and make more monies so I'm Nick these

239
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:05,839
are my teeth is ever looked like this

240
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,570
here there's a tiger we work at Shopify

241
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,420
we just launched shop by two so she'll

242
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,279
fly to is a gigantic single page

243
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,199
application it's our merchant editing

244
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:18,410
interface but basically it's you

245
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,060
it has like 100 different models

246
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,009
thousands of different views and

247
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:24,350
probably katrien zuv lines of code I'm

248
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,199
not exaggerating no it's definitely a

249
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,910
huge app and it's all built on top of

250
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,970
Batman Jas yo demo too many words we're

251
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,519
behind today this is quick demo I it

252
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,430
looks like this you can't see that oh no

253
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,879
oh it looks like this yeah there we go I

254
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,110
it's a little anyway it looks like that

255
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,060
like admin side this is what the

256
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,680
merchant or the customer is looking at

257
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,199
and they can drive their store what's

258
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:52,910
awesome about this is that it's super

259
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,670
fast there's no page reloading you know

260
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,230
the drill it's all pushed state it's a

261
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,689
single page app like Shopify the course

262
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:01,579
ID is instantly getting a lot smaller

263
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:04,370
like if you go put yourself up on github

264
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,740
they identify it based on its language

265
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,870
so Shopify is now JavaScript app

266
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,579
according to github because we've been

267
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:12,170
taking so much out of the rails side and

268
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,170
then producing this beautiful thing shop

269
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,110
why is just a rails API now everything

270
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,209
is golden and harmonious and exactly how

271
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:25,430
it was meant to be so that is shop fight

272
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:30,050
ooh oh my god alright alright we made an

273
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,959
embedded app SDK so at one point Shopify

274
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,040
makes this API so that we can stop

275
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,329
telling our merchants know when they ask

276
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:39,949
for complicated stuff because we're like

277
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:41,810
build it yourself or hire somebody else

278
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,000
to you build it for you eventually that

279
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,589
happens a lot and we're like maybe we

280
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:48,139
should offer a place to market these

281
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:50,750
apps so a Shopify app is really just a

282
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,209
website over here a web application that

283
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:55,699
happens to have permission to access a

284
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:58,370
shops API that's it so when you install

285
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,019
an app it's like I'm going to give

286
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:01,790
permission to this other web application

287
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,800
the downside is that okay right so this

288
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,329
is the backend the Shopify admin and

289
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:10,220
when I click on a nap I get this screen

290
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,920
which is not like super intuitive for a

291
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,470
lot of our customer base who weren't

292
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,779
super like self-identifying technical

293
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:19,879
people they got really compaq infused by

294
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,230
this like they got over it eventually

295
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,240
but they're like where did shop if I go

296
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,459
am I still in my store like what's the

297
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:27,949
deal where have I gone so instead we're

298
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:30,680
like it should be like this instead next

299
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,620
it should be like this instead

300
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,910
so this is a for-real working

301
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:40,310
application of the app is just like this

302
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,560
part here so there's a like a tiny

303
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,570
iframe going on in here but the

304
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,800
beautiful thing about this is that it

305
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,970
can interact with the rest of the

306
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,140
Shopify API or admin rather um so it's

307
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,940
an iframe but it's using post message to

308
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,160
communicate back and forth right so like

309
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,900
inside is this app if you're like can

310
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,550
you pop up some stuff that looks like

311
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,650
you're in the admin if you want to like

312
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,920
show spinners all these other things

313
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,410
modal style windows this kind of stuff

314
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,300
so if you're not familiar with

315
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,120
postmessage it's a really cool a fairly

316
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,440
recent Dom API that allows you to

317
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,420
communicate between different domains in

318
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,980
different windows of the same app

319
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,410
securely so that's basically what we're

320
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,020
using to let third-party developers run

321
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,600
JavaScript within our storefront right

322
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,880
so why are we telling you this if you

323
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,940
have a platform and you have an API you

324
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,010
want to do embedded apps this is the

325
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,420
pattern to go with we've been playing

326
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,430
with us for years and run into all sorts

327
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,830
of crappy ways this is the best way

328
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,840
forward and we've open sourced this as

329
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,280
well it's a brand new API but developers

330
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,630
are already making like boatloads of

331
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,340
money with it if you'd look play around

332
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,640
with it it's in github com / alpha /

333
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,640
embedded app example there's one more

334
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,540
thing we want to talk about with

335
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,760
commerce Edward have you ever built

336
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,680
anything that handles discounts Oh fancy

337
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,710
you ask me Nick why yes I have it's a

338
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,230
pretty complicated it is the worst so

339
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,600
like let's say I want to discount on gin

340
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,100
that just gives you 20 percent off your

341
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,590
order ok I can do that okay but wait but

342
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,410
only orders over a hundred dollars ok

343
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,060
that's not the bad wait but it has to be

344
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,100
a hundred dollars before you factor in

345
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,390
shipping all right ok but you can't have

346
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,460
any items that are on sale in your cards

347
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,690
I don't really know which means I like

348
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,000
on sale ok that's better but you can

349
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,460
only get a discount while the moon is in

350
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,990
a specific cycle you're like a Wiccan

351
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,860
yeah ok Zack no offense to Wiccans no

352
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,810
that's totally cool so I learned that

353
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,160
it's like really hard to build these

354
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,960
discount engines and yeah I don't really

355
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,570
want to do this like Shopify doesn't all

356
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,280
let you do this I don't think any

357
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,750
e-commerce platform would let you do

358
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,640
something like this

359
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,730
we wanted to fix that so we're working

360
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,660
on this prototype basically DSL it's

361
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,580
like a subset of JavaScript and it lets

362
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,860
merchants and developers build their own

363
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,020
discount engines basically you get a

364
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,930
blob of JSON of the order before any

365
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,370
discounts for reply you do you're like

366
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,530
black magic exactly that matter what

367
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,570
wicked magic it is and then you send

368
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,620
back a JSON blob of the order after

369
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,800
discounts are applied right and shall

370
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,980
fly handles the rest yeah so we're

371
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,910
producing like prototypes that are

372
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,220
working that are like little notes and

373
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,710
boxes of things we're still not there

374
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,200
yet but again overarching theme here is

375
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,750
sometimes your customers love good dsl

376
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,400
and you should give that to them instead

377
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,180
of doing the work okay right so sorry

378
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,340
talk 3 I quickly want to go through

379
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,080
what's new in Batman jeaious Nick teeth

380
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,170
ever tiger shelf i if you don't know

381
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,410
what Batman is Batman is a JavaScript

382
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,750
MVC framework that we built a child file

383
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,820
with the express purpose of powering

384
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,580
Shopify to it's similar to angular or

385
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,770
ember but where it differs is that it

386
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,900
really tries to follow similar

387
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,300
conventions to rails does not mean its

388
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,070
rails only its back on agnostic and

389
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,990
we'll work with anything within HX API

390
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,390
but if you are familiar with rails you

391
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,030
can start building apps really easily so

392
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,440
the main new thing that we've released

393
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,510
lately is the new site like I'm not

394
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,770
really quickly right this is one of the

395
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,780
major complaints about Batman when we

396
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,850
first released it was there are no docks

397
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,890
please make it easier for me to get

398
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,380
started using Batman so we built this

399
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,480
when you go to Batman j org now there's

400
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,820
a live tutorial right into site ooh and

401
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,130
it's a live code editor with all the

402
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,960
files that you need it walks you through

403
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,760
getting started building a Batman app so

404
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,750
if I add the Batman rails gem hit save

405
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,760
now I have some generators I can build a

406
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,300
new Batman app right in my web browser

407
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,510
yeah let's set up launch out so this is

408
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,760
actually a running Batman application

409
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,290
and it's based on the little windows

410
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,120
because i went to full screen mode oh

411
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,490
it's cuz you're in full screen yeah

412
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:57,490
there we go alright and now if i make

413
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,260
changes in this one

414
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:05,810
hey ojs conf and hit save then this

415
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,690
window will automatically reflect with

416
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,470
automatically update with all of your

417
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,970
changes so you can actually build a

418
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,460
full-functioning Batman application in

419
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,460
this little text editor and preview it

420
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,080
over here the tutorial walks you through

421
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,730
building a whole audio playlist

422
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,280
management application the other big

423
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,750
thing that we've been working on is docs

424
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,700
so one of the big complaints was that

425
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,160
our docs were insufficient or out of

426
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,740
date so we spent a lot of time investing

427
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,050
in better documentation and rail style

428
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:37,280
guides and a lot more of the framework

429
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,720
is documented it's still work in

430
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,790
progress but we're going to use this now

431
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:46,700
yeah it's usable now so all right yeah

432
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,790
ducks okay just released a new version

433
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,440
sky logical stuff new test suite

434
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,900
coverage Batman rails is a ruby gem

435
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,580
which is less applicable here at JS conf

436
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,740
but if you have a rails application lets

437
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,390
you immediately get started using Batman

438
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,460
with your rails API and we're going to

439
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,540
start pushing this as the best

440
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,860
JavaScript framework for rails

441
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,570
developers it was built for us to chop

442
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,900
by which is a rails application and

443
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,860
doesn't you are familiar with rails

444
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,420
you're going to feel right at home but

445
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,380
you don't have to use it doesn't

446
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,690
necessarily mean that you have to use

447
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,050
rails like it supported on nodes like

448
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,000
you can really have any back-end exactly

449
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,240
alright so coming out more docs clean up

450
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,950
somewhere api's better performance shelf

451
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,420
is already really fast but we want to

452
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,890
make it even faster Nick when's the 10

453
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,570
coming all this is going to lead to the

454
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,790
one point 0 soon real soon now all right

455
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:36,260
danke alright next talk for 20 hours for

456
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,410
you yeah ok teeth so yeah here's teeth

457
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,250
I'm Nick this is Edward by uh we worked

458
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,130
Shopify so something I didn't realize

459
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:50,690
until a talk at Jazz conf us last dis

460
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,270
pastor asked on x ray Daley was

461
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,250
javascript is becoming a tool used for

462
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,380
storytelling and reporting it's being

463
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,250
used in the media yeah just today Astrid

464
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,930
gave a great talk highlighting how

465
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,730
JavaScript lets her tell more

466
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,770
interactive stories it does a better job

467
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,470
of eliciting emotional responses because

468
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,690
three interaction the readers and like

469
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,140
the peep

470
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,640
who are getting into this story can

471
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,470
actually reach out and touch things they

472
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,150
can get into it so here's an example of

473
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:21,380
the New York Times's snowfall article or

474
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,850
story I don't know what it's called now

475
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,460
so if you have any this it's a gorgeous

476
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,460
article about the avalanches in the

477
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,800
water in cascade videos and also its

478
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,840
interactive stuff pictures infographics

479
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,760
like it's really amazing it gives you a

480
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,500
lot more data and a lot more background

481
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,200
about the story and what the reporter is

482
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,630
trying to tell you another example is

483
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:45,440
I'll snap arcade fire just released this

484
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,510
new music video yeah if you haven't

485
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,790
played with us yet do it it's amazing

486
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,870
I'm not going to do it on conference

487
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,990
Wi-Fi but basically use WebGL and your

488
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,580
camera and yeah well you're the phone

489
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,710
and you're like our like shining light

490
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,870
in two parts of the screen it's really

491
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,000
cool so it tells you a story it's a

492
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,610
music video it's amazing try it out it's

493
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:14,780
really cool play oh god play we're going

494
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,990
to die nope come back okay there we go

495
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,730
so snowfall Arcade Fire this is really

496
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,480
cool for a few reasons first the

497
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,490
journalism has attained a new level of

498
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,620
depth and a new method of delivery that

499
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,250
wasn't possible before but also it's an

500
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,530
indication that JavaScript has become

501
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,030
approachable enough that it's now being

502
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,910
used by people who again like wouldn't

503
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,130
self-identify as like a technological

504
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,620
person so at least our JavaScript

505
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,190
programmer once told me that they don't

506
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,410
actually like JavaScript or all of the

507
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,510
compile to JavaScript languages not

508
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,710
saying I agree with this but the reason

509
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,830
why is because it's become too easy and

510
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,900
it's lowered the barrier to entry too

511
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,210
much that it's really easy to make

512
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,180
really dumb mistakes or to spend too

513
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,620
much of your time thinking about other

514
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,710
stuff but I take away that I got from

515
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,290
that was it actually lowers the barrier

516
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:16,100
to entry it lets lets us push JavaScript

517
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,260
and technology into places like

518
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,240
journalism and commerce where technology

519
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,030
would not normally be used

520
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,360
alright doctor next talk quickly about

521
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,420
some dsls and api's and why you should

522
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,250
build them in JavaScript so I'm Nick

523
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:37,250
teeth Edward tire shop fly dsl's make a

524
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,230
lot of things more approach right I get

525
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,610
it a dsl is a domain-specific language

526
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,500
it takes into account what kinds of

527
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,670
words and meanings and subject matter

528
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,140
someone would use in their own domain

529
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,570
like let's say that I'm a journalist or

530
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,660
I'm a storyteller I'm going to use a

531
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,320
something that kind of looks like a

532
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,210
programming language but it doesn't

533
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,950
immediately make me think like oh I'm

534
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,470
playing with JavaScript or whatever and

535
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,840
so when you build a DSL a new developer

536
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,060
or somebody who's not even a developer

537
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,670
doesn't have to think about JavaScript

538
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,470
and the browser and the DOM and the

539
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,670
computer and all these different things

540
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,610
they only have to think about what your

541
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,140
dsl is actually providing like the

542
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,750
business logic they want to build a good

543
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,100
rule of thumb is that you shouldn't have

544
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,010
to write documentation for a DSL because

545
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,630
a new developer isn't going to know how

546
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,790
to read documentation a good dsl is

547
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:32,030
approachable so what does a bad dsl look

548
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:39,150
like does anyone know what this guy is

549
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,680
this is regular regular expression for

550
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,110
parsing a valid email address and it's

551
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,090
probably wrong this isn't even it like

552
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,040
this goes on for like fifty thousand

553
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,660
more lines so regex an approachable dsl

554
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,590
maybe to some probably not we can do

555
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,170
better so here's an example of an okay

556
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,750
dsl this is actually from Batman from

557
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,150
the shelf I code base I like this one

558
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,640
obviously because I made it but

559
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,410
basically it takes a lot of different

560
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,990
complex functionality from Batman models

561
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,870
and streamlines them into one consistent

562
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:18,560
syntax and this model really clearly

563
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,680
like explains its behavior the common

564
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,500
dsl throughout Batman is a class in apt

565
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,510
symbol to say hey this class should have

566
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,940
this behavior and then which API

567
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,880
function you want to call okay here is a

568
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,250
good DSL so our friend Daniel

569
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,460
other guy in the tiger picture he's been

570
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,920
playing around with educational tools

571
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,490
and products and he made this dsl for

572
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:47,620
learning how to program where's my

573
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:57,220
chrome take us there there we go are we

574
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,920
looking at this yes this is Rover battle

575
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,930
except it's cut off really yeah just

576
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,260
don't full screen okay not full screen

577
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:14,110
eight minutes it's an awful screen okay

578
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:17,340
it says that's good drag that over

579
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,080
perfect okay cool the big takeaway here

580
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,450
is that there is a robot there are four

581
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,230
functions in this dsl move down move

582
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:29,310
right move left whatever you hit run and

583
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:32,950
the robot does it it's stupid simple

584
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:36,460
it's designed to like get kids calling

585
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,450
functions and getting used to this idea

586
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:43,840
it changes as you type it so if you do

587
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,100
this you'll start moving oh there's no

588
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,350
like compile or anything you just like

589
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,780
use this little baby DSL so I've been

590
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,890
really a DSL like it's just for

591
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,380
functions but by streamlining all of it

592
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,880
into these four functions it's a lot

593
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,350
easier for kids to actually see what's

594
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:03,330
happening cool dsl's they expose oh god

595
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,380
basically they don't have to be just for

596
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,350
apps or robots or discounts or Batman

597
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,210
models you can add a DSL to just about

598
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,550
anything right and suddenly you expose

599
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,860
another level of functionality to people

600
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,080
who might not normally be able to add

601
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,880
functionality to your product and you

602
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,230
don't have to do anything you get this

603
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,660
all for free I implore you to think

604
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,760
about adding some api's or dsl's to your

605
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,590
product and just like we do with the

606
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,170
shop via API all right buying shoes next

607
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:33,010
politics Jess ok so we workshop by

608
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,620
Edward does not have a tiger I'm Nick

609
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,570
these are my teeth and my teeth and I

610
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,070
would one day like to run for public

611
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,870
office so let me tell you a quick story

612
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,870
my family got our first computer when I

613
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,960
was like six or seven years old and I

614
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,220
started a program

615
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,450
because I wanted to figure out how to

616
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,880
hack these awesome golf games so I got

617
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,100
some visual basic skills yeah what dim

618
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,559
everything game everything I kept

619
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:59,000
pushing and learning with this magical

620
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,500
thing called the internet eventually

621
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,720
started doing some freelance I got

622
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,850
pretty into cocoa and JavaScript and

623
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:05,990
eventually this framework called

624
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,830
cappuccino I then started University

625
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,360
pretty quickly figured out it was not

626
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,909
for me so I left went back to web

627
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:16,429
development and gets pretty sweet jobs

628
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:18,230
get to go to some awesome conferences

629
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,090
like this one and hang out with all you

630
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,700
wonderful smart people my story is not

631
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,320
that special it probably sounds familiar

632
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,840
to a lot of you as far as that story

633
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,750
goes and programming goes I'm not the

634
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,330
war the best I'm not the worst so isn't

635
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,950
that a perfect qualification for running

636
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,380
for public office it's something I'd

637
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,820
like to do at some point we could talk

638
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,600
about reasons why later or offline but

639
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,770
what it means that I spend a lot of time

640
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,630
thinking about politics and technology

641
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,940
and how they can work together normally

642
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,620
that evokes images of like

643
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,299
egovernment and stuff like that but it

644
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,950
doesn't have to thinking back to the

645
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,450
earlier thing about how JavaScript and

646
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,340
lowers the barrier to entry we can apply

647
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,140
it not just to storytelling and

648
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,720
e-commerce but to politics as well so

649
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,809
one thing we could do is for example

650
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:04,820
start hosting our legal code on github

651
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,070
or some github like service imagine

652
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,220
being able to access all of your laws in

653
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,830
a format and all the formats that github

654
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,570
provides being able to go back through

655
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,980
the committee history so you changed

656
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,080
what and when actually right now it's

657
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,650
like today there's a legal hackfest

658
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,970
showing off this new API that the

659
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:25,940
Canadian Association of lawyers have put

660
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,380
together so we're like hey we need to

661
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,500
catch up and offer api's and dsl's to

662
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,570
our own legal code so like that's being

663
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,309
hacked on today these are not just like

664
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:36,110
pie-in-the-sky ideas this stuff is

665
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,630
coming so this has actually kind of

666
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,840
already been done united states is a i

667
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,770
think somewhat parody github account but

668
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,350
one of the things he did is wrote a

669
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:52,039
scraper that scrapes the US legal code

670
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:54,049
and periodically updates changes to

671
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:56,659
github so you can kind of go get the

672
00:26:56,659 --> 00:26:58,220
u.s. code from github it's just not

673
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:03,230
official another one

674
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,030
I recently had to go renew my health

675
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:08,450
card for Ontario and it took no less

676
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,190
than three different trips to City Hall

677
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:14,270
to actually get the card this guy named

678
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,669
Dominic come on had a really similar

679
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,290
experience with Germany's so-called

680
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,360
egovernment you can read this article

681
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,090
it's pretty interesting a sickly he got

682
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,590
access but couldn't do anything with it

683
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,510
right the kicker is like none of these

684
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:29,210
things none of these forms are so

685
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:32,900
complex or so private that you have to

686
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,940
go through 20 different people or 20

687
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,610
different provincial employees so if we

688
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,830
just had a simple system of online

689
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,630
identity which we don't yet but cool

690
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,070
people are working on it hey persona

691
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,910
yeah there's no reason that like at

692
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:49,160
least half of all the bureaucracy we as

693
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,169
citizens deal with all the time couldn't

694
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,049
be moved online all right basically just

695
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:55,790
keep pushing like keep building cool

696
00:27:55,790 --> 00:28:01,429
stuff and like build dsl's like Chrissy

697
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,990
was talking about yesterday with persona

698
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,600
UX testing may be named one of your

699
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,490
personas after a politician and think

700
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,080
hey could this politician use this

701
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,020
application and if we keep pushing and

702
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,090
we all keep doing this then we can

703
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,820
eventually get to like a better more

704
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,640
betterer place government technology

705
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,840
harmony and that's something that I'm

706
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,100
interested in that'd be pretty rad

707
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,610
alright last talked oh ok the Sun never

708
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,830
sets on the JavaScript Empire the

709
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,960
JavaScript Empire is growing yes it's

710
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,570
now available in like hardware forms

711
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:35,620
we're seeing it in flying robots hey

712
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,330
it's like I don't know if you know this

713
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,370
but like you can embed JavaScript inside

714
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,950
a PDF and it will render properly you

715
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,450
can also use javascript to make a PDF

716
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,710
it's being used in operating systems

717
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,540
it's being used in tunes create

718
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,280
operating systems yeah there's another

719
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,590
operating system called ASOS where it's

720
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,890
just a whole OS written in JavaScript

721
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,240
but it's also being sneaky and not just

722
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,370
being used in different technologies but

723
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,830
different areas where technology would

724
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,840
not normally be used or where JavaScript

725
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,460
would not normally be used so I don't

726
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,130
know if you saw this but the new SimCity

727
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,290
disastrous launch terrible fraught with

728
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,900
DRM issues but whatever uses JavaScript

729
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,550
to do a lot of its own like

730
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,770
lui and a lot of the rules engines and

731
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,930
this other stuff we used it to help

732
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:23,020
educate our students more better

733
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,910
different newspapers are using

734
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,350
javascript to make their articles more

735
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,270
interactive and add more depth yeah

736
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:32,030
we're letting API developers do a better

737
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,310
job and let customers do our work for us

738
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,610
and like more and more politics and

739
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,170
government and technology is being

740
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,660
merged together and moving online it's

741
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,730
JavaScript and technology are being used

742
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:47,150
in hospitals in iPads in medicine in

743
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,510
university has admission processes

744
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:52,190
basically javascript is growing we've

745
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,960
become a massive Empire and we can say

746
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,420
that the Sun will never set on the

747
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,520
JavaScript Empire we agree with what

748
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,260
Brendan said last night that it's going

749
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,660
to keep growing and be the language that

750
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,130
you write yourself I'm going to keep

751
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,990
growing and be a low-level language and

752
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:08,390
it very well might end up being a

753
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,250
foundation for a lot of modern

754
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:14,030
civilization where we're all citizens of

755
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,310
the JavaScript Empire and we implore you

756
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,890
to help it grow as well I'm going to

757
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,080
keep pushing it in technology or in

758
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,090
politics and government yep I'm going to

759
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,860
keep pushing for JavaScript to go into

760
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,820
education and open data so maybe instead

761
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,400
of building that to-do app build

762
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,020
something that lets somebody else solve

763
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,600
their own problem build apps that solve

764
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,180
problems outside of our industry it

765
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,070
outside the bubble glory to the

766
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,950
JavaScript Empire and flora to the apps

767
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,440

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,260
Empire glory to us all huzzah hey we're

769
