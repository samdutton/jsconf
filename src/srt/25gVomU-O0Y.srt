1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,590

this dog is about conquering fears so

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,660
it's all one thing it's pretty scared to

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,090
be up here in front of all these people

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,590
but actually I'm not really afraid of

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,410
that many thing so I'm kind of I do a

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,840
lot of stupid basically I'd like my

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,390
mom would put it uh here's me in middle

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,839
school in a mosh pit at a metal show

9
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:30,570
here's me skydiving in California with

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,400
that guy's name is Rocco that's his real

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,700
name um yeah here's me and my family at

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,610
the CN tower in toronto girl leading off

13
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,440
of the tower we're all harnessed up it's

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,170
actually super safe but it's such a

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,870
crazy view of the city that's me on the

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,320
left and the rest of my family well we

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,580
all smile we you can't tell each other

18
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,660
apart it's like crazy so I was just on a

19
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,790
month-long trip in Mexico in a road trip

20
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,960
in a two-door car and we were there when

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,330
this hurricane was hitting and I was

22
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,040
like whatever it's gonna be fine

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,720
actually was fine it didn't really hit

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,490
us but it did really hit the west coast

25
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,329
really bad but thankfully did not damage

26
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:18,960
us um I swam through this cave thing

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,749
while I was there without a life vest

28
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,880
that was really stupid because I was so

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,899
tired at the end and here's me diving

30
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:30,509
off into another it's a kala signal day

31
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:33,359
it's like a natural body of water and I

32
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,109
really up that dive but I was

33
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:38,490
like you know just go for it you just go

34
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,829
for it and so we have a lot of fears I

35
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:45,810
don't have the only like crazy weird

36
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,069
irrational fear that I have is of

37
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:49,679
cockroaches I really hate them but the

38
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:50,939
other thing that really scares me is

39
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,060
code which sounds really weird because

40
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,950
we're at a JavaScript conference now and

41
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,939
I code for living but uh so we're going

42
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,279
to go back we got to talk about my life

43
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:04,200
we're going to talk about code and my

44
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,409
relationship with it over the years so

45
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,770
here's me as a child I just wanted to

46
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,960
show you that because I look super cute

47
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,230
and well we're going to go a little

48
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,840
further forward an elementary school I

49
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,300
was in a G&T program and they would take

50
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,040
us like during school for a couple hours

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,400
and we'd play with 10 grams but we also

52
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,350
did this thing called logo which you

53
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,150
basically learn how to program a turtle

54
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,110
move around best thing ever so fun and

55
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,090
like make it like rudimentary calculator

56
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,060
and things like that fast forward a

57
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,250
couple more years this is mean I think

58
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,750
this is fourth or fifth grade that's me

59
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,820
in the middle that is a dead Playboy

60
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,900
bunny shirt so weird I know and I went

61
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,940
to this camp called cty and oh my god we

62
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,270
have to talk later and so so this is a

63
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,000
summer camp and for three weeks you go

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,980
to a college campus and you stay in

65
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,680
dorms and you take a class monday to

66
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,140
friday for like us you know like a

67
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,610
regular workday but you go to a class

68
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,170
and you got a break in between and stuff

69
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,480
but it's basically school in the

70
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,410
summertime so i did that for five years

71
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,370
most like one of the most amazing

72
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,290
experiences in my life like super

73
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,160
formative and the first year of cty i

74
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,810
ended up taking a computer science class

75
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,200
but and we like I think was visual basic

76
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,850
that we learned how to do and learned

77
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,950
about computer science but then somehow

78
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,130
I just forgot like what that all the

79
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,330
things that learned in that class and I

80
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,470
didn't realize it was like programming

81
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,560
programming like as we know today fast

82
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,570
forward another couple years making

83
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,970
xanga layouts this is not my own i would

84
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,770
not make this but something equally

85
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,650
horrible so like learning how to like

86
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,170
copy paste HTML CSS and JavaScript I

87
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,630
didn't know like really what those

88
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,220
things meant i just copied and pasted

89
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,660
things and change things around and

90
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,890
that's what you do you kind of fiddle

91
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,920
with code and that's how you learn but I

92
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,210
wasn't really thinking about it s code I

93
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,560
was just thinking about how do i make my

94
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,740
site personnel to me my xanga writing

95
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,260
about my middle school life I know so

96
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,580
and I don't know if you remember this

97
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,950
font it was really popular it's like

98
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,150
super nice she's like if you're a middle

99
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,340
school and you were doing xanga layouts

100
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,540
like I feel like this was really popular

101
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,549
and some of these weird Photoshop

102
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:25,350
paintbrushes yeah pretty embarrassing

103
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,820
and of course there's myspace you can't

104
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,330
forget about that so now we fast forward

105
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,620
a couple more years I'm in college and

106
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,090
freshman year I have no idea what I'm

107
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,770
doing I just take a lot of random

108
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,050
classes like I'll be a psych major I'll

109
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,090
do american studies I'll maybe I'll be a

110
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,170
math major all I want to do

111
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,820
environmental biology because my entire

112
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,500
life I've wanted to be a marine

113
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,390
biologist but I never happened but

114
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,330
whatever maybe it's never too late maybe

115
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,420
i'll stop programming but so but

116
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,260
sophomore year I saw me I was like

117
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,550
trying to do a lot of different things

118
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,040
so I decided to take a pro intro to

119
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,050
computer science class am I talking

120
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,540
million miles a minute probably started

121
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,910
taking a programming class and I decided

122
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,280
oh this is what I've been doing all

123
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,140
these years like typing you know

124
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,630
characters and making things happen and

125
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,510
so I was really excited oh yeah I'm

126
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,980
gonna be programmer this is gonna be

127
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,650
awesome java doesn't look that much but

128
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,560
like I only know that now but then I was

129
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,840
like oh this is super cool I'm coding

130
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,370
and stuff like that so yeah so the

131
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,810
sophomore year for our first semester

132
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,050
and that course finished and I decided

133
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,330
to go to a hackathon just having taken

134
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,420
one programming class and what is

135
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,610
happening my stepping on something um so

136
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,020
this okay after this program in class I

137
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,580
just know how to like do some you know

138
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,740
make a blackjack game things like that

139
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,720
and I decided to go to my first

140
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,180
hackathon I didn't know anybody there I

141
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,500
didn't know any of my friends were going

142
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,420
and so I just kind of showed up and

143
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,850
expected the best to happen and you know

144
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,680
what it did it kind of turned out well I

145
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,180
actually had a mutual friend that was

146
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,000
there for a friend of a friend who was

147
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,190
there joined his team and we ended up

148
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,740
winning an API related prize and took

149
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,570
home some amazon gift cards which is

150
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,090
awesome and here's me but then also

151
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,190
looking back at all of my pictures from

152
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,320
like the years i looked the same exact

153
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,050
same in every single photo it's crazy so

154
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,080
for the hair so that happened and i was

155
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,330
really excited and i was on my way to

156
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,820
becoming a programmer i had internship

157
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,760
under my belt the summer after that and

158
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,590
another one after that the next summer

159
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,169
but

160
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:41,150
that's a junior year happened junior

161
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,699
year was a little crazy first semester I

162
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:45,830
had failed a class those artificial

163
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,710
intelligence really terrible experience

164
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,389
we had to ride in Lisp and I was like

165
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:52,789
all right trees and stuff I can't do

166
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:54,499
that because I really like doing

167
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:55,819
front-end development so that's kind of

168
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:57,620
like what I liked but all my programming

169
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,810
classes were like no learn this theory

170
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,639
and learn how to make decision trees

171
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,840
because you're going to be using that

172
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,840
again so I was like this in college was

173
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,569
kind of senior of beginning a senior I

174
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:12,110
was just kind of like burnt out just

175
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,729
doing this in the library at like five

176
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:16,159
in the morning and just not knowing what

177
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:18,620
to do with my life I was all I was so

178
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,169
effed I was freaking out failing my

179
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:23,810
classes feeling lost I was like what am

180
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,129
I going to do up to college like it

181
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:26,810
might going to be coding forever like

182
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,580
computer science doesn't feel like it's

183
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,439
the right fit for me so I just felt

184
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:34,279
 all over so I had to make a

185
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,710
all over so I had to make a
decision I was like do I continue in

186
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,469
this major and have a terrible senior

187
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:41,270
year or do i drop down to a

188
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,099
concentration which you can do i miss in

189
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:45,620
my school and still do computer science

190
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,469
like on my degree but still have a good

191
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,569
time because college is about having fun

192
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:55,819
also with the sites learning so yeah so

193
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:57,560
i ended up taking a bunch of fun classes

194
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,300
that i never would have taken if i

195
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,460
hadn't dropped down to concentration I

196
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,740
took a poetry class post modern poetry

197
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,270
class you don't really know what post

198
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,240
modern poetry is it's just like

199
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,610
postmodern like weird stuff I wrote this

200
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,279
really awesome gem of a line push

201
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:15,289
language to the edge of possibility I

202
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:17,389
have no idea what that means but you

203
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:18,949
know I went to college so it's super

204
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:22,639
sounds really really smart I know so but

205
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,589
like that semester I took ballet because

206
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:26,389
I really loved dancing i took this

207
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:29,360
awesome agile development class i had

208
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,759
taken this mobile HD I class where I met

209
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,360
Charlie and this poetry class was pretty

210
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,789
cool I had to write a lot of papers

211
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,709
which I wasn't really used to I was used

212
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:41,810
type in code not really writing real

213
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,969
words out into strings of words that

214
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:46,310
make sense together sort of sort of make

215
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,269
sense so this one poet shock me at the

216
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:51,380
beginning of the course his name is

217
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,750
Clark Coolidge

218
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,720
and he was a poet but he was also really

219
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,000
into rocks he was really into geology so

220
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,550
he would write poetry that kind of

221
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,160
related to his interest in geology this

222
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,870
is sort of like tangential this is a

223
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,600
poem that we read in this class you're

224
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,170
soaked it in you know ounce Code Orange

225
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,810
the home trilobite chawla bytes makes no

226
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,760
sense but there's a lot of context

227
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,550
behind it which is cool trilha bites are

228
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,560
these like prehistoric animals that are

229
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,300
like you know you can find fossils of

230
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,250
they look like that that kind of

231
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,900
scary-looking but yeah so this guy you

232
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,220
know he's a poet but he also loved

233
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,320
geology and so I was like why can't I

234
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,170
you know combine code with poetry and do

235
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,500
something cool with that so I went to my

236
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,780
last hackathon as a student I was pen

237
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,130
apps that was like 2014 cool oh my god

238
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,020
that was last year that is so crazy is

239
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,040
only last year and so these were kind of

240
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,200
my goals for the app that I wanted to

241
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,440
make um didn't end up really being like

242
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,120
that because I I'm a front-end developer

243
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,530
so like I don't want to really do back

244
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,020
in so kind of ignored that part so I

245
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,970
ended up making with a couple my friends

246
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,760
something called exquisite hues and the

247
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,580
idea behind the poetry that's written in

248
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,770
this app is that is this thing called

249
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,630
exquisite corpse and so basically

250
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,750
exquisite corpse is a method of you know

251
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,390
making art by which a collection of

252
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,160
words or images is collectively

253
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,440
assembled and every collaborator

254
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,950
basically follow some set of rules or

255
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,920
are only allowed to see only the end of

256
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,690
what the previous person wrote or

257
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,060
contributed per se because this is an

258
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,240
example of some surrealist painters of

259
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,190
jamming together to make this weird I

260
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,510
think it looks like pencil yeah so

261
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,430
really cool things come out of it it's

262
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,040
always kind of weird and almost doesn't

263
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,420
make sense but sometimes makes sense

264
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,990
sometimes another example of exquisite

265
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,820
corpse one of my favorite podcasts how

266
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,860
to do everything did this one episode

267
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,360
where I talk about the super bowl and

268
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,040
they're like let's make a super bowl dip

269
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,280
but everyone who contributes only knows

270
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,620
ingredient before them so like if you if

271
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,880
you don't know what I'm talking about

272
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,350
it's like a dip you know it's like

273
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,150
usually like five cheese's or like walk

274
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,850
and like nachos and stuff and so this is

275
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,670
what they came up with so they started

276
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,460
so if you yeah so there's strutted

277
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,900
chicken jalapenos cream cheese grape

278
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,570
jelly extra chunky peanut butter

279
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,090
marshmallow fluff graham crackers

280
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,210
pretzels and dark chocolate hot sauce I

281
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,190
don't know how that jump happen sour

282
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,680
cream ground beef guacamole spicy tomato

283
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,290
jam deep fried green beans jerk chicken

284
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,200
Satsuki Ken fried onions and topped a

285
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,290
pepperoni you've got this like crazy

286
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,790
frankenstein where there's like a lot of

287
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,700
sweet stuff in the middle and then spice

288
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,680
surrounding it I wouldn't eat that would

289
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,350
you would anyone eat that oh yeah oh

290
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,540
weird people in here who would like to

291
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,810
eat that um so yeah so that is the idea

292
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,810
behind exquisite corpse so the stack I

293
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,390
want it we kind of wanted to wear this

294
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,790
elaborate idea at the hackathon where we

295
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,670
would do some sentiment analysis on the

296
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,860
poetry that was written and like make

297
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,750
these Philips hue lights change color

298
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,240
but I didn't end up happening and also

299
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,920
ended up being like a completely funded

300
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,660
app that's a really cool thing about

301
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,630
firebase you can write it's a data store

302
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,310
and you can kind of query it on the

303
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,410
front end and it updates real time

304
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,510
things like that so we were able to

305
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,160
write it all in the front end and I

306
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,750
wrote some shitty angular code to go

307
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,390
along with that so after that project I

308
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,850
was just done I was like oh I'm done I

309
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,280
did the project it works and I can go

310
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,110
home now and I didn't sleep for 36 hours

311
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,020
whatever and so that's how I thought

312
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,360
about that but let's backtrack a little

313
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,820
bit so I said I met Charlie in one of my

314
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,280
classes we worked on a project together

315
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,830
and he introduced me to the whole

316
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,920
JavaScript scene like of the world I

317
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,150
guess at this point so so he told me

318
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,400
about Empire node I one tampon owed and

319
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,900
I met these two guys there that's John

320
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,240
John Kay Paul and jason rhoads they're

321
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,590
both awesome and I wish they were both

322
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:19,059
here so they both we met that weekend

323
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:21,339
and they were both like we you know

324
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:22,539
we've got along really well and they're

325
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:24,309
like Jane you have to give a talk I

326
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:27,009
might meet up it's like you're just

327
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:28,449
going to do it there's like no there's

328
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:30,189
no for an answer that you can't I won't

329
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:31,749
take no for an answer you're just going

330
00:13:31,749 --> 00:13:34,389
to do it this is John Paulding my like

331
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:36,609
direct messages on Twitter he's just

332
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:38,349
like constantly picking me like hey

333
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:39,759
wanting to do this talk what are you the

334
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,249
stock wanting it in a stock and at this

335
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:43,479
point I wasn't really sure what I was

336
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,099
going to talk about I think and then I

337
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:46,689
kind of inkling it was going to be oh

338
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:49,119
there's Jed in there too if you this is

339
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:52,029
a tweet from a long long time ago so

340
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:54,039
people were asking me to talk and

341
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:56,049
because they thought like I don't know

342
00:13:56,049 --> 00:13:58,149
I'm loud and obnoxious and like kind of

343
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:00,789
funny sometimes maybe so they're like

344
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:02,979
you should speak and I was you know

345
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:05,589
thinking about what I should speak and I

346
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:08,289
was thinking about this previous project

347
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:11,709
exquisite Hughes I was like okay I don't

348
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,119
feel great about that project cuz I

349
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,889
built it at a hackathon and it looks

350
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:18,999
pretty shitty so I did this again where

351
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:21,119
I freaked out and I was just kind of

352
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:23,649
putting myself down and shutting myself

353
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,869
like I can't do this like I have to

354
00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:27,399
rewrite the app I was like building up

355
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,899
all these excuses why I couldn't do the

356
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:32,039
talk and I was supposed to speak at HTM

357
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:35,409
NYC html5 which is John Paul's meet up

358
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:38,799
and there was some hurricane also but I

359
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:40,689
also backed out and that's which is why

360
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:43,179
we had all those we've had that thread

361
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:45,789
of him keeping asking me to talk at his

362
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:50,049
meet up so uh but so I didn't end up

363
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:53,079
talking at that meet up but Jason

364
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:54,879
approached me and he said hey I would we

365
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:57,549
like metaphor tiny food and we decided

366
00:14:57,549 --> 00:14:59,349
that I would speak at his meet up in

367
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:03,579
Baltimore at Charm City jeaious so I get

368
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:05,169
to that point and I had sort of started

369
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:06,369
tinkering around with the app because i

370
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:07,749
was kind of like half committed to doing

371
00:15:07,749 --> 00:15:11,819
a talk and so I decided to rewrite it

372
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:15,969
and scrap so I changed from express too

373
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:17,589
happy Jessica had just gone to a node

374
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:21,039
another note was it I was TX Jas and I

375
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,659
got to do a node workshop there we

376
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:24,489
learned happy and I was like oh I kind

377
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:26,199
of understand middleware now so that's

378
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:27,879
awesome so I decided to rewrite it that

379
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:30,129
way and instead of using angular which I

380
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,809
didn't really know how to use and it was

381
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:33,070
kind of a lot

382
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,600
features for what I needed to do for

383
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,880
this app i switch to just doing vanilla

384
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,020
JavaScript which is what I'm most

385
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,190
comfortable with anyway and yeah I kind

386
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,810
of flip flops on the firebase thing

387
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,190
because I was like you know I didn't

388
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,660
like how I structured the data in the

389
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,550
first place and I was like okay maybe

390
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,750
i'll rewrite it and do it in Mongo

391
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,310
because you know well i was thinking

392
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,050
mean sack mentality even though when i

393
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,690
was using angular but I was like but I

394
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:56,830
don't want to rewrite that stuff so I'm

395
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,950
just going to keep it with firebase yeah

396
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,600
and no it's awesome I ended up doing

397
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,490
like encryption for the phone numbers

398
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,920
that were coming in you know and then

399
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,510
you can write everything in JavaScript

400
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,010
that's just amazing and we're a

401
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,840
JavaScript conference so that's perfect

402
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,070
this is one of the first poems that I

403
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:21,820
don't know what's up yeah Brooklyn is

404
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,420
right here so the first yeah so this is

405
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,920
a slide with the first poem that I wrote

406
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,160
on it it says hi the message stares back

407
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,050
no sleep no sleep no sleep and this is

408
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,150
at two in the morning of course and this

409
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,680
was like two days before I had to give

410
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,240
that talk but I like kind of get

411
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,500
everything done it was like an

412
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:43,570
adrenaline wash and so uh that's me ah

413
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,330
perfect that's me at Charm City j/s that

414
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,850

415
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:53,710
awesome and yeah that's me and me so

416
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,230
meta it's like nested and here's me

417
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,070
speaking at the html5 talk can't meet up

418
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,530
dad finally happened and then I don't

419
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,180
have a picture of the Brooklyn jazz talk

420
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,980
that I did but Jen had one in his talk

421
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,449
so you saw it um so yes that's that I

422
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:12,459
was like oh god awesome i got to do a

423
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:14,699
talk I feel pretty good about myself

424
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:19,060
people like what I had to say cool and

425
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,430
so I for some reason I decide to submit

426
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,990
it today as calm cuz like why not why

427
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,610
not submit it to a conference and it

428
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,770
turns out i actually got selected which

429
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:32,470
was such I was just like blown away like

430
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,900
what and I was in Mexico at this point

431
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,190
and I was like oh god I didn't bring my

432
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,710
laptop and I was like I'm gonna have a

433
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,850
whole month where I like won't be able

434
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,070
to work on this and when I get back I

435
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,690
like start a new job and everything so I

436
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,550
was like freaking out again

437
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,750
I was definitely freaking out but I

438
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,950
couldn't really freaked out about on the

439
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,180
trip because I was so busy like

440
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,120
traveling but then I got back and I'm

441
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,220
faced with this task again where I have

442
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:02,440
to write a talk and and I was like my I

443
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,570
feel like my apps not good enough even

444
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,950
though I talked about it already i felt

445
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,090
i still felt like there was something

446
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,640
missing like my talk was not worth

447
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,830
listening to that nothing worth saying

448
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,650
to people and so and then i had

449
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,690
submitted the idea was conquering fears

450
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,480
like what what I do I don't know felt

451
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,800
like kind of weird about my talk idea

452
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,170
and I was like damn I'm i'm

453
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,730
really and i only have like a

454
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:29,320
week to pull this together um so but

455
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,270
then I just like decided no I'm gonna

456
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,830
get my together a sat down in front

457
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,480
of the computer and I just you know just

458
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,340
like that died that I you know I was

459
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,770
doing you know I I took a dive in class

460
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,570
in college too super fun and the teacher

461
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,920
was always like you stand up there too

462
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,480
long you're never going to do it and you

463
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,190
just have to jump and a lot of people

464
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,600
like did their first dives in that class

465
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,000
and it's really cool and so I started

466
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,950
from my computer and I was like

467
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,420
complaining all my friends I can't do

468
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,960
this i'm not worthy and nah and i just

469
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,510
sat down and it just did it so instead

470
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,010
of adding some features that i had

471
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,960
wanted to implement i ended up rewriting

472
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,770
the app again so uh i know a little bit

473
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,200
more after rewriting it the first time

474
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,050
and having like lived my life and

475
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,060
learned some stuff along the way at

476
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,310
meetups and conferences and stuff i

477
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,440
decided to go back to express a night

478
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,060
because i had added a bunch of happy

479
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,560
plugins that i didn't really know how it

480
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,630
worked and it they were just sitting

481
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,580
there and like I just didn't know how

482
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,020
anything worked but now I knew how

483
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:30,040
things worked it was awesome oh that's

484
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,780
that and then I also learned how to

485
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,960
deploy it digital ocean and like even

486
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,550
set up a back of and all this stuff and

487
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,650
save the droplet and made a snapshot

488
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,260
which you can do I didn't realize so I

489
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,940
had that all set up and I felt pretty

490
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,370
cool this is supposed to play that's

491
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,930
right that's like one of my favorite

492
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,440
gifts of all time this kid is so funny

493
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,600
so now we're going to go back so the

494
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,870
purpose of this whole thing was to do

495
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,670
all these things right a full stock app

496
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,080
do something creative

497
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,669
actually finish something for once and

498
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:02,679
it turns out like nothing's actually

499
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:05,230
ever finished because I keep working on

500
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,360
it and finding out that I know more

501
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,950
things that I learned more along the way

502
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,529
that you know I still always have this

503
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:14,679
fear of speaking but I just like if I

504
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,899
put myself there and I just make myself

505
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:20,710
just do it I'll just do it and that's

506
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,659
this is the attitude i have about lots

507
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:24,370
of things in my life I just like you

508
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,450
can't think about it too much if you

509
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,799
think about it too much you're gonna

510
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,380
freak out like i was doing before so

511
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,429
we're gonna go and do a demo sort of i

512
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:34,510
mean i'm just gonna show you what it is

513
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,159
because it's been up for a while let's

514
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,639
see we will go there awesome so if you

515
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:40,659
haven't checked it out yet this is

516
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:42,700
exquisite text oh this is the about page

517
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,740
but the rules are basically you

518
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,240
construct a poem through text messages

519
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,720
if you text so you can see the last line

520
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,570
on exquisite XCOM so right there or you

521
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,909
could text the word last two here to see

522
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:57,730
the last line and based on the last line

523
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,559
you're going to text it something new so

524
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:00,700
you guys are all probably gonna do it at

525
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,440
the same time and so they're all going

526
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,529
to be related to the line that's up

527
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:07,570
right now but that's cool that's like I

528
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,139
kind of like the serendipitous nature of

529
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:12,519
this app like you never know what's

530
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,350
going to come out especially you don't

531
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,580
know who's that the other end you don't

532
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,830
know who else is writing it so I kind of

533
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,080
like that aspect Oh super creative Hey

534
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,190
oh we go in in so yeah so it's this

535
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,809
still using firebase so updates

536
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:29,110
real-time on the front end and so yeah

537
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,200
I'm gonna show so the first poem was

538
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,289
this that I would speak talking about

539
00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:37,809
no-sleep no-sleep no-sleep someone

540
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:40,450
during my first talk try to you know do

541
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,610
that at the end which is super cool but

542
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,350
nothing bad happened and they also

543
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,230
exploited the fact that I didn't strip

544
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,990
the casing on the word last so people

545
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,730
were texting the word last over and over

546
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,039
and over again with a capital L that was

547
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:57,100
cool I like this one because it rhymes

548
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,200
I'll read out for you but can't you just

549
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,179
not rhyme who has a time what's up

550
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:03,490
pretty boy the milk I drink prefers soy

551
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,769
the kind i drink as a boy I don't know

552
00:22:05,769 --> 00:22:07,809
so that's like one of the earlier poems

553
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:10,630
this is back in August it was really

554
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,070
cool that emoji you just were

555
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:16,360
works and it was all this is August when

556
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,640
this was happening but the first line is

557
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,880
definitely so true um yeah and this one

558
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,650
is this a cool first line cuz it's like

559
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,140
very alliterative so I don't know how

560
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,610
many you guys actually like reading

561
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,050
poetry but I kind of nerd out about it

562
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,620
sometimes and there are some really

563
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,180
awesome poems in here some of them are

564
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,210
like some people really put their

565
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,100
emotions into what they write and it's

566
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,200
just one line of you know just one line

567
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,360
of English and they kind of sometimes is

568
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,390
not even English but it's just one line

569
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,770
of like how they're feeling at the time

570
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,080
or they are responding to the person

571
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,970
before them and they kind of have a

572
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:59,830
conversation like this last one or is it

573
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,140
there was one there's like a really like

574
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,730
long conversation between these two

575
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,670
people but I can't find it again um so

576
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,830
if you guys can give me a number betray

577
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:19,840
between I I miss something ok I missed

578
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,160
something but well you'll see in the

579
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,420
poem and then when the palm gets

580
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,670
completed you get link I don't know if

581
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:31,270
you got a you get a link to your poem so

582
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,800
that's is something that happens

583
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,140
sometimes so they give me a number from

584
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,530
1 to 10 50 we can read a random home 47

585
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:43,330
ok so so like I didn't really implement

586
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,950
like a search function very well so this

587
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,200
is just it that's very simple all right

588
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,750
fish swim oh I actually like this one

589
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,320
fish swim trees grow men yearn into a

590
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,210
state of unknowing childlike wonder

591
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:59,490
filled with color and dreams another one

592
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,390
we're just keep doing this until I have

593
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,950
the time out it's like so much fun I

594
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,750
actually last night I was like freaking

595
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,950
out about this talk but I started

596
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,120
reading all the poems that people wrote

597
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,440
and 149 actually I think I feel like we

598
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,610
already saw that one but oh no we didn't

599
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:22,059
oh nice the bacon is dripping shrug grab

600
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:23,980
a vacuum and clean and the unicorns are

601
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,070
actually horses so many jobs drink some

602
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,500
cheese and eat some wine all right we're

603
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,900
gonna wait time for one more poem number

604
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:39,190
127 All Right see how this goes she sold

605
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,799
her last seashell and boarded a toy boat

606
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:45,400
set sail for the moonrise kingdom it's

607
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,309
like cute it's so awesome and sometimes

608
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:50,860
though I read these poems and sometimes

609
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,450
the language is like very sad and

610
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,100
someone's like obviously going through

611
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,390
some and some relationship problems

612
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,520
and they're just pouring it out into

613
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,679
this poem and then somewhat somehow

614
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:00,940
someone else is responding they also

615
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,230
have relationship problems going on same

616
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,030
time so it's just like a long poem of

617
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,940
like why why why it's like pretty sad

618
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,070
but it's also kind of cool that they

619
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:12,010
using this as a fun way to express their

620
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,390
fins at the time so it's kind of like a

621
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,549
reflection of humankind at any point in

622
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:17,020
time I like to think it's kind of a

623
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,740
lofty description but yeah so that's

624
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:25,240
that and one more thing where am I so

625
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,690
okay so burping all for this idea I had

626
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,780
this other idea I know i was at i think

627
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,250
it was i think his empire node or Empire

628
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,960
j/s where a bunch of people from

629
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,130
portland were there and they gave these

630
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,260
awesome demos and talk about creative

631
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,780
code and that's also kind of why I was

632
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,370
still stuck on this poetry ideas like I

633
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,280
want to work on more things like that so

634
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,230
we try to start this like creative code

635
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,030
made up in New York because some are

636
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,860
happen nothing actually came to fruition

637
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,140
but we're going to try to meet again I

638
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,360
know you're not angry you're one of the

639
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,850
people and so this is like basically

640
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,770
just an idea that I had where you have

641
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:02,230
an exquisite corpse but with code so i

642
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,630
have this repo set up here you guys can

643
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,490
totally go to that and right now it's

644
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,770
just i think it's just the terminal like

645
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,390
spinning out a bunch console logging a

646
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,640
bunch of random numbers and so the idea

647
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,770
is to just build on top of that and see

648
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,929
where all of our collective coding

649
00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:21,640
knowledge takes us so with that I want

650
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,410
to thank james Kalm so much for picking

651
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,200
me and my first JS comp was in May and

652
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,850
so I've had two days console one year

653
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:28,690
and I'm

654
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,950
so sad that I didn't get to go to all

655
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,540
the other ones but I wasn't a JavaScript

656
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,120
programmer then so but feeling really

657
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,010
blessed to be able to be here and to

658
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:40,240
speak in front of you all and yes this

659
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,040
is like me in the inside but I won't
