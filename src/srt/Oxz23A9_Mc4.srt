1
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:12,200
Right.

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:26,960
So, let me begin by taking you back in time.

3
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,590
The time is now 10 past 5.

4
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:35,680
On the 28th December, 1978.

5
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,970
(music)

6
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,250
In the skies above Portland Oregon, is a DC
8.

7
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,770
There are 189 souls on board.

8
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,550
Going to land.

9
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:57,500
So, as they are coming to land, they start
to lower the undercarriage.

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,110
There is a big loud thumb.

11
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,280
They can hear and feel.

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,850
It is not much of a approach.

13
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,049
They are going to go back upto 5000 feet.

14
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:21,749
We have a landing gear problem.

15
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:25,380
Landing gear problems aren't a big deal.

16
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,719
They can land with any undercarriage at all.

17
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:41,869
It is normal for landing gear failures that
happen every year.

18
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:43,549
Nothing interesting happens.

19
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:44,549
Nobody dies.

20
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:56,770
It is a huge surprise when after some regular
ordinary radio traffic, Portland hears this

21
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,289
one.

22
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:01,130
United 173 heavy.

23
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,130
Maydy.

24
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,869
The engines are flaming out, we are going
down.

25
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,929
We are not going to be able to make the airport.

26
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:15,719
They impact with powerlines.

27
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:22,670
That's downtown Portland.

28
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,670
That's what it ended up looking like.

29
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,550
Only 10 people died.

30
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,560
24 were seriously injured.

31
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,209
Most of it was because they hit a tree.

32
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,159
It was a small wooded area.

33
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,360
They were very lucky.

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:47,569
There was a rescue team on an exercise when
they hit the ground.

35
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:50,980
So, this is air crashes.

36
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,570
In case you got confused.

37
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,760
That the last picture was a makefile.

38
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,250
I'm Dave Cridland.

39
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:09,069
I have been working in and around the internet
around 1996.

40
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:16,459
I work for Surevine.

41
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:23,079
My colleague Lloyd over there also speaking,
works with us as well.

42
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:26,629
And we do social stuff on the web.

43
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:32,629
For people who really care about security.

44
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:37,530
When I got into air crashes or reading them.

45
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,670
And reading the reports.

46
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,689
This was way before they were all on the web.

47
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:42,160
Which they are now.

48
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,940
They have pretty animations.

49
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:54,709
I got into them, a company I worked for 15
years ago, would hand you aircraft air reports.

50
00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:00,810
Read this one, it is great.

51
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,190
I don't do anything with aircraft.

52
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,880
I do software.

53
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:12,219
Aircraft are large systems with interacting
components.

54
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,790
So is the software that we built.

55
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,510
It was Javascript.

56
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:25,759
And, the kinds of areas that you get.

57
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,840
Sorry, skipped a bit.

58
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:37,800
What we do to avoid errors is we deal with
redundancy and recoupling.

59
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,380
The failures we get are error chains.

60
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,569
Cascade failures.

61
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:47,770
Same thing.

62
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,729
And even the name that we use is the same.

63
00:04:52,729 --> 00:05:00,870
With aircraft, every time an aircraft doesn't
function as it should, there is a detailed

64
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:08,780
investigation analysing every cause and all
possible recommendations afterwards.

65
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:15,360
It is not quite the same in software.

66
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,129
(applause)

67
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:26,310
So, I have read dozens of reports and summaries.

68
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,430
I'm still not scared to fly.

69
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,310
I took 2 flights here.

70
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,900
I had to change at Schiphol.

71
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:46,389
There are 2 accident reports that leave me
feeling scared about everything.

72
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:49,110
How many people flew here?

73
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,110
That's great.

74
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,069
How many are thinking of flying back.

75
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:54,840
Okay.

76
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,810
We'll change that!

77
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,690
So, what happened with United 173.

78
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:05,550
Why did that plane crash?

79
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,230
This might give you a hint.

80
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,580
A small one.

81
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:15,349
When it took off from Denver, Co, it had 46700
pounds of fuel.

82
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:20,770
They like the imperial measurements.

83
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:34,360
When it was on the approach to Portland, we
can measure how it flew, it had 14800 pounds

84
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,300
of fuel left.

85
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:45,879
We know that, the undercarriage was down,
flaps was down.

86
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:58,960
It is burning 2200 pounds per minute.

87
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,180
He sits behind the pilot.

88
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,750
He has the full readouts of everything.

89
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:16,800
The 2 pilots, captain, first officer, they
were at the figure.

90
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,750
In order to check exactly how much fuel you
have, you ask the flight engineer.

91
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,569
They had a headline.

92
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:30,060
By 17:46 they have 5000.

93
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,970
And the flight engineer is reporting this
to the first officer.

94
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:36,770
Who is the pilot flying.

95
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,729
The captain is sorting out problems.

96
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:53,669
And the pilot in charge, captain, tells to
prepare for landing with 4000 pounds of fuel.

97
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:57,430
You can see, that is minutes after he had
5000.

98
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,289
Something wrong here.

99
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:03,340
The first officer requires a fuel check.

100
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,080
He is told 4000.

101
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:14,090
The captain tells Portland, we are going to
land with 3000 pounds of fuel.

102
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,560
This is not right.

103
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,889
6 minutes past 6.

104
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:26,909
The first officer says: We are going to lose
an engine buddy.

105
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:29,250
Why?

106
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,590
Fuel.

107
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,110
Well, activate the cross streets.

108
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,150
To shuffle fuel between tanks.

109
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:46,170
Then they think it is a good idea to ask for
landing clearance a minute later.

110
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:54,710
Couple of minutes later the flight engineer
is reporting only 1000 pounds.

111
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,350
Mayday is declared at 18.13.

112
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:06,260
With the engines running out.

113
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:13,030
The report basically said, this accident exemplifies
a recurring problem with management of crew

114
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,750
resources.

115
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,060
This is an odd phrase to use.

116
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:26,620
The blame was assigned to the captain, who
was stripped of his license and never flew

117
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,330
again.

118
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:32,400
The contributing factor was given as crew
failure.

119
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,870
They are not saying the landing gear was a
problem, the fuel.

120
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:42,640
They say, this was a crew problem.

121
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,890
This is rather unfortunate.

122
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:49,020
The flight engineer was one of those killed
in impact.

123
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:55,460
Before I go on to other crashes which this
is referring to.

124
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,790
There is a top aircraft safety tip.

125
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:04,480
Where is the safest place?

126
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,880
The passenger seats.

127
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:12,920
As a crew you are must more likely to die.

128
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,510
Be a passenger.

129
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,500
The related crashes which are similar.

130
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:27,760
1963 Tupelov 124 in the Neva River.

131
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,920
There was a landing gear problem on take off.

132
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,930
They decided they would circle to use up fuel.

133
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,730
In the days before the aircraft dumped it.

134
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,500
They looped too many times.

135
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,860
No casualties.

136
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:52,770
They didn't evacuate the aircraft, they towed
it.

137
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:57,850
1969 Scandinavian.

138
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,450
Failed to watch the altitude.

139
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,480
15 people killed.

140
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,420
1972, Eastern 401.

141
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,710
Famous crash.

142
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,770
Landing gear problem.

143
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,920
They disenaged the auto pilot by accident.

144
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:22,240
Causing 99 fatalities when they crashed into
the Everglades.

145
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,360
And then the big one.

146
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,420
Tenerife airport disaster.

147
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:33,440
27 March 1977.

148
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:46,760
I have never heard properly the opening lines
to Knowing me, knowing you before.

149
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,600
They were number 1 at the time of the crash.

150
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,040
It is 6 in the evening.

151
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,990
We are at Los Rodeos Tenerife.

152
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,980
The airport name is changed to Tenerife north.

153
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:10,010
Flight numbers are tend to be put out of service.

154
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,600
They did it with this airport as well.

155
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,390
They built a new airport.

156
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,440
This is a cascade failure.

157
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,920
A chain of errors.

158
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,120
Leading to a fatal disaster.

159
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,990
It starts off with a bomb that explodes in
Las Palmas.

160
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,350
The airport in Gran Canaria.

161
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:37,440
By seperatists, protesting against the Franco
regime.

162
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,670
Franco dies later that year.

163
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,920
And there was another bomb warning given.

164
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,420
Although there wasn't another bomb.

165
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:56,970
They closed the airport and diverted all flights
to

166
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,550
Los Rodeos.

167
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,870
It is relatively high altitude.

168
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,870
600 meters.

169
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:11,270
It has a problem with dense low clouds.

170
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,190
It had this at the time.

171
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,160
They had an unusual amount of traffic.

172
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,020
Normally they didn't see much.

173
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:23,130
Now their airport is full.

174
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:29,130
The 2 aircraft in question are the Klm flight
4805.

175
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,350
With 248 people.

176
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:37,540
And PanAm with 396 people.

177
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,890
These both 747.

178
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:45,530
Both flew international.

179
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:53,300
So, and I pulled this diagram of Wikipedia.

180
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,060
And adjusted it to fit.

181
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,750
This is what happened.

182
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:02,070
The Klm flight was first to take off.

183
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,490
It was blocking all of the others.

184
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:12,800
The apron where the aircraft park was jammed
full with aircraft.

185
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,100
They couldn't use the normal taxi way.

186
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,510
That runs across the top.

187
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,120
So the Klm flight is first to take off.

188
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,760
It runs to the back of the entry, turns around.

189
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,480
And the Pan Am follows quickly afterwards.

190
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,110
With the intend to turn off.

191
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:40,440
They are confused which taxi to use.

192
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:52,060
They are told when asked for clarification
to use the 3rd one.

193
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,510
For whatever reason, you can see the Pan Am
misses.

194
00:14:54,510 --> 00:15:01,470
It is clear they didn't know where they were
on the runway.

195
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,470
That's okay.

196
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,100
The control tower knows they are on the runway.

197
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:16,160
The Klm flight piloted by a very experienced
captain.

198
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,240
The chief instructor at the end.

199
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,780
He gets lined up.

200
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,250
We don't have clearance.

201
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:29,380
Air traffic control clearance.

202
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,780
So he says to go ahead and ask.

203
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,340
And so they asked the tower, they give the
clearance.

204
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,480
Atc.

205
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,170
They repeat the instructions back.

206
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:51,570
Now what happens is something that is really
quite seriously horrible.

207
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:56,630
Because the tower responds with okay.

208
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:03,530
And what you see there is the normal type
is what both aircraft can hear.

209
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:10,990
Due to radio interference only Pan Am can
hear it.

210
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:23,050
Klm hears: Okay.

211
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:28,730
They don't hear: Stand by for take off, I
will call you.

212
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:36,310
They don't hear: No, uhm.

213
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:43,160
They do both hear papa alpha one seven three
six report the runway clear.

214
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:50,860
I don't know if Klm thought it was clear.

215
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,110
The tower was reporting runway clear.

216
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,110
It never calls.

217
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,110
It could be confusing.

218
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,110
Either way, they push forward the engines.

219
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:11,220
The flight engineer says, the American is
clear.

220
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:21,009
And gets a definite jawel from 
the captain.

221
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:28,390
Jawel for those who don't speak Dutch: Absofuckinglutely.

222
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,810
The flight engineer...

223
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:38,059
They can't see eachother.

224
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:39,950
Suddenly they start to see the lights.

225
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,720
He says, there is.

226
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,200
That goddam son of a bitch is coming.

227
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,899
They turn it.

228
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:51,809
Engines on full.

229
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:54,059
Rather unusual manoeuvre.

230
00:17:54,059 --> 00:18:02,830
And tries to get into the exit 4.

231
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:08,480
As they Klm flight rolls down they call V1.

232
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,529
If you have been in an aircraft.

233
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:20,200
You know where the aircraft can tip back,
rotate.

234
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
That's V1.

235
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,830
They are V1 at that point.

236
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,059
It means their nose is pointed up.

237
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:33,720
They cannot see the runway if it is clear.

238
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,190
The captain sees the Pan Am flight.

239
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:41,679
And pulls back even harder.

240
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:48,129
Where the rear of the aircraft strikes the
runway.

241
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:51,650
With a big hole.

242
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,299
He manages to get it airborn.

243
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:57,970
But they are full of fuel.

244
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,870
They cannot clear.

245
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,659
You get this impact.

246
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:10,220
This is what the transcript says.

247
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,899
Explamation, expletive.

248
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:19,900
That's actually the last that anyone will
hear from the Klm flight.

249
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,779
It impacts.

250
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:24,769
More or less breaking apart.

251
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:28,210
All the way down the runway.

252
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,330
Everyone is killed on that.

253
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,330
Instantly.

254
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:37,610
The fact it is full of fuel, the fire is horrific.

255
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,680
The fire crew immediately head to the Klm
flight.

256
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,680
They are not aware of 2 aircraft.

257
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:52,090
They mistake Pan Am for another piece of wreckage.

258
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:58,190
When they get there, 61 survivors have escaped
by themselves.

259
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:05,080
335 people are in the aircraft, waiting what
to do.

260
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:11,150
A top tip when you get in, listen to the safety
briefing, plan your exit.

261
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:15,200
It may come as a surprise you might need to
use it.

262
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:22,049
So, the airline industry started using crew
resource management.

263
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:28,289
Which is a doctrine where everyone in the
crew maintains situational awareness.

264
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:30,250
Knowing what is going on.

265
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,499
Knowing there is another plane.

266
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:38,559
All this information must be shared in the
team.

267
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,830
Planning decision making should be shared.

268
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,460
Although you have a single leader who makes
the decision.

269
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:51,789
Every one is voiced their objections.

270
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:57,070
Communication inside and outside the cockpit
are vital.

271
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,740
And inside and outside the team.

272
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,289
And good teamwork.

273
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:06,019
Everyone gets on with the tasks they need
to.

274
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:10,890
Rather than trying to get to do the same task.

275
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,450
This isn't a leadership talk.

276
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:23,740
This is a talk about a lot of people dying
a hideous death.

277
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,990
Leading people is just one person's job.

278
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,049
And effective teamwork is everybody's job.

279
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:35,809
The entire team needs to be involved.

280
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:45,690
So, crew management is taken on by United
in 1980, followed by talks by Nasa.

281
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,970
In their Apollo program.

282
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:57,740
It was thought this was going to help minimize
crew problems, failures.

283
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,320
In the future.

284
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:07,799
So, what happens if a crew faces what normally
would be a non survivable incident?

285
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:12,280
They have excellent crew resource management.

286
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:22,330
So, this would be United 232.

287
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:28,740
On 19 July 1989, at 3.15 in the afternoon.

288
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,850
Near Sioux City, Iowa.

289
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,640
A 3-engined airliner.

290
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,779
Was flying from Denver to Chicago.

291
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:40,240
296 souls.

292
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:49,559
An unusual number was children.

293
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:56,390
After 3.15, the rear central engine blew.

294
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:03,889
They fan, main turbine disk shattered into
several pieces.

295
00:23:03,889 --> 00:23:08,260
And the pieces went through the tailpipe assembly.

296
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:14,769
What that left United 232 with was 2 problems.

297
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:23,249
Firstly the aircraft had a tendency to turn
to the right because of the damage.

298
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:26,690
Left alone it would flip itself over completely.

299
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:30,690
You don't want to do that.

300
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,120
That is not a major problem.

301
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,441
You have the aircraft controls to compensate.

302
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:39,250
Move it back.

303
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,309
This would be a problem if they lost all the
hydrolics.

304
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:45,240
Which they had.

305
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,279
All 3 hydrolic systems were made inoperative.

306
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:58,159
Each is driven by an engine.

307
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,529
All of the hydrolic fluid drained out of the
system.

308
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:10,619
The flight engineer on the radio says, this
is united 232.

309
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:13,159
We blew nummer 2, we lost all hydraulics.

310
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:20,570
We are only able to control with asymmetrical
power settings.

311
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:27,360
They had no rudders or speed breaks or even
a little break on the wheels.

312
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,879
Should they land.

313
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:35,149
The maintenance then had a really interesting
amusing conversation.

314
00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:41,190
You still have 1 and 3?

315
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:50,580
No, you have 1 and 2?

316
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:56,090
This was calculated as being a 10 to the 9th
to 1 chance.

317
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:04,429
The United have checklists for all, except
this one.

318
00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:09,169
It is deemed impossible and unsurvivable.

319
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:12,820
The captain said, we are trying to go straight.

320
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,440
We're not having much luck.

321
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,470
The crew sorted out the engine problem.

322
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,159
Within 14 seconds.

323
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,299
It was then that they realised the plane wasn't
reacting.

324
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:31,470
They started talking all 3 themselves.

325
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:34,350
Every operation they were doing.

326
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,799
Continue using the controls.

327
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:43,750
In case it had effects.

328
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:50,799
Everything they have to do is talk through
as an entire team before they make a decision.

329
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:57,909
Haynes: We didn't do this thing on my last
performance check.

330
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:02,360
Then something remarkable happens.

331
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,900
This is real Hollywood moment.

332
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,760
One of the passengers comes up to help.

333
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:14,190
I'll introduce myself.

334
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:18,549
The passenger introduces himself, Denny Fitch.

335
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:26,059
He has been working for the last 3-4 weeks
as United DC 10 flight instructor.

336
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:31,230
He is the 1 person that you really want in
the cockpit.

337
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,399
This is in part.

338
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:38,960
He is familiar with another crash.

339
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:49,429
Japan Airlines 123.

340
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:53,740
This is the most serious single incident air
disaster after.

341
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,999
1985, 6.24.

342
00:26:55,999 --> 00:27:01,230
It is getting dark.

343
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,830
The plane took off from Tokyo.

344
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:11,919
A 747 short range which carries extra people.

345
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:17,789
A tragedy in itself.

346
00:27:17,789 --> 00:27:25,610
As they flew upto altitude, a bad repair to
a bulkhead causes decompression.

347
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:29,210
I shall use my laserpointer.

348
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,809
Can you see there?

349
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:35,100
There is a bit missing.

350
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:40,570
The vertical stabilizor has been blown off.

351
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:47,130
That has taken out all of the hydraulics.

352
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,490
They managed 35 minutes of flight time.

353
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:53,049
In a very unstable aircraft.

354
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:57,340
They were not only missing control service.

355
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:01,340
They were missing large chunks of the aircraft.

356
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:06,659
They crashed in a remote area.

357
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:12,480
Initial reports suggested no survivors.

358
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:19,149
One of the 4 survivors they found the next
morning said that the heard the helicopter

359
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:25,580
circling, see the lights and it flew off.

360
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:31,909
All the moaning from the other survivors also
faded to nothing.

361
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:32,909
As you might guess.

362
00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:36,830
This is the other one that really freaks me
out.

363
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:40,070
Back to United 232.

364
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,000
I'm looking shaky on time.

365
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,529
- They are also running late.

366
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:48,529
- All right.

367
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:52,570
In that case, I'll take ages!

368
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:57,279
United 232.

369
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,559
Haynes is in no illusions.

370
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,049
He is talking to the cabin crew.

371
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:10,369
I can't remember the name.

372
00:29:10,369 --> 00:29:13,840
She is talking about whether or not they are
going to evacuate.

373
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:22,059
If we are at the front I'll tell you.

374
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:26,460
He comments, won't this be a fun landing?

375
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:32,509
The air crew talk about every decision.

376
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:40,860
One of the decisions they talk about is how
and whether to lower the landing gear.

377
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:45,460
An aircraft can land without a landing gear.

378
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:49,409
On a soft surface it is preferably.

379
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:58,120
Otherwise it will cause more damage.

380
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,629
They decided unanimously to lower it.

381
00:30:00,629 --> 00:30:03,559
There are 2 mechanisms.

382
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:06,830
They decide to crank it down.

383
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:14,879
Which will release some extra hydraulic fluid.

384
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:20,960
So they get closer and closer to Sioux city
airport.

385
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:27,380
Under the very excellent guidance of Kevin.

386
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:34,580
Who is a flight controller who moved to Sioux
City because he was at a busier airport and

387
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,360
didn't like the stress.

388
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,450
You are cleared to land on any runway.

389
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,909
Haynes: Typical humor.

390
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:53,190
You want to be particular and make it a runway?

391
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:59,619
They line up for runway 22, a closed runway.

392
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:02,840
You cannot see the whole of the runway from
the tower.

393
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:09,640
It is also where they have all the emergency
equipment parked.

394
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:14,950
They moved it out of the way.

395
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:24,190
As they are coming in to land, it is incredible
as far as an airport.

396
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:34,190
As they come in, a normal landing in a Dc
10 is 140 knots, 200 feet per minute.

397
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:39,009
They are coming in at 215 knots, and increasing.

398
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:41,889
And 1850 feet per minute.

399
00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:44,389
Nearly 10 times faster than they should be.

400
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:46,460
Is that going to fail?

401
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:57,350
See, I shouldn't have controlled it with Java
script.

402
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:02,190
Let's try it again.

403
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,399
Sorry.

404
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:30,470
This is a similar view than what you get from
the tower.

405
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:39,139
So, Kevin sees that from the tower.

406
00:32:39,139 --> 00:32:44,230
And in his own words, he went down the stairs
and had a little cry.

407
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:48,779
Amazingly, there were survivors.

408
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:52,200
112 were killed.

409
00:32:52,200 --> 00:33:00,179
There is a complication how you measure fatalities.

410
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:01,940
Instantly 1 was killed.

411
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,309
184 survived.

412
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:06,690
Almost 2/3.

413
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:20,619
There was a united captain, one of the very
few survivers from First Class.

414
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:24,489
You can't climb out of an aircraft window.

415
00:33:24,489 --> 00:33:27,950
Yes you can.

416
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:32,470
It comes in, the right wing tips at the last
minute.

417
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:36,590
They couldn't control this.

418
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:41,759
The right wing hits, spills fuel.

419
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:43,309
The tail brakes off.

420
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:47,049
The aircraft flips up.

421
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:50,730
Loses the cockpit, starts breaking apart.

422
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:54,379
It looks like a cartwheel.

423
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:59,080
The whole thing is upside down.

424
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:08,290
The passengers help the crew as much as the
crew helped the passengers.

425
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:11,670
They were unable to release themselves.

426
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:18,440
1 passenger out of the hole of the side, went
back in, because he heard a baby cry.

427
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:24,610
It was thrown into the overhead luggage bins.

428
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:30,260
What happened to the crew.

429
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:34,480
The cockpit wreckage was found over half way.

430
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:42,100
It goes down to there.

431
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:46,280
This is a part of the plane that should be
10 feet high.

432
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:55,850
They found it because the flight engineer
had his arms stuck up through the wires.

433
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:58,560
There were people inside.

434
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:08,440
They found the entire flight crew alive, battered
and injured, but all of them alive.

435
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,180
Amazingly, all of the crew survived and returned
to work.

436
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:16,810
Most of them to work.

437
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:22,980
Denny was sitting behind operating the throttles.

438
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,660
He would never fly again.

439
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,480
He managed to 11 months later.

440
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,320
On DC 10's.

441
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,160
- 30 seconds.

442
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,860
- That's good.

443
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:47,290
So, these quotes from a talk by Hanes.

444
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,490
You can find it on Youtube.

445
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:57,690
Up until 1980 we worked on the concept that
the captain was the authority.

446
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,290
And we had a 103 years of flying experience.

447
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,980
There in the cockpit.

448
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,670
Trying to get that airplane on the ground.

449
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,130
Not one minute of which we had practiced.

450
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:10,040
Any one of us.

451
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:16,040
If I hadn't used Crm, it is a cinch we wouldn't
have made it.

452
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:23,830
The work we do for most of us, will never
involve human lives, anything like that.

453
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:29,940
But, nevertheless, you can learn a lot from
how to do teamwork the aviation way.

454
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,940
Thanks very much.
