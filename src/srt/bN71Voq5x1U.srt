1
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,480

so I just wanna kind of start off here

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,630
with how we take keyboard input so this

3
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,189
example is actually from our game engine

4
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,369
but it the same concept applies when we

5
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:30,840
do something like hit a left arrow key

6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,360
for holding it down we know that in our

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,930
iteration of the game loop if there's

8
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,160
something pressed like a left arrow

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,989
we're going to like move a character or

10
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:41,940
we're going to do something because we

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,070
know the state so outside of the game

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,410
loop we have events happening events

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,769
firing such as key presses so we're

14
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:51,540
going to save that state or if there's

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,309
multiple key presses all of that sort of

16
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,320
thing we want abstract so keyboards

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,610
pretty simple and I'm just going to move

18
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,430
on from keyboard mouse is as simple as

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,530
well but it's a little more involved now

20
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,080
that we have touch devices right

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,760
everyone has a least a phone with a

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,670
touch device with a touch screen on it

23
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:13,200
and when you have touched devices you

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,700
could have multiple inputs right you

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,920
could have multiple points so the

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,240
easiest thing to do is that if a game

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,270
you're you have a game that supports a

28
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,130
mouse and you're moving things around on

29
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,780
the screen you could just grab the first

30
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,990
point and again we sort of abstract that

31
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,210
in our game engine we take the position

32
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,009
in the mouse if it's a it's a touch

33
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,380
device will just take the first one and

34
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,850
like I said emulate that to mouth so you

35
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,320
only have to worry about mouse and

36
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,310
that's fine um however there's a lot

37
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,679
more things you can do than just moving

38
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:48,060
a single finger on screen so we want to

39
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,850
handle that so one of the things that we

40
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,649
did with the game engine was we

41
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:54,149
incorporated at a library recently

42
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:56,640
called hammer j/s which is really cool

43
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,649
because it it does a lot of the stuff

44
00:01:58,649 --> 00:01:59,729
that we didn't want to do there's a lot

45
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,109
of math involved in things like pinch

46
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:04,319
zoom and swiping and and all these

47
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,640
gestures but again these gestures don't

48
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,009
happen the same timing is our game loop

49
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,730
so we want to do is is listen for a

50
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,250
gesture such as swipe and then put that

51
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,260
somewhere that our game loop is going to

52
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,850
pick up and maybe deal with and and

53
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,150
throw away or whatever but that way we

54
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,980
can abstract that it's just a it's an

55
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,110
ambi module or pull it in we we build it

56
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,450
into the game and we're good so it's the

57
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,050
real real quick demo on how that works

58
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,520
when we have here's a bunch of isometric

59
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,730
zombies if we're moving a mouse around

60
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,170
we're told in something on-screen you

61
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,120
know every iteration we can go towards a

62
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,490
point no but if we want to do a gesture

63
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,550
such as a swipe we want to do that once

64
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,530
and throw the event way and so this is

65
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,720
all this is doing its just swiping and

66
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,050
throwing the zombies around the screen

67
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,580
okay so cool gestures okay well that's

68
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,160
why so we got gestures we got masks we

69
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,310
got keyboard that stuff's all cool but

70
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,930
gamepads right we want to play with the

71
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,790
play game with it with a joystick or a

72
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,710
gamepad and this is still prefixed but

73
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,010
we can get from the navigator a list of

74
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,380
game pads now these actually work really

75
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,530
well with in a game loop because we're

76
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,920
not we're not sending event data from

77
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,680
from the controller we're just modifying

78
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,810
well the API is just modifying the state

79
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,130
of the controller so when it's plugged

80
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,950
in and we grab the first one off of that

81
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,800
off that stack refers a player one from

82
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,690
all the buttons and things that will

83
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,959
look when I did show you they'll will

84
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,060
just check the state so I stole this one

85
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,720
directly off of HQ and off of html5

86
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,550
rocks there's just a generic controller

87
00:03:51,550 --> 00:04:00,760
and first demo fail

88
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,300
first it will fail this works really

89
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,190
well usually until you go in front of

90
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:13,020
everybody and tried to do it Oh wrong

91
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,470
sorry okay imagine that there was a

92
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,060
picture of a controller here on the

93
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,590
screen this isn't really all that big of

94
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,740
a deal but all we're doing is we're

95
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,650
checking each button state from a one or

96
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,750
a zero if it's an analog joystick and

97
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,620
we'll get a 0 to 0 1 a floating point or

98
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,060
to negative 1 depending on the axis so

99
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,880
so that's fine that all that that

100
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,650
stuff's all cool but I i call this

101
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,900
postmodern game input devices because

102
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,190
all that stuff is sort of the current

103
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,510
state right i mean the gamepad api is

104
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,160
new but that's what we're used to

105
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,260
playing games with as those sorts of

106
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,930
things so the first one I want to do

107
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,770
there's been a few of these demos come

108
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,830
out lately is using a phone as a gamepad

109
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:06,810
right go to iTunes or Google Play grab a

110
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,970
nap but there is an app for that and

111
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,480
it's just called a browser like don't go

112
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,140
and install anything so let's see here I

113
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,660
gotta time this just right or or you

114
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,610
guys can really screw me up because I'm

115
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:27,780
showing a QR code ok also there's a

116
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,640
bitly link if you guys really want to

117
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,550
mess with me while I'm doing a demo so

118
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,490
sort of what if you guys were in Remy's

119
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,230
talk earlier he was taking orientation

120
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,810
events from a device i'm in this case

121
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,470
this is pretty simple box2d stuff and

122
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,210
all i'm doing is applying torque to the

123
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,920
wheels based on the orientation that i'm

124
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,130
headed in also it's really easy to get

125
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,390
the thing stuck so why not just omit

126
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,850
event like a button to flip the vehicle

127
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,460
over now the the reason I had a QR code

128
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,000
and a bitly link was so that i can make

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,680
sure to join the same web socket the

130
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,410
page goes to a web socket just grab some

131
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,140
random ID the phone has to go to that

132
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,930
same go to that same web socket so that

133
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,430
we got controls so ok cool we've got

134
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,090
we've got web sockets phone controller

135
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,129
so we're going to need a gamepad we just

136
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:25,650
use our phone okay thank you but you

137
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,780
have to use your hands that's like a

138
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,969
baby's toy right we don't want to use

139
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:31,319
their hands for this what I want to do

140
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,370
we want to maybe use the camera to track

141
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,629
our face now I'm not going to deal with

142
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:37,889
this one this was actually pretty cool

143
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:39,840
this is of course if you're a unicorn

144
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,680
you're going to catch doughnuts so a

145
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,569
company called be real software they did

146
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:49,590
a google hangout app where it's tracking

147
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,680
your head and you catch doughnuts in a

148
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,789
hangout so this isn't a w3c spec it's

149
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:59,430
just an API I don't know the magic

150
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,449
behind it actually but it's pretty

151
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:02,490
straightforward when you're creating a

152
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,340
google hangout a google hangout

153
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,740
extension we've got events that we can

154
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,650
have gun to the track event that that

155
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,509
gets passed into this event here that

156
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:14,759
the track event object has all the

157
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,039
things that you'd expect like your noses

158
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,039
XY your eyes some of that type of

159
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,229
information so that you can do all kinds

160
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:24,180
of crazy stuff in the Hangout so face

161
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,580
tracking would be cool if that was just

162
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,139
a speck and we could just use it for

163
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,240
other things but kind of anything to

164
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,889
play around if you're into doing hangout

165
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:39,150
apps ok we want to talk to a browser by

166
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,050
talking to a browser right like why why

167
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,550
wouldn't we just do voice rec why

168
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,750
couldn't we just tell the game what we

169
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,169
want to do so we have something for that

170
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,060
and this is actually expect the web

171
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,889
speech API of course prefix right now

172
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:56,879
all we have to do is create one of these

173
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,279
web speech recognition objects and we

174
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,800
can do some events on that now this demo

175
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,979
is very dependent on how well the

176
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:06,360
internet connection is working here so

177
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,060
let's see if I can do another demo fail

178
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:15,310
here

179
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,390
aah aah sorry aah I allowed it on the

180
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,700
last machine oh by the way just like

181
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,110
with it web RTC web speech you have to

182
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,370
run it on HTTPS or you're going to get

183
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,600
that allow every time and this is a

184
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,880
little bit worse because look it's

185
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,320
taking my voice here why don't I do the

186
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:44,620
demo first and then okay up right up ah

187
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,810
there we go okay so it worked sort of

188
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:55,010
left left well this isn't perfect right

189
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,720
it's a neat concept we can talk to the

190
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,940
things we have a few issues one of them

191
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,460
being that like it has more on an HBS if

192
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,770
it doesn't we have to allow it every

193
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,510
time we have to allow every time we want

194
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,370
to take speech input also this is very

195
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,740
network dependent because it's really

196
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,020
just sending waveforms back up to Google

197
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,430
servers where they're translating and

198
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,900
sending events back and there's a little

199
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,950
bit of bugs and some of the way the

200
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,220
events work but theoretically we should

201
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,890
be able to do voice rec using a standard

202
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,380
API to move things around on a screen

203
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:30,500
and okay so so cool we have web speech

204
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,990
okay now these are we're going to fun

205
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,870
and probably more reliable 3d tracking

206
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:39,440
so everybody see that new xbox one thing

207
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,600
they're like it's not a don't think it's

208
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,790
a peripheral I think it's part of it now

209
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,830
Microsoft has kinect which takes 3d data

210
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:50,150
in um there's also leap motion which is

211
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:54,320
right here now i really like late motion

212
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,850
leap motion school first of all it's

213
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,860
just this cool little little device here

214
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,470
but what leap motion is doing right and

215
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,120
if there's any hardware manufacturers in

216
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,380
the room or anybody working on a cool

217
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:08,500
project their driver is a is a WebSocket

218
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,510
so well their drivers a bunch of code

219
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,550
but they give you a WebSocket when you

220
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:19,670
install their driver and

221
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,310
and mad when it's running okay let's see

222
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:30,040
if this is right okay the the localhost

223
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,350
should have should have a web socket

224
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,360
emitting data from this thing so this

225
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,050
actually takes in a bunch of a bunch of

226
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,420
image data and the web socket is going

227
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,560
to give us back just the things we're

228
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,210
interested so what you let's see here

229
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,890
let's look at the first one so okay cool

230
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,810
so it's working all I'm doing here is

231
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,760
taking x y and z data in the form of

232
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,760
point ables so the what the local web

233
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,290
socket gives us as soon as we connect to

234
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,840
it it starts streaming of all this

235
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,190
position information it also gives us

236
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,850
some things like like the palm and the

237
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:11,410
javascript library that it there's a

238
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,690
javascript library on github that leap

239
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,320
Motion's putting out gives us a bunch of

240
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,390
other things some other event we could

241
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,500
smack down on I think it's a little bit

242
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,820
more difficult to do like a wave thing

243
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,830
because we have all the fingers stacked

244
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,590
up it's looking at in this way but butt

245
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,810
smacking down on it works a bunch of

246
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,020
other of other gestures I'm encapsulate

247
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,100
look stuff pretty well for you so we

248
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,810
just have to make a connection to the

249
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,390
late controller and then every frame

250
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,330
that the thing gives us in this case I'm

251
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,550
putting it on the on the game so we're

252
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,990
keeping the state of those pointa bowls

253
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,120
now this is also important when we

254
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,260
consider our game loop is going to end

255
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,850
60 times a second this thing is capable

256
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,340
of emitting data I think 120 frames a

257
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,130
second so we don't need all of those

258
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,160
positions and I'm pretty sure we can

259
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,170
control how much data is coming off the

260
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,420
thing but what's important is that we

261
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,430
just want to save the state I didn't

262
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,320
given point when we render so the demo

263
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,810
moving my hands around on it I'm just

264
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,480
saving the state of each point of all

265
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,340
four fingers in that case and just

266
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,130
drawing them in my draw loop in my game

267
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:19,030
okay what would be slightly more useful

268
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:23,560
is actually in a game if we if we were

269
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,240
to do something out this game in

270
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,860
particular it's a pretty simple game

271
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,450
everybody's played breakouts and what's

272
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,630
cool about this particular breakouts is

273
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,800
anybody you to do NBC

274
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,250
to NBC is like a well I can't talk and

275
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,010
do this at the same time up to do it

276
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,339
yeah I'm going to fail to do NBC is

277
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:44,649
really cool because it's a list of a

278
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:47,200
bunch of different NBC implementation so

279
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,970
you can figure out which NBC or envy

280
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,890
star or envy whatever API that you want

281
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,700
to use that things still going just die

282
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:03,070
okay good breakouts is like the to NBC

283
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,720
of html5 games so check that out Matt

284
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,800
grierson a great job putting that

285
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,709
together our open source engine is one

286
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:10,810
of the ones on there so if you if you

287
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,769
want to get into and just kind of see

288
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:13,329
which game engines for you go check that

289
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:19,600
out okay so let's see here I'm running a

290
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,959
little head so cool that's cool right

291
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,079
but we all want to wear the things and

292
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,190
you guys probably know where this is

293
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,800
headed next right we want to wear our

294
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,690
computers won't have them right there in

295
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,790
our eyes so what are we going to use

296
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,810
project glass actually this thing is I

297
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,000
know it's goofy but this is really cool

298
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,020
some of the stuff that's happening in

299
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,390
here okay not only like everything to me

300
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,649
is the heads up display right awesome

301
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:46,390
having a heads-up display um there's a

302
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,680
bunch of really cool sensors in here

303
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,740
there's a wink sensor you know there's a

304
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,529
touchpad on here so there's all kinds of

305
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:56,110
stuff on here that I want to use and I

306
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,750
want to you know do game stuff with and

307
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,290
the default way of doing interaction

308
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,660
with this guy is using what's called the

309
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,260
mirror API now your glass talks to

310
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,360
Google servers makes rest calls out to

311
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,130
some other service there's some o op

312
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,870
involved you can get a twitter

313
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:21,430
notification all that stuff is cool but

314
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,810
it doesn't really help me to move

315
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,579
characters around the screen so much or

316
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:27,880
to get characters from here or do

317
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,640
multiplayer up here or any of that so I

318
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,880
want to do more real-time applications

319
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,990
so i put together something called face

320
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:38,709
which is basically websockets using a

321
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:42,370
java library one of the things that I

322
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,649
like about what Chris and others are

323
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:46,150
doing with no

324
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,900
durand with fermata is that I don't

325
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,010
really want right and CEO and writing

326
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:54,190
JavaScript and if you have this firmware

327
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,980
on an Arduino you could connect a serial

328
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,060
port and you could use stuff without

329
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,450
Arduino and JavaScript well similarly I

330
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,560
don't know how many of you want to write

331
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,160
in Android and in Java but I'm trying to

332
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,620
do some of that for you by just exposing

333
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,010
a bunch of this stuff that's in glass to

334
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:16,330
a web socket so I go to this application

335
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,330
there's a little launcher well one other

336
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:22,480
thing there's a USB port on here and put

337
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,070
in debug mode so you could side load

338
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,780
android for or four things there's a

339
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,640
couple of web socket implementations in

340
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,460
Java pull those in put up a heads-up

341
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,750
display so we can kind of see what we're

342
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:38,410
doing and go to this application I could

343
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,690
send messages to it ap R stands for

344
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,770
azimuth which is orientation this way

345
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:50,680
pitch is this way and roll and of course

346
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,180
error message is a couple of buttons to

347
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,520
do some navigation with and that channel

348
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,100
ID you can imagine that channel ID is

349
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,500
what I a WebSocket I want to connect to

350
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,390
or I'm going to connect to a web socket

351
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,430
I must say go to this channel and I'm

352
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,770
putting in my eye so when I do this down

353
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,630
what you guys can go to that one and

354
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,430
screw me up because I could see what the

355
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:16,060
channel isn't here I didn't want to for

356
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,380
the type of allocations I want to build

357
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,490
I didn't want to go to a third-party

358
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,920
server I just wanted to go to some node

359
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,440
server so glass here is running this

360
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,230
face application talking to know doing

361
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,820
web sockets off to some other client or

362
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,410
multiple clients or whatever you want to

363
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:35,740
do and since I have that running I can

364
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,040
see what the channel ID is in here let's

365
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,370
see here umm this is a really cool 3j s

366
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,730
demo that I just took off the 3gs site

367
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,050
but I wanted to do a little bit of

368
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:52,110
integration with data

369
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:58,960
from the glass so what's up um so that

370
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,370
you guys don't put in the channel and

371
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,950
screw up my demo alright so we've got

372
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,900
some orientation events right do we have

373
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,490
orientation events yes we have

374
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,120
orientation events okay um but like I

375
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,170
said I like putting these things

376
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,650
together right i like i like that we

377
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,540
have WebGL and we have web sockets and

378
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,329
we got one of these so why not put them

379
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:28,030
together peacock right okay so why not

380
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:32,260
take the events on to take our

381
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,090
orientation events do a little bit of

382
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,140
WebSocket integration here and and

383
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,370
expect that bluetooth is going to

384
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:43,360
transmit stuff back to the anyway so get

385
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,860
the concept connect all the things

386
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:53,100
WebSocket wow that's weird

387
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:58,070
anyways I'm guessing there we go all

388
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:06,340
right cool all right okay no for that

389
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:11,480
all right I am actually that's really

390
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,430
about all I got um I just want everybody

391
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,350
to connect all the things right connect

392
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,050
all the things web sockets are your glue

393
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,270
right all these devices we plug them in

394
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,190
we talked to node we bounce stuff around

395
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,400
we do stupid disco demos with WebGL and
