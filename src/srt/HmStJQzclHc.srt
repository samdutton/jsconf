00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,719

how about like Sexton my talk is on CSS

2
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:15,919
colors specifically the named ones and I

3
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,260
know we deep dive into a lot of

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,840
technical stuff a lot so I wanted to

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,870
deep dive into some history so there's

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,130
not a lot of code in this talk but

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,840
hopefully you find it pretty interesting

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,289
I do the colors black and white I

9
00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:37,640
realized that's a mistake now what are

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,699
they Webster's dictionary defines a

11
00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:45,890
color as so I was going to do the

12
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,659
Webster's dictionary defines joke but I

13
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:49,309
didn't have to because this is a real

14
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:52,699
website for the Webster's dictionary and

15
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:54,979
it's pretty it's the worst website I've

16
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:55,640
ever been to

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,589
so that's the real joke stay in school

18
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:03,379
so color it says is a quality such as

19
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:05,780
red blue green yellow

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,090
etc that you see when you look at

21
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,969
something so now that we have that

22
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:11,659
background

23
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:15,649
what's x11 can't really understand what

24
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:17,149
x11 is without understanding a few other

25
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:19,539
things first namely letters and numbers

26
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:22,039
we're more specifically a letter and a

27
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:26,450
number of which the set is x + 1 X 11 is

28
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,969
this sweet gooey I haven't actually read

29
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:34,130
what's on that screen I hope it's cool X

30
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,369
set seems it seems very relevant that

31
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:38,210
was on purpose

32
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,180
the colors here it looked like various

33
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,899
greys maybe a black or to the the teal

34
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:50,140
looking color is a light C green MIT

35
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,750
specifically the MIT Media Lab was

36
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,909
pretty infiltrated with like a bunch of

37
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:58,340
companies in Boston at the time namely

38
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,920
Deccan Tektronix so you'll see a lot of

39
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,499
those people show up but MIT Media labs

40
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:06,289
where it's at that's where X was created

41
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:08,899
so the first colors show up in RGB txt

42
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:13,459
in actually x10 so if anyone tries to

43
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:13,810
call

44
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,520
x11 colors they're absolutely right but

45
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,560
you could like undermine them and tell

46
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,680
them well actually the colors come from

47
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:27,220
x10 r3 it's not as catchy so 1987 was

48
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,989
actually the first release august 18th

49
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:32,769
1987 i think i was two months old at the

50
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:33,250
time

51
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,450
there were 69 colors in RGB txt and when

52
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,400
i first wrote the slides for this no one

53
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,200
really knew the original author of the

54
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,510
RGB txt file but since then the x.org

55
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,350
organization reached out to me and let

56
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,580
me know that it was jim gettys

57
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,830
so thanks x.org sweet fix for my

58
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,390
presentation

59
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,810
there are 138 entries because well at

60
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,940
the time because they did a camel case

61
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,440
and lower case spaced as well because of

62
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,750
course you would they were listed in

63
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,690
mostly alphabetical order and they were

64
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,019
tuned for the deck VT 240 serious

65
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:15,970
terminals that is one it looks very

66
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,190
green that's because the color they were

67
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,190
using there was green and that was it

68
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,570
so March 24th 1988 seven months after

69
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,640
the first release very close to my

70
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,799
birthday its March 13th for those of you

71
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:32,530
with pens and paper was a huge release

72
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,940
for colours we added three new colors

73
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:40,030
brown gray and gray and you you may be

74
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,950
thinking that sounds a lot like a law

75
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:47,920
firm but these were the colors in x11 r2

76
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,989
and you may also be thinking hey that

77
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:52,420
brown looks red and are those Gray's the

78
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,480
same color the brown is very red and

79
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,209
those Gray's are the same color gray

80
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:00,400
spelled both ways was intentionally

81
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,079
added because some programmers at HP

82
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:03,549
couldn't remember which one was right

83
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:05,560
for the record in the States

84
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,560
it's a and in England

85
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,680
it's ESO America and England they start

86
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,340
with the right letter for for you this

87
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,350
is all domestic at the time though so it

88
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,049
should have probably never made it in

89
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:24,090
yeah so update literally this morning

90
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,380
five hours ago when I put this slide

91
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,160
again so maybe

92
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,180
ten hours now chrome blink added all the

93
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,340
ease it traditionally didn't work in

94
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,380
browsers this happened this is new

95
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,840
history this morning literally this

96
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,260
morning you can now use geo re UI more

97
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,420
of that I thought they should have done

98
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,510
this though if you're going to go for it

99
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:55,300
go all the way so October 27 1988 was

100
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,340
released three there are a hundred and

101
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,990
one variants of gray added this is my

102
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:06,120
101 dalmatians joke slide very cruel

103
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,050
Cruella Corolla whatever the hundred and

104
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,410
one variants of gray were suggested and

105
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:19,300
added by mark mores this was he was from

106
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,550
the University of Toronto September 3rd

107
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,470
1988 was when he was added I didn't go

108
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,240
back to find this picture this is the

109
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,550
picture that he currently has on his

110
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,640
current site the hundred and one Gray's

111
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,710
were gray zero gray one grade to grade

112
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,330
three I have some more slides they were

113
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,620
in this very clear 3-2 interval you know

114
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:49,660
3 5 8 10 13 15 18 sorry I thought the

115
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,780
intervals were funny except for that a

116
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,970
month and a half later I don't know why

117
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,380
it took so long but a month and a half

118
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,790
later they went in and added all the

119
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,350
misspellings too so there are actually

120
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,630
two hundred two grades there were like

121
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,580
eight commits in between adding the

122
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,380
grades and adding the ease like it's

123
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,169
just like too much to type I guess so

124
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:10,510
luckily those are all now in CSS color

125
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,570
level 4 you just have to add parens and

126
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,919
percentages and it's actually pretty

127
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:17,350
close to what it used to be still

128
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,630
disappointed also in this release

129
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,480
they moved white from 252 across the

130
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,310
board to 255 across the board very

131
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,020
important fix

132
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,740
I wonder what 255 255 255 was called

133
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,770
before my suggestions were really white

134
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,870
or light white

135
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,430
they did that because white now equals

136
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,520
gray 100 before gray 100 was whiter than

137
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,000
white that's what a lot of people say

138
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,900
about me too

139
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,390
this a commit actually just after that

140
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,340
release was the introduction of sandy

141
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,620
brown which is one of my favorite colors

142
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,770
this is one of 40 commits their 40

143
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,560
commits total RGB txt and this is one of

144
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,430
them all they did was add sandy brown in

145
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,350
the commit message just added sandy

146
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,840
brown and you may notice like hey

147
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,340
there's something wrong with that so

148
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,190
over two months later one of the other

149
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,890
of the 40 commits is they fixed the

150
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,860
camel casing in sandy brown very

151
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,000
important color I hope you're still

152
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,870
using it five percent of all commits to

153
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,630
RGB txt are sandy brown related I

154
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,320
personally like sandy brown though

155
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,690
because there's gotta be like a thousand

156
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,640
sandy Browns that exist

157
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,220
like people have no idea that their acts

158
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,680
11 color specifically this guy has no

159
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,170
idea he kind of looks sandy brown - for

160
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,720
what it's worth

161
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,540
1989 was like a huge release not in the

162
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,010
joking way that I've already made twice

163
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,010
in a real way we got Alice blue which is

164
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,590
white on these projectors Alice blue is

165
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,270
named after Alice in Wonderland's dress

166
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,830
that's a fun one

167
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,410
there's blanched almond this fuchsia

168
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,700
there's Thomas fuchsia lemon chiffon

169
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,440
papaya whip peach puff those were just a

170
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,720
list of some of my favorites but this

171
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,510
this was where the the the real people

172
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,130
came together Paul raveling and John C

173
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,200
Thomas were these two dudes on the x

174
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,050
windows mailing list and Jim Fulton was

175
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,610
the maintainer of the filed so these

176
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,020
three people together kinda had this

177
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,210
culmination of new ideas on how we

178
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:40,099
should name colors Jim I actually talked

179
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:41,960
crap about the last time I talked about

180
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,969
this I now that I have all the commits

181
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:45,589
he did some good stuff this is my

182
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:47,420
favorite Jim Fulton commit

183
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,820
he took out transparent which was pretty

184
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,260
much

185
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,760
black and not transparent it was just

186
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,640
not quite black which so as long as your

187
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,130
backgrounds are black transparent should

188
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,510
look fine for you I guess the second

189
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,120
pass Jim Fulton commit was removed blank

190
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,690
line

191
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:13,630
boy what a stupid program that's 2.5

192
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:20,170
percent of our DB T X T so the raveling

193
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,070
RGB txt his version of the colors come

194
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,720
from comp table window said X this news

195
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,580
group before we had forums and really a

196
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,540
lot of other stuff on October 1989 it

197
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,790
was tuned to match his specific HP

198
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,160
monitor so everything you used today is

199
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,160
tuned specifically to one dudes HP

200
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,230
monitor from 1989 and he when he when he

201
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,520
said that he did give a model number

202
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,810
either so I'm just assuming there was

203
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,680
one HP monitor at the time it was a

204
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,180
response to one of his co-workers that

205
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,150
said that's wheat and so he took it upon

206
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,830
himself to change the color of wheat so

207
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:01,030
it looked more like wheat and so he went

208
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,340
and he said a lot of the names came from

209
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,320
Sinclair paint swatches that he had from

210
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,640
recently paying his house

211
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,010
this is Sinclair paints green enamel

212
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,020
specifically the Sinclair oil company is

213
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,450
that a dinosaur logo at the bottom they

214
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,900
were sold in 1994 by Sinclair oil for 51

215
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,450
million dollars because they violated

216
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,010
the childhood lead poisoning prevention

217
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:26,500
Act of 1991 he's quoted saying by the

218
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,450
way I wanted to find ansi standard

219
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,820
colors but ANSI happily gobbled up my 16

220
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,930
dollars without sending the

221
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,700
specification I ordered then they

222
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,070
ignored my follow-up letter nuts to ANSI

223
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,760
and scare quotes ANSI standards so you

224
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,340
use papaya whip because ANSI never sent

225
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:48,490
Paul raveling some mail this is where we

226
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,440
moved away from mostly alphabetical

227
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,350
order as well he did some rearranging he

228
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,150
added a gradient approach to color

229
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,580
groups so he'd have chocolate which is a

230
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,140
color and saddle brown which is a color

231
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,490
but then he added chocolate one two

232
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:05,400
three four and those colors were like

233
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,650
what is it logarithmic steps darker from

234
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,910
from the original colors but

235
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,960
unfortunately those would sometimes

236
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,760
clash with colors that already existed

237
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,190
and so there would be like two names for

238
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,840
the same color like chocolate four was

239
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,520
the same as saddle brown in this case

240
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,920
and so I looked for a chocolate saddle

241
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,170
brown and that's what came up I would

242
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,390
imagine that's chocolate saddle brown

243
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,960
for specifically the Thomas RGB dxt

244
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:34,260
submitted on Halloween 1989 to the list

245
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,490
that's probably good Halloween joke it

246
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,970
was a response to an email sent to the

247
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,240
list titled this is pink so the two

248
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,550
lists that we use come from this is

249
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,310
wheat and this is pink I thought I was

250
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,160
interesting so this is it the best

251
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,260
section is the pink color in particular

252
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,790
looks like the flesh tone of someone

253
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,170
who's been puking for several hours

254
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,240
would really rather get a bullet in the

255
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,720
head than go on living and so Jhansi

256
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,200
Thomas I responded and the key section

257
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,760
here he says advised by our human

258
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,670
factors folks that standard color of

259
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,620
named colors exist but only for

260
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,180
well-controlled color coordinate systems

261
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,180
like CIE but not for RGB I sat down one

262
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,190
evening with the handiest standard of

263
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,860
subjective color names a box of 72

264
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,320
Crayola Crayons and then he said believe

265
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,560
it or not 50% of the colors from RGB txt

266
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,630
were represented already crayons this is

267
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,850
where x11 colors come from for the most

268
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,370
part you might notice he said 72 a handy

269
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,590
box at 72 crayons and I knew them as a

270
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,960
box of 64 as a kid and I wondered to

271
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,780
myself where is this magical box at 72

272
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,330
in which colors did he pull from it so I

273
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,690
went and I found this is 72 krantz what

274
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,960
had happened is they retired some colors

275
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,320
and then they had left over once so they

276
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,750
put them in a box with the new ones and

277
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,160
called it a collector's edition so they

278
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,320
could get rid of them they're currently

279
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,330
worth over $7 on eBay here are the list

280
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,420
of retired colors you may recognize all

281
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,400
of them as colors that didn't make it

282
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,410
into CSS or even x11 colors so

283
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,089
they ended up not mattering at all and

284
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,360
he could have said box of 64 so it's

285
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,889
really a very worthless part of the

286
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:24,690
tongue

287
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,639
these sense retired colors in crayons

288
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:30,490
that still made it into CSS colors even

289
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,800
our Navajo white and Indian red a lot of

290
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,120
people ask are these colors racist and

291
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,829
I'll preface this with the intent isn't

292
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:41,589
isn't magical is a good phrase here so

293
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:43,930
even if they aren't and people are

294
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,069
offended by them that we should address

295
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:47,639
it but Navajo white is the exact shade

296
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,480
of color on the back of the Navajo flag

297
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,439
now someone could have doctored that

298
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:54,910
because if you read the last sentence in

299
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,879
this slide or in Wikipedia here it says

300
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,879
in 1987 which is wrong the colored

301
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,889
Navajo white was included in the x11

302
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:05,259
color list which is not a thing which

303
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:07,209
after the invention of the World Wide

304
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:09,399
Web in 1991 which is the wrong year

305
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:12,069
became known as the x11 web colors which

306
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:17,649
don't exist so someone should edit that

307
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:21,730
Wikipedia page Indian red oh also Navajo

308
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:26,680
white is FF dead pretty sweet RVT

309
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,149
yeah Indian red actually showed up in

310
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:35,319
the UK in 1792 and it's referring to

311
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:38,740
like like rust oxide type stuff so

312
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,439
totally before that was really a slur

313
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:44,680
so that was likely both of those are

314
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,240
probably not racist

315
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,899
initially Peru on the other hand is a

316
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:51,880
bit of more of a mystery I could find

317
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,220
pretty much no information I was like ah

318
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,990
what what color is the Peruvian flag

319
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,980
it's red and white so I went to

320
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,019
Wikipedia and I saw on the brown page

321
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:05,980
there is a link on the color rather on

322
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,199
the x11 page it links to slash Browns

323
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,389
hash Peru and I was like here's where

324
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:12,189
I'll get my information that doesn't

325
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:15,860
exist

326
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,389
the only thing I could do is a command F

327
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:21,630
for the word Peru on the brown page and

328
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,269
it comes up under the skin color section

329
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:29,190
so Peru is probably racist not the

330
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,240
country the color Krantz that's where we

331
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,060
were so this is pink so over 50% of the

332
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,649
colors were already represented but

333
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:39,690
we're guessing that that's probably

334
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,459
because green and blue and red and

335
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,230
yellow are pretty popular names for

336
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,279
colors so very important Thomas change

337
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,550
was he removed medium goldenrod but

338
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,069
luckily he added pale goldenrod dark

339
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:55,889
goldenrod light goldenrod yellow and

340
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:59,790
light goldenrod I'm not sure what the

341
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,279
difference between those last two were

342
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,899
so these are all in Compton windows

343
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,060
Eric's the second half of this talk is

344
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,829
kind of me reading a lot of emails but

345
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:10,620
hopefully it's worth it to you so Paul

346
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,959
vixie the creator of the more more

347
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,290
well-known Quran the Quran you use today

348
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,940
posts probably before he was doing too

349
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,639
much with crime and he he created the

350
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,370
first color picker with x11 and he

351
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,170
called his color picker reasonably cute

352
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,519
I just thought that was nice

353
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,100
he also posts a bunch of code directly

354
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,470
into an email on a news group and I

355
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,610
thought that was like throwback github

356
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:39,569
1988 this is Bob he nails probably the

357
00:16:39,569 --> 00:16:41,160
best joke on the whole list I read

358
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,660
pretty much every email on this list

359
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,689
there's like 200 posts a year guys so

360
00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:48,360
Bob nails this joke someone asks as a

361
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,860
joke they're trying to be sarcastic they

362
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,810
say could someone please mail the recent

363
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,459
message about using the definitive

364
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,009
restaurant standard box of 64 crayons

365
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:58,130
with the built-in sharpener and Bob

366
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,689
slyly responds back the available

367
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:02,040
reference which someone else posted

368
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,230
already was based on the 72 cran

369
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,030
standard so it was important a later

370
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,579
ANSI Rev than the 64 cran standard but I

371
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,079
think it will serve your purposes the

372
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,780
ISO 497 cran standard is still in

373
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,669
committee the French delegation raised

374
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:16,589
objections to the standard pronunciation

375
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:19,020
of muave so it may be a while longer in

376
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,720
the meantime the 72 box is useful

377
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,250
lighter weight fits in more regularly

378
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,319
shaped box easier to keep sharp less

379
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,120
costly as a replacement time due to

380
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,939
meltdown or

381
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:30,220
cutting slash tattooing and universally

382
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,960
available even though it's not an

383
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,019
international standard Larry well the

384
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:38,549
creator of Perl suggests that instead of

385
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:42,909
naming these silly ways how about we all

386
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:45,149
get a curve fitting program and match

387
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:48,730
this really confusing system for having

388
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,990
your own personal colors tuned to your

389
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,399
own personal monitor which is a pretty

390
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:54,179
good idea but about as confusing as Perl

391
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:58,899
and then he says that he's not going to

392
00:17:58,899 --> 00:18:01,120
write it but at the time he did work for

393
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,480
NASA which is pretty cool so good on him

394
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,830
Jet Propulsion lab actually that's what

395
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,009
the JPL stands for the first is it

396
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:12,159
racist thread showed up at this time in

397
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,889
1992 it was mostly people not

398
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:16,840
understanding why the initial guy

399
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,669
thought it was racist and then other

400
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:20,500
people getting really mad pretty much

401
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,440
the same as today and this person came

402
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,179
in and said hey wouldn't it be cool if

403
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:27,730
we named these colors a little bit

404
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,309
better and she was two years before all

405
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,990
those other people and then no one ever

406
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,639
responded to her email and she missed

407
00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:35,440
out on her opportunity so five years

408
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,940
past we have the next version of x11 rr5

409
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:46,360
and we changed gray from 192 to 190

410
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,159
across the board and that was the last

411
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:52,000
official x11 RGB txt update so how does

412
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,549
this relate to CSS here are some CSS

413
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:57,700
colors all of them they're 140 x11

414
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,450
colors and they were specified in css3

415
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,789
which seems like whoa that seems pretty

416
00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:05,440
recent except for that css3

417
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,830
was of course started in 2001 which is

418
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,399
kind of blew my mind so March 5th 2001

419
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:15,279
tantek posts the list of x11 color

420
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,490
keywords on here and they were really

421
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,950
just codifying web browsers had already

422
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,169
done for years and no one wanted it and

423
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:24,370
they were all really mad about it on the

424
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,590
mailing list the hue distribution was

425
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,480
wrong we saw a different prettier graph

426
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,120
of this earlier this one comes out of a

427
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,909
fun email there are already some HTML

428
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:35,320
colors and this is kind of what Leia

429
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,600
talked about before and they mostly

430
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,820
clashed and so like you'll see like with

431
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,560
lime versus green

432
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,830
gray versus gray we had to make way to

433
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,030
use the old colors we couldn't we

434
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,540
couldn't use it

435
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,640
so first mention of x11 colors

436
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,460
specifically in CSS dates back to 96 by

437
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,120
Chris Lilley he was kind of an asshole

438
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,640
and most of his posts but he was right

439
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,240
so I think that's probably what it takes

440
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,320
to be good in the standards

441
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,820
organizations so also note that just

442
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,880
like before this is his picture on his

443
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,840
current website

444
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,100
I took it right off his website and I

445
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,330
actually think that they're the same

446
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,510
pair of glasses that mark mores the 101

447
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,690
greatest guy wore I think they shared

448
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,810
those and then promised each other that

449
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,920
they would never update their pictures

450
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,990
the WWE style mailing list was also

451
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,200
hilarious this is a good one this is

452
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,100
Chris Lilley again someone says to base

453
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,660
a color model on the basic set of

454
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,400
crayons used by euro protocol children

455
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,470
seems short sighted and he said it would

456
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,240
be if anyone was proposing it I'm not

457
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,020
are you

458
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,910
that was him not realizing that indeed

459
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,190
he was proposing it he just didn't know

460
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,880
where that came from and this guy this

461
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,260
one's not that interesting except for

462
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,180
that he thinks the reason we should use

463
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,180
CMYK is because the the largest use case

464
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:06,080
is for websites is printing them out I

465
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,500
actually laughed out loud whenever I

466
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,010
read that Dylan she even the co-creator

467
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,920
of dojo wrote this nice email whenever

468
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,650
they were getting kind of added to css3

469
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,480
and he's like you're all these old posts

470
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,340
in these archives about everyone

471
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,810
disagree with it so I can't find him and

472
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,580
supports them I don't understand why we

473
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,520
do it I don't understand why these

474
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,590
colors exists and why they're so poorly

475
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,810
named like what is this system that

476
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:36,100
we're using and so his his question in

477
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,580
2002 was recently responded to by me in

478
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,560
2014

479
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,570
I said hey Dylan sorry for the short

480
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:47,320
delay in responding to this but I looked

481
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,210
into where the x11 colors came from and

482
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,980
thought I'd answer your question also I

483
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,870
was only 16 when you asked and Google

484
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,700
hadn't quite index all the old x11 news

485
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,000
group

486
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,620
so it's unlikely that a good helped you

487
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,740
at the time and here's my favorite email

488
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,159
probably in the entire list I already

489
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:04,690
apologized for reading email to you but

490
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:09,309
again this is from Steven Pemberton who

491
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:11,860
also was still pretty active not

492
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,960
necessarily with CSS anymore or stumped

493
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,990
he says congratulations on an excellent

494
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,370
specification many of the new facilities

495
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,289
will be extremely useful with one

496
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:22,960
exception the x11 color names are an

497
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,580
abomination that should have been

498
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,799
stifled at Birth and adding them to CSS

499
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,929
as a blemish on the otherwise excellent

500
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:32,530
design of CSS questionable to say that

501
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,419
x11 color set and their names have been

502
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,090
designed is an insult to the word design

503
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,659
it's just a mess let me describe some of

504
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,210
the problems the set of colors described

505
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,490
is very non-uniform look at and that's

506
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,770
his old graph from before very thank you

507
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,990
thankful for that as an example to see

508
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,030
how the hues are distributed a vast

509
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,950
over-representation of reds just to

510
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,840
start off with the names are just

511
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,820
randomly put together some colors have a

512
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,280
dark version like red and dark red but

513
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,890
not all 17 colors have dark versions but

514
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,289
only 13 have light versions there's a

515
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:07,510
medium blue but not medium red there are

516
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,909
15 varieties of blue but only 6 of red

517
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:11,799
there are cultural references built in

518
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:14,100
Dodger blue later switched to royal blue

519
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,380
so I can neither construct the color I

520
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,299
want nor know the color name refers to

521
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:22,960
Gainsborough papaya whip on top of that

522
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,210
the naming scheme is inconsistent dark

523
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,820
grey is lighter than gray light pink is

524
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,210
darker than pink ok I'll stop using

525
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,760
exclamation marks now he he doesn't say

526
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,309
that he's stopped using punctuation at

527
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:41,890
all but he goes ahead and does that - it

528
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,130
is grey and dark grey but like grey with

529
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,200
an e not anymore

530
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,679
as of today brown is not very brown

531
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,110
actually a dark red what do you expect

532
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,150
the difference is between see green and

533
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:58,120
medium C cream sea green is darker what

534
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,350
do you expect the difference between

535
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,419
aquamarine and medium aquamarine

536
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:04,179
aquamarine is lighter there's a medium

537
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:06,130
violet red in a pale violet red but no

538
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,070
violet red

539
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,260
there's a light goldenrod yellow but no

540
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,260
goldenrod yellow just goldenrod there's

541
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,540
dark olive green but no olive green just

542
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,230
olive

543
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,450
there's pale violet red but no violet

544
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,550
red I'd like to submit an errata first

545
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,540
that's the first period in ten lines but

546
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,950
he also he mentions that there's no

547
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,410
violet there's no violet right on the

548
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,780
first line of that four bar stanza so

549
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,730
see you in if you're watching please fix

550
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,190
that well I could go on but I'll stop

551
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,280
here he does go on you get the picture

552
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,260
there's no possible reason that the x11

553
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,520
names should be added to CSS and then he

554
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,140
goes on to propose I'm actually pretty

555
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,240
good ideas that I think kind of are

556
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,610
being realized in the new stuff that

557
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,650
like I talked about today so yeah go

558
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,950
Steven Pemberton in 2002 Hicks each arms

559
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,480
in with what I assume is his

560
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,950
autoresponder these are merely added to

561
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,140
CSS to codify current practices almost

562
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,940
everybody our browser already supports

563
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,190
them it's not going to change so we

564
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,050
might as well codify it that's that's

565
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:12,440
the in Hickson autoresponder we're just

566
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,270
doing what everyone already does get off

567
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,720
my back

568
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,440
and then the the final email that I

569
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,760
found that I thought was interesting was

570
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,070
what if we could make our own system of

571
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,720
color mappings so we can implement

572
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:29,690
unique mappings like say crayons so the

573
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,300
final email is someone suggesting that

574
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,300
maybe we can name our colors after

575
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,710
crayons instead of whatever they're

576
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,810
currently named after so Owens with

577
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:42,200
crayons so I like to end with my

578
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,030
favorite commit boy

579
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:55,880
what a stupid program
