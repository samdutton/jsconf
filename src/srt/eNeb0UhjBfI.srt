00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,880

hello all right thanks everybody for

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,269
coming out the title of my talk is

3
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:18,000
atomic components managing dynamic react

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,810
components using atomic design so just

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,550
quick show of hands who here is hurt

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,279
atomic atomic design previously great

7
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,750
awesome um who's heard of react okay all

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,329
right you're sort of redox and data

9
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,600
management flux okay okay great all

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,969
right so um this is going to assume some

11
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,629
prior knowledge of how data is managed

12
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:45,000
outside of just specific react

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,120
parent-child type stuff um going to

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,640
assume a little bit of prepare knowledge

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,510
about redox or flux just data cross

16
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,579
component communication via some sort of

17
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,129
you know third party however atomic

18
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,649
design you know will be will be getting

19
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,170
into um so my name is Joey I'm a

20
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,750
front-end developer at balderdash we are

21
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,090
no Jas consultants and maintain errs of

22
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,810
sales um that's that's my website find

23
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,810
me on the interwebs at yeah Jody doe

24
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,549
it's just my name mixed up all right

25
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:28,020
atomic design so what is atomic design

26
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,710
it is a methodology for creating design

27
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,770
systems and the way this works is that

28
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,720
it's broken up into five discrete levels

29
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,720
you have atoms molecules organisms

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,189
templates and pages um this was designed

31
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,220
by Brad frost and dave olson they um

32
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,829
have a little library to help you

33
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,930
organize your project in atomic design

34
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,180
called pattern lab pattern labs at i/o

35
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,619
and atomic design it lends a context

36
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,129
interfaces it's very client-facing it

37
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:12,880
helps I take some sort of

38
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,030
static mock up on these components are

39
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,480
these are these small pieces and allows

40
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,940
you to put an additional layer on top of

41
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,550
it which might sound like bloat but um

42
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,910
it it provides a sort of focus that

43
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,170
allows you to with these descriptions

44
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,810
communicate more easily across across a

45
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,930
team or explain to your client exactly

46
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,370
how this is going to work in a greater

47
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,920
flow of things why do we need it so

48
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,920
anytime we come across some sort of some

49
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,860
abstraction or conceptual blue we we

50
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,560
have to ask ourselves is the return

51
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,010
worth the investment right so long in

52
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,280
our case I know as developers we like to

53
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,530
maybe sometimes over design our

54
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,610
structures and our systems um just

55
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,560
because we feel like that's thorough but

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,540
when we already have something that's

57
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,810
you know on a pretty flat simple level

58
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,850
adding this canned a lot of times

59
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,520
bringing a focus to it an organization

60
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,240
that doesn't quite um exist well it

61
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,170
doesn't exist without it right so um the

62
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,770
atomic design in this case helps chunk

63
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,330
with these five components helps create

64
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,080
this artificial hierarchy of the

65
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,010
components in a mental way so how does

66
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,760
it do this well it breaks it down into

67
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,430
five atomic levels so on the Left we

68
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:51,010
have a small atom arm which I'm get

69
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,620
composed into molecules which then into

70
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,200
organisms int and then into templates

71
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,610
and then into actual pages so with atoms

72
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,200
and molecules and organisms what is an

73
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,980
atom right well an atom in our domain is

74
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,240
something like an input element or

75
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,230
button element just small very low level

76
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,950
HTML elements molecules would be a group

77
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,850
of these together let's say a search bar

78
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,549
right we have an input field and we have

79
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:23,470
a button that works with that input

80
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,270
field those together form some sort of

81
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,360
you I togetherness a concept in the UI

82
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,879
that is on we wouldn't think of them

83
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,620
separately so we can think of those as

84
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,039
an organ as a molecule then we take it a

85
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:39,470
step further and we say well that on

86
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,199
that search that search bar has a

87
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,509
further contacts usually in UI patterns

88
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:46,460
some and some sort of maybe a header

89
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,430
element or something like that it can be

90
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,999
anywhere I can um you know be in a

91
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:56,599
anywhere on the page but it still is

92
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:59,750
usually grouped into something that has

93
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,979
a greater context and that's where our

94
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:03,139
organisms come in at least an atomic

95
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,780
design so these are repeatable elements

96
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,630
or groups of molecules that tell a story

97
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,300
in the UI and so here's an example of

98
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,190
them right so at the top we obviously

99
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,490
have an atom underneath that we have

100
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,669
molecules we just have some sort of some

101
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:21,409
sort of text along with an input and the

102
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:23,210
button together those three atoms form a

103
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,280
molecule might be over explaining this I

104
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,039
think is pretty pretty intuitive

105
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,150
underneath that we have an organism we

106
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,280
have a logo we have some some navigation

107
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,469
links and then we have the search bar

108
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:35,569
together and that's in traditional

109
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,580
atomic design what's what's considered

110
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,110
an organism so outside of that Brad

111
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,940
frost recommends that we break our

112
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,130
chemistry analogy and we just completely

113
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,729
pivot into templates um because it quote

114
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:52,039
makes more sense to our clients in a lot

115
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:54,710
of way um these are the templates are

116
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,719
just groups of organisms that are

117
00:05:56,719 --> 00:05:58,610
dedicated to a page level abstraction

118
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,550
and can moved around wireframe style the

119
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,029
the pages would be the actual instances

120
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:07,610
of those templates that are designed to

121
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,389
be deliverables so yeah okay that's

122
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:14,750
fantastic um it's great for documents

123
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,650
great for print but you know we don't

124
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,969
deal with that stuff anymore we're in a

125
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:23,150
post document arrow um we as react are

126
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,759
building user interfaces not necessarily

127
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,120
pages and style sheets and you know we

128
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,190
have one HTML document we're serving not

129
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,770
pages that match up one to one with the

130
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,860
styles or just views tied to specific

131
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,470
models we have things that we have

132
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,360
small components and groups of them that

133
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,660
need to have their own information it's

134
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,830
a very very pre spy idea so react does

135
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,300
have these very specific concerns as I

136
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,200
mentioned we we have these living

137
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,720
breathing life cycle driven components

138
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,480
with these contextual stores that model

139
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,370
are you I state anymore it's not like

140
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,230
we're just pulling anything out of a

141
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,950
database anymore the organism relates

142
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,460
only to other organisms in the atomic

143
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,860
metaphor and that they coexist in visual

144
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,160
space right along when along one one

145
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,470
another on the template or page this

146
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,730
says nothing about how they're going to

147
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,650
talk to each other it simply means a

148
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,020
visual organization and grouping and we

149
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,850
have concerns about how we can actually

150
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,650
make these things talk to one another

151
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,590
when when it comes to implementation we

152
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,650
lack that atomic principle so can we

153
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:39,020
solve that doesn't AMA caprent.com we as

154
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,990
react developers use the same metaphors

155
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,250
because they seem very useful right I

156
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,050
mean we start with you I we start with a

157
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,580
mock-up and then we chop it up and break

158
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,220
it down and organize them try to find

159
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,630
something cool with our directory and

160
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,400
good way to good way to put them

161
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,960
together so we can get this like actual

162
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,150
tangible feel with it so this is great

163
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,890
for that how can we use it arm luckily

164
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,290
pattern on pattern lab is designed a

165
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,650
very and very you know Foss manner it's

166
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,850
very flexible with naming a structure

167
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,740
it's brand new right a lot of stuff

168
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,419
we're seeing in the space is new and

169
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:14,090
open to change there's no one right way

170
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,040
to do it and we think that's just fine

171
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,229
main things as you please and we'll

172
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:20,560
leave the hair splitting out of things

173
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,610
fantastic all right so let's let's

174
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,169
rethink this how are we going to do this

175
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:28,160
well so what I've done is on we're gonna

176
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,010
we're going to not break after organisms

177
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,270
we're not going to pivot the templates

178
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,280
in pages we're instead going to extend

179
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,880
keep keep with this economic this

180
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,580
ecological metaphor and add to new

181
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,020
levels the ecosystem and the environment

182
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,130
so we'll go from atoms to molecules

183
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,320
organisms ecosystems and then into a

184
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,769
sort of larger environment

185
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:53,439
and what these do so we're also going to

186
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:56,319
slightly modify the organism arm there's

187
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,360
a problem with the organism I feel where

188
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,429
the organism is a top level minute

189
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:03,249
pivots anatomic design they say okay

190
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:06,100
yeah an organism can be either you know

191
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,199
the header the footer these groups of

192
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:09,939
molecules I get that we group these

193
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:11,889
molecules or let's say we have a product

194
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:13,179
grid we are right we have these

195
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:15,100
repeating products something it's a

196
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,929
repeatable container that's also an

197
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:19,689
organism and it's like okay so we we

198
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:23,019
have something that I understand the

199
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:24,999
grouping inside the header but we're

200
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,470
also just going to leverage this

201
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,749
organism because we want to pivot to

202
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:31,660
templates to describe product grids also

203
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,670
which are fundamentally different as

204
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,670
repeatable containers are not a big fan

205
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,299
so I say let's let's keep the organism

206
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:42,299
is repeatable container that's fine um

207
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:45,459
but now that we have these these new

208
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,100
concepts to leverage the ecosystem and

209
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,689
environment let's figure out if we can

210
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,629
we can take the context of what would

211
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:54,519
encompass some sort of header or footer

212
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:58,959
and maybe you know abstract it out so

213
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,699
you see where we can go with that so

214
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:02,949
we're atomic design pivots towards

215
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:04,779
client understanding with pages and

216
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:07,660
templates we need a pivot towards

217
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,369
implementation while still retaining the

218
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:13,629
usefulness of the visual metaphors so

219
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:17,740
with the ecosystems we're going to see

220
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,970
an example so this is our fake social

221
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:28,720
app fantastic it's great um it's just a

222
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,809
mock-up that i put together we see we

223
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:34,240
have some sort of hey what's up you know

224
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,649
it's going to tell someone my status

225
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:40,299
some notifications or messages chat

226
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:42,220
people on the right or buddies you can

227
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,110
see who's online talk to them if we won

228
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,839
I have some other stuff in there some

229
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:49,600
post some comments on there a lot of

230
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,249
people like my stuff at school have a

231
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:54,399
lot of friends gotta get nice gallery in

232
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,839
there showing some awesome pictures from

233
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,239
Jas calm my profile image let everyone

234
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:02,459
know who I am and how I see myself

235
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,300
alright so what we're

236
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,910
to do instead is that this is the

237
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,850
environment we're encapsulating the

238
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,220
whole thing environments are going to be

239
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,780
a little bit flexible because in a lot

240
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,160
of times when we're not just building

241
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,850
this you know like great little isolated

242
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,220
you I that is super cool on dribble and

243
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,810
moves inside and things change inside

244
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,370
this little card container and stuff

245
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,500
like that we actually still are building

246
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,500
product that might need to move from

247
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,800
page to page we need full pages so this

248
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,020
environment is going to represent this

249
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,620
pay the still same page level or if you

250
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,970
don't need that if everything is just

251
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,470
moving pieces inside of the static you I

252
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,770
just one page level your environment is

253
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,030
the application itself be your app

254
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:52,090
component it's also important to have

255
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:55,450
the so it's good to have supper shell

256
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,930
not even for like flocks of redox or

257
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,850
anything because a lot of times if you

258
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,860
have siblings like us siblings like the

259
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,040
nav bar or the content container um you

260
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,630
still need a way to get that information

261
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,490
from an outboard to that so you just

262
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,730
pass it up and that's down and so you're

263
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,020
good there the environment still lends

264
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,520
itself to there so it is flexible in

265
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,970
that way but still very useful outside

266
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,450
of that I want you ought to take a

267
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,820
minute just to think so we know the arm

268
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,090
we have this environment we also have

269
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,400
these ecosystems that are going to

270
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,620
obviously be sub junks of this we're

271
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,760
going to break them up into contact with

272
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,140
rule components like I'd mentioned

273
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,410
before on the the nav bar or something

274
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,180
like a some sort of header or footer so

275
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,250
if you were to do this given this you

276
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,700
guys have just heard this just now um

277
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,290
take a moment to think about what you

278
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,750
would imagine would be the ecosystems of

279
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,760
of this right I'm going to show you in

280
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,700
just a second of how I interpreted this

281
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,230
because a lot of these are just design

282
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,900
decisions so this is how I think

283
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,930
ecosystem the ecosystems would be we

284
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,580
have one on the right for the chat we

285
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,080
have one for the main profile and then

286
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,390
we have one that would maybe be a header

287
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,840
or footer so they they should represent

288
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,970
the major core container components and

289
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,260
ideas the interface is trying to

290
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,100
communicate

291
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,340
um also provides a nice isolated context

292
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,800
for when you're trying to style the the

293
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,660
three major ecosystems here chat header

294
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,870
orientation and profile if you're using

295
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,090
Redux for your data management this is

296
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:28,960
where I have to assume the prior

297
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,910
knowledge there's a thing called smart

298
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,310
components which if you don't know redux

299
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,340
um the smart components are the

300
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,480
container components that are going to

301
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,070
not only hold dumb components to which

302
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,590
you pass pass your state and prompts but

303
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,960
also communicate with your reducers and

304
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,210
get the information you need to pass it

305
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,160
down they're kind of like the managers

306
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,350
in the application and this also lends

307
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,030
itself really well to these this

308
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,060
ecosystem metaphor this is where um that

309
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,790
manipulation is going to happen helps um

310
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,100
not so we can still leverage these

311
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,240
things right because you know a ver mob

312
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,680
came up with this smart and dumb the

313
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,270
dumb czar your will be your organisms

314
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,520
and your molecules and atoms and you

315
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,880
just pass them down through it and it's

316
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,980
nice that this level of abstraction you

317
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,870
know there's this conceptual bloat still

318
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,730
is able to map pretty well two things

319
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,260
that are already out there so we don't

320
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,150
need to add another thing it just it

321
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,320
just kind of plugs right in because

322
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,000
we're all thinking along the same path

323
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,130
sort of thing with on breaking these you

324
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:32,650
eyes up into up into new ways so yeah

325
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,940
they're both are responsible for both

326
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,160
handling the data and delegating the NIP

327
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,710
you laid state so notice that we still

328
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,930
have one ecosystem that is significantly

329
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,380
complex versus the other two um the main

330
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:51,040
profile ecosystem that could probably be

331
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,110
broken down even further because I don't

332
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,940
think we're ready to go to the organism

333
00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:00,790
level yet um so ecosystems as a nature

334
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,880
can be nested so we we break it up with

335
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,940
visually and it allows us to have some

336
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,160
sort of isolation for when we want to

337
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,100
pass things around and that way we could

338
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,780
be like hey you know go go wrong with

339
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,700
this this profile part of the ecosystem

340
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,260
and you go run with this and then we'll

341
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,470
just worry about connecting later maybe

342
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,790
maybe even make it a dumb AP system they

343
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,950
don't have to be smart right consider

344
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,390
that one a dumb component then have the

345
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,280
parent ecosystem the larger one the

346
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,840
profile section

347
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,040
the one that's going to handle all that

348
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,750
so you know you work on that you work on

349
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,810
that and what we'll figure it out later

350
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,800
so after that we're going to break it

351
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,350
down into organisms right repeatable

352
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:43,630
containers chat instances each of which

353
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,430
have a molecule that is you know your

354
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,160
name your profile picture um the

355
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,530
repeatable posts inside of which could

356
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,880
be a number of different things right i

357
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,350
mean they're just like cards they have

358
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,300
this one has a text this one is

359
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,420
information about who's following me um

360
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,670
two down there's one there's about the

361
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,670
some sub information about what I added

362
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:07,210
with my new gallery you know just

363
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,920
repeatable elements I think that's

364
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,820
pretty straightforward so how do we

365
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,770
organize these right um this is great

366
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:18,010
it's it's very useful to UM to start

367
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,830
thinking of these components in this

368
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,710
this just slightly abstracted way to

369
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,740
kind of lend to you know give them some

370
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,770
sort of orthogonal contacts if you will

371
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,680
arm but can we also use this to help us

372
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,150
actually literally organize their

373
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,460
components in our project and the answer

374
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,610
is yeah so just a just a brief tour of

375
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,650
how things used to be organized right

376
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,480
and react in the beginning everybody

377
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,980
just we had a components folder and we

378
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,660
put them all in it was cool it was it

379
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,280
was very poor because we were like oh

380
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,390
these components are cool this new idea

381
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,090
you know we weren't really organizing

382
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,740
our directives like that until and then

383
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,180
John Papa came along and was like hey

384
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,459
let's let's add add an additional layer

385
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,630
of context let's say hey you know what

386
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,980
if all these directives are going to be

387
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,170
inside of a footer or header let's um

388
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,959
let's make a footer component let's make

389
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:16,209
a footer folder or something and put all

390
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:17,260
the directives that are associated with

391
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,520
that in there same thing we so we

392
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,140
started doing that with our react

393
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,190
components we said okay you know what so

394
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,290
I've got a header part I'm some header

395
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,900
components is getting kind of big got a

396
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,720
profile I'm going to put on my profile

397
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,580
components in there and a footer and put

398
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,870
on my components and that's fine that's

399
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,570
kind of how we do it today the most

400
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,830
common way to organize our your

401
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,140
components

402
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,270
but you know this arm you still have to

403
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,000
refer to is it still requires some sort

404
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,330
of over design I guess in a lot of ways

405
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,220
I mean you'd have to a lot of thinking

406
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,080
about naming and name spacing and where

407
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,520
you going to put things and we're going

408
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,490
to call things and might not be too bad

409
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,100
of an issue but um when you when you can

410
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,410
instead go back to what we had which is

411
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,000
this an idea of okay look these are all

412
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,260
components yeah they fall into these

413
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,470
trick these these are these ideas but

414
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,870
these ideas don't relate to with a

415
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,790
specific type of implementation for

416
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,260
application that we're going to use they

417
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,180
might you know we might want to reuse

418
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,040
them in other things and they're now

419
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:31,280
scope to this you know profile idea

420
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,500
let's instead you know let's go with

421
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,840
something flat let's this is going to be

422
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,250
a molecule no matter where it is it's

423
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,050
pretty clear this is going to be an atom

424
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,570
it's pretty clear so we can take what we

425
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,950
had just that components folder and then

426
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,920
make our five atomic folders and just

427
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,320
start you know throwing our components

428
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,240
in there as they as they receive the as

429
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,220
they as they match up with these atomic

430
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,370
principles so what's what's nice about

431
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:01,230
that is that it hopes when you're trying

432
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,850
to refactor you want to change things a

433
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,770
lot of times if you want to consider an

434
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,170
organism something on an organism level

435
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,760
smart and that makes you want to change

436
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,070
it to an ecosystem instead of going up

437
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,690
and then finding exactly where that was

438
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,580
in the project previously and finding

439
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,590
the name and finding the path for it you

440
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,730
just go up one level because

441
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,440
everything's flat and you change the

442
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,210
name and you just say alright this

443
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,730
molecule there and or ok that's the

444
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,600
ecosystem now so that's that's a brief

445
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,740
idea of what atomic components um can

446
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,850
can help you with we've used didn't few

447
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,130
of our projects to really great success

448
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,970
um communicating with design especially

449
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,000
designed knows these things you'd be

450
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,160
surprised how quickly even non technical

451
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,060
managers can pick up on this type of

452
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,920
they will they kind of go off on the

453
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,660
road and you you know II first start

454
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,620
doing this feel like you might have to

455
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,570
handhold or something a little but then

456
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:05,440
the you'd be surprised it's actually

457
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,700
really intuitive I'm hoping that you

458
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,800
know when I when we did a little

459
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,150
experiment with you know okay you create

460
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,770
your own ecosystem sort of thing we all

461
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,080
probably kind of broke it up into at

462
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,630
least those few sections right might not

463
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,040
have been exactly that might have been

464
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,170
more might have been a little less but I

465
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,030
think we all understand is you know

466
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,280
front-end developers exactly how these

467
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:30,970
you eyes lend themselves so to get

468
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,980
started um I put a little boilerplate

469
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,190
atomic components app up on github this

470
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:39,850
is the app right here these little peace

471
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:44,560
signs it's an environment holding two

472
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,960
ecosystems inside of which are for

473
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,150
organisms inside of which are molecules

474
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:54,100
with two atoms so it uses you know

475
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,370
webpack and SES s modules and you know

476
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,230
redox and all the cool fun stuff so you

477
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,910
can just clone it and get started and

478
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:05,560
play around with it and hopefully find

479
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,770
as much use in it as we have I
