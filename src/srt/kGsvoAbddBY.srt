1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,190

bye

2
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,760
okay so sorry about that often I do

3
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,000
without the speaker notes to this fine

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,740
yeah as I said I'm not an expert by any

5
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,610
means one of my goals is basically not

6
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,190
to become grumpy developer who runs away

7
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,960
from the new JavaScript frameworks I

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,020
want to sort of embrace this change and

9
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,750
I think like the more time I spend at

10
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,059
this that the grumpy grumpy or someone

11
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:48,260
can become and I've definitely worked

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,879
with some folks who have become so

13
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:51,290
grumpy nyan they've moved off to do

14
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,570
other things or moved up in management

15
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,460
or move to different roles and they just

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,020
gotten frustrated with the change so

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,180
like a part of that is to address this

18
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,489
like how can we approach this how can we

19
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:05,180
change our attitudes so my talk is

20
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,539
simple it's broken up into a few pieces

21
00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:10,759
the first one is constant change as a

22
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:12,770
factor in Java and JavaScript and in

23
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,180
philosophy and maybe we can learn

24
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,830
something by it sort of comparing the

25
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,440
two and you know take a look take the

26
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,119
lessons from one and apply them to the

27
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:23,840
other that's sort of my goal so yeah the

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,880
second one is sort of changing your

29
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,670
attitude to deal with that change and

30
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,950
then the third one is sort of advice to

31
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,130
my younger self and so I think it's easy

32
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,040
for this to become super preachy and

33
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,509
yeah yeah saying like oh I know

34
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:40,280
everything now I'm going to frame this

35
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,970
as a sort of a humble you know advice to

36
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,790
younger me but also its kind of advice

37
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,920
to my current self because I'm still in

38
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,979
the progress in process of becoming

39
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:53,450
better a better human being better

40
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,750
developer so the first one constant

41
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,930
change it turns out to be like a super

42
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,140
important recurring theme in philosophy

43
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,880
for today we're kind of going to focus

44
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,670
on older philosophies the first one sort

45
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,079
of from the Western perspective is

46
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:11,180
Heraclitus who famous famously said you

47
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,950
cannot step twice into the same stream

48
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,410
everything changes nothing remains still

49
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,390
interestingly a contemporary of

50
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,070
Heraclitus is someone you may have heard

51
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,769
of Buddha nothing changes nothing

52
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:28,400
remains without change that these are so

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,959
similar to each other is kind of

54
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:32,959
interesting not so much paradox but it's

55
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:33,470
sort of

56
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,350
like suspicious like someone copied the

57
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,270
other person you know it's too

58
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,400
coincidental there must have been some

59
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,650
wisdom being transferred along the trade

60
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,680
route but you know both cultures we

61
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,240
think of them is so separate like East

62
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,880
and West but they turn out to both care

63
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,370
about this this recurring thing that

64
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,440
there's just constant change in the

65
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,270
world and how do we deal with it you

66
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,940
know it stresses us out and this is the

67
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,440
foundation for Buddhist philosophy

68
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,900
change sort of leads to suffering and

69
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,580
suffering is one of the things we try to

70
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,530
get away from in the world we have to

71
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,870
sort of transcend it and recognize the

72
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,720
impermanence of the world and so maybe

73
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,550
in small ways we can apply that to sort

74
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,560
art every day developer lives you know

75
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,130
constant framework churn just dealing

76
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,340
with that situation this is something

77
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,680
from more than a millennia later but I

78
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,790
thought it was interesting because it

79
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,530
was very similar to Heraclitus as well

80
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,860
it's a Japanese story the current of the

81
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,390
flowing river does not cease thing I

82
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,220
think the water is not the same water as

83
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:41,989
before very similar so sort of pulling

84
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,650
this back to just little old me and so

85
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,870
thinking back to sort of start of my

86
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,660
career JavaScript career I sort of

87
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,910
jumped into a job started using whatever

88
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,590
they were using there probably was the

89
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,860
latest framework so you I'm just going

90
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,900
to call it framework X for now and it's

91
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,340
the way of the future it's the way of

92
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,870
the future you know this is the latest

93
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,610
and greatest thing this must be what the

94
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,080
future looks like you know it's not

95
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,610
going to change much from here this is

96
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,840
what we're set on right everything

97
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,700
before it's just total crap we don't

98
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,709
need to worry about that this is the way

99
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:15,400
of the future it's all framework X huh

100
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,900
and you start writing blog posts and

101
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,120
maybe you give some talks you go to meet

102
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,370
ups and okay you've reached expert level

103
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,370
okay and and you're becoming kind of

104
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,960
entitled at this point probably an

105
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,370
arrogant as we have want to do you know

106
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,750
I know everything about this that you

107
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,430
should listen to me I know I know what

108
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,979
it's all about everything is well and

109
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:40,550
dandy for a little while and you think

110
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,250
of yourself maybe as uber developers

111
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,569
maybe or not maybe I kind of self to see

112
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:49,169
but then this happens new JavaScript

113
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,389
framework appears on the horizon okay

114
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:53,249
people start using it and maybe you

115
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:54,689
think oh this is just the latest trend

116
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:55,800
you think you know this is a flash in

117
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,389
the pan that is going to go away you

118
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:58,979
know framework X is so much better in

119
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,479
all these ways you know I don't have to

120
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,669
pay attention to this but people you

121
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,529
know pick it up more and more and sort

122
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:07,499
of start adopting it and writing posts

123
00:05:07,499 --> 00:05:08,869
about it and this is where all the

124
00:05:08,869 --> 00:05:11,520
excitement is happening like nowadays it

125
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,110
seems to be like in the direction of

126
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,509
react next year probably something else

127
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:20,789
but you know basically yeah it's sort of

128
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:22,289
this situation you've probably seen this

129
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:25,229
before sort of like oh yeah backbone

130
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:26,729
it's the new thing yeah it's the new

131
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:30,360
hotness Oh angular yeah yeah react yeah

132
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,059
and it's just this it's like a fashion

133
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:35,879
trend it's like man is it is this actual

134
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,919
progress or is it just changes in

135
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,869
fashion and people jump in on bandwagons

136
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:42,209
and you know this is kind of like

137
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,979
frustrating because like you know you

138
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:45,659
start at one of these years in the past

139
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:47,309
year and you've seen this all in your

140
00:05:47,309 --> 00:05:49,229
kind of like okay I've been through this

141
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:51,959
before like why am I even learning this

142
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,309
new framework and you kind of get pissed

143
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:54,779
off and that's where the grumpy

144
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:57,240
developer sort of comes in you want to

145
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,209
avoid that so yeah this is part of my

146
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:02,610
perspective this is like okay how can I

147
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,740
sort of change my attitude to not be

148
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,240
like that to sort of be receptive to

149
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,779
this to be able to keep up with it this

150
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,699
is her cleitus putting on his developer

151
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,180
hat in this case this JavaScript head

152
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,860
technology is constantly changing cannot

153
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,009
step twice into the same stat tech stack

154
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:21,240
which is exactly the case it's

155
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,589
constantly changing people are

156
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:24,329
constantly changing even the libraries

157
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:26,369
themselves are changing over time we saw

158
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:28,529
that with angular 1 2 angular 2 and now

159
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:30,209
people got all frustrated and you is

160
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:31,800
everything changed like why don't I

161
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,509
don't just move to react down you know

162
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:35,269
you know people get frustrated with that

163
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,249
this is a something you probably saw Ben

164
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:41,969
nato's blog about angularjs in

165
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:44,189
particular and it's kind of like a

166
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:46,110
optimistic perspective this angular JS

167
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,569
one it's optimistic because there's

168
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:50,639
still upward trend it's sort of like

169
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,769
your feelings get better about the

170
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:54,569
framework over time you're sort of like

171
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:58,259
you start out with nothing at x 0 you go

172
00:06:58,259 --> 00:06:59,200
on your like

173
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,670
is pretty cool and then you're like you

174
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,380
get frustrated with pieces of it and you

175
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,450
dip down into a valley and then you go

176
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,400
up again you plateau and then you're

177
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,170
like this is really crappy why did they

178
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,420
do this you know but you're you feel

179
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,620
like you're making progress because

180
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,880
you're getting more comfortable with

181
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,790
that framework you know this is this is

182
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,870
a good thing right you're making

183
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,740
progress but the reality is we change

184
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,660
out framework so often especially in the

185
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,910
front end world and the JavaScript world

186
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,000
that it feels to me like more like this

187
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,800
like you start out from time zero with

188
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,960
nothing you go up to a certain level you

189
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,090
learn this framework and then this is

190
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,460
like over the course of years maybe your

191
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,590
whole career or something and then you

192
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,960
plateau and then you hit a valley again

193
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,540
because you basically have to discard a

194
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,310
bunch of your knowledge and you have to

195
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,410
be happy well not you don't have to be

196
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,960
happy with that you have to be okay with

197
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,940
that to be able to continue being a

198
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,550
developer so i would say fifty percent

199
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,380
at least maybe greater of your knowledge

200
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,440
that you worked so hard to acquire is

201
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,750
just chucked out the window and you have

202
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,970
to you have to be okay with that

203
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,040
impermanence and that's a hard thing to

204
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,910
do so you're later career becomes okay

205
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,860
maybe i'm not an expert in anything

206
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,620
really i'm just going to keep my head

207
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,570
down at my job and you know hopefully

208
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,940
they don't notice you know i'll be

209
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,560
proficient but you know I'm not like

210
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,220
uber developer obviously and then later

211
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,230
on obviously you switch to programming

212
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,740
and go move to Florida as judge Smith

213
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,510
said and this leads into this constant

214
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,370
changes is recognized I think we all

215
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,880
agree in philosophy and in JavaScript

216
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,770
and in the world in our everyday lives

217
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,320
content change is just a fact of life so

218
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,270
the second part is our attitude towards

219
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,010
that so we can't control the constant

220
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,260
change but can we change our attitudes

221
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,260
towards that I think it's easier that we

222
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,360
can we can change our attitudes but it

223
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,170
might be difficult so I'm doing this by

224
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,330
way of analogy I have two analogies that

225
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,120
maybe we can use our knowledge of one

226
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,880
thing sort of apply it to JavaScript so

227
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,850
how we approach one thing and apply it

228
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,070
to another thing so the first one is

229
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,850
Swiss are

230
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,040
my knives so I'm going to say JavaScript

231
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,810
libraries are Swiss Army knives their

232
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,569
tools there means to an end you pick up

233
00:09:19,569 --> 00:09:21,130
the Swiss Army knife you might not have

234
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:24,009
a fancy one but you know you use it as

235
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:25,959
means to an end it's not an end in

236
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:27,730
itself you know it's not the goal to

237
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,949
just have the light how did the library

238
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:32,290
or the knife and just say well this is

239
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,940
this is what it's all about now you use

240
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,709
that you'd apply that use it as a tool

241
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,449
for other things a hammer is another

242
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:39,459
good analogy but like Swiss Army knife

243
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:40,720
because it has some tools on there that

244
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,639
you use and some other things that you

245
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,800
probably don't use and you might not

246
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,839
even know what they are but that's okay

247
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:49,300
you know and then the new library comes

248
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,920
out it's got more features it's got

249
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,959
different features it's got a magnifying

250
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,180
glass that's pretty cool it's got like a

251
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,459
little hook thing that you don't even

252
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:59,740
know what that is for really is it for

253
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,279
fish Eden I don't know oh you got a

254
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,620
corkscrew still but it's it's basically

255
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,899
still a tool it's like your old tool but

256
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,250
it's slightly different you got some

257
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,829
scissors on there but you know it still

258
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:14,380
means to an end and these are these are

259
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,850
like libraries because they're kind of

260
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,949
smaller and everything and then you

261
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:21,370
might have this monstrosity this is like

262
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,370
the uber Swiss Army knife that's totally

263
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,779
impractical can you even take this

264
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:28,740
hiking or anything it has like like

265
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,029
clippers like nail clippers on it i like

266
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:32,470
how do you even use that you put it on

267
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,560
the desk or something and then I don't

268
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,410
know you have to get assistance for that

269
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,089
yeah frameworks are kind of more bloated

270
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:42,430
and it's got stuff on there you probably

271
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,380
don't really need but hey there it is

272
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,720
anyway but in any case all these things

273
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,339
are related they're all tools they're

274
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:50,889
all means to an end so we should be

275
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:52,959
thinking about the end in itself the

276
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,149
product that we're making so we can plug

277
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:56,560
and play all these different tools

278
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,339
basically swap them out but our focus

279
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:01,870
should be on the tools themselves it

280
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,579
should be on on the product and the

281
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,130
users don't really care they won't

282
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,620
really notice most the time so that's

283
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,339
the takeaway from this and it's

284
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,319
interesting because the javascript

285
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:16,000
library is a means to an end to building

286
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,889
the product the product itself is a

287
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:19,779
means to an end for the user the user

288
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,850
isn't using the product just because

289
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,170
they really like using the product

290
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,100
they're use it because they get

291
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,900
satisfaction from it that you

292
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,040
is it because they need to book a flight

293
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,530
like they're not going to just be

294
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,110
obsessed about that product well maybe

295
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,050
sometimes so in essentially the law the

296
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,760
driver script library becomes the means

297
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,860
to a means to an end it's not even like

298
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,330
the most essential thing in the whole

299
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,050
chain that we should be focused on

300
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:46,150
another analogy things you might have

301
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,740
heard of sand mandalas and I kind of

302
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,690
adapted this or stole this a little bit

303
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,690
from John rice eggs eulogy to why why

304
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,500
the lucky stiff from the Ruby community

305
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,090
basically this is sort of approaching

306
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,570
JavaScript libraries and recognizing

307
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,340
that they're impermanent and being okay

308
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,540
with that so Sandman dollars are these

309
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,130
things that have bitten monks basically

310
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,370
put together some days this is all made

311
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,650
of sand it's really delicate and they've

312
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,060
got these special tools that they're

313
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,220
sort of grinding and the sand is coming

314
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,110
out and you can check it out on video

315
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,750
you can look up like San Mandela just

316
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,760
your construction and destruction

317
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,700
destruction is is the second point and

318
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,560
that's sort of the more interesting part

319
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,870
of this right after they finish building

320
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:37,960
it they they destroy it like okay what's

321
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,970
the point then you know like it's so

322
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,940
it's so ephemeral it only lasts for a

323
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,130
few days and now it's gone like you know

324
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,420
we have a tendency to want to preserve

325
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,430
it like you know I think in the Western

326
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,350
world we would say oh you should put

327
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,120
some like glass over that or put some

328
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,680
glue over that's where the sand doesn't

329
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,990
shift around or we have a tendency to

330
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,360
want to hold on to things and we're not

331
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,460
okay with sort of like letting things go

332
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,230
we have a tendency to swear when I

333
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,110
accumulate preserve it hanging on the

334
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,970
wall you know and you got this whole

335
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,350
massive fortune that you've built up

336
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,360
over time and that sort of your goal of

337
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,250
life is preserve all those things you

338
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,560
come in contact with but this philosophy

339
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,940
is quite different from that it's sort

340
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,980
of like hey you know life is impermanent

341
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,830
you know you got to you got to come to

342
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,780
terms with that sometime so this is an

343
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,880
exercise in impermanence and being

344
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,440
comfortable with that and that it

345
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,090
exactly turns out to be the life of the

346
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,720
developer because they construct this

347
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,270
framework and you may be like an author

348
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,280
on that library but you have to

349
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,420
recognize that thing is going to be

350
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,700
around for forever

351
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,180
you know it's it's like a few years I

352
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,030
don't know a decade if you're lucky you

353
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,610
know I have not even a decade really but

354
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,360
you have to be okay with that and I

355
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,880
think we can get help from a soak

356
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,480
philosopher if it epictetus on this

357
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,410
point of all things are in our power of

358
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,470
things somewhere in our power and others

359
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,110
are not of a harsh appearance if a harsh

360
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,760
appearance relates to anything which is

361
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,310
not in our power be ready to say there's

362
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,280
that is not concern you I don't know

363
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,600
what concern it looks like that but

364
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,760
anyway you get the point so there's

365
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,230
things that are in our control some

366
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,750
things that are not in our control if we

367
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,210
should be worried about one or the other

368
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,620
we should be worried about things so we

369
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,360
can control because we can fix it and we

370
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,440
can make it better so we can't control

371
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,390
the turn of JavaScript frameworks and

372
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,970
libraries so we put on the developer hat

373
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,970
we do not have control over JavaScript

374
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,130
frameworks changing but we have control

375
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,960
of our attitudes towards them changing

376
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,560
and that's the key thing now this is

377
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,690
obviously easier said than done we can

378
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,100
say oh yeah I'm in control my attitude

379
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,930
but this turns out to be super hard and

380
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,670
this actually is like the starting point

381
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,150
of all of the stoic philosophy endeavor

382
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,070
is recognizing this point and then

383
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,870
trying to address it trying to control

384
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,950
your attitude towards it so the both of

385
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,320
these Sigmund allergies sort of give us

386
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,360
these points they embrace the constant

387
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,100
chains and impermanence that's the sand

388
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,560
mandalas and control our attitudes

389
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,970
towards that change that's what the

390
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,120
stoic started for them basically so now

391
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,280
we're come into the last part of the

392
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,160
talk so it's a short talk advice to my

393
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,160
younger self keep it in mind this isn't

394
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,700
just to my younger self actually don't

395
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,900
get too attached to your favorite

396
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,580
JavaScript framework it's not going to

397
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,800
be around forever but become proficient

398
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,800
in it and be able to use it it's a tool

399
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,930
that you have to employ it to as a means

400
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,540
to an end so get comfortable with it but

401
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,130
be ready to let it go when the next

402
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,570
thing comes along something that's been

403
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,980
said over and over again focus on

404
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,680
vanilla JavaScript

405
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,150
basically because it changes less than

406
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,060
the job is your frame works although

407
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,010
javascript is changing a lot very

408
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,290
recently but it does change at a slower

409
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,790
pace than those frameworks and that's

410
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,560
sort of built into the core library if

411
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,700
javascript is language you're using

412
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,370
should get comfortable with sort of

413
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,800
framework list javascript and in general

414
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,780
get comfortable languages in general

415
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,070
because maybe you're not going to use

416
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,420
JavaScript tomorrow maybe again is

417
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,540
something else so that sort of is an

418
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,170
extension of that philosophy don't

419
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,480
despair over the JavaScript landscape

420
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,040
constantly changing actually it's kind

421
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,240
of an exciting thing you knew what

422
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,800
you're getting into when you got into

423
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,450
this career because everyone sort of

424
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,340
said I changes too much you know I can't

425
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,350
deal with it you know but people said

426
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,270
well this is part of what's what's the

427
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,670
excitement about you know being a

428
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,960
front-end developer it's like you're

429
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,300
constantly learning constantly learning

430
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,490
new things you never get bored with it

431
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,190
but when you and you're in Europe you're

432
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,630
okay with that you sign up for that and

433
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,580
when you actually experience that you're

434
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,620
like this kind of sucks you know like

435
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,540
you have to ditch like fifty percent of

436
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,730
my knowledge like every year or a couple

437
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,980
years or so that kind of like actually

438
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,930
experiencing that is kind of a pain but

439
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,570
so but don't despair over it as much as

440
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,380
you can try not to despair like I said

441
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,800
easier said than done but yeah I'd be

442
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,270
ready throw away large chunks of

443
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,760
knowledge as I said be more humble

444
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,040
you're not goober developer unless

445
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,630
you're special maybe you are uber

446
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,350
developer but I'm not so I think just

447
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,690
over time with more experience you kind

448
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,430
of become more humble naturally I see

449
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,900
this happen with developers a lot over

450
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,000
time like and they they're younger they

451
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,850
start out it's kind of bull it's

452
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,680
exciting it's new and they get become

453
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,390
very confident which is ok you know like

454
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,090
and then you learn like man I don't know

455
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,250
as much as I thought I knew and that is

456
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,800
like yeah that's very true or philosophy

457
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,370
in general to sort of you start with

458
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,410
like a sophomoric view of the world and

459
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,090
then you learn crap I don't know nothing

460
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:57,660
no grammar be selective about applying

461
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,930
old knowledge so yeah we have to ditch a

462
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,450
lot of old knowledge but we do get to

463
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,830
keep some of it like

464
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,510
the principles and things like that that

465
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,760
can be applied generally we have that

466
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,169
experience and we're not throwing away

467
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:11,760
all our knowledge when new stuff comes

468
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,970
out but we have to be selective so this

469
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,380
happens a lot when you come into a new

470
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,330
job and you're like I want to use

471
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,250
everything I used to use at my old job

472
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,429
so it's like you know but we're not even

473
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:25,590
using the same framework or library you

474
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,090
know and like you have to be really

475
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,200
selective it you're going to piss off

476
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,840
your co-workers too you're like well at

477
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,690
my old job you know we use you know mood

478
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,299
tools and this function is essentially

479
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:37,620
the same as that but you know move tools

480
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,630
was a little faster and no one wants to

481
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,360
hear that it's just annoying so you have

482
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,429
to sort of be selective with that

483
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:46,110
there's still useful stuff that you know

484
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,090
obviously but not all of that is going

485
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,679
to be useful not all of your experience

486
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,019
is still useful so think twice before

487
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:56,070
you you give advice with it and this is

488
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,480
something that came out from a talk

489
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,970
yesterday from Aaron Quint stock which

490
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,380
was awesome by the way if you didn't get

491
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,240
a chance to see it watch it online when

492
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,500
they post it it's definitely worth

493
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,090
seeing and it's very similar to the

494
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,669
sakai thing but he does a very good job

495
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:11,570
with a bill cool things with blank

496
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:14,669
choose your tool and just build build

497
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:16,169
the thing be concerned with the thing

498
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:18,450
itself like that the end not the means

499
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,820
to an end so just pick up the hammer or

500
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,200
the Swiss Army knife start building

501
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,389
stuff and put it down put it down at the

502
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:27,630
end of the day be proud of you know what

503
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,080
you've made basically and then yeah this

504
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,370
is kind of what i was implying before

505
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,740
this isn't actually a advice to my

506
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,750
younger self this advice my current self

507
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,820
to you so so I haven't really perfected

508
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,470
how to get to these points I've

509
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,210
convinced myself of these things but I

510
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,889
don't necessarily know how to get to

511
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:46,529
them so hopefully maybe that helps you

512
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:49,019
too but I'm not I don't know the way to

513
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:51,510
get to feel all these things like I can

514
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,730
convince myself okay I need to have this

515
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,730
kind of attitude like that but like

516
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,750
actually doing it and actually having

517
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,860
the experience of doing that as a

518
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,679
different thing so maybe that's you know

519
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,740
for everyone else to work out I think

520
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,000
the good thing that came out of this is

521
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,360
actually I realized you know actually as

522
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,490
you get that experience your life

523
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,780
competent see kind of goes up where

524
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,670
sort of like the the JavaScript

525
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,830
competency level kind of was a sine wave

526
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,020
over time and it felt like you weren't

527
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,970
really making general progress which is

528
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,590
kind of pessimistic crappy of you

529
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,540
looking at things but it's kind of how I

530
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,240
feel a lot of the time actually you get

531
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,040
better at life you get better being a

532
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,530
human being over time and actually

533
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,000
that's the thing that it turns out to

534
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,580
matter i think because you could use

535
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,220
your life experience in other things

536
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,050
other than programming and life is more

537
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:45,590
about programming obviously so if you

538
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,870
just spaced out or whatever that's cool

539
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,820
I'm cool with that but like is it too

540
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,470
long didn't watch I could too long

541
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,140
didn't read change is constant it's

542
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,120
uncontrollable because it's

543
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,130
uncontrollable I need to shape my

544
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,760
attitude to accept things and that

545
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,680
better attitude can make me a better

546
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,040
human and I think better humans make

547
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,950
better developers just by virtue of the

548
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,600
fact at least that they're better

549
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,280
co-workers I want to work with good

550
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,190
human well-rounded human beings so I

551
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,080
think that working on ourself and our

552
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,180
attitudes can make us better co-workers

553
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,560
and in that sense make us better

554
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,910
developers if that's what we want to

555
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,830
become I think that's an essential piece

556
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,140
maybe it's not sufficient but its

557
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,950
necessary for that and I just do this in

558
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,750
that at the end of thing hellos other

559
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,370
browsers there's nothing really to do

560
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,680
with anything but this is from PP k's

561
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,870
blog PPK his old time JavaScript

562
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,220
developer if you haven't read his blog

563
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,770
so he obsessively tracks you know all

564
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,930
the differences between browsers I think

565
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,790
he still does and mobile browsers more

566
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:50,750
nowadays but I thought was funny so yeah

567
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,340
if you want to check out the sides or

568
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,030
