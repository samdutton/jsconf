00:00:16,800 --> 00:01:12,740

you

2
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,000
what I love about working in web

3
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,650
development specifically the front end

4
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,720
is that it's constantly moving and

5
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,700
evolving there's always new things to

6
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,100
learn and I think that's something you

7
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,330
can't say about a lot of other

8
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,920
professions every now and then you have

9
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,510
another framework on other technology or

10
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,360
something completely changes like gay

11
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,310
location just available under secure

12
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,690
connections for instance which wasn't

13
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,300
there before but even with the constant

14
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,920
changes around you have a way to to

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,500
build a robust and resilient

16
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,790
architecture and structure to overcome

17
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,470
those changes when I code something I

18
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,690
can see the fruits of my labor right

19
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,479
away I love hitting the refresh button I

20
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,160
like the opportunity to continue

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,899
learning because it is an ever-changing

22
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,390
environment at the hands we host online

23
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,310
portfolios so it's awesome being able to

24
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,350
make like a positive measurable impact

25
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,539
on people's lives I love that I get to

26
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:01,950
meet people I get to travel I get to

27
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,170
talk about things I get to go and have a

28
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,200
drink you know coffee and discuss ideas

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,509
and maybe next year we will be talking

30
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:21,590
about something completely different

31
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,910
the assistance for cascading style

32
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,640
sheets CSS stands for centering

33
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,560
sometimes CSS from me stands for

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,840
wellness the last bit of elegance and

35
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,790
finesse and let the old man's son was

36
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,490
saying centring stuff sometimes but it's

37
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,020
a my talk was all about how we've fixed

38
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,450
that with flex box and grid so hopefully

39
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,130
we can send stuff all the time when we

40
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,250
want it clever smart and stunning people

41
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,920
can sleep soundly because i know that

42
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,880
i'm using web standards and that i'm

43
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,610
quoting in a way that is faster download

44
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,400
easy to understand and also that people

45
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,990
can take a look at and learn from my

46
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:07,890
code
