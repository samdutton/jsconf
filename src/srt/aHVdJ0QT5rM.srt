1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,280

yes so I'm actually not here to talk

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,359
about communism I just really like that

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,500
dog and what I'm actually here to talk

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,089
about oh we got a clicker

5
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:19,390
you know keyboard cannot be identified

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:31,700
this is fine doesn't work why was I yes

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,640
not communism actually um I'm here to

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,219
talk about something that has often been

9
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,340
compared to communism bye bye they so

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,920
don't like it

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,110
which is in fact open source and just

12
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,700
gonna dive right in I want to start off

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,370
by telling you a little story about this

14
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,600
fellow called Richard Stallman in 1984

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,579
or there abouts Richard encountered the

16
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,750
printer so Richard was working at the

17
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,390
MIT artificial intelligence lab back in

18
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,900
the day and they'd just gotten a new

19
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,430
printer so this is something they used

20
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,360
to do the hardware manufacturers of the

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,060
time the mi ta AI lab among others had a

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,890
reputation for having enough some clever

23
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,430
people that so they would give them free

24
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,950
hardware and expect good feedback and

25
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,470
and software patches back and it was all

26
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,799
very nice so they just got a new printer

27
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,240
from from Xerox they they just made this

28
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,310
thing called a photocopier and they had

29
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,820
figured that in fact this photocopier

30
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,619
thing could be turned into a printer as

31
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:53,130
well instead of just receiving the image

32
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,030
data from the that the photo part of the

33
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,360
photocopier they they could actually

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,700
just pipe data from a computer into the

35
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,149
printer part of the photocopier and this

36
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:07,860
was all very new and exciting back then

37
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,039
it was like even more exciting than

38
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,060
laser printers since I

39
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,400
fear the previous Britta they had was

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,870
the laser printer that had the

41
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,569
unfortunate habit of printing circles as

42
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:22,050
ovals and and diagonal lines a sort of

43
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,510
sine waves and that sort of thing but on

44
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,130
the other hand the Xerox engineers have

45
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,590
designed this thing to be basically

46
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,950
crude at all times there would always be

47
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,980
somebody at the photocopier making

48
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,890
photocopies so a design priority was not

49
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,530
to make sure that the thing doesn't Jam

50
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,590
it was more to make it easy for whoever

51
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,950
was at the machine to unjam it which is

52
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,330
great for a photocopier I'm not so great

53
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,920
for a printer so the problem occurred

54
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,150
that they the printer would get jammed a

55
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,300
lot and somebody would have to go and

56
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,810
unjam it which happened to Richard one

57
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,040
day he had a very large print job he

58
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,569
went to the printer about an hour later

59
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:18,329
to check if it was done and he found

60
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:20,010
that not only was his print job not done

61
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,769
but the printer had jammed like 2/3

62
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,910
print jobs back so he was very upset

63
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,989
this is something he'd actually dealt

64
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:30,420
with previously as well how the old

65
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,100
printer tended to jam as well because

66
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,110
printers and what she done is so he was

67
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,970
not a technical engineer so he couldn't

68
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,859
make the printer Jam less but what it

69
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:43,230
could do was patched the software so

70
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,299
that it would pull the printer see if it

71
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,700
was jammed and if it was it would email

72
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,590
everybody in the print queue saying the

73
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,079
printer is jammed you should go fix it

74
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:55,380
on the theory that if you just email

75
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,150
though the person whose job has gotten

76
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,769
jammed they might not be responsible

77
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:00,630
enough to go fix it but it's more likely

78
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,060
if you email everybody that somebody's

79
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,940
gonna go sort it out for you so Richard

80
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,829
decided to implement this patch for the

81
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:10,859
new printer as well so he went to look

82
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:13,620
for the printer drivers of foix and he

83
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,000
couldn't find it he wasn't too worried

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,370
he knew that these things usually showed

85
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,500
up eventually didn't even really bother

86
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,510
pinging Xerox about it just just waited

87
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,390
patiently for the software to surface as

88
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,950
it usually did and months later he

89
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,800
decided even waited long enough it

90
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,110
didn't seem to be surfacing so he are

91
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:46,770
surrounded and discovered that the

92
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,210
fellow had actually written the printer

93
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,840
software had just left Xerox and taken

94
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,840
up a professorship at Carnegie Mellon to

95
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,659
which Richard frequently had occasion to

96
00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:01,590
to visit for work so he just waited

97
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,300
another month or so until he found

98
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,830
himself was coming to Carnegie Mellon

99
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,830
and went to see the fellow who wrote the

100
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,370
printer software and asked him basically

101
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,450
found him

102
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,990
Richard was was an engineering and nerd

103
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,640
so he was very terse it just went to the

104
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,370
fan a self ISM said hello I'm Richard

105
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,140
I'm from MIT

106
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,210
we got your printer and I had the

107
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,770
software because I'd like to patch it

108
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,950
and the fellow looks a bit uncomfortable

109
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,070
and said well I'd love to give you the

110
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,539
software but I've signed a nondisclosure

111
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:39,090
agreement so I can't and Richard have no

112
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,979
idea how to even deal with this it was

113
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:45,330
an awkward social situation so being the

114
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,240
person he was he just basically said

115
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,690
nothing got up and left and felt very

116
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,760
embarrassed and very furious about this

117
00:05:53,760 --> 00:06:04,590
situation so

118
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,580
basically this is how the free-software

119
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,430
movement formed because Richards anger

120
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,259
at not getting that piece of printed

121
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:15,440
driver sort of blossomed over the next

122
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,490
couple of years into the idea that he

123
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,949
needed to form a movement to make sure

124
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,830
that software was always free and

125
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,750
available as it had been in in the

126
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:32,120
golden day some of I suppose US academic

127
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,330
hacker culture everybody shared software

128
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,610
freely among each other and and nobody

129
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,010
saw any reason to actually sort of horse

130
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:49,250
of barren and unguarded secrets so what

131
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,050
came out of that was the Free Software

132
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,780
Foundation and the GNU general public

133
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,590
license or the GPL for short which is a

134
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,599
free software license are basically

135
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,620
God's the principles that Richards

136
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,190
decided on to to safeguard the idea of

137
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:13,729
free software so basically the free

138
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:15,470
software movement is about the idea that

139
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,039
software is the communal good and must

140
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,210
stay in the public domain where it can

141
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,460
be studied and modified freely that's

142
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,149
the heart of the free software idea

143
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:33,229
right now we're in the late 80s and at

144
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:34,909
this point not too many people have

145
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,409
actually even heard of free software it

146
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:39,800
wasn't the movement that was growing

147
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,030
very quickly then in the mid 90s that

148
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,039
are about this fellow called

149
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:49,550
Eric Raymond published a treatise called

150
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,880
the cathedral and the bazaar which

151
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,310
introduced arrival but very similar idea

152
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,460
a compatible idea of sorts called open

153
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,190
source so this fellow Eric Raymond

154
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,949
published the text called the cathedral

155
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:11,180
and the bazaar and the idea of this was

156
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,210
more pragmatic than the face of

157
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,509
commitment so

158
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:19,819
the software still remains in the open

159
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:21,889
under open source but the idea is not so

160
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:25,249
much to preserve sort of the socialist

161
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:30,460
idea of sharing in faith of flat but

162
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,649
it's more the practical notion that if

163
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:36,260
software is out there in the open then

164
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,870
other people can review code or the

165
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,909
people can contribute it to your code

166
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,699
and this is the way to make your code

167
00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:47,240
better quite simply it's a strictly

168
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,889
utilitarian philosophy

169
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:51,980
unlike the frankly the socialism of free

170
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,070
software but still argue arguably has

171
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,940
the greater good in mind so the

172
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,810
flagships

173
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,639
of the open source movement at the time

174
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,480
were Linux the operating system or the

175
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,529
kernel which was using the GPL license

176
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:15,680
but definitely sort of politically was

177
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,540
more aligned with open source and free

178
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:23,449
software and there was this thing called

179
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:26,750
Netscape which started off from the

180
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,680
other direction as a piece of

181
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,449
proprietary software which the company

182
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:39,560
Netscape decided to to put to make

183
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,040
available under an open-source license

184
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,199
and this turned into the Mozilla browser

185
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:46,970
that we know today and the Mozilla

186
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:51,740
Foundation so the open source movement

187
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,170
which which grew out of the 90s and the

188
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,430
the 2000 tended to not be too keen on

189
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,860
the GPL depending rather on what they

190
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,519
called permissive licenses like BSD and

191
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,329
and MIT these did not include the the

192
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:16,850
GPS Sharon eye closes but was more about

193
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,829
pragmatically allowing software to you

194
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:20,959
to corporate open source software

195
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,279
without needing to share back

196
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:27,050
necessarily but preserving the the

197
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,430
rights you were granted under the

198
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,529
license for this the open source of with

199
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:35,389
typically so this was more in tune with

200
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:37,519
the idea with a pragmatic idea if it's

201
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,189
all stats everybody can use this

202
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:42,589
software for whatever they like even to

203
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:44,689
bid for pricier stuff laughs but the

204
00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:46,540
software itself has to stay available

205
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,680
and getting to this decade it sort of

206
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,990
changed a bit and so you have the

207
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,430
idealism of free software and you have

208
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,610
the pragmatism of open source and it's

209
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,230
sort of turning into something onto

210
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,629
getting you again it's something a bit

211
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:06,470
like us maybe programming as self

212
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,509
expression where the artist isn't

213
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:10,220
concerned with community improvement or

214
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,399
collective collective bug-fixing so much

215
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,589
is putting their work out there to be

216
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:19,459
appreciated for its own sake we're still

217
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:22,550
I think myself as a community trying to

218
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,740
figure out the shape of this new

219
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,949
community but it's really exciting to me

220
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:29,870
because in many ways this has been my

221
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,910
own motivation for writing software from

222
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:38,569
from the very start today but now I feel

223
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:40,759
like like people are actually writing

224
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:43,040
software just for the fun of it or for

225
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,350
the lyosha of it and I think that's

226
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,980
really wonderful but in summary whether

227
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,800
you see open-source as socialism or

228
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,829
pragmatism or or even art what it all

229
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:57,529
points down to ultimately and this is

230
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:59,600
what makes it so extremely important as

231
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,509
an idea is that open-source gives us

232
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:09,110
agency and what I mean by that is that

233
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,170
open-source actually grants us the power

234
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,959
first of all as Richard demanded to

235
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,110
create so we have the the source code

236
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,600
for the software we use available to us

237
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,879
so that we can easily customize it

238
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,769
improve it and repair it as we see fit

239
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:29,689
which empowers us as users as well as

240
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:32,179
programmers and it enhances the larger

241
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:33,620
community of the users and programmers

242
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,249
and this is perhaps the most important

243
00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:39,589
of all it also gives us the power to

244
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:42,730
learn how software is built

245
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,610
we have the vast bulk of open-source

246
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,330
software available to us and we have the

247
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,030
ability to examine it to learn how it

248
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,970
works and how to build similar systems

249
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,290
of our own and and anyone can do this I

250
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,660
mean given the admittedly not

251
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,550
unrestricted resource of time at least

252
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,100
there are no gatekeepers to the

253
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,020
knowledge it's readily accessible to

254
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,990
anybody without eating to pay anything

255
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,850
without needing to get accepted into a

256
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,860
university or anything like that

257
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,530
it's all right out there in the open and

258
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,420
that is actually really powerful but

259
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,310
what's so crucially important about the

260
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:28,000
idea of open source so to clarify this

261
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,960
well we're missing a slide I know there

262
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,920
was an exercise right okay to clarify

263
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,240
let me tell you the story of the man who

264
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,400
wanted to go to Mars let's call him

265
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:51,880
Elon after the the fiction of Martian

266
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,580
leader from a science fiction story by

267
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,490
some rocket scientist I forget

268
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,400
coincidentally of course

269
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,940
so his ambition is no less than to

270
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,090
actually send humans to Mars and put a

271
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:11,560
human colony on the planet Mars now

272
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,810
interestingly at least for the short

273
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,290
term his company SpaceX is actually

274
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,120
developing the technology they need to

275
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,760
facilitate going to Mars out in the open

276
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,460
citing the fact that their only real

277
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,570
competitors are Public Interest agencies

278
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,990
like NASA which actually don't don't

279
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,150
keep their work a secret at all so it's

280
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,320
all happening in the open they're all

281
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,610
sharing then take the technological

282
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,210
advances openly including this this

283
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,449
commercial operations place

284
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:48,129
my mic is falling off just a second

285
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:51,310
there we go so in a very real sense you

286
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,839
could say that space access is an open

287
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:55,060
source company in a larger open source

288
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,490
community just that they're not actually

289
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,029
doing software so much as space as it

290
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:05,110
were now imagine if this were not the

291
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,040
case imagine perhaps if someone with

292
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,540
different ideas about intellectual

293
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,279
property or in charge of the company

294
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,769
this of course this this picture is

295
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:18,579
randomly chosen imagine if the knowledge

296
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:21,100
needed to send our species to another

297
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,309
planet was locked away inside some

298
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:26,550
company some company's intellectual

299
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,620
property vaults as it were imagine if

300
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,819
some company was the gatekeeper to

301
00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:32,709
humanity's ability to actually go in and

302
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:36,430
colonize the universe and putting back a

303
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,220
bit from the granulation of space travel

304
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,050
imagine if companies controlled the

305
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,249
knowledge of how to write different

306
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:44,680
kinds of software inside their corporate

307
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,490
silos

308
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,550
imagine if the only way to learn how to

309
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,980
be a serious programmer was to sign up

310
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,490
with some giant corporation and you were

311
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,629
only allowed to use the knowledge you

312
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:58,149
gained from it as as directed by the

313
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:01,750
corporation or you will get shut down by

314
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,110
by patent lawsuits or similar this is

315
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,389
sort of thing that keeps me up at night

316
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:11,430
honestly so the point I'm trying to make

317
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,740
it's that it's not ultimately about the

318
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,589
software that we write it's about the

319
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:20,290
knowledge we put out that of how to

320
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,199
build the software that we write the

321
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,980
programs we leave behind they're not

322
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,160
really our legacy as programmers what

323
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,170
we're really contributing is the

324
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,329
knowledge that we develop the knowledge

325
00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:35,980
that we discover and the knowledge that

326
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,550
we pass on so to me it's actually really

327
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,100
important that we think very seriously

328
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,999
about how we protect that knowledge

329
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:49,569
which which belongs to all of us from

330
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:51,100
being locked away behind walls of

331
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,519
intellectual property and whatnot so I'm

332
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:56,490
sorry I'm going to get

333
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,199
I'm goes again into the legal details

334
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,809
now the GPL I mentioned what happens to

335
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:10,689
be one mechanism for this and I've got

336
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:14,319
actually a cheat sheet for you now if

337
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,679
you believe in this idea of preserving

338
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,319
the knowledge at all costs you want to

339
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,459
use the license that actually and source

340
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,439
that this happens

341
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,160
so the GPL says that not only must your

342
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,290
code remain freely available it also

343
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,790
cannot be linked with proprietary

344
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,760
software so the idea there is to

345
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,150
encourage everything to exist in a fully

346
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,270
open ecosystem now if you have the term

347
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,330
viral applied to the GPL that was sort

348
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,580
of Microsoft's way of referring to to

349
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,160
this idea in this negative way as they

350
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,600
could think of and the GPL is actually

351
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,270
really strict about this but in the

352
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,549
interest of sort of the socialist idea

353
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:04,330
of sharing knowledge this is a less

354
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,190
demanding version of the GPL called the

355
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,580
the lesser GPL as GPR and there's also

356
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,110
the Mozilla Public License which kind of

357
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,090
makes us the same requirements as the GP

358
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,760
out but it's still it's constrained just

359
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,809
to your particular project or even

360
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,429
particular files inside of that project

361
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:26,080
so you think the GPR kind of goes a

362
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,460
little bit too far you might want to

363
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,290
have a look at the Mozilla license which

364
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,080
is also quite decent and finally if

365
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,040
you're not actually making software but

366
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,870
things like writing or visual arts or

367
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,419
music then you can consider the creative

368
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,600
commons share-alike license share alike

369
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,490
is particularly close and the Creative

370
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,169
Commons license which tests SATs and

371
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:50,440
you're free to copy and modify this as

372
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,830
you please but you have to if you do so

373
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,710
you have to publish your derivative work

374
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,140
under the same license making it too

375
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,669
freely available now this is all from

376
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:05,860
the perspective of somebody who really

377
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,840
want to make sure that that free stuff

378
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,100
what happens you might not be

379
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,340
person I am but it's still a reasonable

380
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,110
phone and actually a lot more common for

381
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,250
people to just want to make sure that

382
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,720
their work is free and available to

383
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,330
everybody and they that everybody can

384
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:27,200
use it as they like this is basically

385
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,860
open source and in this case I'd like to

386
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,190
make a plea to you because I think the

387
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,960
most popular license for this by far is

388
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,419
the MIT license and BSD is also quite up

389
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:42,320
there but can I ask you please if this

390
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,000
is how you feel about so if I consider

391
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,140
the apache license because MIT is is is

392
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,230
home quite fine as a license it's very

393
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,960
short which a lot of people like but a

394
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,440
lot of the protections that offers are

395
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,850
implied by the wording of the MIT

396
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,669
license being as short as the days like

397
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:04,730
for instance patient protections the MIT

398
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,010
license says something like everybody's

399
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,059
free to use the software without

400
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:10,250
restriction which implies there has to

401
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,130
be a patient grant if the author of the

402
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,200
software owns the patent for the

403
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,500
software as well now the apache license

404
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,990
actually has things like this the patent

405
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,150
crowns in in plain text inside the

406
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,059
license so it's an explicit grant

407
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:28,190
whereas MIT tends to usually hold up in

408
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,140
court for this sort of thing it is

409
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,610
actually a lot better to have this

410
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,929
language specifically in the license so

411
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:37,250
if you're on the permissive side of

412
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,220
open-source I would like to urge you to

413
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,840
please consider the apache license for

414
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,320
your next project rather than MIT or of

415
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,299
course the GPL or the mozilla license if

416
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:51,590
you like so just at the end this is

417
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,400
where it gets social this is the awkward

418
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,830
posthumous talk because it would be

419
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,539
almost dishonest of me not to address

420
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:01,789
what might well be considered the

421
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:03,110
elephant in the room at this point

422
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,409
because you only that our community

423
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:08,750
leaders sometimes turn out to be a bit

424
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,220
rubbish and Richard as it happens

425
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,409
Richard Stallman it's not necessary an

426
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:17,860
exception to this I don't think he's

427
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,169
actually malicious in any real sense but

428
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:22,240
the truth is is

429
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,230
it says some pretty awful things I don't

430
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,350
think he means to hurt people but it's

431
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,110
more a matter of not knowing quite how

432
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,840
to behave properly in civilized society

433
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:39,880
and I mean I don't mean to excuse him

434
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,050
actually it is a bit problematic for the

435
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,320
leader of the free software movement to

436
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,290
to behave in this way and maybe it's

437
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:54,820
time for him to step down and when it

438
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,160
comes to Eric Raymond I'm not even going

439
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,990
to go that he's literally the worst

440
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,720
person in existence I just feel it's

441
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,660
important to mention that and my purpose

442
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,520
in going to this rather dark place at

443
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,200
the end of the talk is to stress that

444
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,960
even though the idea of open-source been

445
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,120
always have sort of sprung from the most

446
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,420
saintly of people it's not about the

447
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,990
people in the and we shouldn't be

448
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,220
treating these people as heroes which

449
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,380
not really treating anybody as heroes

450
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,890
and what matters is the idea of open

451
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,920
source or whichever direction you

452
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,480
approach it from whether it is from the

453
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,920
left or from the right or permissive

454
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,960
restrictive care or don't care

455
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,250
all of that it's not about the people

456
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:46,300
it's about the idea and the idea what it

457
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,340
comes down to in the end is the

458
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,000
knowledge embedded in the community

459
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,900
that's what's so important to protect

460
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,910
the knowledge of how to write software

461
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,720
and more broadly the knowledge of how to

462
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,790
do anything we as humans are able to do

463
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:08,080
even one day you and me we're going to

464
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,500
go to the stars and the knowledge to do

465
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,350
that we must preserve that at all costs

466
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,080
and that is what open source is really

467
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,440
all about thank you so much for enduring

468
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,390
this enjoy the book
