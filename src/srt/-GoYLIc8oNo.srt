00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,720

hi-yah I'm Lawrence and I'm actually a

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,490
teacher at the University of Applied

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,150
Sciences in Amsterdam but that's not

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,130
what I'm here to talk to you about today

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,420
I'm also volunteer at a refugee code

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:21,300
school called pack your future and well

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,949
I can tell you what hack your future is

8
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,019
but it's actually been done better in

9
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:26,670
this video so I'll show you show you a

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,670
short clip

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:41,590
[Music]

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,660
haiji future is an initiative it's an

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,850
organization that especially for

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,890
refugees that come to the Netherlands I

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,199
think it's mostly Syria but it's from

16
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,590
other places as well people who have

17
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,050
left their countries involuntarily to

18
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,170
pick up a new skill hopefully so hack

19
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,940
your future teaches them computer

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,630
programming web development CSS and HTML

21
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,640
and you learn the basic about it and

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,760
then JavaScript of course and help them

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:21,689
to find jobs these are people who had

24
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,460
some unfortunate circumstances perhaps

25
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,650
and are trying to do something good for

26
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,450
themselves and for the world I'm proud

27
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,439
of myself that I could learn it all so

28
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,759
this actually tells you a bit about what

29
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,890
hack your future is but not so much

30
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,470
about why hack your future is so IQ

31
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,390
future was founded by a couple of people

32
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,079
who thought well there's a growing group

33
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,619
of refugees coming to our country and

34
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,390
they'll actually have a lot of trouble

35
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,310
entering the job market because they

36
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,960
won't have the right backgrounds they'll

37
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,659
have some language barriers maybe there

38
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,579
are some discrimination issues going on

39
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,579
so how can we prevent these people from

40
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,649
becoming marginalized in our society so

41
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,740
it it funded hack your future because

42
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,390
they decided well what's what's the best

43
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,220
way to actually empower people and the

44
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,379
best way to get them jobs well one of

45
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:12,090
the best ways currently is to teach them

46
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:12,740
what if

47
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,750
skills because there's a lot of demand

48
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,050
for web development skills and it allows

49
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,390
you to go into various different paths

50
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,720
as you all know so we thought well how

51
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,660
can we do that we came up with an idea

52
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,300
of of setting up a volunteer program

53
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,570
where volunteers teach refugees every

54
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,270
Sunday for about four hours we have

55
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,270
interactive sessions with them and then

56
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,160
they spend about 20 hours working on

57
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,350
homework assignments and they hand in

58
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,110
their homework on get up and we interact

59
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,550
with them through slack throughout the

60
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,920
week so they actually have some support

61
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,980
for the whole week we teach some basic

62
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,090
skills first we start off with HTML CSS

63
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,590
because they have virtually no technical

64
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,180
skills coming in and that's like a

65
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,820
really easy way to enter this field and

66
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,490
then we spent nine weeks on the basics

67
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,910
of programming through JavaScript which

68
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,920
I had a lot of pleasure and teaching

69
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,470
them they're super motivated so it goes

70
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,270
a lot faster actually doing with my

71
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:19,340
students at the University and after at

72
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,050
the end of those six months they work on

73
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,700
a project and they actually develop

74
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,860
something themselves they often choose

75
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,350
to develop something that will benefit

76
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,530
other refugees which is really awesome

77
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,020
and alongside that program we also teach

78
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,810
some seminars on how to conduct yourself

79
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,050
and job interviews how to make a good

80
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,860
LinkedIn profile well you know basic

81
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,950
skills that you might also want and

82
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,960
things that are quite different in in

83
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,940
the Netherlands as opposed to for

84
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,810
instance Syria so yeah that's that's the

85
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,320
way that we that we set it up so what

86
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,260
have we achieved well we have about 55

87
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,990
students that have found jobs at

88
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,590
companies such as KPMG booking.com and

89
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,310
KLM I guess that's the the main thing

90
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,770
that we've achieved but we also have an

91
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,290
an active network of students mentors

92
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,330
and alumni there are 200 people strong

93
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,580
they're all in one select group they

94
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,410
help each other out with anything from

95
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,810
[Music]

96
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,990
finding good companies to apply it

97
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,090
- how to cycle through the snow in the

98
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,380
Netherlands when winter comes and we've

99
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,229
also achieved 100% uptime for the past

100
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:38,360
two years and honestly who can really

101
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,830
say that about any program we're running

102
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,630
we also have some new chapters in

103
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:49,099
Copenhagen London Annamma so people have

104
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:52,819
started copying our projects and

105
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:55,069
hopefully we've achieved part of at

106
00:04:55,069 --> 00:05:00,470
least a better future so I also have a

107
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,509
quote it's not by Steve Jobs it's

108
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:06,169
bye-bye jack one of her students he says

109
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:08,979
that his main takeaways from the program

110
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:12,560
were to how to think like a programmer

111
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,599
how to work in a team and most

112
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:17,810
importantly that people can still treat

113
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,490
him for the for the person that he are

114
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,550
he that he is and not the way that he

115
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,699
might be seen which i think is very

116
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,470
important thing for these students

117
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,020
coming to us because as soon as they

118
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,060
enter our doors they they stop being a

119
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,949
refugee and they start being a students

120
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:36,409
and we just treat them like that and we

121
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:38,060
don't really talk about their

122
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,830
backgrounds at all we just treat them as

123
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,750
students and we say this is your

124
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,590
homework you have to deliver on it we

125
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,389
will be supportive and try to help you

126
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,669
with any issue but well you have to

127
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:54,800
deliver so actually the point of this

128
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,900
talk is not to tell you how awesome it

129
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,840
is that I work at this program that I

130
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,060
volunteer or how good this program is I

131
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,940
actually want all of you to start

132
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,610
copying this idea and to set up a hack

133
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,789
your future of your own because I think

134
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:12,310
it's one of the best ways to empower

135
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,650
people so how can you do that well you

136
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,560
need a couple of ingredients first of a

137
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,069
convenient location it's important that

138
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:24,319
people can actually reach your your

139
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,630
location and and a lot of these people

140
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,729
will be in camps and they might not have

141
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:31,969
a lot of money or means of

142
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:33,889
transportation so it's important that

143
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:36,110
you find a good location secondly you'll

144
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,610
need some laptops they don't need to be

145
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,560
state-of-the-art actually it's better if

146
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,639
developers don't have

147
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,379
state-of-the-art laptop so they learn

148
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:47,150
how to develop for for all people you'll

149
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,819
need a program director or better yet a

150
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:51,770
team of people who are prepared to think

151
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,599
about the hard challenges that you might

152
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,110
face to get everybody together we can

153
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,439
help you bit with with that you'll need

154
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,479
mentors and this seems like it might be

155
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,389
difficult to find people to volunteer

156
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:07,249
especially on a Sunday as we do but

157
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:09,409
we've actually found that there is an

158
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:11,469
abundance of mentors people are really

159
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:14,569
happy to help there are people from

160
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:16,099
universities there's people from

161
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:19,009
companies there's people from well any

162
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,599
place you can think of a lot of people

163
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:23,840
with diverse backgrounds like to help

164
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,819
out as well so we have a very diverse

165
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:28,060
group of mentors helping out and

166
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,529
students of course this is the most

167
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:34,039
important parts might not be as easy as

168
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:35,750
finding the mentors because you need to

169
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,469
find people that have basic English

170
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:41,599
skills first that's like that's our

171
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,180
minimum requirement but we also want

172
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,400
them to be very motivated so we actually

173
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,199
have them do a little test before

174
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,779
they're allowed to join our program and

175
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:52,610
it's about learning a skill on your own

176
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,169
so they have to prove that they can do

177
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:56,000
that within a certain amount of time and

178
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,939
it's a task that really anybody can

179
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:02,180
complete as long as they're motivated I

180
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,580
guess a lot of people will ask well how

181
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,949
do you get financial supports you don't

182
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:09,020
need that much money it's nice if some

183
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,389
companies help out and donate old

184
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:14,020
laptops it's nice if the municipality

185
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,060
helps out with the rent a bit or get

186
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,509
your location but ultimately this is

187
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:21,889
definitely something that you can

188
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:24,649
overcome you'd be surprised at how many

189
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:26,149
people want to help if you have a good

190
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:29,089
idea of course you also need a

191
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:31,819
curriculum this is something that can be

192
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:33,260
very difficult to set up but we've

193
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,169
already done it for you so I'll show you

194
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:38,479
a link on our curriculum it's just

195
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,880
something on github it's just a list of

196
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,320
topics that we think is good to talk

197
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,120
about but of course you can set up your

198
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,290
own way of doing it so how would you do

199
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,630
this well just like Jess Kampf you can

200
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,250
just say like well I think this is a

201
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,530
great idea I want to do this in my city

202
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,110
so I'm just gonna basically fork the the

203
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,350
projects which you can do from github

204
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,540
hack your future and then if you want to

205
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,250
know how to get started you can just go

206
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,310
to start code school and there will be

207
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,290
lots of tips there there will be lots of

208
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,780
documents there will be like a setup for

209
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,360
a code of conduct there will be an

210
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,670
article about how to deal with students

211
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,380
who have some trouble with staying in

212
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,410
the country there will be some tips on

213
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,240
how to conduct yourself as a as a

214
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,820
teacher so we've tried to share all the

215
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,800
knowledge that we already have here and

216
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,020
we also have links to all the the

217
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,640
resources that we we use if you need

218
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,230
some more help you can also talk to me

219
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,120
on slack actually I think there should

220
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,670
be a space between Lawrence and iron

221
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,360
Alta which is very Dutch name but if you

222
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,800
if you put that in you should be able to

223
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,300
find me or you can just find me in real

224
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,360
life I'll be around for these two days

225
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,520
and I hope to work together with you

226
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,770
into creating a better future thank you
