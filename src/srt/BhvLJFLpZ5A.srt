1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,509

um give me a second all right working

2
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,710
good um hello good morning uh we're

3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,539
going to go from systems programming to

4
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,240
tech money and politics so I think we're

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,189
aiming for like hundred percent audience

6
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,650
alienation is the goal here so who here

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,480
and this is going to be a question that

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,740
I want to start by making you

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,719
uncomfortable who here writes code for

10
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,540
money I do yeah I know we're not

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,340
supposed to say that we write it clearly

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,190
for passion but um also for money who

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,200
here writes code for money at a tech

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,710
company I do not everyone does um who

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,020
here uses products program data tech

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,949
company say github or nvm who pays for

17
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:54,989
products that are programmed at a tech

18
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,449
company who makes products that they

19
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,489
sell to other tech companies that's the

20
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:01,070
thing i do not everyone does that either

21
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,690
tech company tech company tech company

22
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,670
money money money money money so tech

23
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,170
companies make a lot of money and

24
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,640
they've made a lot of people very rich

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,409
some of those people they've made rich

26
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,689
through profits off of sales of products

27
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,729
directly but not very many that's not

28
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:17,310
the typical model for tech company money

29
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,310
making these days mostly those profits

30
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,470
come from a large exit event such as it

31
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,409
like an IPO or a sale not such as those

32
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,320
are the two exit events um and the

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,479
profits from those events I don't know

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,590
why they're called that but that's what

35
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,869
people say the events are split between

36
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:36,750
the shareholders who own part who own

37
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,119
shares of that company us can be

38
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,250
employees it's often in some part early

39
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,140
employees but it's usually mostly

40
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,720
investors people and firms who have

41
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,500
given those product makers money in

42
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,329
exchange for a share of the company in

43
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:53,880
the hopes of this large event happening

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,079
we call early stage investors venture

45
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:01,110
capitalists um because it sounds like I

46
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,240
don't know an early like a victorian

47
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,280
cowboy novel I don't know why we call

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,899
them that but it has to do with the writ

49
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,200
like the risk involved and the early the

50
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,330
earliness of the investment I wanted to

51
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,379
find that because I'm going to be saying

52
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:13,840
the word

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,450
see a lot so when we work at these

54
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,790
companies as many of us do as I do and

55
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,319
many folks who raise their hands do our

56
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,629
labor is going to grow the investment

57
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:24,370
that these people have made some of it

58
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,110
may be going to grow our own investment

59
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,879
but its share between those things and

60
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:30,849
when it does pay off the money that's

61
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:34,269
made out of our labor goes to these

62
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:35,830
people and they use it for other things

63
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,239
some of that is other tech companies

64
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,190
increasingly more and more it's been

65
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,970
spent on political campaigns and races

66
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,599
so there is a lot of national investment

67
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,720
from tech companies into politics Barack

68
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,120
Obama certainly has gotten a lot of

69
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,910
money fund raising money from tech folks

70
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,890
lobbying if there's been almost like a

71
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,290
hockey stick style growth in lobbyists

72
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,930
paid directly by tech companies national

73
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,970
candidates to four million dollars was

74
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,060
spent this year on a house race in San

75
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,690
Jose trying to electro Khanna to the

76
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,250
house representatives as sort of a tech

77
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,090
company friendly legislature national

78
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,760
priorities tech money-wise are usually a

79
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,579
i'ma guard sort of immigration tax

80
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:23,650
policies cyber security and net

81
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,319
neutrality I am NOT going to talk about

82
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,670
immigration because some things are

83
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,319
sacred and that's absolutely a third

84
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,150
rail in our community so I'm not I'm not

85
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,030
touching it tax policy generally is the

86
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,349
same as everyone else tech companies

87
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,540
don't pay it either cyber security and

88
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,569
net neutrality are things that other

89
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:41,739
people have talked about and talked

90
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:43,750
about better I'm so I'm not going to

91
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,000
talk about national priorities in tech a

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,950
political spending I'm actually going to

93
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,200
talk more about spending on local state

94
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,940
and regional levels I believe that this

95
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,180
kind of political involvement has more

96
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,560
of an impact on our day-to-day life I

97
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,359
believe we're seeing more and more of it

98
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:00,190
and it's changing rapidly right now so I

99
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,079
want to talk about it so those are the

100
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:03,310
things that tech money cares about in

101
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,319
the national level what does tech money

102
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,000
care about on a state and regional level

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,389
so who knows it six californias is who

104
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:16,060
has seen like a badly night joke about

105
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,579
six californias six californias as this

106
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,979
plan to split California in 26 States

107
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:22,780
you know small government and all that

108
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,640
it's completely unworkable it's insane

109
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,960
it doesn't make any sense um

110
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,270
it was a ballot initiative they missed

111
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,940
the deadline in 2014 and spent so

112
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,650
gathered signatures for 20s their dau

113
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,289
gathering signatures for 2016 they

114
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:38,180
collected a million signatures to try to

115
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,000
get on the ballot in 2014 missed the bat

116
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,419
ended up being about 750,000 valid

117
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:45,710
signatures so about three quarters

118
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,050
actually isn't bad which says a lot

119
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,449
about California and initiative politics

120
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:52,069
they missed by about 50 case they're

121
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:53,419
looking to put it back on the ballot in

122
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:58,340
2016 this is Tim Draper he is a

123
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,410
billionaire venture capitalist he is the

124
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,669
son of another billionaire venture

125
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:03,349
capitalist and he's the grandson of yet

126
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:04,970
another billionaire venture capitalist

127
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,430
he's the founder of draper fisher jerger

128
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,320
and Draper associates I also believe his

129
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,470
son is avicii um some of his investments

130
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,220
are skype hotmail Tesla baidu which is

131
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,770
like the Chinese search engine twitch

132
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,139
and an unaccredited University named

133
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:23,060
after him and San Mateo offering degrees

134
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,630
in entrepreneurship he is the sole

135
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,810
funder of six californias he poured five

136
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,789
million dollars to buy those eight

137
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,199
hundred thousand signatures to get on

138
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,490
the ballot and he's going to pour more

139
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,509
into get it on the ballot in 2016 so you

140
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:43,039
know wacky rich guy right that's in by

141
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,900
the way this picture was taken in his

142
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,199
University this is the seating at Draper

143
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,169
University in San Mateo ah so you know

144
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:53,539
was a crazy check story right here's the

145
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:55,099
thing it's not is actually his first

146
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:58,699
political venture in two thousand there

147
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,949
was another time very recently where

148
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:02,599
people were making obscene amounts of

149
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:04,610
money and then investing it in local

150
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,830
politics I know we've forgotten that

151
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,280
that ever happened and and refused to

152
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,599
talk about what happened at the end of

153
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:13,909
it but in two thousand in the first tech

154
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:17,509
boom he sponsored a proposition state

155
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:19,880
proposition called proposition 38 prop

156
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,650
30 proposed to give every student in the

157
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,120
state four thousand dollars to attend

158
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,919
private school no regulations are

159
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:26,690
constraints whatsoever no means testing

160
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,360
nothing it was essentially a proposal to

161
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,219
privatize public education at the cost

162
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:33,050
of about three and a half billion

163
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,599
dollars to the state of California Tim

164
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:37,610
spent 23 million of his own money on

165
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,589
this proposition his dad threw in

166
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:40,729
another two and a half million

167
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:41,990
it was believed to be the largest

168
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,729
contribution by an individual to a

169
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:45,379
ballot proposition in California history

170
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:48,339
at that time so large amount of money

171
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:51,979
this was to be fair pretty beanbag wacky

172
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:54,379
that's very far to the right of even

173
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:56,800
like the most ardent voucher prophecy

174
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,409
proposals and it failed it did not

175
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:02,749
succeed not before the opponents of it

176
00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:06,680
spent another 30 million opposing it so

177
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,229
this is still in the realm of crazy guy

178
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:12,650
doing crazy things in politics but he

179
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,779
actually was fresh off a stint on the

180
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:18,319
State Board of Education he Tim Draper

181
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,449
was appointed by governor pete wilson in

182
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:22,460
1998 to the State Board of Education his

183
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,469
main is only qualification was having

184
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:26,330
developed a business simulation game for

185
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,849
kids and fundraising for Pete Wilson of

186
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:31,689
course the Board of Education sets

187
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:34,039
education policy in California it orders

188
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:37,219
textbooks it's sort of adopts policy and

189
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:40,069
writes the actual practical

190
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:41,629
implementation of policies that's quite

191
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:44,270
a bit of power for someone who went on

192
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,370
to then propose privatizing the entire

193
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,370
education system Gray Davis a Democrat

194
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,919
was a replaced pete wilson discover 1999

195
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,249
Tim Draper was not reappointed in his

196
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:57,770
place however Reed Hastings was and you

197
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,779
probably know Reed Hastings as a CEO of

198
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,870
Netflix he's also on the board of

199
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,069
Facebook he was on the board of

200
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,779
Microsoft he was already rich when he

201
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:08,089
founded Netflix from a 750 million

202
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:10,159
dollar acquisition of a previous company

203
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:13,639
he helmed he was and is a major major

204
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,620
major Democratic donor nationally and

205
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,449
locally and he was a special supporter

206
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:19,099
of the newly elected governor Davis and

207
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,479
he stayed on the Board of Education much

208
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,550
longer than Tim Draper through the

209
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,930
beginner beginning of Governors for

210
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,219
teenagers term and he actually was the

211
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:26,719
President of the Board of Education for

212
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:30,979
four years and Reed had a big-money

213
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:32,599
school bell on the ballot in 2000 as

214
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:36,709
well prop 39 reduced the threshold for

215
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:38,810
local school board initiatives to pass

216
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,089
from sixty-six percent to fifty-five

217
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:43,880
percent so it said to pass a school bus

218
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,790
school bond local school bond measure

219
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,350
you only need fifty five percent of the

220
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,699
vote previously it had been sixty-six

221
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:51,339
percent and this had a big effect on

222
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:54,019
bills getting past actually to fund

223
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:54,470
school dist

224
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,790
locally I passed easily um partially

225
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,930
probably because they outspent their

226
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,970
opponents 621 they raised three point

227
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,550
flat through 30 1.5 million dollars to

228
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,040
pass proposition 39 and 2000 Reed gave a

229
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,800
million dollars of his money personally

230
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,080
the main Thunder was I mean then the

231
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,880
passing this bill was in big part thanks

232
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,290
to Reed's buddy and the campaign

233
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,280
co-chair John doar John doar is the star

234
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,320
partner at kleiner perkins caufield &

235
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,410

236
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,100
venture capital investment firm in the

237
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,570
south bay they made their substantial

238
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,780
wealth by investing in google amazon AOL

239
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,470
into its son EA Genentech Zynga lots of

240
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,180
things have been funded by kleiner

241
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,320
perkins um John doar the partner gave

242
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,440
six million himself uh kleiner perkins

243
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,990
gave a million from the firm there was a

244
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,240
couple other partners that gave a total

245
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,030
of 1.5 million more than eight million

246
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,250
dollars basically made from investments

247
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,030
in these companies went to pass prop 39

248
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,090
so like well I got to be thinking like

249
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,860
all that just to lower the voting

250
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,780
threshold for these school bond bills

251
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,790
that seems like a lot of money to spend

252
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,310
turns out there was a provision of prop

253
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,140
39 that didn't have anything to do with

254
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,930
bond funding charter schools are private

255
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,180
organization some prop nonprofit and

256
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,040
some for-profit that run public schools

257
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,720
they're funded by taxpayer dollars

258
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,580
they're funded per student the way that

259
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,380
public schools are this has been a

260
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,870
growing movement over the past about 20

261
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,360
years as a way of reforming the

262
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,820
education system basically taking the

263
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,680
government out of it well not their

264
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,110
money um there's a proposition a in the

265
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,620
bill prop 39 that requires that public

266
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,270
districts provide charter schools with

267
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,070
space reasonably equivalent to those

268
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,020
used by non charter schools in the

269
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,540
district so they have to lease if they

270
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,670
have space they have to give it to

271
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,870
charter schools if they ask for it

272
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,730
basically and it has to be identically

273
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,560
furnished and located in the area the

274
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,720
charter school wants to locate in and so

275
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,460
different school districts have done

276
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,980
this in different ways LA Unified School

277
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,570
District has to fill this request

278
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,940
through colocation which means putting

279
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,240
charter

280
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,040
schools in the same actual building and

281
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,140
facilities as non charter schools which

282
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,700
is a very literal reading of what the

283
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,230
bill is asking for it's incredibly

284
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,930
controversial it doesn't go well very

285
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,940
often and charter schools are not happy

286
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,470
with it generally so this culminated

287
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,120
recently in a series of drawn-out

288
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,490
lawsuits against the LA Unified School

289
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,990
District by the California Charter

290
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,390
Schools Association probably wondering

291
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,950

lot of tech investors there's actually a

340
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,010
lot of money coming from tech to fund

341
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,230
what is often cast as a grassroots

342
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,870
Charter movement right and actually once

343
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,250
you start noticing this this is

344
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,620
everywhere you look Laurene Powell Jobs

345
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,950
is now after her husband's death has

346
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,870
been sort of lauded for her newfound

347
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,880
philanthropic interest and she's done

348
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,380
she's been giving massive grants to

349
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,180
charters vihar Emerson collective

350
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,000
education fund the CEO of co.org

351
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,040
recently gave a huge chunk of cash to

352
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,570
support a measure to establish charter

353
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,870
schools in Washington State Mark

354
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,750
Zuckerberg um 100 million dollar

355
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,870
donation to Newark schools which has

356
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,370
been kind of a clusterfuck was actually

357
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,020
focused directly on charters it was a

358
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,270
main tenet about 100 million dollar

359
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,970
donation there's a lot of money there

360
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,980
from tech in this movement and in these

361
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,310
organizations what is it being spent on

362
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,500
so at a certain point within the last

363
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,810
couple years the folks funding these

364
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,160
movements have turned their focus from

365
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,440
state propositions all of those still

366
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,230
exists and there's still political work

367
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,089
being done on the state level in favor

368
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:32,790
of charters to local governments and

369
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,470
there's there has been an absolutely

370
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,440
unprecedented flow of money from

371
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,029
political action campaigns into school

372
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:41,339
board elections which are you know

373
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,170
generally even in big cities kind of

374
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:48,600
tiny Affairs in Oakland in 2012 185

375
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,830
thousand dollars was spent by tech

376
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,510
funded packs on school board elections

377
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:58,110
here 150 k this year in West contruct

378
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,690
West Contra Costa County school board

379
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,089
election this year 350 thousand dollars

380
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:06,980
spent by one pack in a school board race

381
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,320
$250,000 in Santa Clara against Kennedy

382
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,990
and a song who's never even had outward

383
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,140
opposition to charters it's across the

384
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,180
country it's happening all over the the

385
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,950
focus has turned to school board races

386
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:26,610
so why is that so these are a couple of

387
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,160
quotes from Reed Hastings recently the

388
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,350
first one he's basically saying what's

389
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,640
the problem with school districts

390
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,230
definitely their democratically

391
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,440
school boards um apparently they're

392
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,000
getting a little sick of having to spend

393
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,470
all this money to keep candidates in

394
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:44,430
there um it's he outwardly said that one

395
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,840
goal of the charter school movement is

396
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,080
to get school board is to shrink school

397
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,390
board um power and this is where the

398
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,250
opposition that happens the school board

399
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,320
generally happens at the school board

400
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,460
large schools generally happens at the

401
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,010
school board level this last quote is

402
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,600
really instructive right it's like why

403
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,950
why right this is this is a huge amount

404
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,930
of money and a really like widespread

405
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,020
movement why do it and this quote ear

406
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,940
says basically how Reed Hastings

407
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,490
envisions the role of a school district

408
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,650
in this new model of Education is to

409
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,570
bring charter schools to town like a

410
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:19,950
chamber of commerce would develop

411
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,850
business okay I think that's a really

412
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,860
instructive quote why is all this money

413
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,670
going to charter schools so rocket ship

414
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,680
that I mentioned is a huge proponent of

415
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,550
the concept of blended learning which is

416
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,260
classroom time that's really focused on

417
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,110
it's backed up by a computer based

418
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,430
instruction and all of these a lot of

419
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,630
these charter schools are very tech

420
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,040
focused there's a ton of online work

421
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,960
that happens it's bringing tech into the

422
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,090
schools there's in fact there's in fact

423
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,440
some schools that are entirely online

424
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,500
doing online education what that means

425
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,540
is that there's a lot of software to be

426
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,700
made and there's a lot of software to be

427
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,480
sold to fulfill these needs for for for

428
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,010
online classes and for online education

429
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:08,460
and online tools and in fact there's an

430
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,370
entire new sector newish sector called

431
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:16,560
ed tech which is growing hugely it

432
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,910
focuses on a couple different things but

433
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,590
k12 ed check in particular has been a

434
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,420
market that's gone up hugely in the last

435
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,820
decade last even two three four years

436
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,370
it's become a huge focus of folks it's

437
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:31,200
stuff like online classes apps to drill

438
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,090
for tests things like that and it's it's

439
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,920
broad and there's a ton of money going

440
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,080
into it some of it directly by some of

441
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,520
the folks that i mentioned earlier who

442
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,840
investing in these charter schools

443
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,900
dreambox is a math online math education

444
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,270
program that Reed Hastings and John

445
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,380
Doerr recently bought for eight figures

446
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,830
and it's used by

447
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,120
all the rocketship schools it's like an

448
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,190
official tool that they use John Zenor

449
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,320
who was the CEO of rocketship actually

450
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,330
left to develop an app that's now used

451
00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:00,370
by rocket ship schools there are VC

452
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,890
firms that only focus on ed tech there

453
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,840
are accelerators now there are multiple

454
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,610
ed tech accelerators some of which are

455
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:12,149
focused directly on k-12 education um

456
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:14,590
there are some challenges and investing

457
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,799
in ed tech as our favorite Twitter

458
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,750
thought leader has pointed out here in

459
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,130
Marc Andreessen he was also a major

460
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,539
venture catalyst famous for his

461
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:26,049
investment in netscape I think this is a

462
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:28,779
really interesting quote because Morgan

463
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:30,639
Driessen does invest in EdTech despite

464
00:18:30,639 --> 00:18:32,769
this quote he's not saying he wouldn't

465
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:34,330
invest in EdTech he's saying these

466
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,970
conditions make it difficult and so one

467
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,000
approach to that is doing some of the

468
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,169
things that I talked about earlier which

469
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:44,289
is changing the way that public schools

470
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:48,100
as they're conceived sort of exists so

471
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,419
that you can change how they procure

472
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,389
things and in fact andreessen horowitz

473
00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:54,639
recently hired as a political consultant

474
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:56,799
adrian fenty the ex mayor of DC who is a

475
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,559
very famous charter school advocate and

476
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:02,019
that's that explicitly adds a political

477
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:04,659
consultant to help them with political

478
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:07,059
interventions for their portfolio

479
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:09,100
companies another way to do that is to

480
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,019
create markets outside of public schools

481
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:13,360
which is tech could be you could and you

482
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,860
could sort of sell the charter schools

483
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,769
of that but even things like just last

484
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:21,100
month andreessen horowitz invested in a

485
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,960
new private school chain completely

486
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,210
private venture funded schools is kind

487
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,250
of an unusual model in anything there's

488
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,779
a thing called there's some for-profit

489
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:31,659
universities have also seen investment

490
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:35,470
from tech companies there's also not

491
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,419
sort of bypassing the school's

492
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:39,580
themselves and selling directly to

493
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,070
students and parents um there's been a

494
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,470
big wave of free products recently that

495
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,799
are designed to enhance learning and as

496
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,659
we know when you have a free product

497
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:52,510
from a for-profit company what's what's

498
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,389
being sold there is not the app itself

499
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:57,669
but it's the data and in some ways

500
00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:00,250
having some sway over regulations about

501
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,600
the use of student data can be

502
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,490
really really lucrative thing for

503
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:09,190
investors so what okay so let me say

504
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,289
this let me just cut off a conversation

505
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:13,299
I'm not interested in having after this

506
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:15,039
talk you don't need to come up to me and

507
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,289
tell me about how your little niece is

508
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:18,940
in the best charter school and it's

509
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,220
amazing or teach for america saved your

510
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,080
cousin's life or whatever I don't care

511
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,090
and also I don't think it's actually

512
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,289
relevant to the point I'm trying to make

513
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:28,960
right the charter schools sort of

514
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,870
argument or discussion is complex right

515
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,480
if there's I'm by no means trying to

516
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,370
suggest that all of the thousands if not

517
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,110
millions of students in charter schools

518
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,090
and teachers and administrators who are

519
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,490
working very hard to give students good

520
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:45,039
education are evil or are scheming for

521
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,179
profit right but this is going on and

522
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:50,140
we're basically having a private

523
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,789
infrastructure built under our nose by

524
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:53,559
people who are openly advocating for

525
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:55,929
less democratic processes in order to

526
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:57,400
serve their own economic interests and

527
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,130
that bothers me I find it disturbing I

528
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,350
think that's reasonable to be mad about

529
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,480
that right public schooling has been

530
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,830
concerted considered a cornerstone of

531
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,750
our democracy forever right and you

532
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,340
might ask agree or disagree with this

533
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,620
particular approach to education reform

534
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,880
but our ability to have that

535
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,530
conversation at all as being usurped

536
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,049
right and what's more is to like to us

537
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:18,460
it's being you served with our own money

538
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,070
with our own labor right with with money

539
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,659
that we're generating so I think that's

540
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:24,340
worth paying attention to and it's worth

541
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,549
caring about another thing to note is

542
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:28,960
that there's something that we know

543
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,059
about tech companies and investors they

544
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:34,330
copy right you get for every goober you

545
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,450
get a lift sometimes the the models that

546
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,270
are copied go on to be far more

547
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,710
successful than the original you know

548
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,030
you do get things like Facebook out of

549
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,159
my space I want to wrap up by talking

550
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:46,600
about a way that I think that this

551
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,070
pattern which has been pretty successful

552
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,120
so far is starting to be applied again

553
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,140
who knows who this is yes say it say his

554
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,549
name if you say it three times in the

555
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,760
mirror he appears covered in blood this

556
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,590
is Ron Conway we were not going to get

557
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,030
through a presentation in the Bay Area

558
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,799
about tech money and politics without

559
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:10,450
Ron Conway um Ron Conway okay Ron Conway

560
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,409
is a a

561
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:17,239
like very prolific tech investor he's

562
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:19,970
invested in Airbnb in Google very early

563
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,710
on to so he's made a ton of money Airbnb

564
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,409
Google paypal Twitter Zynga Facebook

565
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:27,230
BuzzFeed reddit pinterest mint square

566
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,259
over 650 companies I guarantee this

567
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:32,210
morning you have interacted with a Ron

568
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,460
Conway investment product it's I there's

569
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,039
no way you didn't um every for a while

570
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,960
every y combinator company he was buying

571
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,090
shares and I mean he gets around and

572
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,460
he's made an absolute almost

573
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,619
inconceivable amount of money uh early

574
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:48,769
stage in early-stage tech investing this

575
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:50,929
is maybe his most impressive purchase to

576
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:53,659
date the entire political apparatus of

577
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:55,489
San Francisco and I am in no means I'm

578
00:22:55,489 --> 00:22:57,289
by no means exaggerating and this is all

579
00:22:57,289 --> 00:22:59,539
very public it's not hidden there's

580
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:00,830
articles about it i'm not going to go

581
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,779
too deep into it but i encourage you if

582
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:04,850
this is newer a little bit unfamiliar to

583
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,590
you to look into it because it's pretty

584
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:11,090
fascinating basically he in 2011 I

585
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,519
believe stepped in to negotiate a tax

586
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,970
break to allow in the way it's phrased

587
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,039
is to keep Twitter in the city which I

588
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,480
have a lot of any way we could talk

589
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,600
about a lunch um he negotiated a massive

590
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,679
tax break for Twitter and other

591
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:26,509
companies in the mid market area he

592
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:28,220
basically decided that was great I like

593
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,019
that let's do more of it he spent six

594
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:31,549
hundred thousand dollars getting the

595
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:33,259
mayor of San Francisco elected likely

596
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:36,590
reelected many for the just two weeks

597
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,830
ago the like main opposing candidate in

598
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,559
2015 basically said I'm too scared of

599
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,109
Ron Conway to run against Edley he also

600
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:47,539
bought five or six seven possibly

601
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:48,409
depending on how you're counting

602
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:50,179
supervisors on the board of supervisors

603
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,679
including the president the Board of

604
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,960
Supervisors and he's so be like this is

605
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,999
and this is an order to enact laws that

606
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:57,379
are favorable for companies he's

607
00:23:57,379 --> 00:23:59,059
invested in and he in fact was so

608
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:00,559
blatant about buying the recent

609
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,350
short-term rental law in favor of Airbnb

610
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,379
that Airbnb competitors are suing him

611
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:09,919
for shutting them out um pretty

612
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,070
impressive this is Greg Suhr Greg Suhr

613
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,169
is the chief of police in San Francisco

614
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:17,690
he's often described as an old friend of

615
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,090
Ron Conway I've never found a picture of

616
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,960
them together but still lookin um in a

617
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,190
couple years ago there was a widely

618
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,770
publicized $100,000

619
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,590
donation to SFPD from SF City which is

620
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:34,090
Ron Conway's coalition of tech companies

621
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,960
donation is kind of an interesting way

622
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,640
to put it that money actually went to a

623
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,560
member of that coalition in order to

624
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,070
develop an app for SFPD and it was the

625
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,660
access that wrong call my has that was

626
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,370
made it made it possible for that

627
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,980
public-private partnership to happen it

628
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,570
was an app to access the city's crime

629
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,760
data warehouse in the field so he

630
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,070
basically engineered this way for a

631
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,760
company under his umbrella to be paid to

632
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,260
build something for the SFPD just at the

633
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,570
beginning of this year he announced a

634
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,250
series of gun safety challenges for

635
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,830
entrepreneurs this is in response to

636
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,300
Sandy Hook he came out saying you know

637
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,190
this is the next new thing this is where

638
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,340
I'm focusing my philanthropic efforts

639
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,390
philanthropic is an interesting way to

640
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,820
put it not that gun safety isn't an

641
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,640
incredibly worthy cause but he also has

642
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,710
said he's looking for the next Mark

643
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,570
Zuckerberg or Larry Page of gun safety

644
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:30,110
it's an entrepreneurship challenge which

645
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,630
he's offering to invest in tech in

646
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,380
technological solutions for gun violence

647
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,910
this is both for this a huge market

648
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,080
admittedly and this is both for the

649
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,400
private owner market which in this

650
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,200
country is very large but also for the

651
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,000
public in the last challenge in the set

652
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,440
of four focuses on the euphemistic

653
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,240
community safety which generally is

654
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,040
understood to mean policing a quote from

655
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,340
a partner of Conway's in this sort of

656
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,350
challenge that they've enacted there is

657
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,120
money to be made gun violence is

658
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,950
expensive to society and there's a big

659
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,630
potential market for solutions Ian

660
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:06,440
sobieski who's a partner in I don't even

661
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,260
want to say this out loud in a VC firm

662
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:14,150
called band of angels kidding me yeah

663
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,910
said that at those sort of launch for

664
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,830
this set of challenges that's really

665
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,630
interesting because sobieski is an

666
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:24,500
investor in SST Inc and if you've ever

667
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,240
done any reading into sort of military

668
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,210
or government contractors you know that

669
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,650
they're like Vegas names are the most

670
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:33,080
terrifying things assistant used to be

671
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,890
known as ShotSpotter oh yes if you are

672
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,530
an ugly resident that may be familiar

673
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,180
two hundred and sixty-five thousand

674
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,600
bucks

675
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,890
of Oakland money was spent on

676
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,710
implementing this shot spotter network

677
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,679
of gun supposedly audio gunshot

678
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:51,770
detectors um the police recently came

679
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,240
out and said yo this doesn't help us at

680
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,299
all well I don't like we we generally we

681
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:59,809
know when someone gets shot um to vote

682
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:01,970
ShotSpotter was on all the time not just

683
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,940
when it it wasn't activated by anything

684
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,950
it was just on all the time and recorded

685
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,380
voice conversation may have been a

686
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,620
feature not a bug um Oakland has also

687
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,169
been investing over the past few years

688
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:17,090
11 million dollars in the domain

689
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,010
awareness center which is designed to be

690
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,700
a surveillance hub for law enforcement

691
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,929
collecting things like ShotSpotter data

692
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:27,500
traffic cameras police reports stuff

693
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,950
like that social media posts into one

694
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,809
hub running it through things like face

695
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:35,390
detection software and data mining

696
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:40,490
software and you know alerting software

697
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,590
what I'm getting at is that that 11

698
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,539
million dollars was going to software

699
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:48,260
companies right again this is a market

700
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,669
and that 11 million it's been it's I

701
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:54,890
mean it's been scaled down somewhat and

702
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:55,760
there's been a lot of opposition

703
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,559
understandably because it came out in

704
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:59,900
public records requests that the overt

705
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,090
intention of it was to spy on activists

706
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:07,270
basically the money so far has gone to

707
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,280
military contractors but Google actually

708
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,010
put in a bid to use some of their

709
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,809
services in building this domain

710
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:17,929
awareness center google has products

711
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,730
surveillance products I they call it

712
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,080
something else there's some euphemism

713
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,059
for this like Intel or like communica

714
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:24,320
it's always community that's how you

715
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,750
know the techno police community intel

716
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,870
something like that um because they have

717
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,159
products that they do sell to other

718
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:33,919
municipalities they didn't you know they

719
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,960
didn't win this bid this time yet but

720
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,179
this is a market that exists it's

721
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:42,470
growing the legal sort of barriers in

722
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,169
place to prevent it I would argue are

723
00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:49,190
possibly more more more easily

724
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,690
surmountable than the ones that we've

725
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,460
seen have basically been steamrollered

726
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,049
by the charter school movement so

727
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:57,929
this is kind of scary and I think if I

728
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:01,460
was a betting woman I would start a

729
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,860
terrible firm with a terrible pun name

730
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,179
um no um I suspect that what we'll begin

731
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:12,029
to see is the very valid and

732
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:14,090
understandable calls for police reform

733
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:18,929
start to be engineered and funded by

734
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:20,940
some of the folks who funded the school

735
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,980
reform movement and buys when I say some

736
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,809
of the folks who fund the school reform

737
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:26,249
movement I mean the people that we make

738
00:29:26,249 --> 00:29:30,119
money for so I'm not saying this to

739
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:32,940
scold I work at a company funded by Ron

740
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,619
Conway I've worked at I think three

741
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:36,570
companies funded by Ron Conway I've

742
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,059
worked no company I worked out we've

743
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:41,369
covered in all the names that I've said

744
00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:44,789
probably ninety percent of my salary has

745
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:46,259
come out of some of the names I've said

746
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:50,070
here this is a fact of life we pay rent

747
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,679
we do what we do I an argument you could

748
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:54,119
make is that this is the same as other

749
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:55,649
industries certainly other industries

750
00:29:55,649 --> 00:29:57,179
lobbies certainly other industries have

751
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:00,330
political involvement my concern is that

752
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,869
while that may be true um we have very

753
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:05,639
little skepticism about some of these

754
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:07,590
initiatives particularly around ed tech

755
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,480
which I find troubling we're smart

756
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,489
people we can get our heads around this

757
00:30:11,489 --> 00:30:13,830
I believe in us and part of that is just

758
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,480
paying attention there I did a lot of

759
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,739
research for this presentation but I

760
00:30:16,739 --> 00:30:19,559
wasn't exactly like filing Freedom of

761
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,480
Information Act requests and combing

762
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,759
through obscure things I was reading

763
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:25,289
articles published by journalists the

764
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:26,609
stuffs out there and we should be

765
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:28,350
listening because this is our blood in

766
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:31,169
the game our skin in the game finally I

767
00:30:31,169 --> 00:30:33,419
was going to open this I considered

768
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:34,859
opening this talk with a moment of

769
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:37,139
silence inspired by um Darrell hopwood

770
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:38,789
did this recently at a conference I was

771
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:39,899
that in st. Louis I thought it was very

772
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:42,269
moving and I saw sounded like make a

773
00:30:42,269 --> 00:30:45,299
slide for it was just like a a moment of

774
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:49,440
silence for who like for you know like

775
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,080
Eric garner who recently the protests

776
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,840
have been focused around for Alex nieta

777
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,730
who was shot by the SFPD for Alan

778
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,340
Blueford for a local person and then the

779
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,950
CIA torture thing came out and when I

780
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,659
came right down to it I think we have

781
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:06,200
enough silence in the tech industry I

782
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,039
think we've

783
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,779
you did more than our fair share of

784
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:14,970
silence so there's a lot of chillin sort

785
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,919
of effects of some of this stuff I think

786
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,929
people feel like maybe their jobs are in

787
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:21,629
danger or something but I think that

788
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,909
some of that is just cowardice and I

789
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:25,950
think that getting our voice is as

790
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,190
people who a are making money that's

791
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,220
being used to implement things like this

792
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,989
and be you just have a lot of privilege

793
00:31:33,989 --> 00:31:37,619
by the fact that we're very well paid we

794
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:39,059
should be the one saying things and we

795
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:40,529
should be paying better attention so
