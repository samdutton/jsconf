00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,900

alright so after a couple really deep

2
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,420
presentations yesterday I thought I

3
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,280
think that maybe starting off with

4
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,879
something a little bit fun am I on now

5
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,290
okay sorry something a little bit more

6
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,940
fun and what's more fun than gaming

7
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,440
right so I'm going to talk about the web

8
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,680
game console and I have a bowling app to

9
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,590
show you so let's just get going so i

10
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,050
wanted to start out with survey because

11
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,750
I'm kind of into gaming but everyone's

12
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,759
not into the same thing but let's just

13
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:15,789
start off with this how many of you x

14
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:18,910
raise of hands are into gaming alright

15
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,160
that's a good number that's great how

16
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,960
about how many of you have one of these

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,240
this is a PlayStation 3 raise your hand

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,759
if you have a PlayStation 3 okay that's

19
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,640
a good number what yeah we'll get there

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,179
don't worry yeah this is I know this may

21
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:35,860
offend people to put this light up

22
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,490
because it's not your favorite one

23
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,770
playstation sony sold 62.6 two million

24
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,909
playstation 3's and then for those who

25
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:47,259
are more interested in this console

26
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:49,680
raise your hand if you have one of these

27
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,390
so it's about the same and the numbers

28
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,360
you'll find her about the same two 65.4

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,979
three million so it's close to the same

30
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:58,990
there how about one of these you don't

31
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,100
find as many people saying no we but

32
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,180
yeah there's there's what not that

33
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,270
they're not great right but they sold a

34
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,470
lot more 95.3 five million how many of

35
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,850
you have one of these gaming consoles

36
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,530
yeah that's right because they sold 150

37
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:29,799
7.8 million smartphones in 2011 in the

38
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:33,160
fourth quarter so

39
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,840
yeah quite a few more of these exist and

40
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,490
then when you you pair this up with

41
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,340
other internet-connected devices with a

42
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,390
total of five billion of those sold you

43
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,090
have a few a little bit better market

44
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,970
share numbers in that camp so anyway

45
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,410
that's what I wanted to talk about I

46
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,630
want to show you my simple game that I

47
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,430
wrote and then talk about how I wrote it

48
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,860
and go into some of the detail of

49
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,750
building web games and and basically

50
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:08,070
mobile web development in general so the

51
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,080
way that you launched my game you can't

52
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,780
find it in the app store because it's

53
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,060
just a web game and you just go to the

54
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,340
URL which I haven't published yet so you

55
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,160
won't be able to do this yeah we'll get

56
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,180
there but it launches from an icon on

57
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,290
your phone just like that so it launches

58
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,100
like any other game that's a blank slide

59
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,650
so the mobile interface looks like this

60
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,660
once you get the game running it just

61
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,510
gives you a bowling ball and you put

62
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,730
your thumb on the bowling ball and then

63
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,530
you swing it let me give you a

64
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,470
demonstration there's my I don't know if

65
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,910
you can see it but there's my bowling

66
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,910
ball app you put your thumb on it and

67
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,370
then you swing backwards and forward

68
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,010
just like you would a wii controller

69
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,620
because it uses the gyroscope and the

70
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,950
accelerometer to take the calculations

71
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,720
of the swing through and then bullet

72
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,720
down the alley so it the ball slides

73
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,970
forward and it looks like that and yeah

74
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,310
on a web slide deck it doesn't look that

75
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,500
cool but the display on another display

76
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,040
you have your bowling alley and so then

77
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,250
when you do this action the ball goes up

78
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,229
and hits the pins and it's a pretty

79
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:30,180
simple game and let's see if I can hit

80
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,180
those other pins by spinning it sideways

81
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,670
yes thank you

82
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,050
so I've had a lot of practice at this

83
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,919
game I'm the only tester I always wanted

84
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,740
to be a game tester right so I'll just

85
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:54,319
do it again just because I like 20 same

86
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,099
spot yes that's annoying let's start

87
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:04,400
over I think I can get a strike oh my

88
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:14,629
gosh well close enough all right let's

89
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:17,300
move on you guys can play it later I

90
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,310
think if we wait long enough that one

91
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,030
might slide off the end it's moving just

92
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,659
wait a second okay so so let's just talk

93
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,650
about how it works so on the client on

94
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,990
the mobile device it's just html5 I

95
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,129
don't have a native rapper or anything

96
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:41,479
and so it's just CSS transforms for the

97
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:44,389
smoothness and then the touch ap is that

98
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:46,550
you can use with your phone I already

99
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,979
talked about how it requires use of the

100
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:51,650
accelerometer and the gyroscope in order

101
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,060
to get the twisting and turning that you

102
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,229
need to be able to send the right

103
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:58,069
information to to the server on the

104
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:01,759
server I'm using node and web socket too

105
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,610
so that my phone can just talk quickly

106
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,639
to the server the total amount of code

107
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:11,449
is I think it's 30 lines of code for the

108
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:14,840
whole server side piece to run i'm using

109
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,889
socket i/o and really 15 of my lines of

110
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:21,680
code or pretty boilerplate so so that's

111
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,879
not a really tough part then on the

112
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:28,909
client the the bowling alley I'm using

113
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:32,000
canvas for the bowling alley and i'm

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
using box2d web which is a 2d physics

115
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,870
engine and it it has a game loop in it

116
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,150
and some really good examples of what

117
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,349
other people have done with it on the

118
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:47,419
web it's pretty easy to get going in

119
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:49,240
fact I

120
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,039
I wanted other people to be able to play

121
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,220
with it and use it and so Gabe daily and

122
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,160
myself who put this together put a

123
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,560
tutorial up on github so that you could

124
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,330
basically build it yourself and step

125
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,389
through and I think that that I have the

126
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:06,160
URL for that later on in the slide so

127
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,569
you could run it locally and hook it up

128
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:12,130
to your phone but as we as we use the so

129
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,930
this is the bowling alley again and when

130
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,669
it comes forward now it doesn't have

131
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,789
pins now it has a bunch of trash so

132
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:25,030
box2d has this cool debug draw that lets

133
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,789
you just throw random shapes out there

134
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:30,909
and then you can just bowl into random

135
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,860
shapes which is sometimes more fun than

136
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,889
bowling into the pins but you all if you

137
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:40,539
don't want to provide your own renderer

138
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:43,870
then box2d will let you just do the

139
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,509
debug draw and it'll draw out your stuff

140
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,099
for you and then when you figure out the

141
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:50,590
renderer then you can do that so I just

142
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,080
wanted to show you bowling against

143
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,289
random geometric shapes the tutorials

144
00:07:56,289 --> 00:08:00,009
here if you're interested I'll also put

145
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:01,630
this again at the end of the slides if

146
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,020
you just search on github you can find

147
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,449
my repo and it's called web bowling and

148
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:08,590
if you go to the wiki there's a

149
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,690
step-by-step tutorial on how to build it

150
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,340
or you can just download the code and do

151
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,620
it yourself you don't really need any

152
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,590
you need node on your server but and

153
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,659
then you need a mobile device and I'll

154
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:22,150
talk about that later on some of the

155
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,969
other stuff that you need a mobile web

156
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:27,909
development though isn't all that

157
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:30,460
straightforward there's a there's a few

158
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,060
things that are missing right now that

159
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,860
need to happen in order for this to

160
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,690
really kind of take off and so I want to

161
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:42,070
talk about that for a second so the good

162
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,539
part about mobile web development is

163
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:47,560
there's no IE 6 all of the yeah thank

164
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,490
you but there is windows seven phone or

165
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,200
Windows Phone 7 or whatever it's called

166
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,990
which had this like abysmal it might as

167
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,529
well have been ie6 that I guess the the

168
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:01,300
good part about it was that no one

169
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,010
bought it

170
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,390
yeah sorry no I think that Microsoft is

171
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,950
doing some great things with ie 10

172
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,480
that's money and I'm excited for it but

173
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,990
yeah windows seven phone was bad the

174
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,090
good part about it is device lifespan is

175
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,400
really short and so as new phones come

176
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,300
out with new features like two years ago

177
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,610
no phones had gyroscopes right and then

178
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,100
the iphone 4 came out and it had a

179
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,540
gyroscope and now all the phones are

180
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,340
coming out with gyroscopes makes it easy

181
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,970
to do cool stuff like this and then you

182
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,800
know right after they come out the api's

183
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,050
come out to support them and really

184
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,760
quickly you have a whole bunch of new

185
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,170
features on a whole bunch of new devices

186
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,900
so that's the good part about mobile web

187
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,440
development the the not so good part is

188
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,970
that the tools kind of suck that you

189
00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:02,260
have what's that one the winery wineries

190
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,090
is kind of good but it doesn't let you

191
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,360
step in and debug if you were at Paul

192
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,580
Irish's talk yesterday he did a great

193
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,870
job talking about what they're working

194
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,260
on in for remote debugging in chrome and

195
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,550
that'll be great I wish it was there

196
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:23,700
today super excited about it so and then

197
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,500
offline so i put the little asterisks

198
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,740
down there for chrome beta because once

199
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,450
chrome beta is available then at least

200
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,220
one device will have some really good

201
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,080
debugging tools so offline is also

202
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,030
difficult offline is a weird thing

203
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,530
because it's been available on mobile

204
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,290
devices since i think the first version

205
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,940
of the iphone they if you went and to

206
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,010
WWDC then you probably signed a

207
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,330
nondisclosure and you're not allowed to

208
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,100
talk about it so I can't say what i

209
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,410
really thought but it it doesn't work at

210
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,180
first they made it so that you could go

211
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,010
offline and you could set up your cache

212
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:06,460
manifest and then you'd be able to turn

213
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,640
the put the phone in airplane mode and

214
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,890
then run your app that way but what they

215
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,680
really did was as soon as you went back

216
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,939
to your application

217
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:18,479
and it would try to refresh the page and

218
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:21,249
it wouldn't go to your app cache it

219
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:23,259
would just pop up a little modal dialog

220
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:25,179
that said hey you're offline try

221
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:28,299
connecting online again which it what's

222
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:29,470
the point of that it doesn't make any

223
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,579
sense right so so anyway I wanted to

224
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:38,009
call out a few people specifically apple

225
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:41,829
for sandbagging and I know that this is

226
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:43,329
going to offend a few people but that's

227
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:46,809
okay throw something at me preferably

228
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:52,149
money but yeah so they so aside from

229
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:55,779
their original offline web stuff that

230
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:57,669
they did that was kind of dumb then they

231
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:02,649
added a WebGL in iOS 5 so WebGL is

232
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:04,089
available right now and you could do

233
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:08,459
your 3d stuff on the mobile devices

234
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,619
except it's only available for I ads and

235
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:13,779
you can't use it in the rest of the

236
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:17,799
browser so that's just dumb it's just

237
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:20,019
them trying to protect their their

238
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:22,599
application their native application

239
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:23,949
store right where they make up all their

240
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:27,159
money and then they still have when you

241
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:29,649
when you have an offline app and you try

242
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:33,339
to bring it back you go to it it still

243
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:36,369
tries to refresh and and it'll go to the

244
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:38,739
app cache now they fix that but it's

245
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:40,419
still kind of annoying that it has to

246
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:44,169
refresh every time and then the this

247
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:45,849
one's a funny one because everyone

248
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:50,079
trashes ie6 and windows for attaching

249
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,569
the browser to the operating system

250
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:54,759
right so that with you don't get the new

251
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,289
browser until the new version of the

252
00:12:56,289 --> 00:12:58,569
operating system and everyone gets after

253
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,329
Microsoft for that and Apple does it and

254
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:03,970
Google does it but no one mentions that

255
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,459
it's really dumb anyway so i had to call

256
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:09,909
them out because that sucks and it's

257
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:12,729
stupid but you can't just call out apple

258
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:15,429
you have to call out google too because

259
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:18,639
browser browser if you have an android

260
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,970
device and you have that browser icon in

261
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,859
some cases it's actually called internet

262
00:13:23,859 --> 00:13:25,389
and i think it's because they don't want

263
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,549
to attach themselves to it like oh this

264
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:29,740
is just a browser this is

265
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,040
chrome or anything that we care about

266
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:38,140
it's just yeah its weak and it is really

267
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,150
weak I mean if you use the browser kind

268
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:44,290
of sucks and app cache the offline

269
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,750
doesn't work at all if you go into

270
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,480
airplane mode and then you come back

271
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,820
then half the time it'll never come up

272
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,230
with your app even though it's been

273
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,920
cached and so that needs to be fixed as

274
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,100
well and by the way the browser is bound

275
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,500
to the OS now they recently released

276
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,650
chrome beta so if you have an Android

277
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,780
device that's running ice cream sandwich

278
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,450
then you can load Chrome Beta on there

279
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,860
and it already does far better than

280
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:19,030
browser but but it's still in beta and

281
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,220
we're hoping for great things from them

282
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,460
but but we have yet to see a full

283
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,680
release and so we're excited but

284
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,130
cautiously so I did want to show you

285
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:35,530
this this is H screenshot from html5

286
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,650
test and I apologize that it's hard to

287
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,720
read and it's small but what you'll

288
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:47,320
notice is that Android 4 is in sixth

289
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,200
place there and that's unfortunate it

290
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,480
another thing that i wanted to show is

291
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,900
that windows seven phone or Windows

292
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:01,620
Phone 7.5 has a score of 141 yeah ouch

293
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,850
the other thing I wanted to show you is

294
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,340
that the number one and number two spots

295
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,460
are held for are held by people who

296
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,380
don't make their own devices and don't

297
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,950
have a native app store that's opera

298
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,040
mobile and firefox mobile so it just

299
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,020
wanted to point that out I will also

300
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,490
show you that Chrome although Android

301
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,780
Browser got a 256 chrome beta gets a 3

302
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,660
43 on this so good job to them I hope

303
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:39,090
they continue yeah alright so you know

304
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,980
enough people have called out IE what is

305
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,360
there more to say about that

306
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,560
good job guys get in the game so this

307
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,450
one's not a call out this is a call out

308
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,880
to Mozilla I'm not going to call them

309
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,160
out I'm super excited to see boot to

310
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,950
gecko I even got a device ready and I

311
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,540
loaded boot to gecko on there so I could

312
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,670
come in and show you guys boot to gecko

313
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:04,930
and how excited I am about that but now

314
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,959
I don't really need to write thanks to

315
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:17,050
Mozilla yes so I appreciate Mozilla for

316
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,170
for trying to keep for keeping them

317
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,510
honest because Mozilla is not going to

318
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,339
have a native app store right they'll

319
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:25,959
have a web app store and so they'll make

320
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:29,110
sure that the web doesn't fall fall in

321
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,610
second place to the native app stores

322
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,620
where the guys can make more money the

323
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,709
other players and so I appreciate that

324
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:37,690
there's no conflict of interest here and

325
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,810
I wanted to make sure that that Mozilla

326
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,850
got enough support I mean not that I

327
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,040
hope that they get enough support to

328
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,800
push the other players to be honest so

329
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,029
that's a that's all I had here's my

330
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:59,470
sources and I put the the tutorial and

331
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,820
the web bowling game down at the bottom

332
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,010
