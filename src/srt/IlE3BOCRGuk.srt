I'm Nikolai bachinsky I'm from Bulgaria

2
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,910
and I work as a meta engineer at

3
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,720
automatic we make wordpress com our

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,480
company has been investing more and more

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,510
in JavaScript a lot of our new projects

6
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,820
are our single page applications using

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,350
our REST API also last year we acquired

8
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,699
cloud up and share more the one of the

9
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:42,250
organizers of the conference actually

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,879
works with us I've been working with a

11
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,010
lot of single page applications lately

12
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,780
and honestly I have no idea if this

13
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,269
would if this is going to be the future

14
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:58,690
in the in the mid to long-term but

15
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,199
actually it's a pretty good way to

16
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,470
develop responsive and just engaging

17
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,770
applications now i'm really glad i was

18
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,400
able to come here because i have a

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,890
feeling that people in in Argentina are

20
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,439
are very similar to people in Bulgaria

21
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,020
in many many ways so I've been wanting

22
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,289
to visit for some time and I still

23
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:26,350
haven't seen much from the from the OCD

24
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,740
but ty will walk around on on Sunday and

25
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,159
Monday I've just blocked two days and

26
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,990
I'm really impressed with the conference

27
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,689
both both the speakers and in general

28
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:39,969
the organization has been great and

29
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:43,509
everybody has been incredibly nice which

30
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,850
I guess is something really common in

31
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,100
the JavaScript community these days I

32
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,259
think that technologies is another thing

33
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:56,950
which is another area where about Gary a

34
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,219
similar to Argentina we have a lot of IT

35
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:04,060
specialist there and

36
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,170
and it is growing really rapidly I can

37
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,759
see a lot of companies opening offices

38
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:14,970
and and especially with with a lot more

39
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,700
companies working remotely I see a lot

40
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,980
more friend friends of mine just staying

41
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,340
in Bulgaria instead of going to Western

42
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,250
Europe board or the US and this way it

43
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,510
is both good for for their growth and it

44
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,250
is really great for the country because

45
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,950
many many people from abroad get to

46
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,120
visit and in and all of those developers

47
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,160
get to spend their money in Bulgaria
