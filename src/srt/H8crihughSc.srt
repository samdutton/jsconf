1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,890

hi guys how are you can you hear me well

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,870
awesome okay so my name is Shannon

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,050
Foster I'm from Baltimore Maryland I'm a

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,280
techie and I got invited to do Cascadia

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,929
only a few weeks ago so I'm really

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:17,640
excited to kind of be like the

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,470
last-minute speaker but also kind of

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,900
show you guys some of the things that I

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,910
hope that you can learn from this talk

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,490
as far as web PR goes from a show of

11
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,650
hands has anyone doesn't work with web

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,669
PR before I see like five people

13
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:35,250
okay that's still cool has anyone used

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,670
VR in general before headset oculus rift

15
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,540
daydream cardboard okay alright so it's

16
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,520
a good group of people and a good

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,370
dynamic I would say so with this talk as

18
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,170
I mentioned before kind of want to give

19
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,570
you guys a deep dive kind of a little

20
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,000
bit of an overview of what is happening

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,590
and what can be done what whether you

22
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,239
are a little bit beyond the scope of

23
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,829
gaming but more so per se you know

24
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,369
shopping or maybe even banking in VR or

25
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,430
AR and so upon creation of this talk I

26
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,890
realized that there was an error in my

27
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,130
talk title so instead of it being down

28
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,320
the rabbit hole with VR it should say

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,619
something else but I'll dive into that a

30
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,390
little bit later as we go through this

31
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:29,880
talk here yeah sorry give me one moment

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,060
here okay yeah so web VR sparked my

33
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,960
interest at go IO 2017 it was this new

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,140
thing that browsers are trying to adopt

35
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,890
and get started with not too many people

36
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,240
still know the difference between

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,810
regular VR and web VR and who can blame

38
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,909
them it's you know kind of the not

39
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:52,320
really the same title but when you hear

40
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,549
web PR you're just kind of like okay

41
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,250
what big differences can this be exactly

42
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,930
you know what exactly can I do with this

43
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,479
that I can't do already primarily with

44
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,119
the hardware device and so I'm hoping I

45
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,710
can show you that difference here so

46
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,530
let's take a look at a few examples

47
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:14,670
see if I can get this to play okay cool

48
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,510
so see it's playing oh there we go so

49
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,510
this is if you guys have heard of the

50
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,550
awards this is one of the nominees for

51
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,820
the best web be our example sites

52
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,760
I'm created by this guy called a cubic

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,300
photo cubed a German developer and a

54
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,760
group of designers this really stood out

55
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,770
to me one because it's not just a game

56
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,610
but the interactivity along with this

57
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,740
just looks really cool and if you look

58
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,690
here yeah and when you look away when

59
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,730
the user looks away or pulls away from

60
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,790
the view and the scene it has some sort

61
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,220
of timer or math going on here where it

62
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,230
knows like okay users looking away head

63
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,010
his turn turn back game interacts or

64
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,600
this component interacts so that's just

65
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,070
something that stood out and this was

66
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,390
tagged with three Jas WebGL Babylon and

67
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,280
a few other things and I just thought

68
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,540
I'd show you guys so another example

69
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,290
this is also another awards one that we

70
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,630
have going on here and this one was more

71
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,959
so if you've ever been to they have

72
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,610
these new things called AR art art

73
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,290
exhibits we have this thing

74
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,140
ar Tech or something in DC where it's a

75
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,300
nightclub and you can you know have a

76
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,100
little martinis and use your phone to

77
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,810
see like the AR pop up on the martini

78
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,209
and so this is a photo gallery and it's

79
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:40,980
in virtual reality and this is me

80
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,180
scrolling through it through the browser

81
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,030
of course and this person created it as

82
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,650
a portfolio and I just thought it was a

83
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,330
good way to kind of show you guys like

84
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,610
how we're stepping through into the

85
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,519
mercy of Technology on the browser and

86
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:58,820
you know just what we can do with it and

87
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,430
the cool thing about this is the user as

88
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,080
you can see I'm obviously not using a

89
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,360
headset I'm using my laptop to access

90
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,820
this the cool thing about web PR is all

91
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,760
you need is a URL to get access to this

92
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,150
game or portfolio or design or anything

93
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,650
like that you don't need

94
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,609
fairly a overpriced or over expensive

95
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:23,010
oculus rift or HTC vive just to

96
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,100
experience this anyone can do it which

97
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,800
is why I love the inclusivity of web

98
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,220
they are another one just a showroom

99
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,590
example if you've ever used like an IKEA

100
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,040
app or oh gosh there's another one

101
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,690
that's also a furniture store app where

102
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,169
you can place place things in the room

103
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:45,419
and furniture or even Amazon now when

104
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,460
you shop on there you can use it with

105
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,320
reality to kind of see what things look

106
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,030
like in your actual space and so for

107
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,530
instance this is just another example

108
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,630
that just shows like this is a showroom

109
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,240
that you can see online of course just

110
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,280
type in the URL and just kind of tour

111
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,530
the area and something that really stood

112
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,870
out to me is you can click on each of

113
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,970
these 3d objects that are placed here

114
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,979
and the user can decide which types of

115
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:12,030
textures that they want to add to the

116
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,350
object which I thought was pretty neat

117
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,199
using these different spheres so if you

118
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,820
want to test it out there is a link

119
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,200
right there on the bottom and just one

120
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,320
more this one I grabbed off of Google

121
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,070
experiences they demoed this last year

122
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,979
at Google i/o 2017 and again it's just

123
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:33,360
like the whole introduction to just

124
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,630
using web BR and this one this one's

125
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,300
actually really funny because it just

126
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,099
kind of dives into why there was an

127
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:42,870
error in the way that I named my talk

128
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,210
and why there's any need for me to

129
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:58,170
rename it so

130
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,550
get excited ready to start and play this

131
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,180
game and then suddenly it tells me like

132
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,240
hey by the way like we're no longer

133
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,330
using what BR we're moving over to web X

134
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,900
R and so that's where the area's error

135
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,449
is in my talk I miss name this talk

136
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:18,850
completely so I decided I'm gonna change

137
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,880
it to down the rabbit hole with Webre R

138
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,699
or V R on the web sorry

139
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:33,100
and so turns out the web BR version 1.1

140
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,460
is deprecated there's only a few

141
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,139
browsers that still use it and you can

142
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:40,750
probably guess which ones are the late

143
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,729
bloomers that probably still use it

144
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:47,080
maybe per se but you can if necessary

145
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,060
absolutely necessary you can go back

146
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,030
through the API list or documentation

147
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,610
and see you know okay I want to use the

148
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,289
specific version of this and try it out

149
00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:59,280
great it hasn't gone obviously very far

150
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,410
it's still something if you want worth

151
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,450
looking at but it's been replaced by the

152
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,820
webex our device API which I'll dive a

153
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,250
little bit into a little bit later and

154
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,360
as I mentioned before currently

155
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,120
available on some browsers web PR of

156
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,340
course is an experiment and of and of

157
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,410
itself as we have so many different

158
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,120
groups trying to work and develop their

159
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,250
own standards of it and just see how far

160
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,419
can we go with this technology and so

161
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,800
there are multiple iterations that it's

162
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,280
going through we also have open XR which

163
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,099
is not really competing but they're also

164
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:37,690
trying to develop this new standard of

165
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,370
again web VR on the web and so they're

166
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,590
the open source community and major web

167
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,110
browsers are allowing all different

168
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,820
types of work for the web we are in a

169
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,330
full web standard as I said before oops

170
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:57,589
too far

171
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,150
and if this gives me back my mouse

172
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:09,009
that'd be great okay so anyways so when

173
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:11,590
you try to open up a web browser

174
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,259
web VR applications that are using this

175
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:17,440
API that has been deprecated the user

176
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,909
will usually get this error at the very

177
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:20,409
top of their screen so they can't really

178
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:23,650
do much I know disappointment so it's

179
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,509
currently this is what they'll get with

180
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:29,219
Chrome the developer model as well as a

181
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:31,719
coronary and as well as the Samsung

182
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,360
Internet and a few others I know with

183
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,029
Safari any Apple device mostly because

184
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:39,640
I'm positive they don't support most of

185
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,300
the web VR features they're mostly with

186
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,640
what is it AR core I think is the way

187
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,680
that they're going and so that's why you

188
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,910
probably won't see a lot of support or

189
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,279
and or don't get this error message and

190
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,800
as far as those that still support it

191
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,589
they'll also be able one to use the

192
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:59,200
application and they'll also get this at

193
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,970
the very top of it and the VR displays

194
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,310
not found it's just a function that we

195
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:07,029
can go ahead and input into our system

196
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:08,740
that displays a little icon that says

197
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,779
okay here you go you can use the VR

198
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:13,000
functionality for your device or the

199
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,560
supported device and of course we're

200
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,010
Internet Explorer when trying to use

201
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,610
what VR they're gonna get either a blank

202
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,980
white screen or a blank black screen so

203
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,170
I don't know why they're always so

204
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,110
behind but be cool if one day it can

205
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:38,500
catch up all right so that brings a new

206
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,120
talk title I guess down the rabbit hole

207
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,480
with WebEx are and let's just dive more

208
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,029
into exactly what is WebEx are so WebEx

209
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:51,250
are can be called by many different

210
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,579
names from extended reality to cross

211
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:57,699
reality but according to those who are

212
00:09:57,699 --> 00:09:59,860
the main contributors to the device API

213
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,220
for WebEx are they want X to mean

214
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,530
something else

215
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,370
ideally it's whatever whatever you guys

216
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,350
want it to be think of it as a variable

217
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,570
of sorts

218
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,700
whatever you create this can be the

219
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:20,580
definition of that so it's open source

220
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,600
API of course as I mentioned before it's

221
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,690
currently in an experiment as I

222
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,250
mentioned earlier we're testing out the

223
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,830
limitations on what we can do with what

224
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,750
we are how far can we actually go with

225
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,280
this technology and what can be done

226
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,900
what are the different use cases I

227
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,970
mentioned earlier that a few of us are

228
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,590
trying banking and augmented reality

229
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,680
where we have your card and you just

230
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,510
hover your phone over it your camera

231
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,580
just pops out with a graph interactive

232
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,260
graph of you know this is your spending

233
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,520
habits this is how much you spent this

234
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,220
money your limits this is what you went

235
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,750
over this is your goal things like that

236
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,250
just to teach people better spending

237
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,310
habits as well as shopping in augmented

238
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,050
reality we're also trying to disrupt the

239
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,770
fashion industry last year also at

240
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,020
Google i/o they introduced this new gap

241
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,380
augmented reality application where you

242
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:15,000
can see the textile and the 3d object of

243
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,010
the model or whoever wearing this

244
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,740
clothing pattern and you can interact

245
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,270
with it change the different sizes of it

246
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,850
and you can do it in browser as well to

247
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,650
make it much more accessible to all

248
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,570
users versus those who just have to have

249
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,850
a specific type of phone I can remember

250
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,350
the phone that they tried to pass with

251
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,960
the last year just to get that

252
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,540
application going it was a Verizon thing

253
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,760
I don't know but uh yeah and it also

254
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,810
simplifies creating on VR and x vr XR AR

255
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,750
applications on the web for any

256
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,880
supported hardware device so whether

257
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,880
it's a Google daydream cardboard vibe

258
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,300
rift this simplifies that by allowing

259
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,240
developers to have easier access versus

260
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,620
using or manually inputting OpenGL or

261
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,280
yeah OpenGL WebGL or whichever to get

262
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,810
this going so this just makes life

263
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,150
easier for all of us

264
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,000
of course it's not open X are so open X

265
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,850
are is you can I guess you can consider

266
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,980
it a competitor and a competitor in a

267
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,070
way except none of these companies are

268
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,900
well groups are they're open sourced and

269
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,010
they're not making it to it some money

270
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:30,600
so open XR is another API that's created

271
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,370
by the Khronos group which was

272
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,040
previously called the Kronos VR

273
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,890
initiative and that's basically a group

274
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,700
of engineers from Google Pluto I think

275
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,690
also oculus that are pretty much the

276
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,750
same people who also work on the WebEx

277
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,300
our platform and they're all just again

278
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,410
we're all just trying to work together

279
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,750
and develop these new standards for this

280
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,490
technology and to see how far we can go

281
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,210
so this is an example of one of the

282
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,310
first applications or mobile

283
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,760
applications that's using WebEx our if I

284
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,640
can get back to play and so yeah there

285
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,410
was one of the first organizations that

286
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,120
are actually getting this going and

287
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,130
they're actually using the WebEx R as a

288
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,680
platform to help developers I believe

289
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,890
like you to build augmented reality apps

290
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,890
and XR if it's big enough

291
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,980
I'd have to I'm scared I might break

292
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:35,190
something and so they're just tracing 3d

293
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,340
objects with an interactive menu and

294
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,330
it's all again using that WebEx our

295
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:56,190
device API

296
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,980
okay so one of the things with though

297
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,710
again the WebEx our API is you can

298
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,590
detect query whole display and what this

299
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,600
means is that it enables XR applications

300
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,190
on the web by lying pages to do the

301
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,840
following again detect query poll

302
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,740
display

303
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,320
detective capabilities are available

304
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,540
query the XR capabilities poll the XR

305
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,990
display and associated input device date

306
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:24,370
on display imagery and on the XR device

307
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,940
at the appropriate framerate and some of

308
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,760
the goals I guess these are primarily

309
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,590
the goals of what they're hoping to do

310
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,720
with this API and I know that some of

311
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,490
the non goals they've made that very

312
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,740
clear is defined how virtual reality is

313
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,360
to not define how virtual reality on

314
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,790
what reality works on the browser and to

315
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,330
expose every feature every feature or

316
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:49,540
every piece of VR and AR hardware to not

317
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,870
sorry and to not build the Metaverse I

318
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,640
would hope they're not exposing anything

319
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,150
on the hardware and so this is just

320
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,070
another example of another experiment

321
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,410
using a XR device API

322
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,840
um this is primarily for iOS but I

323
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,260
clearly have an Android so it works on

324
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,420
here so let's see if I can play this

325
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:19,000
example and so this is just again it's

326
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,980
just showing what you can do with this

327
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,500
API and I can show you guys a link in a

328
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,290
second on how to get access to this and

329
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,550
it's just an experiment of just like

330
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,380
trying it out and just see okay cool

331
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,700
we're just building doing this building

332
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:42,980
block game what else can we do with this

333
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:49,530
oh yeah this is the one this is sorry I

334
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,420
work at a cybersecurity firm so it's

335
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,840
this is the one that's like hey you can

336
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,880
access the site but anything if I go

337
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:05,330
back to the slide here

338
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:09,120
okay all right so again one of the

339
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,770
things I mentioned earlier is what's the

340
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,590
difference between what VR and VR one of

341
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,180
the main difference is virtual reality

342
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,260
is something that we can well use to be

343
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,800
able to just maintain or keep within

344
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,630
hardware devices so only those who had

345
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:29,339
access to VR or even sometimes AR it's

346
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:32,220
just if they had these very expensive

347
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,740
hardware devices so one of the benefits

348
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,080
and beauties of web VR is that we can

349
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,240
make it accessible and inclusive for a

350
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,100
lot of different people to use it and

351
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,529
it's a good way to think about it

352
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:45,060
another way to think about it is that we

353
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,310
can scale our applications you know from

354
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,950
being these basic ecommerce site to

355
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,390
something where the user can actually

356
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:54,089
look at the item this 3d model spin it

357
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:56,010
around and even walk around it and just

358
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,900
see like okay is this something that

359
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,160
actually went in my home is this

360
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,240
something that actually wouldn't wear

361
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,390
you know the browser in my opinion it's

362
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,160
getting a little websites are getting a

363
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,280
little boring nowadays and I feel like

364
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,920
there are just so many different

365
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,120
interfaces that we can add more

366
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,829
interactivity that we can have that

367
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:17,100
keeps a user engaged and coming back to

368
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,140
our sites for more one of the companies

369
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,449
I used to work for Under Armour we

370
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:24,510
didn't enable 360 view of our sneakers I

371
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:30,030
think until 2016 I believe and even then

372
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,590
it's still not enough for the youth for

373
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,660
our customers they call us and they ask

374
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,570
us hey like what what what's the exact

375
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,460
color of this because sometimes the you

376
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,990
know colors are off or what's the exact

377
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,300
material this or you know what does this

378
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,890
feel and look like and in some cases

379
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,080
unfortunately for us we can't really

380
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,900
explain it though you know we work there

381
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,150
we still don't technically violate them

382
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,800
even if you work in underwear you don't

383
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,150
really buy the shoes to be honest with

384
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:58,830
you so it was just really hard to you

385
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,880
know it's just really hard to explain

386
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,350
you know what this material would look

387
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,540
like for the customer and so imagine

388
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,300
this if we have this VR application or

389
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,450
even an AR again they can look at it and

390
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,950
technically not feel it or smell it

391
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,590
that'd be kind of weird but still they

392
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,450
can just see like okay this is what this

393
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,820
product looked like looks like

394
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,409
okay yes this product can definitely be

395
00:18:18,409 --> 00:18:20,750
for me just the way to consider it and

396
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,860
there are companies that are doing that

397
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,860
I can link you a few later on and so

398
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,610
just to dive into again with Web VR we

399
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,070
have usually if you're on YouTube on

400
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,269
your mobile device you'll see this

401
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:34,309
little icon in the corner that says okay

402
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:36,080
do you want to watch this video in

403
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,549
virtual reality and then you'll get

404
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,740
these two little lens that will not lens

405
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,509
will screen that pop up that are split

406
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:42,889
but they're showing the same exact

407
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:45,019
content for when you put the ear headset

408
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:47,000
on and then of course what VR it's the

409
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,720
same thing except I mean you can use the

410
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,179
st. the same exact devices for viewing

411
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:55,850
web PR and so the idea of the future of

412
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,220
web VR is that we can browse the web or

413
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,009
browse the anything really using these

414
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:04,159
same exact devices but the best way in

415
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:07,279
my opinion to do this is to just either

416
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,679
have the option to yes you can use the

417
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,840
hardware device or no you can just use

418
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,519
your phone or the browser to get this

419
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:18,080
done and just to dive a little bit into

420
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,539
WebGL because I figured okay hey yeah

421
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:22,519
sure let's go ahead and touch base on

422
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:25,909
this just a little bit so WebGL is

423
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:27,649
basically what I described is just

424
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:29,750
simply oh dear god that's cutting up

425
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,190
it's just the canvas canvas we're just

426
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,220
building 2d and 3d graphics the great

427
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:41,000
thing about today's available libraries

428
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,750
of just frameworks is that you don't

429
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,129
necessarily have to do this you don't

430
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:49,100
have to manually go in and type all of

431
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,429
this obnoxiousness and in your HTML

432
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:54,049
because there's something that's already

433
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:57,019
there that does this for you I'm just

434
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:58,639
gonna I mean if you guys want to see it

435
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:07,470
I can show you this later but there's

436
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:15,790
oh wait to far okay okay yeah so I guess

437
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,950
that cut down to the last one weird but

438
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,200
anyways if you have questions feel free

439
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,720

Shannon Foster I'm a junior software

441
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,070
engineer and also a full-time student

442
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,240
web VR is something I've been doing for

443
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,300
the last year and a half or technically

444
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,540
after the launch of I would say Pokemon

445
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,850
go is when I got into augmented reality

446
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,010
I was like yeah I gotta try this out

447
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,690
but anyway it's feel free to reach out
