00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,940

everyone so this is me in a garden on

2
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,650
the weekend reading a book right so very

3
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,850
chill and here's the cognitive channel

4
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,480
between the book and my brain as you can

5
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,100
see there's a clear bandwidth and this

6
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,610
is where the bandwidth between the

7
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,650
cognitive load and the brain is at its

8
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:50,890
highest so here's someone on the train

9
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,590
that I took a photograph of without

10
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,310
permission so he's looking at his phone

11
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,190
and while looking at his phone he might

12
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:05,080
have been inspired to catch a new Star

13
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,960
Wars movie that's coming out soon right

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,970
so you might want to do it on a weekend

15
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,760
on a specific date that the movie is

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,659
launching so then he goes about setting

17
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,979
a reminder because you would want to do

18
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:20,320
it right then and he doesn't want to

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,420
remember the launch deal so this is how

20
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,409
the community channel looks like on your

21
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:33,250
left is the screen on the phone and on

22
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,650
your right is the brain right in the

23
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,470
train the cognitive resistances and

24
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,780
friction is higher and therefore the

25
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,590
bandwidth is lower right so there are

26
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,720
the noises and the distraction right so

27
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,030
while thinking about the next Star Wars

28
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,360
movie he might have recollected his

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,159
experience with the previous novels

30
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,040
movie and the cycle goes on right and

31
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,900
then you know there might be remembering

32
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,570
one of the characters in it and you know

33
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,570
on and on so sometimes this resistance

34
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,659
may cause partial absorption of the

35
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:14,230
cognitive load or even worse total loss

36
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:19,540
of intention so comparing this situation

37
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,560
and the situation of myself reading the

38
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,769
book right you'll find that this is

39
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:30,040
actually a stressful situation France is

40
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,430
introduced subconsciously into that act

41
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:38,109
itself so in our lives there are many of

42
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:40,719
these subconsciously stressful

43
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,019
situations that can be avoided

44
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,389
electronically setting reminder is just

45
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:50,639
one of the example so expenses claim

46
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,639
online bills etc alright so I said about

47
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,430
thinking could there be a better way of

48
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,949
interacting with computers where we get

49
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:03,219
to a point where we can be continuously

50
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:06,309
and lightened rather than continuously

51
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:08,139
torturing ourselves with this repetitive

52
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:12,099
cha computers can be the bicycle of our

53
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:15,909
mind pouring from steve jobs so I said

54
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:20,680
about delegating a lot of my chores into

55
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,459
a note process die named Joe dot so Joe

56
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:29,169
dot is a NPM package that you can

57
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:31,049
install and it helps you absorb

58
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:36,969
repetitive electronic duties so the

59
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:39,430
first thing that we need to know is when

60
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,309
dealing with Joe da is to have a list of

61
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:44,799
these duties so I thought it would be

62
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,919
nice to have it centralized so that we

63
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:50,349
know that we know the number of duties

64
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:52,269
that do not is handling it's much

65
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:54,519
clearer that way right so I said about

66
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,839
doing this and I chose JSON as the as

67
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:03,699
the definition structure for this and I

68
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:06,339
use I use this package called histories

69
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:09,339
on which is which allows me to get

70
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:13,089
comments into in within the text

71
00:04:13,089 --> 00:04:15,609
definition itself so the comments are

72
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:17,170
very helpful as you can see otherwise it

73
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:17,739
seems

74
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:22,090
it machine is right so once you have

75
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,110
that least I said about constructing the

76
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,199
duties itself so the first duty that

77
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,830
Jojo has to do for me as something that

78
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,349
i delegated to is to tell me that it's a

79
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:38,169
life because I wouldn't want process

80
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:40,870
that you know i delegate duties to to to

81
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,940
die off and i don't know you and my

82
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,710
bills doesn't get paid or my you know my

83
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,880
my electronic choice doesn't get done

84
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,759
right so the first base case is to tell

85
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,539
it to tell me that I'm a life that he's

86
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:59,229
a life dude I mean it is a life so okay

87
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:04,900
so any duties can be packaged as and

88
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,199
shared publicly on NPM or it could be

89
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,889
ran locally as with a local install flag

90
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:18,460
set to true so what does is it gets the

91
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,770
least that we saw previously it runs

92
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,979
through it and for each item in the

93
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:26,650
array it actually installs the package

94
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,820
from NPM via the NPM I package that's

95
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:37,150
also from the song also for mpm so once

96
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,750
its installed the duty it actually Fox a

97
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:46,599
duty process as a child process and it

98
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:51,460
starts sending duty calls to the trial

99
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,919
process duty so this duty call can be

100
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:59,469
scheduled with this definition here it's

101
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:03,940
a crown expression or a duty can be

102
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,909
called from another duty this is useful

103
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:13,210
I will see very soon so duties can have

104
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,270
parameters as well right so within this

105
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,909
Duty definition I've included five

106
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:21,789
parameters to a duty cocktail and mill

107
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:23,880
so this Duty is essentially about

108
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,400
killing that lock file so this closes

109
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,039
the loop of Judah telling me is alive

110
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:31,639
but it's actually logging it too

111
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,830
Oh a lot far right so but now I need it

112
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,020
to actually tell me and the interface

113
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,960
between me and Jo dot can be you know a

114
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,439
meal a meal from Joe dot so what we have

115
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:45,680
here is till this lock file look out for

116
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,499
this string and if you find it you know

117
00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:54,050
send it to me email so this is the

118
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,590
implementation of the duty so the idea

119
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,900
is that all of these duties can be

120
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,469
assembled with NPM packages and NPM as

121
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:05,360
we know it has so many features and

122
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,659
functionalities right so these features

123
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:10,580
and functionalities as time Sanjay was

124
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,639
saying later earlier are very capable

125
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,319
you know we could use nightmare we could

126
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:19,520
use all sorts of here I used till you

127
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,960
know to do all of these electronic

128
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,340
charts and you don't have to be it

129
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,949
doesn't have to be very complex you just

130
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:26,479
need to know how to string together a

131
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,240
couple of NPM packages facet some

132
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,680
parameters and that's it so these are

133
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,060
some of the ideas that I'm currently

134
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,509
working on bashful file adding prices

135
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:41,180
downloading remembering nuggets of

136
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,569
information commit doing something when

137
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:47,210
I commit easier way to do revolve and

138
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,520
check links on my webpage for you know

139
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,990
things that are links are no longer

140
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,089
valid so these are some of the duties

141
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:55,370
that if I do not delegate to Georgia I

142
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,060
have to do and it's again it's a

143
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,099
repetitive torture because it doesn't

144
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:03,740
seems like a creative thing that I want

145
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,740
to deal with on my computer so these are

146
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,669
simple duties so I thought there might

147
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:14,060
be an opportunity to add slightly more

148
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,669
complex duties that make Joe doubt more

149
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:22,370
useful so we could add a duty that gives

150
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,610
me a volt power interface like this that

151
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,949
deals with do this so it's like a mating

152
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:33,979
so I could use a head of bots that deals

153
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:39,130
with doodle as well so there are areas

154
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,990
there are automation tools like grant

155
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,500
and God that's similar in

156
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,780
in terms of automation right it does

157
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,390
automation as well right on there is

158
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,520
another room for something like judo too

159
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,740
because the domain is personal

160
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,220
automation also there is another tool

161
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,010
called p.m. to that does process

162
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,250
handling but it doesn't do the ecosystem

163
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:10,100
of duties that we can actually create so

164
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,590
there are few more areas that car is

165
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,920
currently i'm currently looking at

166
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,590
making duties easier to create share

167
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:25,430
fine install and configure so the

168
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,760
written up a some documentation here if

169
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,280
you want to check it out the current

170
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,410
state is available everything is wave on

171
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:38,240
github and that's it life can be better

172
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:51,070
with javascript thank you
