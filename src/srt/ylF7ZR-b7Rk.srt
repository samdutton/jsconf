00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,950
JENN: Hello.

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:15,309
Just kidding.

3
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:19,689
My friend at Apple taught me that.

4
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:21,910
How is everyone doing tonight?

5
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,800
[ Applause ]
It's like 2:00 in the morning.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,800
You did it.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,410
I so, backstage they have like a makeup station
and the sound guy is like, oh, do you need

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,410
makeup?

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,929
I think I have enough going on here?

10
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:39,649
Do I look good?

11
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:42,430
Of course I do.

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,430
Anyway.

13
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,170
Along with that and the layout and aggressiveness
of this slide, I think that should set the

14
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,620
tone for the rest of the talk.

15
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:57,289
So, despite what Lori said in his talk this
morning, I'm not talking about WebAssembly.

16
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:59,620
I think they misread the schedule.

17
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,969
That's actually Max's talk which is moved
to tomorrow.

18
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,710
So, please check it out.

19
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,230
I'm here today to talk about package managers.

20
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,850
I'm just kidding.

21
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,979
[ Laughter ]
Oh!

22
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,049


23
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:15,259
And before I go on, I know this counts towards
a ton of my talk.

24
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:16,880
Where is Keith Kurson?

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,119
Is Keith here?

26
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,619
Oh, here.

27
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:23,539
Happy birthday, Keith.

28
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:26,110
[ Applause ]
Cool.

29
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:34,009
Clapping, a round of applause for the organizers,
volunteers, speakers, sponsors.

30
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:35,189
Awesome.

31
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,850
Thank you so much for having me tonight.

32
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:46,490
Which was supposed to be a talk I called JavaScript
considered useful.

33
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:51,670
But then I saw that the conference schedule
had my talk this late.

34
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,539
And so, I switched things up a bit.

35
00:01:54,539 --> 00:02:00,689
So, thank you for sticking around this late
for the first episode and maybe last of my

36
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,179
new hit show "JavaScript After Dark."

37
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:08,340
Night time is a time to reflect on the past
day.

38
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,310
Like, did we feel productive?

39
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,160
Did we meet our goals of meeting new people?

40
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,140
Saying hi to old friends?

41
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,380
Not drinking too much coffee?

42
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,200
Who here drank too much coffee?

43
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,990
Did we learn some new stuff from the talks
today?

44
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,530
Like how capitalism is bad, right?

45
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,880
Wow.

46
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,640
It's also a time to reflect on those moments
we can't ever take back.

47
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,510
Whose flashbacks keep us up at night.

48
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:43,500
Important and impactful meaningful moments
like this time a woman asked me in lower Manhattan

49
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,930
three years ago at that red X there where
the Chase bank was.

50
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,840
And I said I didn't know.

51
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,140
But it turns out we were literally in front
of a Chase bank.

52
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,210
I think about it every night.

53
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:04,850
Tonight, we're going reflect on some just
as insomnia inducing past and present moments

54
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,270
of JS.

55
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,780
The language, the community and me.

56
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:19,210
Tonight, I am your tall shadowy figure hovering
over you above sleep paralysis.

57
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:24,820
Now, we're not going to reflect on the birth
of JavaScript 23 years ago.

58
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,740
There's a wealth of content online you can
read about.

59
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,850
How it came to be.

60
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,120
And it wasn't even the most exciting thing
to happen in 1995.

61
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:42,350
That, of course, goes to Space Hog's debut
album, if you're into British glam rock.

62
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:46,090
Oasis released what's the story morning glory.

63
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:53,340
But that's just as uninteresting to me tonight
as the JavaScript origin story.

64
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,900
I bet you didn't think that someone from outside
the world of package managers would be bringing

65
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,870
the hottest takes to the JavaScript conference.

66
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,850
But here we are.

67
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,480
The only year in the past that we are going
to talk about is probably the most impactful

68
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,910
to all of us tonight and that is ten years
ago.

69
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,430
That is 2009.

70
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,620
I know a lot of math.

71
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:20,790
So, what were JavaScript, the community and
I up to in 2009?

72
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,480
And how we all have collectively grown up
since.

73
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,590
So, let's explore.

74
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:33,520
In 2009, JavaScript had just about started
getting use to the actually being useful.

75
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,470
Both for normals and nerds.

76
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,180
The iPhone had only been out for about two
years.

77
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,150
So, the idea of JavaScript in everyone's pockets
was real.

78
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,720
But it was still in its infancy.

79
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,240
Not a lot of people knew.

80
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,600
And it had been about four years since AJAX
had come about.

81
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,230
And I think stronger than dirt is a pretty
good bar to reach for scripting languages.

82
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:04,220
In part with AJAX, web 2.0 was evolving from
user interactions like shit posting comments,

83
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:11,260
to collaboration and real time shit posting
comments with Google wave.

84
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:18,580
They reprogrammed the algorithm that most
use today like Glitch.

85
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,900
So, honestly, haters of Google Wave can eat
it.

86
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,120
GitHub and StackOverflow were about a year
old.

87
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,160
And the most popular JavaScript questions
from that year were a reflection of the language's

88
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,420
youth and complexity.

89
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,850
Which nearly matched that of the social construct
of time which to this day we still have issues

90
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:42,750
with 
in JavaScript.

91
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,150
Prototype, jQuery, all a few years old.

92
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,780
It's about the user interface, baby.

93
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,310
I'm sorry, I cringe whenever I hear that.

94
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:58,050
For the client side, there wasn't much besides
the cringy taglines and logos.

95
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,110
Entirely exciting or dramatic going on.

96
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,660
And to be fair, this is the year before backbone
was released.

97
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,310
So, there was no real framework wars in sight
yet.

98
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,370
It would be another year before Steve Jobs
would release his viral YouTube video/open

99
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,370
letter, thoughts on Flash.

100
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:22,000
By the way, Flash ends of life next year.

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,560
So, rich people and blogging males weren't
quite yet talking about HTML5 as if it were

102
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,640
like an actual brand new language literally
to solve every problem yet.

103
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:39,720
It was a simpler, softer, more down to Earth
time for the document object model and those

104
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,690
of us fucking around with it.

105
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:49,730
But that's not to say that 2009 was without
excitement or even conflict and drama.

106
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,419
Shouts out to the TC39 panel a little bit
earlier.

107
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:54,090
It looked a lot different back then.

108
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,480
Looked a lot different last year.

109
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,240
They were having a tough time coming to a
resolution to a debate that I will summarize

110
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,930
as I do most in the community, grownups fighting
on blogs instead of saying it to their faces.

111
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:16,400
Blogs, for the unfamiliar, it was how people
put long threads of Tweets into a single page,

112
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,060
by the way.

113
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,160
RIP.

114
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,680
And TC39 for those that missed the panel,
it was great panel.

115
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:31,620
It's a technical committee to which large
companies pay 70K or more dollars to join.

116
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,190
And what does or doesn't change with JavaScript
the language.

117
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:42,810
It appears that in 2009 the committee of the
pulling a weekend at Bernie's with the math

118
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:47,250
icon John Von Neumann.

119
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:54,300
Fun fact, Neumann invented merge sort, the
second best sorting algorithm next to Jortsort.

120
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,410
I don't know.

121
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,970
Maybe this is what TC39 was fighting about.

122
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:05,570
Honestly, it was one of the least interesting
things I was reading about in 2009.

123
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,560
But to be fair, there was a lot of competition
in being interesting.

124
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,710
Remember, Google Wave came out that year.

125
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:21,530
And by the way, it's hard not to see some
irony in the year collaboration was disrupted,

126
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:28,110
some dudes from large companies had a hard
time collaborating with each other.

127
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,840
Maybe that's the hardest problem in computer
science.

128
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:40,259
But if you stare directly into the sun, you
may find it interesting that the resolution

129
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:46,699
of this particular conflict was the committee
renaming ECMAScript 3.1 to ECMAScript fifth

130
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:47,699
edition.

131
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:53,160
The version, one point, nine points, is a
huge thing back thing.

132
00:08:53,160 --> 00:09:02,730
It was a few years later that TC39 had another
conflict and moved up the version 2009 points.

133
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:08,339
Obviously, an homage to the 2009 renaming.

134
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:14,559
Numerologists should be all over this shit.

135
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,480
Most of the news about JavaScript 2009 was
not about JavaScript, but about browsers who

136
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,259
were all allegedly the best.

137
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:24,720
Stallman was mad about open source.

138
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,139
And, yeah, some things haven't changed.

139
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:29,139
Companies tracking us.

140
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:30,449
So, you know, we knew.

141
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:31,920
We were warned.

142
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:39,220
But the most exciting news you would agree
in the JavaScript cannon for developers was

143
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:47,839
the founding of the modern JavaScript specification
and the release of NodeJS a few months later.

144
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,269
Whoo, yeah.

145
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:50,269
Whoo.

146
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:53,920
So, like 2009 was like a growth spurt year.

147
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,430
Our youthful and complex JavaScript was finally
going through puberty.

148
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:04,440
You know who wasn't going through puberty?

149
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,089
Me.

150
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:09,610
I was 24 years old in 2009.

151
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,170
And if you go off my Tweets from that year
alone, I was dealing with excruciating wisdom

152
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,439
tooth pain which I couldn't afford to fix
because I was broke as fuck.

153
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:24,370
So, I took recreational drugs to curb the
pain instead and expressed myself on the Internet

154
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,290
and doing so.

155
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:31,670
I was in Rob Thomas and deleting the Internet
before that became cool.

156
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,209
And I freaking loved Yahoo!

157
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:35,569
Pipes.

158
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:36,569
Shouts out.

159
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:41,589
What would probably surprise you, I was not
writing much JavaScript.

160
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:47,440
I was in graduate school working on my master’s
in computer science and my last year's courses

161
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,389
were virtually all mathematics.

162
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:56,070
And when not writing pages and pages of pure
math, quite beautifully, I must add, I was

163
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,869
programming in R.
Who here knows R?

164
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:06,560
So, for those of you who are unfamiliar with
R, it's similar to S. Very self explanatory.

165
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,459
[ Laughter ]
I had a lot of odd jobs back then.

166
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:16,040
But my most fulfilling was teaching non technical
college students how to use Excel at 7 a.m.

167
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:24,389
I love this review from them who said the
class topics themselves are really boring.

168
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:28,470
But it's not like she invented Microsoft Office
and forced it upon us.

169
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,079
I did not invent Microsoft Office, but I did
create the curriculum.

170
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,600
So, yeah.

171
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,130
7 a.m.

172
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,130
Fun times.

173
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,910
I have no idea what StackOverflow or GitHub
were.

174
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:45,089
And those sites are probably not even actively
considering me a part of their target core

175
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:46,879
demographic.

176
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,769
I was a young white woman studying computer
science, stats and linear algebra in a state

177
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:53,870
school in New Jersey.

178
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:59,310
In 2009 that was like the conventional path
to becoming a software engineer if you were

179
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:04,990
broke and living on your own and the only
person in your family to go to college.

180
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't think there were any web developer
bootcamps in 2009.

181
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:17,029
And most higher education engineering programs
were using Java and C++ and to this day to

182
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:20,890
teach programming at an applicable level.

183
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:25,949
JavaScript was copying and pasting from cool
sites and blogs I liked to look at and follow

184
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:27,879
using Google Reader.

185
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:28,879
Remember?

186
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,670
I do.

187
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,819
Googlers in here, I remember what you did.

188
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:37,629
Also, I want to shouts out to my old D and
D crew.

189
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:39,029
Brian Brennans here.

190
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:44,769
I forgot to take my D and D handbook and my
glittery dice out of the shop before I took

191
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:47,149
it.

192
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:49,970
And the elephant says PHP.

193
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,549
PHP is JavaScript with question marks.

194
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:59,489
[ Laughter ]
I did a lot of really shitty part time freelance

195
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:01,410
web design and development.

196
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,339
Yes, design.

197
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:08,850
With a wide range of low or no paying clients
and most of that development work was written

198
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:09,850
in PHP.

199
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,879
Which is way prettier than the designs I was
expected to come up with.

200
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:20,170
So, yeah, my then boyfriend's dad's friend's
real estate company who didn't pay me learned.

201
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:31,819
Joan Osborne, Grammy nominated singer, performer,
of what is God is one was us hated what I

202
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:32,819
designed.

203
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:37,660
And the movie baby geniuses was adapted from.

204
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,790
He was sick as fuck.

205
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,629
He hate what had I designed.

206
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:49,180
But as my friend said when his kid vomited
on him, tough, but fair.

207
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:54,360
I didn't Tweet about JavaScript until 2010.

208
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
Far from helpful.

209
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,600
I shan't be purchasing this services from
you.

210
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:07,240
To me, programming community let alone JavaScript
community didn't really exist.

211
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,850
Programming in general didn't exist outside
of the classroom and maybe in a couple of

212
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,100
channels.

213
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:20,269
And this one mailing list I participated in
about my favorite operating system, open Solaris.

214
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:23,060
Pour one out for that.

215
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:30,240
While TC39 was arguing about whatever they
were arguing about in 2009, Oracle was buying

216
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,690
Sun microsystems.

217
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,399
With that was the end of the Open Solaris
project.

218
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:42,999
I was heartbroken and still pissed at Oracle.

219
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:45,290
You know what else died in 2009?

220
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,589
GeoCities.

221
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:47,889
Yeah.

222
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:50,690
So, this may seem hella dramatic.

223
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:56,860
But I was basically watching everything important
to me about open source and building the web

224
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:02,269
being destroyed in a very tiny bubble that
was very far and very different from the bubble

225
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:07,839
that I am in today which is the JavaScript
community.

226
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,179
The JavaScript community, what many of us
call the communities, what we see here tonight.

227
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:18,489
Young, we think of JSConf, the family conferences
and EU.

228
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:25,009
And this conference started in 2009 in response
to or after the inaugural JSConf US earlier

229
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:26,989
this year.

230
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:28,709
You may recognize the organizers.

231
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:31,139
Little baby Jan.

232
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:36,279
I like that Jan grew his beard over the past
ten years so he can dye it pink just for us

233
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,329
tonight.

234
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:44,309
In the pink there, I can't believe you spoke
at your own conference.

235
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:48,429
That's like wearing a Green Day shirt to a
Green Day concert.

236
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:50,339
It's bad ass.

237
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:53,949
And notice I'm not making fun of AMP in this
talking.

238
00:15:53,949 --> 00:16:02,160
So, while to me there was no community, it
definitely did exist somewhere.

239
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,629
And allegedly it was rock and roll.

240
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:08,819
And remember, I love rock and roll.

241
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:12,459
So, why didn't anyone tell me about this?

242
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:17,149
I mean, if you look at this image and you
look at the earlier couple of years' images

243
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:23,899
and that like intro, you'll probably realize
that I wasn't part of the core target demographic

244
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:28,829
of not only many of the tools that came out
in 2009, but these events.

245
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:30,209
And that's not meant to be shade.

246
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:31,209
That's reality.

247
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:36,649
In 2009 it was very hard to see someone like
me in the audience of an event like this.

248
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:41,290
Let alone on stage visible and admired by
the tech community.

249
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:46,819
Also, these conferences were in they're expensive
as hell.

250
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:50,100
And I don't know about the rest of you all
who at least like went to college.

251
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,720
But the predatory textbook industry ate up
whatever so called disposable income I had.

252
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,059
Plus, I needed to buy weed because my wisdom
teeth were hurting.

253
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:03,980
Just kidding, I've never done a crime.

254
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,870
But today, 2009 plus ten equals 2019.

255
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,410
I can better support myself and others.

256
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,220
And not only am I actively part of the JavaScript
community.

257
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,640
I'm literally right here on stage at the tenth
JSConf.

258
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,070
Or at least the tenth year that they've had
it.

259
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:24,389
Soc, congrats to the organizers and everyone
for such a long run.

260
00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:25,389
Let's give everyone a another round of applause.

261
00:17:25,389 --> 00:17:36,020
[ Applause ]
What a wild ride this past ten years have

262
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,200
been.

263
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,610
For one, I don't have wisdom teeth anymore.

264
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,000
So, that's great news.

265
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,860
In less great news, I also don't have Google
reader, Google wave or Yahoo! pipes.

266
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,730
Ten years I was mad at Oracle.

267
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,049
Today the feeling is mutual.

268
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:57,580
This is a Tweet by an Oracle employee after
this conference announced my speaking.

269
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,720
Please don't find this person and I give him
shit.

270
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,410
He is correct, JSConf EU is better than this.

271
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:09,460
Using this to represent me.

272
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,490
This conference will be hearing from my lawyers.

273
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:18,039
And by the way, it needs to be said that me
making fun of Oracle owning the JavaScript

274
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:20,080
trademark is not punching down.

275
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,700
Because unlike Larry Ellison, I don't own
a fucking island with a volcano on it.

276
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,030
He's going to be just fine.

277
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,429
JavaScript the fame, though.

278
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:33,750
Maybe it's not time to worry about that.

279
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,660
Capitalism is bad.

280
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:45,870
So, yea, not only do I write a lot of JavaScript,
I'm an exec at one of the most exciting in

281
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,990
the JavaScript ecosystem.

282
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,990
Yeah, Glitch.com.

283
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:52,309
Yeah, shouts out.

284
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:56,951
I get to lead and work with some of the best
engineers, designers and business people in

285
00:18:56,951 --> 00:19:01,360
the world and we're all working together to
make it so that everyone who uses the web

286
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,110
can create the web.

287
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,019
It's been wild to start to see that happen.

288
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:11,539
And not only is it happening, but people are
building apps on Glitch that I couldn't imagine

289
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:18,190
would be possible within the confines of the
browser and this beloved portable dynamic

290
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,490
language we use.

291
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,450
Like, I'm not even saying hard to see like
ten years ago.

292
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:30,100
Like, I couldn't imagine this stuff, or double
stuff, five years ago.

293
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,070
Things like virtual reality and motion detection
in the browser.

294
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:42,100
We have a cool web VR starter kit and we have
been working with Mozilla on making cool demos.

295
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,350
And like, in the browser.

296
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,850
Like, who'd have thank you?

297
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:51,750
Machine learning and music, shoutout to really
cool stuff with JS.

298
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:59,769
And people asking about the questions about
the new metal group Evanescence, the answer

299
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:03,540
is going under is their best song.

300
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:10,120
And people on the note extending services
and even content management services like

301
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,240
WordPress with their Gutenberg editor.

302
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,230
So, it's sick.

303
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,279
Game Devs are not only making games on Glitch,
but they're building them in a way so those

304
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,370
that don't typically design and build games
can do so with their own levels.

305
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:26,190
And that is also super sick.

306
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:34,950
And speaking of games, that quiz game that
you have been playing is a Glitch app.

307
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:40,620
But also like under the hood, we have a powerful
as hell collaborative editor written in JavaScript

308
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:46,929
that runs in the browse their lets everyone
write JavaScript and other languages collaboratively.

309
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:49,870
And even view server-side JavaScript in the
browser.

310
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:58,639
So, like the scale of access to writing JavaScript
in 2019 among all the editors is matched only

311
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:02,130
by the access to learning it this year.

312
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,130
You know?

313
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:06,730
There are bootcamps now and there's online
learning and they're expanding the options

314
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,779
and opportunities for people to enter the
community and industry.

315
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:15,539
Even the books about JavaScript today show
not only is the community growing in number

316
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:20,090
of developers and technologies, but the backgrounds
of those using JavaScript is changing.

317
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:25,490
I want to give a shoutout to Daniel of Coding
Train, awesome series.

318
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,770
Nick Morgan, writing with JavaScript for kids
book.

319
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:34,799
And all the like awesome great initiatives
like Black Girls Code.

320
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:40,330
Giving like people getting people of all ages
and backgrounds into our community so that

321
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,450
we all collectively cannot only build the
web together.

322
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,860
But build like an ethical web that solves
the problems that we all actually have and

323
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,340
solves everyone's problems.

324
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,799
Not just a core group.

325
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,140
People aren't just asking, you know, anymore
how to use JavaScript to redirect a page or

326
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,220
figure out the name of the month.

327
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:05,120
They're asking JavaScript they're asking how
to JavaScript to tell a story with data around

328
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,779
gun violence and political activism
And we're learning and teaching literature

329
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:13,070
and art using the language.

330
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:19,590
So, shouts out to re Publica, color of change,
awesome organization.

331
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:25,419
My large son, Angus Cole for writing with
JavaScript.

332
00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:27,480
And the institute, my own project.

333
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:36,330
It's like the side project or indefinite hiatus
and fronted.

334
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,389
And not only does JavaScript the language
look different, the people writing and talking

335
00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:42,309
about JavaScript do too.

336
00:22:42,309 --> 00:22:45,650
Shouts out to all of my fellow speakers that
the event.

337
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,759
Round of applause for them.

338
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:53,240
And the MCs.

339
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:59,200
[ Applause ]
And don't you dare let anyone tell you that

340
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,710
the diversity and who is writing all this
code and the brilliance of what is being made

341
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,490
with it are a coincidence.

342
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,490
It's not.

343
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:14,540
And we have a lot more work to do to make
it actually diverse and inclusive and we can

344
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:19,149
only imagine how awesome and how brilliant
the things coming out of this language will

345
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:25,159
be when we are at the point and beyond that
we could say that.

346
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:27,380
Anyway, 2009 was a wild year.

347
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,400
But 2019 is fucking lit.

348
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:37,450
Which makes it incredibly hard to imagine
what could be in store for us in 2029?

349
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,450
But I flew all the way out here so let's give
it a go.

350
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:47,340
These are my hopes and dreams for 2029.

351
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,360
The first: You might have noticed my avatar
on the website.

352
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,909
I gave them one that had my face and the skeleton
zoomed in.

353
00:23:55,909 --> 00:24:00,120
I was told that the reason my conference head
shot is zoomed in on the skeleton is because

354
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,230
of AI.

355
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,909
Which means we're all going to die.

356
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:10,371
But honestly, in 2029, a significant amount
if not majority of code will be written by

357
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:11,371
machines.

358
00:24:11,371 --> 00:24:15,000
That shouldn't be surprising with all the
talk about artificial intelligence in this

359
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,320
industry.

360
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,799
This has been planned for decades.

361
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:23,379
If you read early text that's on artificial
intelligence, like the people who created

362
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:28,509
that idea did it so like machines would write
our code for us.

363
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,679
Like, work for ourselves.

364
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:32,590
Like, machines can do it.

365
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:38,230
And we've already boilerplated and automated
a lot via command line interfaces.

366
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,820
Which is rad.

367
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:46,190
But we're going to need some nice slick graphical
user interfaces to bring that development

368
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,220
to the masses.

369
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,760
Much like some of our favorite operating systems
did for computing in general.

370
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,100
So, that's a cycle we're entering into now.

371
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:59,399
And because we need GUIs, there's a lot of
abstraction and design challenges that come

372
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:00,399
with it.

373
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:04,210
So, that means that those specializations
we saw starting to disappear over the past

374
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:10,139
ten years like content and style, separate
concerns from interaction, I think that those

375
00:25:10,139 --> 00:25:13,169
things are going to become more discrete again.

376
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:20,509
And with that, like the role of frontend and
backend will become rarely used unironically

377
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:23,960
as much as the phrase close to the middle
is.

378
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,120
I think we're gonna see a lot more specialization
in our community.

379
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:34,820
And front and back will be replaced with UI,
ML, AI, IoT. hope they come up with another

380
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,820
phrase than IoT.

381
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,350
I don't like that.

382
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,269
Too many letters.

383
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:41,269
VR.

384
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:47,150
I would say hobbyists or maker, but I think
that's also kind of like the maker movement

385
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:52,570
is still quite misogynist because women have
been doing crafts and yarn and that shit for

386
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,620
years.

387
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,179
Hopefully there's a better word that doesn't
bring the patriarchal theme in.

388
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:08,679
Way specialized and there are going to be
generalists to mentor, coach and educate new

389
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:11,020
and seasoned specialists.

390
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:15,769
So, I think like the thing that we need to
worry about, and I'm seeing it already in

391
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:22,910
our community, is the gap in value and pay
of educators in the industry.

392
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,330
Yeah.

393
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:28,850
[ Applause ] shouts out to my teachers.

394
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:32,680
And not like the engineers who teach on the
side because it's extra money and they don't

395
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,559
really care about the people that they're
teaching.

396
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:36,950
No.

397
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,350
Anyway.

398
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,350
I can't go on these tangents.

399
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,340
I'm going to get people mad.

400
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,360
That gap, by the way, I think should be can
be filled with all the money Microsoft is

401
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,720
spending on trying to figure out who horse
JS is.

402
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,559
Just saying.

403
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:58,509
Ryan Dahl will be doing a mistakes I made
making Dino tour.

404
00:26:58,509 --> 00:27:02,860
Ryan, if you watch this video, you're a treasure.

405
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,259
Please don't hate me.

406
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:05,809
But I'm right.

407
00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:10,169
Microsoft is going to shut down GitHub and
VS code in their master plan to get us back

408
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:16,270
to using Microsoft Word to build HTML pages
like nature intended.

409
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:22,250
And because Word doesn't allow JavaScript,
all y'all who are like JavaScript is considered

410
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,919
harmful folks will finally be happy.

411
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,389
But then you'll realize your brand has become
obsolete.

412
00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:31,230
So, sorry about that.

413
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:37,279
Make E CMA will update their website design.

414
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,360
Also, you see all the trademarks down there?

415
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,590
That's an update.

416
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:46,390
If any of y'all are here still.

417
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:49,830
I want to propose some hot new trendy dark
modes.

418
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:57,270
Or an old classic, hot dog stand.

419
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:03,049
Even better, maybe in 2029 we'll have designed
and implemented a more diverse and inclusive

420
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:08,749
way to evolve the language than leaving it
up to only large English speaking corporations

421
00:28:08,749 --> 00:28:13,289
who can afford not only a seat at the table,
but the flight and hotel to wherever that

422
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:18,360
table keeps moving around to.

423
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:25,840
Now, given the number of people in this room
and my background in statistics and getting

424
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,890
yelled at on the Internet.

425
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:33,440
I will say it's highly probable that some
of you are thinking, Jenn, why are you complaining

426
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,659
about diversity when you said this event is
more diverse than it was ten years ago?

427
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:45,100
And yes, Uncle Bob, from my extreme white
woman perspective, we're doing a bit better

428
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,860
this decade when it comes to D&I.

429
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:53,940
But I predict and hope that by continuing
and evolving this work, in ten years the need

430
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,200
for diversity scholarships will have dwindled
or have been made obsolete by the fact that

431
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,059
companies will value all of their employees
enough to sponsor their being a part of these

432
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:04,059
events.

433
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:08,940
Or at the very least, people will not complain
on Twitter about people of color having their

434
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,999
own space at these events.

435
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:19,019
[ Applause ]
Just a reminder.

436
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:25,860
We are living in a misogynist and white supremacist
society.

437
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,950
And that plays into a lot of the stuff happening
over the next ten years in AI.

438
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:33,029
I don't want to slip that under the rug.

439
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:37,080
These are hopes and dreams and I'm hoping
that more people are involved, and more diverse

440
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,220
people are involved so we can undo the damage
and prevent that.

441
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,020
That's an aside off script.

442
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,700
I can talk for hours about that.

443
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:55,230
But I think another thing is that all of us
community organizers will have hopefully evolved

444
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,299
the conference experience so that yeah!

445
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:58,600
Fuck yeah!

446
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,179
Are they playing Foosball?

447
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:05,039
Are they getting excited about Foosball?

448
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,240
Shaking my head.

449
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,120
Anyway, yeah!

450
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,970
I think that we will make it so that all people
can still know the community exists and feel

451
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:21,179
like they're a part of it even if they're
like I was in 2009.

452
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:26,049
Which was too broke to travel and/or too lost
to know what I was supposed to be looking

453
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:27,049
for.

454
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:30,901
And I predict that a lot of people writing
code in ten years, if not the majority of

455
00:30:30,901 --> 00:30:34,679
people writing code in ten years, will not
be developers but trade.

456
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:38,230
So, we need to welcome them to this experience
as well.

457
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:47,320
As well as TC39 whatever hopefully non corporate
professional group is running the show.

458
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,649
And it's been said that this will be the last
JSConf EU which in the wake of my Microsoft

459
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:54,559
Word prediction, I'm not surprised.

460
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:00,080
Much like every conference, though I think
they'll skip a year or two and keep going

461
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,549
for years to come.

462
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:05,580
I'm thinking this might be my last JavaScript
talk.

463
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,270
I said that a few years ago and came back.

464
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:11,309
Jay Z said he wasn't making music anymore
and then he came back.

465
00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:14,150
I don't know.

466
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,929
I just think that something like this is too
magical and beautiful.

467
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:20,950
And to give up this ability to bring different
people together to learn and grow with each

468
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,950
other.

469
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:27,149
It won't run quite the same, this conference,
though, and it shouldn't, because what the

470
00:31:27,149 --> 00:31:30,340
language and community look like is rapidly
changing.

471
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:36,210
So, you know, those of you here running companies
and popular projects in the ecosystem, I want

472
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,320
you to take note of that dynamic changing.

473
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:46,159
I think it's becoming hella evident today
and not that not only are more companies in

474
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,899
our ecosystem going to have to live by the
value that all people matter more than the

475
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:51,899
tech we're building.

476
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:56,529
But the survival of their business will depend
on their being accountable and honest to those

477
00:31:56,529 --> 00:31:57,950
values.

478
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:58,950
You know?

479
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,049
They're staffed by and used by the community.

480
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:08,659
And so, those of us running companies in that
space need to like walk the walk sprint, even

481
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:10,529
more than talking the talk.

482
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:11,529
Yeah.

483
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:17,110
I mean, as an aside, I was just thinking a
lot about CJ's talk.

484
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:22,080
It's been really hard to witness what's been
going on at npm.

485
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,080
Because like at Glitch we talk about like
we're trying to get everyone to be able to

486
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,419
build the we can, and our product is very
focused on people.

487
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:34,720
And it just sucks when like someone in the
ecosystem just like fucks up something and

488
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,950
it sets the rest of us who are trying to do
good work back.

489
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:38,950
And that's fine.

490
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,590
We were ready to do the work.

491
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,590
We're here for the fight.

492
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,909
Like, we're gonna do it.

493
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:43,909
And we're gonna win.

494
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:45,929
We're counting on it.

495
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:54,710
But I'm just hoping that you all still you
all question companies and ask questions and

496
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,499
keep us honest and hold us accountable.

497
00:32:57,499 --> 00:33:01,270
Because some of us like want to do you right.

498
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,270
We're trying.

499
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,520
We're trying really hard.

500
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,840
And while tech is already political, in 2029
I predict there will be significantly fewer

501
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:16,549
cowards pretending it's not.

502
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:25,019
[ Applause ]
As for me, I don't know where I see myself

503
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:27,970
in ten minutes, let alone ten years.

504
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,880
Besides, of course, hotter and smarter.

505
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,290
Let's be honest.

506
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,450
Thank you.

507
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:38,559
Where I see myself in the future has always
been my hardest problem in computer science.

508
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:43,419
Like, I know where I'm at now and that's like
living a life and in a world that I never

509
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:45,330
could have imagined ten years ago.

510
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,429
Let alone two years ago.

511
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:51,429
Three months before I joined Glitch, I was
exploring how to quit tech because I fell

512
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:57,340
really ill and I just couldn't manage going
to work every day miserable and also physically

513
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,340
being miserable.

514
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,299
One of those had to give, that was tech.

515
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:04,409
And fortunately, an opportunity came around
and I ended up at Glitch.

516
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,610
And I felt great.

517
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:12,330
But I could never see that path happening
and it's very scary when you enter a space.

518
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:16,410
Even someone in the game as long as me and
not knowing what's ahead of you.

519
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:18,429
Not having any visibility.

520
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:26,920
It took a lot of hitting road blocks, earning
degrees and dodging obstacles, getting yelled

521
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:33,290
at on the Internet on the regular and a fuck
ton of work to get where I am today.

522
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:38,270
It was not a direct path, becoming a woman
in leadership.

523
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:42,750
And I'm not confident that such a path is
available for anyone else.

524
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,170
Let myself to continue.

525
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,600
You know?

526
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,460
Something might happen and in three months
or six months I might be like you know what?

527
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,460
Something's got to give.

528
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,900
I got to go back to teaching Excel at 6 a.m.
or 7 a.m.

529
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,650
Whatever the fuck it was.

530
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,060
I'm not a morning person anymore.

531
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:01,690
I don't want that to happen.

532
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:05,630
But I predict or at least hope that with like
the work we're all doing, like all of us in

533
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:11,540
this room and helping everyone on the web
create the web that our community in 2029

534
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,860
will be more visible and accessible.

535
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:18,240
As well as the definition of success for individuals.

536
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,600
More and different people will not only get
a say in how our language evolves, but they'll

537
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,530
get time on stage.

538
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:31,050
The safety that comes with being valued and
fairly paid.

539
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,920
I think that or hope that they'll be able
to see themselves continuing on that path

540
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,350
and reaching their ideal destination.

541
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:42,320
That they're not just sort of walking blindly
like I feel I am myself today.

542
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,660
And I think with that, they'll hopefully be
a little more confident in coaching other

543
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:52,400
generations and types of coders to reach their
ideal destinations as well.

544
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:59,860
And I think a lot of prominent visible marginalized
people in this industry have many stories

545
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,860
like this to tell.

546
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:04,660
But, you know, one day a woman came up to
me and was like, I really look up to you.

547
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,260
I follow you on Twitter.

548
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,240
I'm like, sorry.

549
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,830
And she's like, I want to, like, be you in
two years.

550
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:17,300
And I'm like, girl, I couldn't be me in two
years.

551
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,370
And I can't tell you how to be me in ten years.

552
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,500
That's what I'm hoping will change.

553
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:28,020
I hope that path will include building like
awesome apps that solve everyone's problems.

554
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:32,541
I hope it includes leading a team of the Greatest
engineers in the world and, you know, even

555
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:36,670
flying thousands of miles to shit post Larry
Ellison.

556
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:41,250
A volcano on the island.

557
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,800
Look it up.

558
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,280
If I play my cards right, and y'all let me
play them, I think that I'll be doing all

559
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,150
of those things still.

560
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,100
Maybe not flying miles to shit post Larry
Ellison.

561
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,990
That's like a one and done thing.

562
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:04,690
I think that maybe I'll be helping some Glitch
employee work on their dot doc XEU talk where

563
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:09,750
they showcase all the amazing apps that our
rad community made that year.

564
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:19,090
And we asked the community about 2029, it
was facilitating farming, supplying energy,

565
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:24,700
quantum computing, challenging the social
construct time.

566
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,460
The news in a social media dystopia.

567
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:33,340
And maybe even just simply making websites.

568
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:39,020
I know that my hair will probably be all gray
which will look sick as hell.

569
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,350
I hope any wisdom teeth don't grow back.

570
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,690
I don't know, climate change.

571
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,120
Like you never know what's gonna happen.

572
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,240
Anti vaxxers.

573
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:55,870
But I'm pretty confident that every night
I'll be lying wide awake, just like for years,

574
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,850
reflecting on the moment where I told the
woman in front of the bank that I did not

575
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:02,930
know where the Chase bank was.

576
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,200
Maybe the sun will burn out.

577
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,360
Thank you.

578
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,320
Thank you for sticking around for JavaScript
after dark.

579
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:15,650
I'm Jenn, smash those links, please subscribe.

580
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,030
And I'll see you on Glitch.com.

581
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:21,640
Thank you.
