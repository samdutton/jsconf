00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,420

good morning everyone welcome to The

2
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,240
Hangover slot I promise I'll go easy on

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,660
all of you my name is Suze Hinton you

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,730
can follow me on Twitter and github at

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,950
new cat if you want to know what my

6
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,660
username means you can come and find me

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,759
after this I'm a front-end developer at

8
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:30,130
Kickstarter in New York City which we'll

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,800
be talking about a little later on I'm

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,630
also a member of the node.js Hardware

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,120
working group so really enjoyed Rachel's

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,380
talk yesterday she was talking about the

13
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,060
no BOTS community so we're both part of

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,079
that ok we both also like cuts a lot

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,670
which you'll also find out with this

16
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,390
talk I'm recently a member of the newly

17
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,489
minted amber accessibility project

18
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:53,980
community team should we work on trying

19
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,769
to bring better accessibility to the mas

20
00:00:56,769 --> 00:00:58,269
front-end framework so again talk to me

21
00:00:58,269 --> 00:00:59,219
if you'd like to know more about that

22
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,920
we're actively working on that so why

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,360
are we here you're probably reading the

24
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,830
abstract and wondering about that we're

25
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,360
going to try and keep things in mystery

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,680
for a little bit longer but the main

27
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,590
points are that today we're talking

28
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,900
about Dada and art and how they can fit

29
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,450
together we're also talking about making

30
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,490
a mess I think it's really important to

31
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,020
make a mess and I'll touch on that a

32
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,900
little later on - there's also a lot of

33
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,700
feelings so if anyone's seen my talks

34
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,439
before you know that this is coming but

35
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,700
I thought I would have a warning that

36
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,619
there are a lot of feelings in this but

37
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:33,640
it's a good thing to story time I want

38
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,659
to tell you a little story in 1994 I was

39
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,520
9 years old and I was reading the

40
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,729
following book this was my introduction

41
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:48,880
to programming and you're thinking 1994

42
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,159
pretty strongly Windows 95 is about to

43
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:53,710
come out but this was my computer so I

44
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,320
was really really excited to learn how

45
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,149
to make art on the computer I'd been

46
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:00,969
drawing like my entire life and I never

47
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:02,680
really got that great at it but as a kid

48
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,450
that's all I wanted to do with computers

49
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,250
was I didn't want to type on them I

50
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,350
wanted to make art so I was reading this

51
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,509
book and this was my introduction to

52
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:13,210
programming and so I guess you could

53
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,920
call that you could call me the littlest

54
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,010
artist at the time but of course I did

55
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,310
grow up and I still was in love with the

56
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,230
idea of sort of the primitive

57
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,739
things that go on behind graphics and so

58
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:28,930
recently I wrote a library called Olli

59
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,220
DJ s and its job is to put pitches on

60
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,830
this primitive screen so you can kind of

61
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,510
see how that influence is still carried

62
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,980
through I'm not going to tell you how

63
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,790
many years later and give away my age so

64
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,680
I think of myself as the accidental

65
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,349
programa I didn't realize I was going to

66
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:49,750
be a professional programmer when I was

67
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,250
nine years old I was just having a lot

68
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,470
of fun and so in my personal time I

69
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,630
still like to emphasize on that which is

70
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,489
why I call myself the accidental

71
00:02:57,489 --> 00:02:59,860
programmer I don't care about whether

72
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,810
you use semicolons in your code or not

73
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,640
it just it doesn't matter to me that's

74
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:09,130
not what excites me about programming so

75
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,599
now I'm going to tell you a story within

76
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:14,620
a story I had a good friend Lindsay

77
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,319
Smith give me this book and he said to

78
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,269
me I think you'll really like it and I

79
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:20,410
think this was about seven or eight

80
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,959
years ago so for those who haven't read

81
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,049
it it's called contact by Carl Sagan by

82
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:30,010
this lovely gentleman here and the main

83
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,620
character is a scientist called dr.

84
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,109
Ellie Arroway and she works for the SETI

85
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:36,549
movement trying to find extraterrestrial

86
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,340
life so she heads up the program at what

87
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,670
if the astronomy towers and so her job

88
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,549
is to scan all of the signals in the sky

89
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:47,739
and figure out whether or not that's an

90
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:49,930
extraterrestrial signal she has to dig

91
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,540
within the noise and try and find that

92
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,970
signal in there and she actually does

93
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,420
one day and her team finds a message

94
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,600
from outer space and so this ends up

95
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,209
taking her to New York City where she

96
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:05,829
has to attend a lot of like really big

97
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,930
meetings with the government and with

98
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,910
security agencies and and with

99
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,310
scientists all over the world and it was

100
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,569
the first time she'd been to New York

101
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,359
City and she fell in love with it and

102
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:17,620
when I read this book initially I was in

103
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,209
Australia and when I moved to New York

104
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,639
City I felt the same way and I almost

105
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:24,300
carried her in my heart while I did and

106
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,090
so she had to take the subway in order

107
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,340
to get to a lot of her meetings and it

108
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,500
turned out that as she's riding the

109
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,350
subway because her mind was so true

110
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,210
over the last few months - listening for

111
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,350
signals within the noise that as she was

112
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,420
on the train she ended up missing all of

113
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,980
her meetings because she was listening

114
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,220
so intently for secret messages that she

115
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,690
didn't realize you know what was real

116
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,400
and what wasn't anymore

117
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,070
and so I found myself when I first

118
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,780
started taking the subway trying to

119
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,690
listen for messages in that - but then I

120
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,240
realized something about the difference

121
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,730
between myself and dr. Ally are awake

122
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,230
and that is that I kind of look for this

123
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,580
sort of stuff - which is how is similar

124
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,300
but dr. Arroway didn't have JavaScript

125
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,740
so what if dr. Arroway did have

126
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,500
JavaScript you know how could she try

127
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,400
and visualize the hidden messages in the

128
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,780
sort of noises that she falls in love

129
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,910
with so I found myself asking what does

130
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,640
sound look like and you know how can we

131
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,470
visualize that so we saw some of that

132
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,210
last night where the sounds were

133
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,280
visualized long like the the frequency

134
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,930
samples I'm gonna do something slightly

135
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,470
different today and we're gonna find out

136
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,470
via art what sound can be made to look

137
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,390
like so we're gonna use the Web Audio

138
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,800
API and before I go into this you're

139
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,270
probably wondering what the formulaic

140
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,700
spectrum is well that's a made-up word

141
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,780
so I'll explain so when you work with

142
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,940
data especially in your professional job

143
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,550
you want to make sure that that the

144
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,770
integrity of that data is is accurate

145
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,930
and the way that you're presenting that

146
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,900
data is also super accurate and so when

147
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,360
you're creating art be loyal to that the

148
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,940
data is really important in order to

149
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,730
create beauty that people can still

150
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,010
relate back to the data right so that's

151
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,450
really really important

152
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,490
when you start getting on the data

153
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,650
corruption side things start to get

154
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,660
messy there's a slight disconnect and

155
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,010
you're not really sure what's going on

156
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,260
but the thing is like that's art - like

157
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,780
who cares it's it's not it's not

158
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,640
important because you start with

159
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,990
something and you come up with something

160
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,320
unexpected at the other end so the talk

161
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,000
today is sort of focusing more

162
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,220
it's this messy side just to give you a

163
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,270
bit of an indication so the way that I

164
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,070
wanted to use the Web Audio API was I

165
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,140
wanted to record samples of the subway

166
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,570
and then I wanted to analyze that PCM

167
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,630
data so what is PCM it stands for pulse

168
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,160
code modulation so it's actually the raw

169
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,870
uncompressed audio data so it's the

170
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,030
samples that have been taken from the

171
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,700
analog world and then digitized so each

172
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,780
value in like a PCM file the the sample

173
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,120
ranges from negative 1 to positive 1 in

174
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,830
value so that's really important cuz

175
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,120
we're sort of going to map to that later

176
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,780
and some common PCM format file

177
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,610
extensions WAV files a files a ul 16 and

178
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:38,260
of course start PCM and this is a rather

179
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,290
wonky photo I took from Wikipedia that

180
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,720
sort of shows how you have your analog

181
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,850
sine waves and then you do math to

182
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,460
figure out like how to actually sample

183
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,620
that at regulate intervals so they're

184
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,850
the sort of values that we'll be playing

185
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,990
with now I end a lot of time sort of

186
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,700
secretly trying to record sounds on the

187
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,100
subway and I decided to pick a really

188
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,960
annoying obnoxious sound that we've all

189
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,280
sort of learned to ignore so if you've

190
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,990
never been on the New York City subway

191
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,970
before you may not be familiar with this

192
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,620
so I'll play it for you those who have

193
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,130
will be very annoyingly aware of it

194
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:18,040
stand clear of the closing doors please

195
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,050
and that dingdong at the end every time

196
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,090
okay so what if we took this sounds

197
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,130
right what if we took it as a WAV file

198
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,009
and open debt and looked at the data and

199
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:30,509
what if we took all of those values from

200
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:33,360
negative one to positive one and we said

201
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,120
okay each sample is a pixel on our

202
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,490
screen and then what if we took that

203
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,130
range and just mapped it over so it

204
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,289
would be zero to 255 to make it easier

205
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,850
for us to work with right negative one

206
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,200
to positive one is a really weird range

207
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,360
to work with unless you're working with

208
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,089
random numbers and what if that new

209
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:52,740
value that we've mapped it to would

210
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,080
affect the hue of the pixel that we're

211
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,160
putting on the page so I won't freak you

212
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,690
all out with too much code this morning

213
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,980
given that we were all drinking the

214
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,250
night before but it takes you know 12 to

215
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,930
13 lines of code in order to achieve

216
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,020
this a lot of art is just a bunch of for

217
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,580
loops and I was telling someone this

218
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,339
last night you're just taking data and

219
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,230
then looping around and doing crazy

220
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,020
things with it within the loop so we use

221
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,150
the audio context to decode the audio

222
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,339
data and we're just feeding in like

223
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:28,290
what's a coda and array buffer and then

224
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,700
once we've decoded that within the

225
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,040
promise we can get one of the channels

226
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,690
so we're just getting the left ear

227
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,250
because it's art it doesn't matter for

228
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,110
dropping the right ear we loop through

229
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,580
that and once we've mapped the value

230
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,480
from 2 to from 0 to 255 we can then

231
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,450
generate a pixel out of it by generating

232
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,480
a hue saturation luminosity converting

233
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,589
it to RGB and then we can manipulate a

234
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:59,490
image data canvas object and then put

235
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,350
that back onto the canvas in that very

236
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,720
last line so these slides will be up

237
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,130
online later so you can have a look at

238
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,260
that more closely if you like so what

239
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,709
does it look like if we just do this

240
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,500
well this is sort of what we have and so

241
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,910
that comes out really interesting I

242
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,990
actually thought it was really beautiful

243
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,740
and so there's a lot of pixels in there

244
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,029
but you can sort of see this rainbow

245
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:22,529
banding effect which i think is really

246
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:23,310
really cool

247
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,029
and if you're so if you've really been

248
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:28,589
paying attention this photo in the last

249
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:29,360
10 seconds you

250
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,740
realize that you can actually see the

251
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,480
patterns of the sound and this really

252
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,000
delighted me a lot you can actually make

253
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,800
out the individual words through those

254
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,420
bands at the top so you can actually

255
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,910
figure out based on how big the bands

256
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,300
are which word and syllable the speaker

257
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,160
was saying then you can see this big

258
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,500
empty bit but that's the white noise and

259
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,360
then they very obnoxious dingdong at the

260
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,399
end is in like vibrant rainbow colors

261
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,130
and I thought this was actually really

262
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,470
cool like this was proof that the the

263
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,480
dotted integrity is like one for one you

264
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,370
can actually see it and so that's really

265
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,980
cool to verify that that you know you've

266
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,620
brought that in and visualized it

267
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,269
there's only one problem with that that

268
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:09,620
picture that you just looked at is

269
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,290
300,000 pixels and a couple of times I

270
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,029
got the code wrong and I just completely

271
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:15,680
crashed the browser because it got stuck

272
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,959
trying to work on something you can't

273
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,610
console.log within that loop or it will

274
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:23,269
freeze for example and when you think

275
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:26,510
about it I just got the one channel I

276
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,700
didn't get the other ear so imagine if

277
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,890
you had that would be 600,000 so it's

278
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,870
it's just it's a lot to work with and

279
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,890
it's a little bit scary so this is this

280
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,240
is a bit of a problem like how do we

281
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,839
sort of like reduce that I thought maybe

282
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,360
the best way that to reduce that is to

283
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,420
map it audio to visuals and then back

284
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,070
out to audio again what if we can make

285
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,510
different audio out of this so what if

286
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,040
we took the simple concepts of a song

287
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,730
right it's 16 beats so how do we sort of

288
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,100
divide that up well theoretically we

289
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,360
could take the three hundred and eight

290
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,860
thousand seven hundred and twenty eight

291
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,839
samples and we could divide that by

292
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,820
sixteen beats right so now we have our

293
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,560
chunks of samples to do something with

294
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,839
but that's still a lot of samples that's

295
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,019
19 thousand samples so what if we sort

296
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:16,399
of start getting real with the data

297
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,440
corruption and start losing data and

298
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,630
what if we average the sample values of

299
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,779
each beat so essentially we add all of

300
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:26,600
them together divide it by 19,000 and

301
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,390
then we end up with a negative 1 to

302
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,550
positive 1 range like value for every

303
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,320
single beat then we can take that value

304
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,779
and do something sort of meaningful with

305
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:37,459
it but it's it's a lot simpler to work

306
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:41,930
with so what if we wanted to put people

307
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,120
back on the train

308
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,130
we might be able to designate the seat

309
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,100
color of each feet based on the value

310
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,430
and maybe that seat color denotes what

311
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,040
drumbeats or what oscillator note we're

312
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,339
gonna play and then this little kitty at

313
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:00,769
the bottom what if if he was sitting on

314
00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:02,690
a seat that was you know designated by a

315
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,510
specific value as well within that range

316
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,160
what if he could do a guitar strum and a

317
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,980
note to sort of accompany that

318
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,570
so what we get is something like this so

319
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,550
there are eight seats on the left and

320
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,230
eight seats on the right so that makes

321
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,290
up sixteen beats and you can see here

322
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,480
the cat has appeared in in this sort of

323
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,610
pattern now this is taking the direct

324
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,149
data from the the PCM values again from

325
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:30,800
that stand clear of the closing doors

326
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,139
please sound so without further ado

327
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:34,730
let's have a listen to what that sounds

328
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:53,220
like

329
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,990
okay so you get the point not sure

330
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:05,810
whether that's thank you so that's very

331
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,360
strange music and I sort of thought what

332
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,160
if we could make this a little more

333
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,940
entertaining so I have a friend and his

334
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,400
name is Mark Johnson and you can tell he

335
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,870
lives in New York just by looking at him

336
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,870
partly and he's a very incredibly

337
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,110
talented designer and he's also just a

338
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,810
really funny guy so I I met up with him

339
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,580
in the cafe a couple of weeks ago and I

340
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,440
said you don't happen to have any silly

341
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,570
sample sounds that you've recorded of

342
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,940
your own voice to you and without

343
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,830
surprise I said actually I do and he

344
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,600
just dropped boxed me a bunch of samples

345
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,180
so what happens if we put mark into this

346
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,740
train you know what is this gonna sound

347
00:14:42,740 --> 00:15:03,309
like let's let's have a listen

348
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,009
anyway that's sort of a little bit

349
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:12,029
funnier and he we hasn't seen this yet

350
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:14,149
so I guess I'll just send him this video

351
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:16,740
okay so a little bit about how I put

352
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,690
this piece of art together

353
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,149
most of it is SVG images that I've drawn

354
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:23,670
in a different program and imported them

355
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,399
in just as image tags it's a lot of divs

356
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,079
so those seats are just floating divs

357
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,630
next to each other right so this this

358
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,910
sort of application is way easy to deal

359
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,769
with in canvas in my last example

360
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:37,350
because you're just working with CSS and

361
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,970
you're working with JavaScript

362
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,860
manipulating those Dom elements so I

363
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,589
highly recommend doing art with divs and

364
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:45,480
things like that because you probably

365
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,680
couldn't tell by looking at it that it

366
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,060
was just straight markup that you can

367
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,610
look at in in the chrome developer tools

368
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,370
and then I'm using CSS animations for

369
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,680
that cursor to move across and I'm also

370
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,160
doing CSS animations the the cats kind

371
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,910
of danced along with this drama as well

372
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,920
and yeah obviously I'm not a musician

373
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,639
because that didn't sound great but I'm

374
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,620
hoping to sort of improve this music and

375
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,000
I've been talking to some of my musical

376
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,319
colleagues and they've been helping me

377
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:16,019
out but I'm better at Hardware things

378
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:17,639
and I think I'm better than earn for

379
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,850
that so I thought okay what would

380
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,589
playing this music look like in the real

381
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:25,079
world like can I do something to do with

382
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,810
hardware that can transfer this really

383
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,339
weird composition in the browser and

384
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,019
then we can play it back out in the real

385
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:32,300
world again

386
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,350
so I attend this meet up in New York

387
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,779
City code JavaScript as a code Brooklyn

388
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,639
Deus and they have this really funny

389
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,880
riff on the MTA metro card that you use

390
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,500
in the train system so it just says

391
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,870
brooklyn javascript this is what the

392
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,759
actual card looks like so you can see

393
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,350
it's actually really clever and that's

394
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,569
how ticket to get in and it's also our

395
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:54,959
drink ticket to get a free drink or you

396
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,870
can keep it and you have a souvenir and

397
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,370
i thought to myself that's that's such a

398
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,040
clever like riff to do on it like could

399
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,370
i do my own riff so i decided to lay out

400
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,930
a custom printed

401
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,270
afford and I thought what if I put a

402
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,650
speaker on the circuit board and then we

403
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,600
can play the sound but making it look

404
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,580
like a metric HUD so what it makes it

405
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,230
obvious what sort of sounds it's going

406
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,820
to play in the first place so that's the

407
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:24,390
tie back so this is what it looks like I

408
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,280
I think if they turn the video on I

409
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,570
actually have it here so if you wanted

410
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,610
to come and find me later on that's

411
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:35,310
that's it there with the giant this is

412
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:38,160
like a little 3d printed house for a

413
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,960
speaker that I stole from a musical

414
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,890
greeting card and you can program the

415
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,840
chip on the board as well using the

416
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,730
headers in the corner here and it just

417
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,160
plays music off an SD card so if you can

418
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,810
put that composition on an SD card it

419
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,550
will work and I think it'll be a little

420
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,850
too quiet for me too I don't think you

421
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,090
can hear it but come and find me later

422
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,530
so here's a quick video of me testing it

423
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,700
out for the first time after it's

424
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:10,480
soldered it all together

425
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,170
I don't think you can hear it I'm sorry

426
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,559
the audio is gone but you hold the

427
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,090
button down and it plays the sound while

428
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,400
the the button is held down so this is

429
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,160
also using an 80 mega 328p so you've if

430
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,300
you've ever played with an Arduino

431
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,090
before I actually just like rips the

432
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,580
micro micro controller off the Arduino

433
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,230
and then just put my own custom code on

434
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,340
it so so you know this isn't quite

435
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,800
finished yet and I feel like there's not

436
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,720
enough JavaScript in it for for me to

437
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,910
say it's a JavaScript project so I

438
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,340
actually wrote something last year code

439
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,830
a viago which uses nodejs to flesh

440
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,140
compiled programs onto micro electronics

441
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,300
so I've actually already done that so I

442
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,760
did write the program that runs on this

443
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,710
in C++ but it uses JavaScript to flash

444
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,960
it on there so that's pretty cool the

445
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,000
next thing I want to do is to stream the

446
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,330
resulting song over USB connection with

447
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,090
node.js using WebSockets and it will

448
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,860
stream it over to the SD card and save

449
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,750
it as a file so I started working on

450
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,190
that a couple of nights ago during the

451
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,900
conference and I'm sort of almost there

452
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,610
but I have some weird SPI bottleneck

453
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,710
issues so I will blog about that soon if

454
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,559
I manage to get it up and going and of

455
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,720
course I I want to make better music you

456
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,850
know not very good at it but we'll

457
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:28,130
figure it out okay so things got a

458
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,940
little bit weird but you know it's ah

459
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,920
this is the point this is this is what

460
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,809
I'm trying to tell you you don't always

461
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:38,090
have to use your code for professional

462
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,190
use you know when I work on my job

463
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,110
everyday I want my code to look perfect

464
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,910
I wanted to be readable I wanted to be

465
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,610
performant but whenever I go home for

466
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,530
the day I almost want to rebel against

467
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,240
that and and be the little girl with the

468
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,150
Commodore 64 again and so this is why

469
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,550
I'm up here today because I want to go

470
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,530
over like what what was the point of

471
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,920
this so creative coding gets you out of

472
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,929
your comfort zone when you're not used

473
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:05,540
to using divs for things like music and

474
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,880
moving curses and and things like that

475
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,220
it teaches you how to think about the

476
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,840
tools you use everyday in a different

477
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,880
way and how you can sort of exploit that

478
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,580
kind of thing

479
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,080
art doesn't care about your semicolon

480
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,809
feelings so if you create really messy

481
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:23,840
code with unused variables

482
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,850
you know missing stuff all over the

483
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,670
place and and lots of repeated sort of

484
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,130
copied and pasted functions odd doesn't

485
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,200
care it's still going to show you what

486
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,690
you wanted to look at in the end and so

487
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,910
you can really have a play ignore the

488
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,340
actual code and just expressively start

489
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,010
writing because odd doesn't care about

490
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:48,130
perfection it's it's about exploration

491
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,580
so kill MC or Killian McMahon is a he's

492
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,140
a colleague and very close friend of

493
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,590
mine and one day during a hackathon at

494
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,540
work I said ki just teach me about music

495
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,430
and so this is him attempting to teach

496
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,560
me about chords like G major and C major

497
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,460
and he also told me about like staying

498
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,750
within those chords and creating really

499
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,670
cool sort of repeated loops so I'm

500
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,140
really hoping to apply that new

501
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,030
knowledge to this music and help it

502
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,580
evolve but I've never worked with

503
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,900
Killian in this way before

504
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,090
he's a designer and he writes the HTML

505
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,740
and CSS and then I write the JavaScript

506
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,200
that accompanies his work and that's how

507
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,480
we normally collaborate but this offered

508
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,610
this new sort of collaboration given

509
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,180
that he plays amazing music outside of

510
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,830
outside of work and if anyone's going to

511
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,020
Pike on this year in Portland he's

512
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,790
actually going to be opening and putting

513
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,370
in a band playing and it's a really

514
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,670
awesome band they called The Adventure

515
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,390
where they called the venture

516
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,190
capitalists and they make fun of the

517
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,300
startup scene and they're really really

518
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,900
cool so definitely check the route so I

519
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,490
guess what I'm saying is that odd is

520
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,580
about what you learned it's not about

521
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,840
it's not about the normal things that

522
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,550
that we care about when we talk about

523
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,630
syntax so take some time if you have the

524
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,190
privilege of spare time and write some

525
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,980
messy code and make lots of mistakes and

526
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,310
don't necessarily go back and fix them

527
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,900
you deserve a break from being judged

528
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,640
we're always riding on each other's code

529
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,990
reviews and we're always like

530
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,210
painstakingly going over line by line of

531
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,060
code but what if you could just type

532
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,830
like this you know it just it feels

533
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,870
soothing it feels expressive you're just

534
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,040
throwing stuff out there to see what

535
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,220
happens I had no idea that a train with

536
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,750
cat sitting on it playing guitars it was

537
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,130
going to come out of this project but

538
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,650
that's that's what happened so code like

539
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,510
no one's watching

540
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,970
I want you to remember that code like no

541
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:44,120
one's watching and if you can don't get

542
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,510
rebase before you push it up so I'm

543
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,130
starting to see an alarming problem in

544
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:52,150
our industry we're juniors look up to

545
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,280
programmers who are mid-level and senior

546
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,640
and lead and they see us writing this

547
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,260
perfect code out of the gate because

548
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,180
they see it after we've opened the pull

549
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:02,750
request

550
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,370
well they join a company and they look

551
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,600
at our finished code that's already

552
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,530
sitting in production and I see juniors

553
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,050
even in my job just frozen looking at

554
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,480
this empty text file when they starting

555
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,060
a feature and it's it's that fear of the

556
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,100
blank canvas they think that they have

557
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,720
to write everything perfectly and have

558
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,280
all the details in their head the first

559
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,560
time and that's just not true

560
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,480
that's not how any of us write I don't

561
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,300
think we write something sort of good

562
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,160
and then we write it Gouda and then we

563
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,500
write it the goodest right that's that's

564
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,200
how it works and having to explain that

565
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,210
and having to get those genius to come

566
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,860
and pay with me whenever I've started

567
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,680
something so they can see my process

568
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,450
that shouldn't be necessary we we should

569
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,130
be showing people history even an

570
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,810
hour.get so they can see that we wrote

571
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,580
something messy and then we went back

572
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,130
and we thought about it and and we

573
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,110
changed it in ways that we wouldn't have

574
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,900
seen when we first started so just get

575
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,000
push and the scariest thing I've ever

576
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,730
done last night was I pushed all of the

577
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,530
art that I showed you today I pushed it

578
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:06,110
all up to github and I left it learn you

579
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,850
know there's multiple audio contexts

580
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,110
going on and they all have slightly

581
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,790
different ways of naming the variables

582
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,950
and it's a complete mess but I'm

583
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,360
inviting you to look at it so you can

584
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,790
see how stuff evolved and it doesn't

585
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,100
matter because all I wanted people to

586
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,050
see was the final product and it works

587
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,720
perfectly fine so think about that in

588
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,640
your everyday so that we can all be

589
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,710
learning more of each other and not

590
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,080
being so terrified of having to be

591
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,380
perfect the first time so that we can

592
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,820
make it okay for others so if you take

593
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,310
anything away today I want you to make

594
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,800
some art and want you to just throw it

595
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,960
away if you don't like it because it's

596
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,510
just code you can write more

597
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,910
so if you'd like to have a look at my

598
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,680
art examples you can go to that address

599
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,490
and the repo will also go there so that

600
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,600
you can have a look at the code if you

601
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,040
like il TSW just stands for I love the

602
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,310
subway that's my secret I I ride the

603
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,990
subway even when I'm not going anywhere

604
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,750
sometimes because I love it so I was

605
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,430
trying to make everyone else love this

606
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:14,460
subway today and if you'd like to go

607
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,780
through my slides again so look at some

608
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,190
of the code samples or just like play

609
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,670
with the stuff that I showed you can go

610
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:23,280
to again new cut github today you

611
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,200
slashed formulaic spectrum I just got a

612
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,030
jackal build error in my email so I will

613
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,060
try and fix it it's not quite up yet and

614
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,170
I will be blogging about this project

615
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,390
really soon to show how I made the

616
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,660
electronics and and sort of why I wanted

617
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,070
to do this weird everything in the first

618
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,690
place so keep an eye out for that I'm a
