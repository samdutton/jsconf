1
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,510

hi well that's weird okay hi I'm

2
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:26,130
Sebastian I work at some web service

3
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,960
agency code dank vector and Germany most

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,550
of you won't know this one actually I

5
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,489
consider myself as the average

6
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:37,940
JavaScript deaf from the next door so

7
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,040
nothing special most people then from

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,410
the internets know me as a ski disco if

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,340
they know me and yeah I actually love

10
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,859
coffee and 80s movies and multicolored

11
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:57,210
sucks so these are my favorites I'm

12
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,219
wearing them right now and if you have

13
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,969
any any cool online stock online shops

14
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,500
or something like this where i can buy

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,390
socks that look like this just give me

16
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,450
ping on twitter please thanks ok now for

17
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,860
sure and i also love javascript so yeah

18
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,120
a bit of history um my this looks a bit

19
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,850
word i know but when i was a kid like

20
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,640
six or seven years old i always imagined

21
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,520
it later when i'm working in my working

22
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,570
life that i will be in some lab and

23
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,130
actually looking like this every day and

24
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,560
doing some weird stuff building cool

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,330
things yeah but then I discovered our

26
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,290
script and after a while I thought yeah

27
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,300
actually I'm doing exactly that what I

28
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,020
dreamt of when I was kid so like

29
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,930
building all these crazy things here and

30
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,950
yeah so let's start the actual talk I

31
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,540
brought three kind of examples things I

32
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,989
build at home um I just figure out the

33
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,620
first one won't work because of some

34
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,510
network issues but I still tell you a

35
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,410
bit about it so actually um about

36
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,790
something called the trial detector so

37
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,810
the actual quest was that I'm spotting

38
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,190
the trolls here in the room

39
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,120
that tweet bath stuff during the talk

40
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,410
but yeah let's come to that later but

41
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,390
you're due to some network issues that

42
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,670
won't work because the actual setup boss

43
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,960
you see this this lamp here maybe and

44
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,420
this is attached to wireless power

45
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:59,000
plaque you can buy on Amazon and this

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
book's if I turn it on here no yeah so

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,210
you can see ok works manually and I'm

48
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,420
actually this works through the zigbee

49
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,190
wireless protocol is some kind of

50
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,560
standard protocol and I rode a node

51
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,770
library that you can that abstracts this

52
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,050
protocol this is not like it because

53
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,410
it's pretty unstable and well so you see

54
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,750
it's not working yet so it's really

55
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,600
unstable and I will work a bit on it and

56
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,600
then I will release it but yeah ZigBee

57
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,940
protocol is like a wireless

58
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,570
communication protocol and it's

59
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,160
standardized and open protocol so

60
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,230
everybody can just like grabbed it and

61
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,440
builds devil it works like bluetooth

62
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,700
kind of 16 communication channels can

63
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,060
fool duplex and you can do a scene

64
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,070
communication also there are you know

65
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,540
connectors i'm currently working with

66
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,739
the XP shields but this is kind of hard

67
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,070
to get around yeah there are also like

68
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,920
devices are standardized so you can buy

69
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,680
like this wireless power plaques on

70
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,220
amazon for like 20 euros or something

71
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,640
and then use them with any environment

72
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,260
you want that speaks the ZigBee protocol

73
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,610
and by the way when I'm when I did this

74
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,130
like kind of library abstraction I just

75
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,560
find thought that the guys who went to

76
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,610
the protocol must be on crack or

77
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,950
something because this is so weird

78
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,130
standing like packages with hex values

79
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:40,260
around and not good at math and just

80
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,910
really sucks when

81
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,820
you're not good at math so but I built

82
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,990
this library that will be released

83
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,120
somewhere in the future yeah that I

84
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,970
think it has some easy API so you can

85
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,520
just like discover the wireless

86
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,200
controller that you will connect with

87
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,530
your devices that you have you can start

88
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,180
a device discovery and actually like

89
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,020
getting to know these both so let's ddu

90
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,490
the wireless control speak with the

91
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,200
device and yeah so the device is called

92
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,350
will return all available devices these

93
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,960
have some common types like this one

94
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,280
will say hi I'm a binary switch and the

95
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,160
other one will and also it will say like

96
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,170
a are the status currently I'm turned on

97
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,860
and then you will have some easy actions

98
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,530
like turning things on and off hood when

99
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,620
it works then it works with these binary

100
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,290
switch things only but I will implement

101
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,570
some more drivers soon when I release a

102
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,690
library okay yeah sad that i discovered

103
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,610
that that won't work because there would

104
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,470
be a cool thing to show but let's move

105
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:02,050
on to another thing abroad here actually

106
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:09,380
uh-huh i have a connect here these

107
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,320
things i just type here is not like

108
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,210
comin fer to connect because when i

109
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,419
arrived in berlin on friday i just like

110
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,190
set up everything in my hotel room to

111
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,210
test if it works and to connect connect

112
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,030
gotta serio got a serious damage during

113
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:31,110
the fight and so a friday morning free i

114
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,320
am I like saturday morning for um I just

115
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,140
my last chance was to open it and I only

116
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,360
had a Swiss Army knife carrying with me

117
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,500
so I will never ever do that do that

118
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,660
again not in a hotel room not at three

119
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,000
o'clock in the morning opening a connect

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,510
but it kind of worked after this surgery

121
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:59,400
and so hopefully this will work so the

122
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,790
quest is make you're a proud of me and

123
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,510
actually what I'm trying to do is let

124
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,800
the kinect recognize a gesture i'm doing

125
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,790
then brought the kinect will give all

126
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,340
that stream to this Windows PC which has

127
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,990
to connect SDK installed and there's

128
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,880
some library running which will then

129
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,990
broadcast some broadcast some WebSocket

130
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,480
event which I'm catching in a browser

131
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,390
here on this computer and this computer

132
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,080
actually then we'll go and say hey

133
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,090
arduino please just let these tin cans

134
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,900
flip over okay and let's see if that one

135
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:59,670
we work huh it's running okay so after

136
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,740
this connector Udrih it worked like in

137
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,880
sixty percent of the things that drive

138
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:17,310
so hopefully so the bad way the infrared

139
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:27,000
sensor is gone so let's see how come on

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:42,430
come on come on

141
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,079
okay maybe will someone come over and

142
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,649
try his jedi force on the second one any

143
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:57,899
volunteer no I just come over just like

144
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,360
try to position some around here because

145
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,790
the kinect has some damage you won't see

146
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,680
yourself here normally you would see

147
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,220
yourself here and it's kind of hard

148
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,149
because no you don't know what to do but

149
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:19,620
still stand here and try um just give

150
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,600
just stay here for like two or three

151
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,360
seconds and I hope they're just do it a

152
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:50,170
couple of times just thank you

153
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,500
yeah I actually I just like did

154
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,660
something that was way cooler than this

155
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,010
like a shooting game so hopefully that

156
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:06,260
if the internet works uh-huh I did

157
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,250
something enter user group like a couple

158
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,120
of months ago and you see actually you

159
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,120
can really control this little rat

160
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,399
cursor inside of your browser window and

161
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:24,950
this is way more cool than what I showed

162
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,470
here and actually had this cool example

163
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,959
we're just like point on things and take

164
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:32,330
your other hand and shoot and shoot and

165
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,360
when you hit the virtual tin can I would

166
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,360
just flip this one over but damage

167
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,410
connect and a failure but hope you

168
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:47,209
enjoyed it what the other one too okay

169
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:54,620
so let's see how that works ok meet

170
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,709
connect Jess connect us is a library

171
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:00,290
that some I think some guys from Norway

172
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,459
build like half a year ago and this

173
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:07,670
one's super cool as a it uses the kinect

174
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,520
sdk so this is why I have this windows

175
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,170
laptop here and it's a little program

176
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:19,279
that runs on on this computer which

177
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,100
dispatches like you ends why sockets and

178
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,100
broadcast em to the network also they've

179
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,770
built some neat client-side JavaScript

180
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,170
library and it which introduces new

181
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,620
events so you can do like at evangelist

182
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,750
interconnect touch start to a need um

183
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,450
alum and and then react on that this is

184
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,190
so cool and you can set this up in like

185
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,839
15 to 20 minutes to do something in your

186
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:47,360
browser it can handle two players

187
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,300
actually so they also have a nice demo

188
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,279
with a pong game to place the two

189
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,000
players playing against each other and

190
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,040
it also has some predefined gestures one

191
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,890
we saw there to swipe gesture and they

192
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,630
also have something like a jump Chester

193
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,260
when you jump

194
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,530
up and down and this is pretty pretty

195
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:13,220
cool okay for my next project that I

196
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:19,010
call the Dancy Dancy I need another

197
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:23,060
volunteer out of the audience somebody

198
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:27,350
is willing to dance in front of okay

199
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,890
maybe maybe you will you would trust me

200
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,150
that nothing bad will happen as I just

201
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,920
ruined my street credibility on my own

202
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,580

238
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,400
with you I think you need it okay what

239
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,620
happened just here well I don't know for

240
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,160
sure I know does any one of you have

241
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,990
heard of this cool thing called Mikey

242
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:31,650
Mikey okay after this you will just like

243
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:35,370
directly order one on your own so make

244
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,810
you make it for me is the best damn

245
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:40,410
thing since sliced bread it's like this

246
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,530
little controller it actually was a

247
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,570
Kickstarter project like four months ago

248
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:50,760
and this little controller you can just

249
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,340
pluck them a plug it in via USB and it

250
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,160
acts like a normal keyboard so you get

251
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,730
some alligator clips with it and

252
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,730
actually that's the back of it so you

253
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:08,430
can map keyboard keys so you see W ASDF

254
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,560
these are actually normal keyboard keys

255
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,290
you can just clip alligator clips and

256
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,500
and connect it with everything that at

257
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,720
least transports a bit of energy like

258
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,670
your skin or some foil or appear a

259
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,040
banana they actually built some really

260
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,560
cool banana a keyboard that's awesome

261
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,330
but it is a cheap trick so as a toll it

262
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,940
acts like a normal keyboard and you can

263
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,390
just like grab it in your browser like

264
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,090
normal with a normal event listener and

265
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,920
as I told you an immaterial that conduct

266
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,900
at least bit of energy will work and

267
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,550
should really really get one for you on

268
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:56,130
your own at home okay so unlikely first

269
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,260
example won't work maybe I'm showing

270
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,010
that off later over there let's see but

271
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,960
you may ask yourself why is this guy on

272
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,310
stage showing us all this weird stuff

273
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,160
connecting you know

274
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,660
and actually it all started after last

275
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,330
year's Jays convey you so we had this

276
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,590
cool talks about the coder dojo and this

277
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,880
really cool talk by Chris Williams who

278
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,650
encouraged at least me to step up and do

279
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,280
some practice talking and also because

280
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,570
in a company i'm working there we work

281
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,100
together with some schools and

282
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,660
universities and select students coming

283
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,210
over and we tell them what we do here

284
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,330
and before i discovered all this cool

285
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,550
hat worst of they were like design

286
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:54,400
students that came over and asked you

287
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,570
here a developer do presentation on what

288
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,490
you're doing and I was like I was here I

289
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,680
built this website and you can buy

290
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,860
flights with it and every one of them

291
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,770
was like oh yeah ok this guy bills

292
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:13,960
website mmm but then I thought okay

293
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,620
maybe the job as a developer needs a bit

294
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,130
polish and I started building those

295
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,580
little things so I build a couple of

296
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,170
more which I just like for a way after

297
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:36,460
time when I'm bored of it and now I'm

298
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,470
showing this all to students and school

299
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,180
kids who come over to your company and

300
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,490
wanted to know what a developer does for

301
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,220
me and now i can say i'm okay i'm a

302
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,700
developer a boat key words you can make

303
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,790
music with your feet and i can make you

304
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,600
a real Jedi warrior night whatever

305
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,940
they're called and also I have some very

306
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,360
little cousins like beginning from the

307
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,550
age of six or seven I guess yeah and

308
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,830
this is this is the stuff if you want to

309
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,710
get someone into programming or want to

310
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:18,220
make somebody have fun doing starting

311
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,990
with programming that's the stuff you

312
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:24,310
should show them so and also if you're

313
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,960
some kind of a CTO

314
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,130
CFO run a known company that employs

315
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,590
some developers just buy them a couple

316
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:36,909
of rdu nose just buy them like a connect

317
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:38,950
to play around or just make you my key

318
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,630
thing and give them like two or three

319
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,929
hours in a week in a month maybe two

320
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:46,809
just and say just go and play so they

321
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:49,210
will have more fun when they go to work

322
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:52,480
because they can really do something and

323
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,210
actually just building thinks of

324
00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:00,010
javascript is fun so yeah I guess that's

325
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,899
it a bit shorter because the first

326
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:06,539
example was screwed but first of all
