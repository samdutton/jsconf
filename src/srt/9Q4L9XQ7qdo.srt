1
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:21,400

Oh

2
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,540
you

3
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,570
hi everyone welcome to my talk on a

4
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,179
symphony of sound gone mobile now let me

5
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:32,370
just give you a little bit about myself

6
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,290
as they said earlier my developer from

7
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,410
South Africa in Durban work on mainly

8
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,540
mobile doing mobile web games so today I

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,309
thought I tried a little thing a little

10
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:49,180
bit different and that is to have a demo

11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,120
a live demo please don't curse me okay

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,290
so now I actually need everyone to

13
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,820
participate if they can't pull out their

14
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,329
phone the devices hit the wire fire and

15
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,649
start go to that address in a matter of

16
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:02,230
seconds cool if everyone can just head

17
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:17,050
on over there well you do that so what

18
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,300
we're going to do is I'm going to try

19
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,280
and get the whole everyone's if you just

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,570
pump up your volume is going to try use

21
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,520
your phone's then to control all the

22
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:37,420
various sounds stop cheer with sorry

23
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:44,150
we got some sounds playing clearly no

24
00:01:44,150 --> 00:02:00,960
that's great sorry Tendo 11 to 13 dot 1

25
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:24,500
48 48 thousand

26
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,660
I hear some sounds

27
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,620
we'll have one person playing sound yes

28
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:40,689
Oh jet pump it up let's try it with

29
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:51,510
everyone else

30
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:59,950
I some noise in the back

31
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,890
any other ones All Hands up for those

32
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:16,400
who are playing there well that means

33
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,090
smashingly anyway but that there wasn't

34
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,560
that important what I want to remain you

35
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,990
speak about was that working about with

36
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,550
sound on mobile with what you have to

37
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,510
come across what some of the issues

38
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,640
you'll do the main goal of this is that

39
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,190
to get people to understanding what

40
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,420
actually happens when you're going to

41
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,650
play with sound on mobile what are some

42
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,000
of the quirks where some things I need

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,050
to look out so you're not sitting there

44
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,490
bashing your head against the wall and

45
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,650
then I want to try talk about current

46
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,090
about synchronizing sounds across the

47
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:47,570
devices audio all is relatively simple

48
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,760
to play on the end of us as you can see

49
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,790
using html5 audio will just create a new

50
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,610
instance audio set up the source hit

51
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,460
load and play no problems now you think

52
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:03,640
that that would obviously work it won't

53
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,390
that doesn't work and force your mobile

54
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,240
Wow the main thing that you could

55
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,560
understand is that depending on the

56
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,070
operating system as well as the actual

57
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,310
browser you can't just go and play a

58
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,290
device it with iOS specifically I know

59
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,030
Remy shops that a lot of work and all of

60
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,330
this thank you sir that you can't look

61
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,300
the load they won't load the sounds I

62
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,340
os5 in below and then well as it won't

63
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,020
also play the sound off the play you

64
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,760
actually need the user to initiate play

65
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,470
and chrome on Android is the same issue

66
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,390
so in order to not only low but play

67
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,860
sound you actually need to get that user

68
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,990
input upfront otherwise as you can see

69
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:51,050
not much will happen so a solution using

70
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,410
the auto buffer and preload to preload

71
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,230
it up front and then adding a event

72
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,790
listen foot touch starts as the user

73
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,410
goes and basically interacts with the

74
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,080
phone go to call call play it'll go up

75
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,880
play it or to buffer all the automatic

76
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,920
start loading and at the same time you

77
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,600
obviously don't want the user to start

78
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,890
freaking out as they touch the screen

79
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,230
sound starts playing add a listener to

80
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,060
play as well which then as soon as it

81
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,280
kicks in you send it to your go away you

82
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,380
basically send it to a force pause which

83
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,200
will then basically stop stop it

84
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,700
immediately remove those vent listeners

85
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,560
and basically keep it for later so that

86
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,450
any time you need to call it later it'll

87
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:32,380
go back and play so you thinking cool

88
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,660
well we're bored with audio APR that

89
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,250
should be much easier you have to worry

90
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,540
about all these mirrors inconsistencies

91
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,590
with the html5 tag you've got a sprite

92
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,660
issues which I believe someone's talking

93
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,210
about sprites later today so hopefully

94
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,530
they will cover some of those little bit

95
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,980
of nasties so let's take a look at

96
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,960
basically this is grab this morning or

97
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,660
can I use what the current support for

98
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,390
web audio is on mobile as you can see

99
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,100
there's not much thanks to the chrome

100
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,870
guards for shipping it I think about two

101
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,930
three weeks ago inversion 29 definitely

102
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,460
made life a lot easier so you're looking

103
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,100
at iOS 6 and above and then Chrome for

104
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,720
Android everywhere else doesn't really

105
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,970
support it and I believe Firefox for

106
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,860
Android they're looking at possibly

107
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,540
bringing that in as well now that it's

108
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:24,310
unstable Thank You chrome so wait a very

109
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,290
simple function pull or from html5 rocks

110
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,810
on how to basically load up a set of

111
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,760
player sound passing through the buffer

112
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,410
very straightforward simple create your

113
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,080
buffer source said it's play it no shoes

114
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,090
again on the phone it won't work and you

115
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,830
probably will be like that because none

116
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,440
of your sound is ever playing but

117
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,980
thankfully it's very simple to remedy

118
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,540
you haven't got the loading issues that

119
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,580
you have of the audio tag you've just

120
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,160
got the plank with iOS as well as again

121
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,650
chrome the user has to actually initiate

122
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,810
that initial play so using the hack that

123
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,980
we do earlier we can actually just put

124
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,500
that in the play the sound up put even

125
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,330
to your Creator master game mode which

126
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,610
basically set the volume to 0

127
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,919
just play it off for a second or so stop

128
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:10,360
it and the next time you come back there

129
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,039
should be no you should you can carry on

130
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:14,289
playing so it's actually quite a nice

131
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:16,599
and with the Web Audio and just while

132
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:18,419
playing around is that it's as

133
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,909
everyone's voices it's very responsive

134
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:23,620
there's so much you can do with it and

135
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,210
the support on the devices they have got

136
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,460
that do have it is actually quite good

137
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:33,939
so now the thing which is every time

138
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:35,199
I've brought this up with someone that

139
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,389
way said I'm crazy and maybe a middle

140
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:40,120
synchronizing sounds now the whole idea

141
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,550
behind synchronizing sounds was today

142
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,439
for those that did play was to have

143
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,300
basically played or for a server and

144
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,069
everyone will then get all across so

145
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:50,919
what is that actually entail they can

146
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:55,120
see that's the core bit of being

147
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,349
synchronous aren't you need to know what

148
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:57,759
the latency of every device is because

149
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,139
the last thing you want is to be able to

150
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:01,719
say okay everyone play from the start

151
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:03,729
and then three seconds later this device

152
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:04,960
starts playing and that device starts

153
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,789
playing so you got when working with

154
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:08,229
this you've got to really factor this

155
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:13,060
into your code just a brief explanation

156
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,330
of latency and thanks to wikipedia so

157
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,460
lazy is a measure of Tom DeLay

158
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,589
experienced in a system so in this case

159
00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:21,789
we're mainly interested in especially

160
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:23,740
with mobile on the radio how long did it

161
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,569
take hit my server and then returned to

162
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:30,490
get it so this is what I'm that I was

163
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,130
using to calculate latency as you can

164
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,140
see all I basically did was I ping my

165
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,690
serve with a current time and then the

166
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,310
server will respond back with the time

167
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,719
that it was received along with the

168
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,969
original time that then lets me say ok

169
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:44,829
well how much was basically the round

170
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:48,910
trip and here are / or / to just to get

171
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,940
a lead see one direction but that of

172
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,380
course isn't a hundred percent accurate

173
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,959
because lady can vary from inside but

174
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:58,149
this gives you a good round instance of

175
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:01,540
what it is and then the response

176
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,430
received sorry they're like what the

177
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,930
thing with latency is of course it's

178
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,519
always changing so that one little

179
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,370
function won't do much use it'll concert

180
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,600
it'll return a value and then two

181
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,040
minutes later also late and shut up

182
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,199
you're still not synchronized so I found

183
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:18,830
what would probably works best

184
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,540
to you constantly ping your server

185
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,880
getting calculating the latency and

186
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,120
storing all that in the right and then

187
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,160
using the mean latency so of course very

188
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,510
pretty so please push it all in the

189
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,130
array get the middle instance and use

190
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,380
that I found that that works quite

191
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,140
nicely when I was testing early as we

192
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,000
managed to get easy four or five devices

193
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,730
to sync perfectly across with no

194
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:45,170
problems so when a point of applying

195
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,360
your lady once you've got it it's no use

196
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,860
sir cool I've got my lady I'm going to

197
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,060
push play what's going to happen you

198
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,370
actually need affected us in such a case

199
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,370
for this what would I have what I found

200
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,110
that is the probably the easiest way to

201
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,250
do is whenever you're sending from the

202
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,040
server to go and play to actually add

203
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,950
the latency to that start time so that

204
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,280
you can then estimate that each device

205
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,330
when they receive it they'll have

206
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,850
restart time of one second plus it in

207
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,200
their latency they all should start

208
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,360
roughly at the same time if not the

209
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,860
actual sound but the sound instance will

210
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,810
be then the same some more interesting

211
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:24,350
things about audio and latency and all

212
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,320
those is that audio responsiveness

213
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,290
differs so from that of using the audio

214
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,320
tag to the HTML to web audio APR was

215
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,350
that it takes up to a second just in

216
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,630
order to instantiate that play on with

217
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,520
the audio tag so if you're going to be

218
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,380
using a situation like such on mobile

219
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,520
where you want to add multiple devices

220
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,440
you can have to cater for both of them

221
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,570
you never then worry about if you tell

222
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,250
the Web Audio to play guaranteed it will

223
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,460
play near instantly but then about 500

224
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,290
milliseconds later the audio tag will

225
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,060
play which then gives you that kind of

226
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,150
like stereo kind of a late late into

227
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,760
effect to do this probably the best

228
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,650
thing is to then buffer that time a

229
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,060
little bit more so whatever your latency

230
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,100
is increase it by give another for

231
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,470
another second or so which just then

232
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,150
pushes that up and hopefully gets

233
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,150
everything synced across some other more

234
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,960
interesting things is of course

235
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,390
depending on the sound you can actually

236
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,660
have leeway with your difference between

237
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,480
various devices what I found is that if

238
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,180
you have a basically a monotonous tone

239
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,610
of course it'll make no difference

240
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,579
not many changes in notes and if your if

241
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:34,060
it's a fast paced track with multiple

242
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,380
changes you will notice that a lot more

243
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,839
if with that is half a second or for

244
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,149
less so just going over to to recap on

245
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:46,089
some of the things that with when

246
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:48,160
working with audio with mobile things

247
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,660
you need to bear in mind is that the

248
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,370
user needs to initiate load and playback

249
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,950
with audio tag this is iOS this is on

250
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:57,220
Android all of them use the preload

251
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,180
attribute as well as the buffer auto

252
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,160
buffer that is fortunate appreciate

253
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,310
depreciated so preload with or with Auto

254
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,899
should do that so far space that will

255
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,790
every time you kick play immediate load

256
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,140
because calling the load and iOS

257
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,680
actually won't load the sound wave Audio

258
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,899
API you've got the same instance the

259
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:19,420
user needs to actually instead initiate

260
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,220
that play backwards we're using a touch

261
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,120
interface or whatever else and with

262
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,560
latency late she is constantly changing

263
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,570
so just bear that in mind when trying to

264
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,430
go it's you need to always make sure

265
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,050
you're getting the either the mean

266
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,519
latency because average the last thing

267
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,260
you wanted to get one spark and your

268
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,709
average just thrown out exponentially

269
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:42,190
use uut UCT timestamps that's catching

270
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,380
for different time zones and easiest

271
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,089
thing for to communicate with server and

272
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:49,300
client of course and then factoring in

273
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,279
latency when scheduling start time for

274
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,829
audio taking that start time adding it

275
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:59,529
on and carrying on so resources one of

276
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,930
them is Remy shops audio sprats I'd

277
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,399
highly recommend likely talks a lot

278
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,810
about some of the iOS fixes that I

279
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,839
mentioned here today we're what you

280
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,160
actually need to do and there's an us

281
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,750
there's another little issue when you're

282
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,339
trying to seek through and set the

283
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:14,380
current time with the audio tag which

284
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,480
actually just doesn't work so you found

285
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,750
a nice little hack around to do that

286
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,940
also the Web Audio API book by virus was

287
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,519
its I would highly recommend that if you

288
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:26,800
don't know much about audio or even just

289
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,420
the Web Audio API was actually really

290
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,750
great resource to get you through html5

291
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,760
rocks also they have an intro to the Web

292
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,279
Audio API highly recommended as well as

293
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,590
sounds of racer

294
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,940
this was really interesting because they

295
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,040
they actually start talking about how

296
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,800
they used and various algorithms to

297
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,050
calculate latency for the game and some

298
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,130
of those issues that they came across

299
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,770
which funny enough was similar to the

300
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:55,260
ones that I was finding thank you I'm

301
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:00,240
Wi-Fi as you can see Nick dacosta on g+

302
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,550
twitter ethnic underscored acosta if you

303
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,490
have any questions all the welcome to

304
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,810
come fine we will give me a sharp

305
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,250
nothing we've got some quite a bit of

306
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,910
time for questions yep we definitely

307
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,830
have time for some questions dad's also

308
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,720
wander around in there too so put your

309
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,310
hands up if you got questions ok one

310
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:22,980
over here and I don't see anyone and key

311
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,020
comment on whether there's any

312
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,730
difference between the Web Audio API

313
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,400
inside of Chrome for iOS compared to

314
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,560
safari for iOS because obviously it's

315
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,350
the webview the jobs cleanser is

316
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,260
slightly different not as fast i found

317
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,230
one odd difference which is more like

318
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,390
about a browser bug but whether than any

319
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,970
performance differences i haven't found

320
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,950
i haven't found much i don't actually

321
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,990
own unfortunate iOS device i wasn't able

322
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,740
to kiss that much on there the job said

323
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,970
from what i have done because we add

324
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,100
work we got a few devices going through

325
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,210
all of those haven't found too many

326
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:00,210
issues with that begin the sounds that

327
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,460
we planes very simple just setting up a

328
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,920
sprite playing going through not found

329
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,020
that much it is that I think the this

330
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,910
actual issue are in terms of performance

331
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,550
is quite nominal specifically full audio

332
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:15,720
because it handles quite nicely anybody

333
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,750
else actually he's got another one if

334
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,940
that's cool do you know if there's any

335
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:30,750
way to capture that that audio so record

336
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,220
the audio that you generate on a mobile

337
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,180
device so I know there's a the offline

338
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,440
context that was in the spec I don't

339
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,210
know whether that's landed at all I

340
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:42,600
don't know don't think that's actually

341
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,860
landed I could be hurry mistaken

342
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,180
anyone knows correct me if I'm wrong but

343
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,550
the the implementation on mobile is

344
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,620
still very new and as I said with chrome

345
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,200
really only shipping that about earlier

346
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,730
this month with vision 29 which the

347
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,780
latest one and then of course iOS with

348
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:08,870
iOS 6 all right thank you
