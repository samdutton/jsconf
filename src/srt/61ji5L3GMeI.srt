1
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,389

as mentioned I'm Anna watt and up until

2
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:11,500
two weeks ago

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,720
for Stanford University building

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,059
accessible user centered websites and

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,560
web product so we supported the

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,869
university's over 3,000 websites

7
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:22,029
we're sort of operated as an in-house

8
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:24,490
Drupal webshop and I work directly with

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,619
our development team back in front end

10
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:28,320
of and visual and user experience

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,180
designers but I actually just started a

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,580
new position just last Wednesday at a

13
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,460
startup in Seattle called text EO as a

14
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,010
community manager but while I was at

15
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,199
Stanford I worked on campus for the

16
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:44,110
first six months and then I decided to

17
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,880
move to Seattle where I continued

18
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,590
working for them remotely for the last

19
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,170
two years and when I moved I was really

20
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,210
missing that sense of community so I

21
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,250
started a Stanford community of practice

22
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,500
for distributed and remote workers which

23
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,300
was a community that met entirely

24
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,910
virtually to discuss this culture shift

25
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,739
of the future of work and what that

26
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:04,479
looked like and specifically the

27
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,940
challenges facing technology teams in

28
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,399
higher education so first I want to

29
00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:11,860
start off by saying I am NOT here to

30
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,170
push a remote first agenda I know that

31
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,549
there are some companies doing not

32
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:17,680
really successfully but really I want to

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,479
help support the culture shift around

34
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,939
what remote working really looks like

35
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:24,340
and how you can work with a distributed

36
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,619
team and working in tech you will

37
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,990
inevitably end up in a situation where

38
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,070
you're working with someone in a

39
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,110
different physical location as you even

40
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,220
if that means they're in a different

41
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,689
office or even a different conference

42
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:37,090
room on another floor and I encourage

43
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,799
you not to just cancel your remote

44
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,280
meetings because of that so or your

45
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,680
collaborative meetings that is so I have

46
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,299
to tell you this talk is already going

47
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:48,880
so much better than the very first talk

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,369
I ever gave at a conference I was

49
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:53,320
introducing this new community of

50
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,060
practice for remote workers at

51
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,399
Stanford's itn conference which brings

52
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:59,770
together 500 of Stanford's IT

53
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,390
professionals from all across the

54
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,520
university I flew back to Palo Alto

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,520
California on campus from Seattle and

56
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,739
I'm originally from the Bay Area as I

57
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:10,420
said I'll just stay with my parents in

58
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,579
Pacifica which is this cute little beach

59
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:15,040
town about 30 minutes away without

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,709
traffic on a good day so I gave myself

61
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:20,849
an hour and a half to get there and

62
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,140
believe it or not

63
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,570
it took me an hour and a half to get

64
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,210
there and I was late to my first ever

65
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,780
talk I got stuck in traffic when I

66
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,790
finally got to campus I parked the staff

67
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,680
parking lot about half a mile away from

68
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,230
the conference center I had to book it

69
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,750
across campus hoof it up a flight of

70
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,460
stairs three stairs at a time and I go

71
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,040
blasting through the conference doors to

72
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,780
see my speaking partner on stage

73
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,780
nervously laughing and introducing me so

74
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,320
I climb up on stage out of breath finish

75
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,709
the talk humiliated but it turns out

76
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,140
that everyone thought that we had staged

77
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,910
this that this was this big scripted

78
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,970
moment right because the irony was that

79
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,800
we were introducing this community of

80
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,500
practice because so many people were

81
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,970
dealing with their commute time

82
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,500
specifically at Stanford they had

83
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,190
doubled within the last year nailed that

84
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,560
one

85
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,060
so I go busting through the door they

86
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,010
recorded it I'd show you a video but I'm

87
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,870
not going to and the reality is that in

88
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,610
San Francisco Bay Area and I'm sure this

89
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,610
is true in many other cities San

90
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,920
Francisco workers have quit a job due to

91
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,870
a grueling drive to work that's one in

92
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,580
three San Francisco workers and this

93
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,890
came from the 2018 study by Robert Half

94
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,799
a talent firm yikes I'm sure some of you

95
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:43,690
can maybe even relate to this here and

96
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,910
it's not just traffic that's the problem

97
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,630
there's this affordable housing crisis

98
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,610
happening in many major tech hubs and I

99
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,739
grew up in the Bay Area my entire family

100
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:56,019
is still there but I personally made the

101
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:57,970
decision to move so I could afford a

102
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,920
home and I knew that that was a decision

103
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,410
was also a privilege that I had and I

104
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,060
know several other people that have made

105
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,680
that same decision to move away from

106
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,019
their family in order to afford a

107
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:10,989
different lifestyle and if you're having

108
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:12,519
a hard time thinking about how remote

109
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,110
working might impact you or your

110
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,060
employers I encourage you to check out

111
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,609
this talk by Erica D Fox called new in

112
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:21,070
town I saw this talk at the write speak

113
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,930
code conference in Portland Oregon of

114
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,680
August 2017 there's a link at the top

115
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,960
that we link but this talk confronts the

116
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,370
impact of the tech industry on

117
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,320
gentrification and I can't do this talk

118
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,030
justice so I just encourage you to watch

119
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,230
it after

120
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,670
you know when you go back after this

121
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,490
conference and it really talks about

122
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,980
that impact and specifically how remote

123
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,080
working can help offset some of those

124
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,850
issues along with other insightful

125
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,600
research and ideas so check that out

126
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,160
because the other thing is anytime you

127
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,380
talk about remote working the stigma is

128
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,410
this is what you're doing maybe I'll be

129
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,120
doing this in a few hours because we're

130
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,660
here but realistically this was not my

131
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,250
life this is not what it looked like to

132
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,190
work from home somehow you're on a beach

133
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:11,050
with Wi-Fi maybe there's a cocktail but

134
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,240
that certainly is not the reality for

135
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,330
most remote workers this is what my

136
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,550
office looks like I worked in my house

137
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,440
between four walls from 9:00 to 5:00

138
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,470
every day that is my desk and that is my

139
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,560
huge cat Lambert he's part Maine Coon so

140
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,990
he's just big but if you zoom in you'll

141
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,030
see like I'm on slack having a

142
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,220
discussion about gdpr compliance not

143
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,740
looking up flights to Mexico with

144
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,120
infinity pools and Wi-Fi don't work from

145
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,310
and mad hops to anyone that can do that

146
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,200
that's amazing but I just found that it

147
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,850
wasn't the lifestyle that I was able to

148
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,890
live because I interacted with my team

149
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,690
and our clients and an almost hourly

150
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,930
basis on video calls all day long this

151
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,020
was my view not the beach this is my

152
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,700
team at Stanford on Halloween no one

153
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,140
tweet this slide they know that I'm

154
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,180
sharing it but they'd probably kill me

155
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,240
if they knew I chose this photo I didn't

156
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,500
know you know if I didn't know any

157
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,880
better this could be any other day but

158
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,670
it was Halloween you'll see my coworker

159
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,290
Carol is dressed as a chicken she's

160
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,450
actually holding a chicken and then

161
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,810
bottom left you'll see is the conference

162
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,970
room of people on campus we had just as

163
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,980
many people working on campus as we did

164
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,140
working remotely and we have everything

165
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,360
from developers designers project

166
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,330
managers writers user experience

167
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,670
researchers both remote and on-site on

168
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,650
this picture we had a lot of fun and

169
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,840
every Monday morning we'd all jump on a

170
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,850
call and the larger team have our

171
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,770
stand-up talk about blockers and really

172
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,670
just kicked off our week so okay I told

173
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,930
the conference organizers there'd be

174
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,760
pictures of cats so you know that's why

175
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,890
they picked my talk but the truth is I

176
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,290
never thought I would be a remote

177
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,990
I was terrified I you know I'm an

178
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,240
extrovert working remotely was really

179
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,160
hard for me I get ideas from being

180
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,380
around other people so even though

181
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,970
Lambert here and I can come up with

182
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,340
great ideas together such as napping on

183
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,800
my keyboard ultimately I still needed to

184
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,530
join remote meetings with my team and I

185
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,510
still needed to collaborate and as the

186
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,310
project manager people were looking to

187
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,610
me to lead those in a collaborative way

188
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,870
just like when I was on campus for the

189
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,240
first six months it's just that now I'll

190
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,250
happen to be floating up on a giant five

191
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,870
foot TV screen on the wall in the

192
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,120
conference room and so while you might

193
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,680
think it's challenging how do you run a

194
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,840
brainstorm meeting without that wait

195
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,880
board and a smell of dry erase marker

196
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,250
right I actually found that it's still

197
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,860
very very doable remotely so today

198
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,270
finally here's the plan

199
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,300
I want to discuss what exactly is a

200
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,980
collaborative remote design working

201
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,600
session other than setting the record

202
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,940
for the most adjectives used in a talk

203
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,770
title and how is this different from

204
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,690
just another regular meeting and then

205
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,520
we'll look at some tools we used and how

206
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,990
I put them to use for running these

207
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,090
working sessions entirely remotely so

208
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,710
it's just a virtual whiteboard sticky

209
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,930
notes and all and then I'll share some

210
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,940
tips and best practices for being

211
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,500
inclusive because all the tools in the

212
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,970
world won't help you if you're not

213
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,360
actually including your team sound good

214
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,510
let's do it so what's the difference

215
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,460
between another regular meeting and a

216
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,920
working session in a traditional meeting

217
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,260
you might be updating each other right

218
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,030
you get in a room you talk about the

219
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,760
work you assign things you update and

220
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,110
then you leave and then you go work on

221
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,060
it so the PM there right

222
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,340
we're telling adding tasks hey front end

223
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,560
team you're gonna go team those

224
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,230
responsive breakpoints now yeah back-end

225
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:33,460
team go do backend stuff and user

226
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,080
experience designer you're gonna

227
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,050
interview a user or something right and

228
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,000
then we'll all come back together and

229
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,470
talk about what we did wrong because we

230
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,300
weren't actually working together go

231
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,840
team so this isn't just about having

232
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,520
better meetings with your team it's

233
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,320
about changing the way you actually

234
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,420
spend your time together and how you get

235
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,700
that work done so after this you can go

236
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,320
tell your team guess what no more mean

237
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,580
and then come thank me because they're

238
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,430
gonna love it by actually switching to

239
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,410
the term working session even in the

240
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,870
calendar in might I saw a change in the

241
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,640
way people approached the time together

242
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,380
they felt less pressure to bring

243
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,570
finished work to a meeting to share with

244
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,910
the group and we still have daily

245
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,500
stand-ups and sprint reviews for those

246
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,150
of you working on agile teams and are

247
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,040
curious so these are working sessions

248
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,770
outside of that so what exactly is this

249
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,170
collaborative remote design working

250
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:23,770
session

251
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,110
well it's collaborative because no one

252
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,060
single person is giving a formal

253
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,190
presentation like I'm doing right now

254
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,160
this is not a collaborative talk when

255
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,440
people are co-creating and feeling

256
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,450
included and their ideas are being heard

257
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,640
they're far more engaged and they're not

258
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,800
sitting there on their laptops looking

259
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,830
at pictures of my cats you're working

260
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,810
session should be as hands-on and

261
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,450
interactive as possible and it's remote

262
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,190
so this is a tricky layer right what

263
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,810
does it mean to be remote it doesn't

264
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,340
mean that everyone's working from home

265
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,080
it just means that you're not physically

266
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,730
co-located maybe there's people in a

267
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,260
different office or a different

268
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,820
conference room across campus this

269
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,710
happened at Stanford all the time it

270
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,990
took 20 minutes for me although 30

271
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,730
seconds flat when I sprinted onstage

272
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,550
super late to cross campus to another

273
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,200
meeting so we're saving time by just

274
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,810
calling in remotely and the goal here is

275
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,160
that you're making the content of these

276
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,070
meetings or these working sessions

277
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,540
accessible regardless of anyone's

278
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,460
physical location the day of the working

279
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,650
session the thing about the time you

280
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,300
called in to a meeting on speakerphone

281
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,520
or you were the person on the laptop at

282
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,620
the end of the table with everyone else

283
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,390
in the room you probably couldn't see

284
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,530
the whiteboard with all of their

285
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,750
fabulous ideas you probably couldn't

286
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,420
hear everyone that well and when you did

287
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,640
try to chime in it was awkward and they

288
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,050
asked you to repeat yourself is if you

289
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,940
just interrupted them sound familiar

290
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,730
just didn't feel like you were there in

291
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,250
the room with them so when you set up

292
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,410
these working sessions to work remotely

293
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,570
you're forcing the adoption of tools and

294
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,460
best practices that make this content

295
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,440
actually more accessible and inclusive

296
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,080
for everyone in the room even those

297
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,880
physically there and remote on the

298
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,850
screen and these are design working

299
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,230
sessions because they use a design

300
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,210
thinking process which I'll cover in a

301
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,550
few slides which brings the team along

302
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,150
the journey

303
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,190
designing something together when

304
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,960
there's a shared decision making along

305
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,760
the way you no longer need to fill

306
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,860
people in on conversations or decisions

307
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,560
made without them oh well

308
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,690
the design team mate met last week

309
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,490
during our design review meeting and

310
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,590
made some tweaks to those mock-ups after

311
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,690
I put a note in the JIRA ticket didn't

312
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:32,230
you see it design is iterative right

313
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,120
things are constantly changing so when

314
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,320
you're making these changes and

315
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,180
decisions together no one gets left

316
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,100
behind and these are working sessions

317
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,630
after all they're not deadline-driven

318
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,790
meetings as I mentioned before people

319
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,040
aren't rushing to get stuff done and it

320
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,020
allows the team to create shared goals

321
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,880
and expectations for how they spend

322
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,940
their time together so we're taking a

323
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,620
page from our accessibility advocates

324
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,090
accessibility is huge in higher

325
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,430
education as it should be everywhere so

326
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,110
when you solve a problem for remote

327
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,900
employee you often solve it for everyone

328
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,180
as a remote project manager I was forced

329
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,790
to keep up with documentation define and

330
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,070
redefine our processes and

331
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,610
over-communicate because someone

332
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,200
couldn't just walk up to my desk anymore

333
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,230
ensure their slack they can ping me but

334
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,060
it's just not the same and when your

335
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,740
remote you want to have access to that

336
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,390
information as quickly and efficiently

337
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,440
as possible

338
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,970
so when you set up these working

339
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,010
sessions to provide all materials to

340
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,200
work remotely such as creating a virtual

341
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,820
whiteboard it creates a much more

342
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,550
cohesive and well documented experience

343
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,160
so raise your hand if you've ever had a

344
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,290
magical brainstorm whiteboard session in

345
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,240
a conference room and you took a picture

346
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,650
of it and guess what I bet that picture

347
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,210
is still sitting on your phone and a

348
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,400
black hole or maybe you posted it on

349
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,140
slack and got a thumbs up emoji

350
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,110
until one day google photos prompts you

351
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,060
hey do you want to archive these 22

352
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,390
pictures of whiteboard photos so with

353
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,860
the virtual whiteboard it can be

354
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,350
revisited modified updated and used

355
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,850
frequently throughout the project

356
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,200
without requiring someone to

357
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,600
painstakingly transcribe all of your

358
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,490
wonderful notes on sticky notes on the

359
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,850
board so this is an example of mural a

360
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,650
tool that we use to recreate these

361
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,660
virtual whiteboards and share link and I

362
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,730
put a link to this whiteboard every

363
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,050
single one of my meeting invites

364
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,760
regardless if we're past the

365
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,200
brainstorming phase or not because we

366
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,490
might come back to it right we might

367
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,630
still want to access this information

368
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,590
later so as I mentioned working sessions

369
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,360
benefit from this design thinking

370
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,890
process since you're bringing everyone

371
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,690
along this journey of designing

372
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,700
something together the source here is

373
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,620
the Stanford d.school they have several

374
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,930
great resources for how to run workshops

375
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,750
with this lots of play books and sort of

376
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,430
worksheets and stuff to walk you through

377
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,750
how to do this but I'm going to cover

378
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,280
the quick basics because this could be

379
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,060
its own talk so just quickly first you

380
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,070
want to empathize with your users you

381
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,900
want to understand how they're feeling

382
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,430
what are their motivations gain an

383
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,860
empathic understanding of the problem

384
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,750
you're trying to solve then you're going

385
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,060
to define the problem or the hypothesis

386
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,980
so typically you create a human centered

387
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,960
problem statement which is really just a

388
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,730
fancy way of saying what are we doing

389
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,630
here for example how can we use

390
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,130
storytelling in a visual and compelling

391
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,960
way so our readers will want to learn

392
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,030
more and feel empowered to keep coming

393
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,760
back to our website instead of we want

394
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,680
our users to click and read our magazine

395
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,140
articles to drive up the number of page

396
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,170
views then you're going to quickly jump

397
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,240
into the idea phase with solutions and

398
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,010
designs this is brainstorm this is where

399
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,990
the magic happens so you can include

400
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,570
ideas for visuals user experience how

401
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,000
you might talk to users even ideas for

402
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,290
infrastructure you think you might need

403
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,690
to solve the problem and then jump into

404
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,060
the prototype experimental phase this is

405
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,910
low fidelity designs wireframes whatever

406
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,770
you need to get a prototype together so

407
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,450
you can get it in front of users as

408
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,130
quickly as possible for immediate

409
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,350
feedback which brings you to testing and

410
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,660
it's okay to fail fast because you're

411
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,680
going to keep going through each of

412
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,360
these different stages as you learn more

413
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,450
about your users means how they're

414
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,280
feeling how they're thinking and

415
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,590
behaving to your designs so you can keep

416
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:09,670
improving so I want to share an example

417
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,190
feature request of how we might have

418
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,920
taken a feature request into a Design

419
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,780
Thinking working session with our team

420
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,230
remotely so this example the product

421
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,730
owner came to us we worked on websites

422
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,860
at Stanford a product owner came to us

423
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,410
and said as a Content author just

424
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,880
someone that edits content on a website

425
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,340
I want to share the latest article with

426
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,360
a video or a featured image on the home

427
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,459
so that I can drive more traffic to our

428
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:39,140
magazine articles okay great let's get

429
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,640
in a room let's talk about it team what

430
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,709
do we what do we what's the problem

431
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,720
we're trying to solve who are the users

432
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,209
we're really solving this problem for so

433
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:48,829
first we empathize and define the

434
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:52,399
problem the end users the website

435
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,930
visitors or the people we're actually

436
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,300
designing for here so you want to get

437
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,769
everyone in their room thinking about

438
00:15:57,769 --> 00:15:59,899
those users right away not just about

439
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:01,790
the product owners business needs which

440
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,380
we know are important since they're the

441
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,050
content authors but in our working

442
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,180
session we'll use these frameworks for

443
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,250
example so this again we're using mural

444
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,010
because we're in that brainstorm sort of

445
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,950
emphasized and defined phase on the left

446
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,110
you see this strategize our value

447
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,240
proposition canvas and what that is is

448
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,399
it's looking at your user profile so

449
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,740
understanding their games their pains

450
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,019
what are the tasks the jobs they need to

451
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,430
do when they get to your website right

452
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,589
everyone needs to do something when

453
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,990
they're looking at your website and on

454
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,430
the other side you're looking at your

455
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,019
products your service or your website

456
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:38,480
and what are those game creators and

457
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,820
those pain relievers and between those

458
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,980
two canvases you'll start to identify a

459
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,199
fit where things are fitting between

460
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,820
your users and what you're providing to

461
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,800
them and where the gaps are what are you

462
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,269
missing what are you not seeing and

463
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:51,980
that's how you start to define what are

464
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,959
the problems we're really trying to

465
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:54,769
solve here

466
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:56,810
so a user experience designer in this

467
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,240
working session with this canvas for

468
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,920
example in mural is getting the whole

469
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,360
team thinking about the end user

470
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,699
experience we have developers in the

471
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:06,530
room we have obviously the user

472
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,740
experience designer everyone's talking

473
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,900
about this from the beginning and then

474
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,790
on the right is just another example of

475
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,280
the lean UX framework that you can use

476
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:22,520
to help define the problem so from there

477
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,130
you're gonna get into idea mode and this

478
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,569
can happen in the same working session

479
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:29,990
sometimes the last phase takes longer it

480
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,760
just depends how big the problem is and

481
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,530
how much you already know or what you

482
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,870
don't know yet so in the idea phase we

483
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,270
use Google draw or envision freehand for

484
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,130
example to quickly sketch in low

485
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,960
fidelity ideas I don't actually have the

486
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,520
mock-ups for this feature request since

487
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,160
I no longer

488
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,440
at Stanford but this is just obviously a

489
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,010
picture of a wireframe but a developers

490
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,840
might start sketching in some ideas for

491
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,850
functionality requirements as our

492
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,590
designers sketching out ideas for how

493
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,050
they want this to lay out on the the new

494
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,820
homepage we're designing maybe our

495
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,290
developer even says oh hey I have this

496
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,230
idea to use this YouTube API and while

497
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,150
they're demoing this all of us in the

498
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,030
room we discover oh we want to use our

499
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,980
own image stills and the ability to

500
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,020
upload those instead of using the

501
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,610
YouTube previews since we know that

502
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,440
custom imagery is really important to

503
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,330
our product owner so we you can see

504
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,980
we're sort of discovering these things

505
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,710
together collaboratively much earlier or

506
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,860
not in the process then we'll jump into

507
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,080
our prototype phase our visual designer

508
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,330
these again admittedly are much higher

509
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,980
fidelity than where they probably

510
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,750
started but this is what I can share

511
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,240
with you so we're looking at mock-ups

512
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,270
there using sketch or envision or Sigma

513
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,820
to collaboratively jump in and work on

514
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,040
these designs and we'll walk through

515
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,600
these technical requirements with our

516
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,700
developers will confirm the user flow

517
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,310
with our user experience designer in the

518
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:53,250
room as well and finally we'll test and

519
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,770
in our next working session we'll jump

520
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,920
on a call in zoom to share our screens

521
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,930
and watch someone test our prototype for

522
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,970
the very first time you can use tools

523
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,280
like optimal workshop as well to send it

524
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,140
out to like large groups of users to

525
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,540
collect a lot of data but the quickest

526
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,400
way to just test is share someone's

527
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,170
screen and watch them interact with your

528
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,360
prototype for the first time and in this

529
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,730
case I was the guinea pig so I was the

530
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,980
one testing our very first prototype and

531
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,220
on the right there was no play button

532
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,750
our designer immediately was like wait

533
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,070
where's the video play button this

534
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,560
custom icon I created it's missing and

535
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,030
as it turned out Google tag manager was

536
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:35,070
preventing our custom JavaScript from

537
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,230
loading in the correct order and so you

538
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,670
know if anyone's come across that bug

539
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,250
before that was a fun one to kind of

540
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,840
troubleshoot together but we were able

541
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,750
to really quickly come across some of

542
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,460
these issues early on and get them

543
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,870
resolved because we were sharing our

544
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,340
screens and not just like peeking over

545
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,990
each other's shoulder at the other

546
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,920
person's laptop so so far we've talked

547
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,490
about the format of collaborate

548
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,679
remote working sessions an example

549
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,210
feature built in the design thinking

550
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,550
process remotely so here are some other

551
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,170
tools because I've already mentioned a

552
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,840
few and chances are you're already using

553
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,270
a lot of these but I think but start

554
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,559
thinking about how you can leverage them

555
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:14,410
to set up a remote working session so

556
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,750
first and foremost nailed down your

557
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,880
video conferencing software it's super

558
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,580
important our team you zoom slack also

559
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,010
has great of you know video capabilities

560
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,080
for ad-hoc calls but we would actually

561
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,510
setup a dedicated zoom number that the

562
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,980
team would just memorize and it kind of

563
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,990
served as our virtual office or just hey

564
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,700
jump on a call and then people would all

565
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,410
meet there so you don't waste time

566
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,010
setting one up when you need to we would

567
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,809
also set up our conference rooms so that

568
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:42,820
we did have whiteboards in the physical

569
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,830
room directly across from the camera

570
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,150
where the conference room screen was

571
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,610
pointing and then we actually figured

572
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,990
out it's a little creepy but you can

573
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,179
change the settings of the zoom host to

574
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:54,670
allow far-end camera control so it's a

575
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,679
remote user I could actually control the

576
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:58,330
camera and like zoom into the whiteboard

577
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,040
and look around which was really

578
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,630
empowering as a remote person I don't

579
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,130
have to interrupt someone in their idea

580
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,630
because I can't see what they're doing

581
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,000
so I was able to kind of feel like I was

582
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,940
in the room with them also other

583
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,250
brainstorming tools mindmeister is a

584
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,350
good one for quick sort of mind mapping

585
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,210
just stream of conscious getting ideas

586
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,150
down Trello is really great another

587
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,580
virtual sticky board like experience

588
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,620
with sorting and voting and commenting

589
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,630
and now it connects to JIRA because that

590
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,170
lasya nones them now so that's cool you

591
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,600
can also use mural and optimal workshop

592
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,960
for user experience testing optimal

593
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,000
workshop has tree jack card sorting

594
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,870
first click analysis and surveys design

595
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,970
mock-ups we were using sketching and

596
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,950
vision for a while but figma sort of

597
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,300
taken over that real time and

598
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,770
collaboration sort of Google Doc

599
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,570
experience for designers which has been

600
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,870
really great so just take advantage of

601
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,429
all of the tools your team is already

602
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:55,809
using but think about how you can use

603
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:58,240
them and I'm a remote friendly way and

604
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,220
if there are others that you know of

605
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,780
that I haven't mentioned tweet them at

606
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,450
me always always checking out new tools

607
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,660
and so finally as I mentioned you can

608
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,130
have all the tools in the world but

609
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,330
they're not going to help you if you're

610
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:10,870
not actually

611
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:14,260
including your remote team members so I

612
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,120
have a few tips I want to share with you

613
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,809
this first one make remote working an

614
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:21,550
option for everyone especially for any

615
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,559
managers in the room this might be the

616
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:25,540
hardest part so maybe find me after if

617
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,890
you find that this is the biggest hurdle

618
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,380
on your team but I call this out to

619
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,270
manager specifically because I think the

620
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,950
culture shift has to start from the top

621
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,530
working from home should not be

622
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,180
considered special treatment or a

623
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,910
privilege and I'm not saying everyone

624
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,700
should work from home every day but they

625
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,860
should have the option and flexibility

626
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,000
to work from when and where they need to

627
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,010
only allowing full-time remote staff to

628
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,120
work remotely creates this really

629
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,880
negative stigma around it and resentment

630
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,040
for those that do so if everyone on the

631
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,690
team has a chance to try it and won't

632
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,190
feel like this dirty little secret that

633
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,630
gets taken advantage of when they

634
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,160
finally get to work from home because

635
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,250
they have a delivery at noon but it also

636
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,470
creates empathy for the on-site team for

637
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,080
the remote team members oh I finally got

638
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,150
to work from home last Thursday I didn't

639
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,770
realize when I hate pretzels right by

640
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:18,570
the microphone that's all you can hear

641
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,190
number two always turn on the video

642
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,840
camera now of all the tips I'm going to

643
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,640
share I think that this one is the most

644
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,220
important you have to have video and

645
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,350
everyone on the call has to do it

646
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,900
because video helps provide visual cues

647
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,790
like I'm agreeing with you or I'm

648
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,800
confused please keep explaining that

649
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,679
idea it really those facial expressions

650
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:40,360
are really helpful for staying engaged

651
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,980
and feeling like your ideas are being

652
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,500
heard and headphones are essential for

653
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,179
remote participants I think that goes

654
00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:48,640
without saying but just prevents that

655
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,429
sort of awkward audio gaps in feedback

656
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,870
that you might get so just get a nice

657
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:53,980
pair of headphones with the mute button

658
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,100
and on the positive side one positive

659
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,570
side effect of remote working I've

660
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,429
learned is that it really flexes your

661
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:02,710
active listening skills since you are

662
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,450
more aware of when you're interrupting

663
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,860
someone when you have control of your

664
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,330
own mute button sometimes I need to

665
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,860
remember that one when I'm in real life

666
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,309
again with other humans not just my cat

667
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:14,770
so number three have as much visibility

668
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,960
as if you were in the office do you say

669
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,429
hello to your team when you walk by

670
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:20,350
their desk in the morning drop a good

671
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,970
morning message and slack to say hi to

672
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,110
your remote teammates too so

673
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,250
people even let us know when they

674
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,660
stepped away from their keyboards for

675
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,130
lunch or when they're signing off for

676
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,450
the day but it's not a hard and fast

677
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,100
rule so there's no real pressure around

678
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,530
it if you forget - we still have daily

679
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,420
stand-ups and that's not just for agile

680
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,790
teams so for those of you that aren't

681
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,530
doing them most of you probably are but

682
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,720
hosts stand-ups with your remote staff

683
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,160
and on-site staff so you can kind of

684
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,700
check out

685
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,920
ok who's working from where today one of

686
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,660
the priorities and really just kick

687
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,340
start the day for your remote teammates

688
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,710
I know as a remote worker that's how I

689
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,870
kind of felt like I was at work even

690
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:57,919
though I was still in my own house this

691
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,750
is a fun one you can create a team

692
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,580
working agreement that really sets those

693
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,710
baseline expectations and understanding

694
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,600
of how you're gonna do work together

695
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,210
remotely you can create this in a fun

696
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,220
team bonding workshop using and design

697
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,220
thinking process we came up with a fun

698
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,960
team name in ours called team rational

699
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,640
and reasonable we were working on a lot

700
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,070
of legacy code so that just kind of came

701
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:21,440
up but you can discuss and decide things

702
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,750
like slack is great but when is it

703
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,809
appropriate to use email maybe never we

704
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:28,580
add conference links to every single

705
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,190
meeting invite regardless if we know a

706
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,840
remote team member is joining or not

707
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,100
because you never know if someone's

708
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,390
plans are gonna change and they're gonna

709
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,070
work from home that day so just having

710
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,190
that video call link already in the

711
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,270
invite it just keeps things moving

712
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,340
smoothly it doesn't feel like someone's

713
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,049
inconveniencing you because they decided

714
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:47,690
to call in another good one is if there

715
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,179
are more than 20 or 30 replies in slack

716
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:52,250
thread just hop on a call and hash it

717
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,980
out how do you get a hold of someone if

718
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,299
something is urgent do you need their

719
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:58,610
cell phone numbers and if you do have a

720
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,620
company-wide policy just make sure that

721
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,330
it's visible and well communicated to

722
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,400
your staff but I also recommend that

723
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,919
give your team that space to create a

724
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:08,690
working culture that's unique and best

725
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,490
for them to kind of get down into the

726
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:14,299
nuances of these things so I have a

727
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:16,460
recap of all of those tips available on

728
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:20,090
a link at bitly slash remote - tips on

729
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,360
medium which just has all of these tips

730
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,040
in a couple of others but the really big

731
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,410
takeaways from today are remember you're

732
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,390
collaborating you're not presenting in

733
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,850
these working sessions be inclusive of

734
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,160
all your team members both remote and

735
