1
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,020

so as you mentioned my name is Kyle

2
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,940
kayak the divide alup it's talk is

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,520
communicate all the things what that

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,900
means we're going to talk about web

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,670
communications and more specifically

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,560
about the capabilities that you now have

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,110
access to as front-end developers to do

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,700
communications on the web so well we're

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,350
kind of late and last couple people to

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,760
get in if you guys want to follow along

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,530
this is a live deck it should update

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,030
automatically if you just head to this

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,490
URL it's goo GL / AP capital j capital f

14
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,850
capital N and the number 7 that'll be

15
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,530
important later we'll do some demos and

16
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,970
I'd love to actually get some audience

17
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,740
interaction will try doing a video call

18
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,930
and maybe a little screen share so if

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,860
you guys want to go ahead and hit that

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,680
URL will run that throughout the session

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,030
here all right so everybody ready let's

22
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,799
do this thing so what we're going to

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,299
talk about today we're going to take a

24
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,700
look at WebRTC sort of what it is what

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,040
it allows you to do is devs what the

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,320
spec looks like how it functions I don't

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,729
talk a little bit of our spoke company I

28
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:16,770
work with what that framework allows you

29
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,600
to do how it simplifies your lives a bit

30
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,790
and we'll look at some code samples some

31
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,930
implementations of WebRTC using response

32
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,700
Crean sharing talk about messaging a bit

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,770
and if we have time at the end we'll get

34
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,590
into QA this is a bit of a short session

35
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,320
30 minutes isn't a ton of time so we're

36
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,610
actually going to kind of cruise through

37
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,710
this rather quickly um if you guys can

38
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,820
just hold questions till the end that'd

39
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,470
be great too so Who am I and why should

40
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,299
you actually listen to anything I have

41
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,490
to say like you mentioned my name is

42
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,530
Kyle taya I'm a flash and web developer

43
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,270
it's been about 10 years is a flash

44
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,560
freelancer doing ton of ActionScript

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,540
work which kind of led the foundation

46
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,220
for where I found myself today with web

47
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,080
communications flash did a lot of

48
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,970
peer-to-peer stuff video streaming audio

49
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,310
I mean sort of laid the foundation work

50
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,960
for where javascript is now coming up to

51
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,420
speed with this communication stuff then

52
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,979
I got back into front ends and now as i

53
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,090
mentioned i'm a developer evangelist for

54
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,280
smoke coming out to conferences like

55
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,720
this and talking to great folks like you

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,730
about web communications i'm also a huge

57
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,230
beer geek so if we have any home brewers

58
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,510
in the audience find me at the karaoke

59
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,980
party tonight or at the beach tomorrow

60
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,260
I'd love to talk beer and talk about

61
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,540
that fall day

62
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,830
so what the heck is web RTC it's defined

63
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,440
by the Mozilla Foundation as a free open

64
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,210
project that enables web browsers with

65
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,460
real-time communications it's the RTC

66
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,590
portion capabilities via simple

67
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,050
JavaScript API so what does that mean

68
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,980
exactly free it's free you can use it

69
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,690
it's built into the browser it's part of

70
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,670
the html5 spec or is at least being

71
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,500
proposed to be part of the html5 spec

72
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,480
meaning you just have access to it for

73
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,890
free you don't have to buy a license you

74
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,410
can just play around with it open its

75
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,390
open sourced into the BSD license so if

76
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,980
you're one of those crafty developers it

77
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,390
likes to contribute to projects and i

78
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,850
highly recommend all of you do on you

79
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,170
can actually add your own features into

80
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,880
this and make contributions to the spec

81
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,459
and might actually see them go live

82
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:09,959
real-time communications this is sort of

83
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,390
the the meat of it all it's audio and

84
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,850
video and data in real time so basically

85
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,709
what WebRTC does is to figure out how to

86
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:18,600
connect to browsers and create a peer to

87
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,370
peer connection between them so if you

88
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,840
think about kind of how the WebSockets

89
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,340
work but you take that middle layer out

90
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,080
and just connect the browsers directly

91
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,600
one to one that's what period of your

92
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,160
communications does and the real-time

93
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,130
portion of it is real time so think

94
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,540
about video and audio in real time the

95
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,470
way you talk to somebody on the phone

96
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,750
that's a real time conversation the same

97
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,400
communications capabilities are coming

98
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,410
to the web browser so if you think a

99
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,820
Skype or Google Hangouts those are kind

100
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,040
of good examples of this type of

101
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,560
technology being utilized today and

102
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,360
JavaScript API is as I mentioned it's

103
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,530
built into the browser it's part of the

104
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,690
html5 spec so it's stuff that you can

105
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,519
just access natively with the JavaScript

106
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,260
you know and love today and I'm assuming

107
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,180
I have a very large audience of j/s

108
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,530
developers in this room given the

109
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,930
conference yeah all right so this would

110
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,280
be a stuff that you guys can easily work

111
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,600
with you don't need to know anything new

112
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,590
you don't need to learn anything new

113
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,690
other than the api's and you can just

114
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,269
start working with it using javascript

115
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:11,489
the contributors Google Mozilla and

116
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:14,370
opera are the big ones IE is kind of

117
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,390
Microsoft working on their own

118
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,910
implementation of RTC which sort of

119
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,950
mimics WebRTC with a few tweaks of

120
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,169
course no shock there but they're

121
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:23,760
actually also contributing back to the

122
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,770
main spec so there is some back and

123
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,510
forth going on between google and

124
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,780
mozilla and ie which is good because the

125
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,250
hope is that one day when they finalize

126
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,960
a spec and things firm up and sort of

127
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,310
they decide on and how everything is

128
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,270
going to really look and we're

129
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,610
uh that everyone will implement one

130
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,640
version of this spec again that's that's

131
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,250
a hope it's maybe a dream but things are

132
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,450
actually looking like they might go in

133
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,260
that direction so WebRTC in the wild

134
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,520
what are people doing with this stuff

135
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,800
already you guys may have seen Amazon

136
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,930
made a some time ago the Kindle Fire X

137
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:00,810
was launched updating and we have our

138
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,840
first demo issue here wow that's awesome

139
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,680
alright guys bear with me i'm going to

140
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,920
go go a little bit rogue on this oh

141
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,370
we're up alright so Amazon Mayday when

142
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,960
Kindle launched they added this new

143
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,770
feature called the Mayday button

144
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,330
basically allowed you to click a button

145
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,920
and be immediately connected with a

146
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,260
sport rep at Amazon who would then be

147
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,780
able to access your screen circle the

148
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,520
mail button to show you how to use email

149
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,860
apparently given this example um and

150
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,870
then shut you know with a video with a

151
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,630
shiny happy support rep from amazon i

152
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,250
have tests of the service this is not

153
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,470
the person you talked to i can tell you

154
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,600
that very plainly they were very helpful

155
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,150
but not nearly as shiny or happy as

156
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,090
portrayed in their marketing campaigns

157
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,350
that being said it's a really cool use

158
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,390
case right you've got live video

159
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,980
conversation happening with the support

160
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,970
representative you're getting immediate

161
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,770
feedback it beats the heck out of the

162
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,300
you know the existing kind of chat

163
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,890
support or even the worse and more

164
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,660
standard phone support that you get for

165
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,670
most companies and they built this using

166
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,440
WebRTC implemented on top of their

167
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,480
existing phone systems so they used web

168
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,580
RTC for the video portion at least from

169
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,980
what we can tell and then the existing

170
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,240
stuff went through their their normal

171
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,470
phone support line that they already had

172
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,170
in place one you guys might have seen a

173
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,810
little bit more is google hangouts this

174
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,130
is one that i'm guessing most people in

175
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,510
this room have used at some point you

176
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,580
may have noticed in the past you had to

177
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,050
download a plug-in to use google

178
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,600
hangouts no longer as of about six or

179
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,040
eight months ago they rolled it over to

180
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,930
officially use WebRTC so kind of eaten

181
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,420
their own dog food there to do the

182
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,220
functionality for things like the data

183
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,080
transfers and the live video

184
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,480
conversations as well as messaging i

185
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,370
believe so a good example kind of

186
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,480
showcasing a lot of the functionality

187
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,320
built into WebRTC apollo is actually a

188
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,290
chat client we built it respond we

189
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,760
didn't like hangouts for specific

190
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,129
reasons so we built our own

191
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:52,110
we used our own tools to roll our own

192
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,479
version of a communications out this

193
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,979
actually has things like screen sharing

194
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,649
file sharing group messaging phone

195
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:00,389
conversations you can dialect somebody's

196
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:02,069
phone or you can dial them directly over

197
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:04,919
the web using a video call and again it

198
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:05,909
was just something that we built a

199
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:07,589
custom tailor a solution for what we

200
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:11,669
needed as a remote team pure CDN this is

201
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:13,259
actually a really cool implementation

202
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,499
these guys built it's essentially a CDN

203
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:18,689
on your website so what you do is drop

204
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,550
in a JavaScript library and it scrubs

205
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,709
your web your website for static assets

206
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,110
so things like PDFs large video files

207
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,999
images anything that's static that you

208
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:28,259
would normally just have every user

209
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,569
download from your web server and what

210
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:32,309
it does is to look and see if anybody

211
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:34,319
else currently on the site has those

212
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,749
files already if it does it creates a

213
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:38,399
peer to peer connection between the new

214
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,289
user and the user with the files and

215
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:42,089
actually sends the files directly across

216
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:43,740
that peer-to-peer channel and what

217
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,300
that's doing is saving you a ton of

218
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,069
bandwidth costs so instead of everyone

219
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:48,479
in this room going to a website and

220
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,429
downloading every single file thus

221
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,229
charging us a bunch of bandwidth they're

222
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:54,839
actually creating a network around the

223
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,339
people in the room and streaming those

224
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:58,619
files when possible directly from person

225
00:07:58,619 --> 00:08:00,569
to person so kind of akin to a bit

226
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:03,389
torrent client in a way and again then

227
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:04,860
with savings can be really huge on that

228
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,849
especially when you think about things

229
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:07,679
like large video files that you might

230
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,509
want to share you know 10 10 megs at a

231
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:11,189
time through a bunch of users could cost

232
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:13,829
you a lot of money in bandwidth cube

233
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:15,719
slam this was an example Google built to

234
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:20,699
kind of there we go to kind of showcase

235
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,240
the gaming potential for WebRTC so they

236
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,619
actually take advantage of that peer to

237
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:27,749
peer connection to stream JSON objects

238
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:29,669
with live game updates so if you think

239
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:30,869
about normally how you'd set up a game

240
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:32,880
online you have some sort of a gaming

241
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,800
server in between all the data would go

242
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,389
from one user up to the gaming server

243
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:38,039
and out to the rest in this

244
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,689
implementation they built a sort of a

245
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:42,000
pong style game where they're using

246
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,529
video to actually show you the user

247
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:45,029
you're playing against and audio so you

248
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:46,800
can talk back and forth and then using

249
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,209
that same channel to just send simple

250
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:50,519
JSON objects with the game data so as

251
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,139
updates are happening in the game the

252
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:53,490
position of your paddle the position of

253
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,019
the puck it's sending all that stuff

254
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,449
across using just just json through the

255
00:08:57,449 --> 00:09:01,139
the data channel some more altruistic

256
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:02,790
examples that I think are actually

257
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,779
really cool speak

258
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:05,249
exchange is one that I was just recently

259
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:07,800
shown this is basically connecting

260
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,749
elderly retirees or folks in retirement

261
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,089
homes in the US with non-native English

262
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:14,310
speakers or students in Brazil and what

263
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,720
it does is to connect them via video

264
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,129
chat to allow them to practice their

265
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:18,990
English so it's taking folks that are

266
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,339
rather lonely and just looking for

267
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:21,899
somebody to talk to you with kids that

268
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,459
are trying to learn English and bringing

269
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,980
them together via just a simple web chat

270
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,259
built on top of WebRTC and again all

271
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:29,910
they need to do this is to go into the

272
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,709
browsers that support WebRTC so Chrome

273
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:33,870
and Firefox are the big ones and they're

274
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,279
able to have this video communication

275
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,509
happen there's no plugins there's no

276
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,860
software to download that's kind of a

277
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,019
big thing and again as speaking exchange

278
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:41,220
building this they're not paying all

279
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,350
these huge bandwidth bills to host a

280
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,699
server and actually stream all that

281
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:47,279
video data through that server and

282
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,990
another one that's a personal favorite

283
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,540
of mine is be my eyes these guys came up

284
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,040
with a concept to build an app that

285
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,529
would allow site challenge people or

286
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,839
blind folks to actually dial into this

287
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,360
app and request help so imagine you're

288
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,949
blind and you're in your apartment and

289
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:03,180
you need to know if the milk is spoiled

290
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,920
right or you're on a subway and they

291
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,120
don't have a Braille system you just

292
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,319
need to know which track you need to be

293
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:09,269
standing by this app actually allows you

294
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:11,189
to open up the app request help from a

295
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:13,199
sighted person they then connect via

296
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:15,180
WebRTC over a video chat you can show

297
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,500
them what it is you're looking at or

298
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,329
trying to look at and they can explain

299
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:19,949
it to you or describe what it is you're

300
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:22,139
seeing or read the text that isn't in

301
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:25,079
Braille so again kind of a cool way to

302
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:26,939
look at you know use or potentially use

303
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:29,220
for this type of technology so it's just

304
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,259
giving developers like ourselves a new

305
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:33,600
way to to work with communications in

306
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,189
the existing stuff that we know so in

307
00:10:35,189 --> 00:10:36,930
JavaScript in our language we don't to

308
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,300
go out and learn actionscript or use god

309
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,550
I even suggested flash to accomplish

310
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,439
something like this we can just do this

311
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:45,839
stuff using javascript so how does it

312
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,389
work kind of like this everybody

313
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:50,009
remembers the old tin cans and strings

314
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:51,750
as a kid right you got a tin can on one

315
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,129
in a tin can on the other end you've got

316
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:54,750
a big string in between well if you

317
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,610
place the tin cans with a browser and a

318
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,990
string with that peer-to-peer channel

319
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,610
that we were talking about this is kind

320
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,529
of how WebRTC works you've got two

321
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:03,509
people that want to connect WebRTC

322
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:04,620
figures out how to make that connection

323
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,120
happen and then once you have that

324
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,439
channel open you can send whatever you

325
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:08,910
want to cross it whether it's video it's

326
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,519
audio data it all streams directly

327
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,100
across so to kind of bring this example

328
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,179
home a little bit more we're gonna talk

329
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:17,760
about Bob and Alice Bob and Alice met

330
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,680
an online dating site like many of us

331
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,260
today and we're using the example of

332
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,630
caveman date calm I wanted to use paleo

333
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,370
date calm but apparently that site

334
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,610
actually exists for paleo eating folks

335
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,620
that want to date so if you're really

336
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,050
into meat and nuts and you want to meet

337
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,270
a you know another person that's into

338
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,460
that same thing check out paleo date but

339
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,230
caveman date calm is our example for

340
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,450
today so Bob and Alice Medicaid mandate

341
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,580
and doing the smart thing in the world

342
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,110
we live in today they wanted to have a

343
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,030
video chat and kind of test the waters

344
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,230
before they went out on their first date

345
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,590
so in an ideal world the browser would

346
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,060
update quickly enough that I could

347
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,280
actually talk to it it would look

348
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,980
something like this Bob and Alice would

349
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,090
exchange some information through a

350
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,830
process known as signaling and what

351
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,330
signaling does is to basically say hey

352
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,620
I've got the capabilities to share a

353
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,150
webcam I've got the capabilities to

354
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,310
share my microphone and here's some

355
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,080
information about how to access me so my

356
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,330
local IP address of my port then share

357
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,040
that stuff back and forth and from that

358
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,180
they would be able to establish this

359
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,230
peer to peer connection we've been

360
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,510
talking about but as we all know the

361
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,120
real world isn't so much I deal in the

362
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,620
real world we have NAT which is the

363
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,020
network address translation which is

364
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,160
what allows us to have these vast

365
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,780
networks that we have today so things

366
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,150
like your your router at home or maybe a

367
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,760
firewall at your workplace these are the

368
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,920
things that both allow us to have the

369
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,180
networks and connections that we have

370
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,040
existing today but also block us from

371
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,320
connecting to one another fortunately

372
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,570
there's a thing called ice this is a

373
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,720
technique used by WebRTC to sort of

374
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,330
traverse that network translation issues

375
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,280
so around that it basically figures out

376
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,900
regardless of your network topology how

377
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,280
to make those browsers talk to one

378
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,400
another so if alice is at work browsing

379
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,280
online dating and Bob's at home or at a

380
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,320
coffee shop somewhere public let's say

381
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,060
Alice has a big firewall in place and

382
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,250
Bob's wide open Bob's going to try to

383
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,990
figure out okay how do I talk to Alice

384
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,670
he's not actually doing this is what's

385
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,840
happening sort of on the back end

386
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,850
through WebRTC in the browser but he's

387
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:12,960
going to use a thing called a stun

388
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,940
server and what the stun server does

389
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,590
it's got one role and it's essentially

390
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,090
just to say you know how do you look to

391
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,920
the public so when Bob wants to talk to

392
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,030
Alice first thing he's going to do is

393
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,410
send a little packet to the stun server

394
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,180
the stun server is going to say hey Bob

395
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,710
you're wide open here's your IP address

396
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,900
here's a port I can access you at you're

397
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,610
good to go buddy Bob's going to get that

398
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,840
little bit of information back he's

399
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,209
going to

400
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:33,040
send that over to alice alice is going

401
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,269
to receive it then she's going to say

402
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:35,619
okay well now how do i connect to Bob

403
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:37,720
well alice is at work right so there's a

404
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,399
big fire wall in place she can't really

405
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:41,319
be accessed publicly so she's going to

406
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:42,429
send a packet out to the stun server

407
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:44,110
they're gonna say well Alice I don't I

408
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:44,949
don't really know what you look like

409
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,749
you're behind a firewall I can't get

410
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:48,759
right at you so that's where this third

411
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:50,379
piece this turn server comes in that you

412
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:52,809
see here basically that's a way to relay

413
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:55,209
around nap so normally in an ideal world

414
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,339
and this is about eighty-six percent of

415
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:59,350
the time given statistics Bob and Alice

416
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,639
would both be open enough that they

417
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,929
could connect straight away so they both

418
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:03,399
get their IP addresses they both get

419
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,779
their ports they'd connect and

420
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:06,429
everything would be done we'd have that

421
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,019
peer to peer connection but given the

422
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:09,579
case of the firewall which is that odd

423
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:11,319
fourteen percent time where there is

424
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:12,779
something preventing that from happening

425
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,800
the turn server is going to come in and

426
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,439
basically act as a relay so alice is

427
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,579
going to send some information back to

428
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:20,079
Bob saying hey here's the turn server

429
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,189
this is how you're going to get access

430
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:23,410
to me Bob sent Alice the public IP and

431
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,720
port when Bob sends information over to

432
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,730
Alice it's actually going to go from Bob

433
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,709
to that turn server and then down to

434
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:31,540
Alice when Alice sends information to

435
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,249
Bob it's going to go straight across so

436
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:35,019
in an ideal world what we're hoping to

437
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:35,949
accomplish is you're going to have a

438
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:37,660
peer to peer connection where the data

439
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,730
goes directly across and both in both

440
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,420
both directions but in the case of you

441
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,160
know network issues or something like a

442
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,809
firewall you're going to reuse that

443
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:48,519
relay server that turn server is sort of

444
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,889
a backup so what this ends up giving you

445
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:53,799
is a hundred percent coverage or 99.9

446
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,119
I'm guessing it's probably some weird

447
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:56,589
scenario out there that won't work still

448
00:14:56,589 --> 00:14:58,660
but the the piece of takeaway from this

449
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,459
is through this technique known as ice

450
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:02,290
we have the capability to connect pretty

451
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,929
much everyone peer-to-peer so that small

452
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:06,009
percentage of the time you're going to

453
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:07,209
go through that relay server you're

454
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:08,379
still going to pay some bandwidth there

455
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:09,429
but the rest of the time you're

456
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:10,990
basically going directly across that

457
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,879
channel and hopefully saving a ton of

458
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,879
money on bandwidth so the complete

459
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:16,749
connection would look something like

460
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,699
this Bob and Alice would exchange

461
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:20,679
information ideally they'd share stuff

462
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,059
across that period if your channel in

463
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:24,429
non perfect worlds they'd share some

464
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:25,689
stuff through the turn server and the

465
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:29,019
rest would go across directly simple

466
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:30,369
right you guys ready to run out there

467
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:32,439
today spin up a couple servers configure

468
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:34,929
them learn all about the api's and start

469
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:37,209
playing with this stuff that's kind of

470
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:41,620
where we spoke comes in so resposta

471
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,970
bella purrs the ability to easily add

472
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,190
real-time communication

473
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:47,040
so their app the key being easy it's

474
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,530
sort of like WebRTC but we wrap

475
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,180
everything up for you guys so the turns

476
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,620
server the stun server all that

477
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,970
signaling process the whole connection

478
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,350
piece you don't have to worry about that

479
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,090
you can just focus on doing what you do

480
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,760
which is developing applications so if

481
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,440
you remember Bob and Alice the signaling

482
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,120
process is done server the turn server

483
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,040
with your spoke it looks something more

484
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,840
like this you connect out to respond

485
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,210
that whole handshaking process for you

486
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,070
figure out how to connect you up and

487
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,180
then all you have to worry about as a

488
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,520
dev is really creating the application

489
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,540
and how they're going to connect so

490
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,410
whether they're going to have a video

491
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,760
call or they're going to have an audio

492
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,110
call or they're going to share some data

493
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,420
back and forth that's really all you got

494
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,160
to worry about so we take care of kind

495
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,890
of the the harder bits for you good old

496
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,770
Billy banks my homie but wait there's

497
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,450
more there's a few features that we've

498
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,100
added to kind of round out the stack so

499
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,330
you might be wondering well ki could

500
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,670
still go and turn out those servers

501
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,950
myself what's the value here one it's

502
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,690
open source our javascript libraries are

503
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,130
at least that you can edit and add

504
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,780
features to yourself cross browser

505
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,760
supports so all of those nights prefixes

506
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,890
that we love and hate so much we're

507
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,630
taking care of those for you concepts

508
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,280
like endpoint discovery and this is kind

509
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,900
of a big one that's not taken care of by

510
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,850
WebRTC so how do you find people within

511
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,320
the network right how do you find people

512
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,060
within your application framework that

513
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,500
you want to talk to you that stuff

514
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,820
doesn't really exist natively in WebRTC

515
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,410
so you have to sort of bake it out

516
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,810
yourself we add capabilities and methods

517
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,939
to handle that stuff for you concepts

518
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,400
like groups messaging features so if you

519
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,870
want to send messages out to a group or

520
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,280
to a single individual we added those

521
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,990
capabilities as well things like

522
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,730
presence whether or not you're online

523
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,310
offline available we had capabilities

524
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,140
for that and a really cool one phone

525
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,569
system support so if you want to have

526
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:24,089
your mobile or web app talk out to the

527
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:25,770
traditional phone network so you wanted

528
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,910
to have a button on your site that

529
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:27,930
allows you to call up somebody else's

530
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,790
phone or vice versa you want to have a

531
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,980
phone call into your web app we added

532
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,420
that support as well and there's also

533
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,850
mobile SDKs WebRTC is currently not

534
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,580
supported in most if not almost all

535
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,490
mobile devices so we added the

536
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,260
capabilities to do those as native

537
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,760
applications and tie them into your

538
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,430
existing web apps all right let's get

539
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,010
down to the good stuff the code first

540
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,060
thing you want to do if you want to play

541
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,320
around with remote for a mark to set

542
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,640
over torr spoke that I oh and get a free

543
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,900
developer account start playing around

544
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,600
plug their getting connected to sort of

545
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,080
the first

546
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,490
and I'm going to actually switch this

547
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:09,000
out to show some code view here so

548
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,529
sublime text a little easier is that big

549
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:12,029
enough for everybody not sure we're

550
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:13,230
going to get everybody all the way in

551
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,750
the back but thumbs up thumbs down up

552
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,159
all right I see pretty far back there

553
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:21,179
sorry bud you're gonna have to come a

554
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:25,110
little closer um okay so getting started

555
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,029
with this how it all works it's just a

556
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:28,890
JavaScript library so you dumped in and

557
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,639
include and you're off and running

558
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:33,659
getting connected like I said it's kind

559
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:34,980
of the first part that whole signaling

560
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,029
portion we talked about exchanging

561
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:37,769
information how we connect two browsers

562
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:39,120
together that's going to happen during

563
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,100
this connection phase and to do that

564
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,809
you're going to have an app ID this is

565
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:44,700
kind of how you identify yourself within

566
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,220
their spokes and how you identify your

567
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,350
application it acts as a container of

568
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,570
sorts so anything that connects users

569
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,460
into that app ID is going to be sort of

570
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,440
your container for all your users so if

571
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,909
you guys all connected under this app ID

572
00:18:56,909 --> 00:18:58,139
here we'd be able to find each other

573
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:00,750
everybody in this room if we split half

574
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,250
of the room into one app ID and half on

575
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,899
the other it would split that the group

576
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:05,429
down so the half on the left wouldn't

577
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:06,990
know about the half on the right so your

578
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,669
app idea is basically your container for

579
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:11,370
your application there's concepts you'll

580
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,990
hear me to mention endpoints and peers

581
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,909
those are basically just users or

582
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:17,220
browsers so an endpoint is somebody that

583
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,980
you're trying to connect to so the first

584
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,299
step is creating an instance of the

585
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,549
client object to do that with respond

586
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:25,860
respond yet client we're going to pass

587
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,570
in that application ID and then there's

588
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,159
a key piece here called development mode

589
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:31,019
we're gonna set that to true basically

590
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:32,429
what this does is handle all the token

591
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:33,840
authentication for you so in a

592
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,159
production application like most

593
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:36,299
frameworks you're going to have to take

594
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,460
care of token off indication and

595
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,090
management of user privileges with

596
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,100
development mode we're just like leave

597
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,750
that wide open so you can just connect

598
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,549
in play with all the different AP is all

599
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:49,830
users have access to everything it makes

600
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,880
it a lot easier to get up and running

601
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,320
and start doing proof-of-concept work

602
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,700
once you're ready to go into production

603
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,049
you're going to have some simple stuff

604
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:56,870
you plug in using a node library maybe

605
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:01,350
to handle token authentication so once

606
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,820
we get that client object we can start

607
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,620
calling some listeners on it and calling

608
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,179
some methods the listener we're going to

609
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:07,830
add here is connect and that's basically

610
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,360
the event saying hey you're connected in

611
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,770
the framework start playing around your

612
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,100
video

613
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,419
calls are ready to rock your you're

614
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,429
ready to start going and then to

615
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:15,929
actually get connected we're going to

616
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:18,450
call client connect and pass through an

617
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,669
endpoint ID and in this case it would be

618
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:22,410
the idea that I wanted to connect us so

619
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,299
if i connect it in his Kyle I'd pass in

620
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,910
the username Kyle or an email address or

621
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,799
a grid however you store your users in

622
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,120
your database it's up to you as the dev

623
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,980
tough to pass that stuff through but the

624
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,510
endpoint ID'd the takeaway from that is

625
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,650
that's how you're going to find people

626
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,510
within the system so if I login is Kyle

627
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,850
you guys can look me up by Kyle so

628
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,140
that's going to connect us the kinect

629
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,309
event will fire off and we'll be ready

630
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:57,190
to roll jump back over here for a second

631
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,580
so yeah is it a little bit of glitch

632
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:07,830
here

633
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,100
alright so messaging given the time here

634
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,990
we're going to just look at the code for

635
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:19,270
this so messaging very simple you

636
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,919
connect up once you're connected you can

637
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:22,510
start accessing the methods available to

638
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,799
you in the framework so a messaging

639
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,150
would be I want to send a message to

640
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,590
another user this is an example of

641
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,900
point-to-point messaging so me to one

642
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,390
other person and to do that you would

643
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,640
call client listen for a message event

644
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,779
that's when you receive a message from

645
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:36,880
someone and you just get back an event

646
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,799
containing the message data and all that

647
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,630
is is a simple JSON object just

648
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,399
JavaScript object so you can access you

649
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:44,230
see here event message message that's

650
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,370
going to be the message value of what

651
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,860
you've received to send a message you're

652
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,380
going to first get the ID of the person

653
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,610
you want to talk to you so in this case

654
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,860
we're talking about remote ID and this

655
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,299
is just some jQuery I've used here to

656
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:58,990
access some inputs endpoint that's the

657
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,279
person you want to talk to you so we're

658
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,840
going to call client get endpoint

659
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,700
passing in the ID of the person we'd

660
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,230
like to talk to so in this case if it

661
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,940
was John I'd passing the idea of John

662
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,919
and once I have access to that end point

663
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:10,120
i can start communicating with that

664
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,399
person so I'm going to call n points n

665
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:15,580
message here with the object containing

666
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,169
a message property and the value of the

667
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,429
message I want to send to that person

668
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:20,289
and that's really it for sending

669
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:21,820
messages so you could get a simple chat

670
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,140
application going with that pretty

671
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,429
quickly so group messaging will actually

672
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,289
look at a quick demo on this one so if

673
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:30,669
anybody's following along out there if I

674
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:32,409
get a couple people to click on that

675
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:37,240
link the DN XV you see link there and

676
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,559
that should open up the group messaging

677
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:44,470
window you'll see here I've got not

678
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,909
connected to respond out connected to

679
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:47,020
the group so what's going to happen here

680
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,340
is I'm going to put in a user name i'm

681
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,220
just going to use kyle hit connect it's

682
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,240
going to call out to her spoke go

683
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,590
through that connections process that we

684
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,179
talked about and then it's actually

685
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:56,289
going to automatically join a group

686
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:58,210
called foo and we'll look at how we did

687
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,039
that in a second you can see I am typing

688
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:05,340
things that's an awesome message Rutgers

689
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,210
so you can see here it's just really

690
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,010
simple but it's sending messages out to

691
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,600
an entire group of people and the UI is

692
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,630
purposefully dumb it's meant to be just

693
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,840
for for showcasing here so to look at

694
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,200
the code for that it's very similar to

695
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,549
the code we had in the original except

696
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:21,760
we

697
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,520
some functionality to create a group so

698
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,540
we're going to listen for that connect

699
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,070
event again and when the kinect event

700
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,510
actually happens we're going to join

701
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,180
this group I passing a group ID and

702
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,100
there's on success in a non message

703
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,410
handler inside the group so on success

704
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm just going to store that group as a

705
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,160
variable on message I'm actually going

706
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,020
to pass the message out to that

707
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,580
unordered list that I'm showing in the

708
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,410
window there and then to send a message

709
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,540
to a group it's the same as sending your

710
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,770
message to a single person or an

711
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,300
endpoint which is called group Sun

712
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,620
message we pass through the value that

713
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,410
we want to send out so pretty simple

714
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,820
stuff there to send messaging to a group

715
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,530
you know 10 15 lines of code you can get

716
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,300
group messaging work for a chat type

717
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,000
application so to get into something a

718
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,300
little bit more interesting take a look

719
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,820
at video and pray to the demo gods that

720
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,100
this all works perfectly if somebody

721
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,810
could go ahead and just click on this

722
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,400
link that's falling along there and then

723
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,840
just give me a little hands up that

724
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,760
you're you're going to participate here

725
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:22,120
in the demo please all right if you just

726
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,110
let me know the name that you actually

727
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:28,360
logged in with Rob all lowercase ok so

728
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,860
I'm connecting in this Kyle you can see

729
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,820
there the whole connection process

730
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,440
happen and then i'm going to call out to

731
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,180
connect to rob so I'm just typing in

732
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:39,060
Rob's name here it's kind of tiny and

733
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,400
I'm going to hit call first thing you're

734
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,450
going to see happen here is this little

735
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,250
pop-up it's asking me to allow access to

736
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,690
my camera and microphone that's a

737
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,940
security feature once I click allow Rob

738
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,260
should see the same thing on his end

739
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,300
we'll see my video clicks in here and

740
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,210
now hopefully we're going to see Rob's

741
00:24:54,210 --> 00:25:00,860
nice hmm

742
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,650
so you're live on camera all right so

743
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,150
this is actually a hell of a lot simpler

744
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,560
than you might expect and this is kind

745
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,210
of the cool stuff with WebRTC use I'm

746
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,590
able to start up a video call using

747
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,600
nothing but a couple dibs gives some

748
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,650
simple jQuery and the remark library so

749
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:22,470
looking at this example here we've got a

750
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,210
couple new things here we did the whole

751
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,710
connection process and I'm not showing

752
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:28,260
that here just keep the code simple but

753
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,520
you've got this div / remote video

754
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,990
source in the Dib for the local video

755
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,790
source if we jump back here there's your

756
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:36,480
remote there's your local once we get

757
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,310
past that we've got some call options

758
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,870
here and this is just an object that

759
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,940
passes through constraints constraints

760
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,560
are basically what I want to allow

761
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,500
access to so I as the developer or I as

762
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,750
the user so if you wanted to add you

763
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,820
know some sort of a UI feature that

764
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,020
allowed users to turn off the microphone

765
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,670
or to turn off their web camera and

766
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,720
choose which one they wanted to share

767
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,490
out this is where you would update those

768
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,710
properties so in this case i'm sharing

769
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,360
out audio and video meaning we're going

770
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,060
to go share everything and have a full

771
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,160
video call with Rob then we've got

772
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,140
methods here for on local media which is

773
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,270
when my video becomes available and on

774
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,070
connect which is when Rob's video became

775
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,110
available so these handler methods here

776
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,760
basically say you know what I want to do

777
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,980
when that becomes available to me what

778
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,000
you're going to get back in that event

779
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,010
is actually a video element so we hand

780
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,200
that back we wrap up the the binary

781
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,000
stream or the raw stream of video data

782
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,160
in a video element pass it back to you

783
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,300
and then all you have to do is attach it

784
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,160
to a dip and I did that by calling this

785
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,870
set video method and all this really

786
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,130
does is take the dip that I want to

787
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,050
attach the stream 2 and then passes out

788
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,220
the element so you can see here I'm

789
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,440
calling event element that's going to be

790
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,820
the actual video element that's getting

791
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,010
returned and local video source was the

792
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,800
damn that I wanted to access so then

793
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,930
we're listening for a call event this is

794
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,250
what's going to listen for when an

795
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,280
incoming call is happening so here you

796
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,870
can see I'm calling active call equals

797
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,310
event call that's going to be the call

798
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,110
object that's gets passed back from that

799
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,400
call and that's how you interact with

800
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,190
things like video calls or audio calls

801
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,270
and then when doing a simple check here

802
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,890
for active call caller that's going to

803
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,240
say whether or not I'm the one that

804
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,560
initiated this call I don't want to

805
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,300
answer myself obviously so this little

806
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,400
check here takes care of that and then

807
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,020
to answer a call we're going to SiC an

808
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,340
active called out answer so when I

809
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,260
placed a call to rob his browser checked

810
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:13,830
for this he says

811
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,210
okay I'm not the guy that made this call

812
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,740
I'm going to call active called out

813
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,029
answer and pass through those call

814
00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:20,640
options that we supplied and then he's

815
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,990
going to accident add a listener for a

816
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,029
hang-up event hang-up is basically when

817
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:26,519
any disconnect occurs and to actually

818
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,289
make the call happen we're going to get

819
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:29,610
access to that end point the same way we

820
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,500
did for messaging by calling client get

821
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,210
endpoint passing through the recipient

822
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,679
idea of the person we want to talk to so

823
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:36,720
Rob in this case once I have access to

824
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,279
that end point i'm going to call start

825
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,169
video call on and pass through those

826
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:42,299
call options so as the person initiating

827
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,070
the call all i have to do to kick things

828
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,380
off is call endpoint start video call

829
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,149
pass through those few options which was

830
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:50,279
just a simple JavaScript object and then

831
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,559
wait for the call to come back and from

832
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,909
there here's my set video method I

833
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:55,350
mention all I'm doing is using just

834
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,970
straight-up JavaScript you in document

835
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,070
document by ID clearing out anything

836
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,330
that's already existing and appending

837
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,799
the video element that I pass through I

838
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,269
got back from the event and that's

839
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:04,470
really all there is to start a video

840
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:07,289
call you know we're looking at 55 lines

841
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:09,570
of code here with some some fluff for

842
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:12,480
the jquery stuff and the UI so pretty

843
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,760
simple yeah so we'll go ahead and kill

844
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,539
this one so you're up and we'll look at

845
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,460
something very similar which is screen

846
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,380
sharing this actually functions almost

847
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,149
exactly the same I'm going to pick on

848
00:28:27,149 --> 00:28:28,710
Rob and ask for his help again you don't

849
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:33,299
mind following along there I'm going to

850
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:34,799
hit connect connect up the same way we

851
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,899
hit in the other examples and then once

852
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:38,429
I get the thumbs-up from Rob that he's

853
00:28:38,429 --> 00:28:40,440
connected I'm going to go ahead and call

854
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,789
it to rob only this time instead of

855
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:43,980
sharing my web camera is the video

856
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,970
stream source it's going to actually

857
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:48,210
take capture of my desktop so you're

858
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,320
going to see here this little pop-up

859
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,720
this is very familiar to anybody that's

860
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,130
used screen sharing and Google Hangouts

861
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,649
it's the exact same UI I can choose

862
00:28:55,649 --> 00:28:57,210
which screen i want to share out so if i

863
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,799
want to share my whole screen or maybe

864
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:04,320
just sublime text i'm going to hit share

865
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,000
and it's going to bump me over to the

866
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,370
app that i shared out and then you can

867
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,470
see here this is actually my screen

868
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,669
being shared out and Rob should be

869
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:13,649
seeing the same thing on his end sounds

870
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:14,700
interesting for the rest of you out in

871
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,019
the audience I'm sorry this is a one to

872
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:19,169
one screen sharing demo but the screen

873
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:20,460
should share out he should be able to

874
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,220
see any updates on making on my side and

875
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,440
I'm hoping for a thumbs up rub

876
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,370
want want demo problems is there any

877
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:38,210
sort of allow that came up or anything

878
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,509
so what should happen when the demo

879
00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:42,129
works properly is that Rob should shade

880
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:44,289
of screen so we'll just push past that

881
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:46,750
it's probably a simple fix of something

882
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,309
with the security going on there but I

883
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:50,169
want to show you guys the code that's

884
00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:53,889
the the more interesting part of this ok

885
00:29:53,889 --> 00:29:55,330
so again we've got a video element for

886
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,620
local we've got a video element for

887
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,259
remote similar stuff that we did in the

888
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:01,779
video screen example of the video

889
00:30:01,779 --> 00:30:03,279
sharing example the only main difference

890
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,779
here is that we've got to install small

891
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:07,570
plugging this is sort of a polyfill for

892
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,190
Chrome right now and tell screen sharing

893
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,720
gets rolled into the new release of

894
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,909
chrome once that happens you won't have

895
00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:14,350
to do this plugin mess anymore I

896
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,029
mentioned this stuff doesn't require

897
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:17,470
plugins the only time it required

898
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,639
plugins is when you're on the bleeding

899
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:20,259
edge and the features haven't been fully

900
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:22,389
rolled out into the browser yet so this

901
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:24,549
code here is basically handling a check

902
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:25,809
to say hey do they have the chrome

903
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:28,450
extension yet if not we're going to go

904
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,159
ahead and let them install it luckily

905
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,750
it's an inline installation meaning they

906
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,039
don't have to leave your page they don't

907
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,120
have to go out to another website to

908
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,740
download the plugin we can download it

909
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,230
all right in that one page so it's

910
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,909
actually go out find the plugin for me

911
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:41,830
install it for the user if they don't

912
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,659
have it give me a notification it's

913
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:44,889
already rock and then we're going to

914
00:30:44,889 --> 00:30:47,559
move on so once this extension excel

915
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:50,080
success happens or if I already have the

916
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,519
extension which was my case which is why

917
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:53,080
you did not see any sort of installation

918
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,000
process happening and probably stop

919
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,509
sharing my screen too we're going to get

920
00:30:58,509 --> 00:30:59,620
into the start screen share portion

921
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,450
which is the same thing we saw our video

922
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,889
sharing so I'm going to get access to

923
00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:04,360
that client endpoint and try to talk to

924
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,279
rob here I'm going to get access to the

925
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:07,899
local in the video element and then i'm

926
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,580
going to call endpoint start screen

927
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,559
share passing in the video element here

928
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:12,759
this is a little bit different than the

929
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:14,110
video example in that I'm actually just

930
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,820
going to pass the local and remote video

931
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,299
elements objects into the the method

932
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:20,649
here and they're actually going to

933
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:21,970
attach the video for me automatically

934
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,620
this is just sort of a helper feature

935
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,700
that was built in as part of the

936
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,049
framework so you have options and how

937
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:27,279
you actually connect things out

938
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,080
depending on how you want to interact

939
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,360
with that with that code so if you need

940
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,070
more more access do you want to do some

941
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,529
some more UI updates in between you can

942
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:37,000
get that actual element back and edit it

943
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,230
yourself if you want it just to

944
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,700
automatically connect to a div and start

945
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,330
screening you

946
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,279
do it this way as well but basically to

947
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:43,419
start a screen share it's the same way

948
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:44,860
you just call endpoint start screen

949
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,539
share instead of endpoint start video

950
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:49,299
call you get the same thing back you get

951
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:51,159
a video element return and it's just

952
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,870
going to use your your screen as the

953
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,510
source of sharing or screen video

954
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,659
streaming as opposed to your webcam and

955
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:59,470
then there's a handling method here at

956
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,870
the bottom for if the extension fails to

957
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:07,480
install properly so that's screen

958
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,730
sharing docks and additional examples

959
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,409
there's more stuff up on Doc's Tetris

960
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:12,820
poke that I owe you can check out kind

961
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,080
of how all this stuff functions and play

962
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,720
around with it so to kind of wrap up a

963
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,799
little bit i mean what's all this stuff

964
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:19,929
mean what's the point of WebRTC why is

965
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:22,919
it valuable why should you guys care a

966
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:25,149
framework lycra spoke ads faster

967
00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:26,440
development so there's kind of a key

968
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,690
takeaway there it's better user

969
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,399
experience this is a really big one for

970
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,320
me I like to harp on this this one

971
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,419
specific point how many people in this

972
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,860
room have gone to a website in the last

973
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,510
couple months where they've been logged

974
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,850
in people on the website they know who

975
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,679
you are your session identifies you your

976
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,269
account information maybe you're on your

977
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:44,950
cell phone site or trying to pay a bill

978
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,899
for utility or something they know

979
00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:48,340
everything about you basically they know

980
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,539
the page you're looking at it's all

981
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:51,220
there in the session but then when you

982
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,870
need help you have to go dig up an 800

983
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,190
number somewhere buried on their site

984
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,389
that they don't want you to find you

985
00:32:55,389 --> 00:32:56,860
have to dial that number and you have to

986
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,149
enter your account information and

987
00:32:58,149 --> 00:32:59,289
probably some other personal

988
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:01,059
identification stuff to your security

989
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:02,620
then you get somebody on the phone if

990
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,419
you're lucky who then asks you for your

991
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:06,010
account information and your mother's

992
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,299
maiden name and all this identifying

993
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:09,279
info all over again we've all been

994
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,080
through that process it's painful it's

995
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,090
usually ends up and getting hung up on a

996
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,919
few times it takes an hour to get any

997
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:17,110
kind of information you might want I'd

998
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,700
like to propose that as developers we

999
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,980
kind of have the power to change that

1000
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,539
given these tools in that same scenario

1001
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:24,279
there could simply be a button on the

1002
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:26,320
website that says click to call write or

1003
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,590
just call so you click the button it

1004
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,600
pops up a video chat you take all that

1005
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,950
session information that we already have

1006
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,200
access to through J us wrap it up in a

1007
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,059
simple j/s object and pass it across

1008
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:38,139
that channel to the support

1009
00:33:38,139 --> 00:33:39,970
representative on the other end you can

1010
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:42,340
decrypt that information put it into a

1011
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,919
UI and give all the info access to that

1012
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:46,240
support rep that they need so they know

1013
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,860
who they're talking to they know what

1014
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,750
account information you have they know

1015
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,549
what page you're looking at and they can

1016
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:52,649
more readily help you with your problem

1017
00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:54,050
so I just

1018
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,010
like to challenge you guys to start

1019
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,390
thinking about things in new ways I mean

1020
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,650
we haven't really had access to things

1021
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,150
like the microphone the camera and

1022
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,100
streaming media in JavaScript until

1023
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,980
recently and we just we have a chance to

1024
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,980
change the way things work with that so

1025
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,510
happy boss's yeah you build some cool

1026
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,800
app makes you guys a million dollars

1027
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,390
they're going to be pretty stoked but

1028
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,890
happy users it's kind of the bigger take

1029
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:15,290
away from me you know we have a chance

1030
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,760
to connect people you look at be my eyes

1031
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,770
you look at speaking exchange right

1032
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,030
there's a really a chance to you to

1033
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,140
change lives with the code you're

1034
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,910
creating and these tools are going to

1035
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:25,250
give you a chance to do that so the

1036
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:25,940
thing I'd like to leave you with

1037
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,920
communication should be a feature not a

1038
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,990
product I'd like to again challenge you

1039
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,490
to think about how communications could

1040
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:33,110
be built into your app instead of asking

1041
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,940
your users to go and open up skype or go

1042
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,440
jump over to Google hangout so we can

1043
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,660
have a call if you're on a remote team

1044
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,429
this is hugely important i mentioned

1045
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:41,600
that Apollo app that we built internally

1046
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,280
to use that was part of the driver for

1047
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,320
it is we wanted communications to happen

1048
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,820
in a seamless fashion and we wanted

1049
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,110
multiple ways to do it in very specific

1050
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,300
use cases so we built that tool out

1051
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,040
another thing I played around with as a

1052
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,420
demo is a technical interview

1053
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,860
application I'll give you a white

1054
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,480
boarding and code challenges and screen

1055
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,220
sharing all live over a video with a

1056
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,350
video chat in the background you know

1057
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,880
it's all stuff you can build so if you

1058
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,220
see use cases out there I mean there's

1059
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,750
ton of nails this is kind of the new

1060
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,790
hammer right so look at ways that you

1061
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,530
can start building communications into

1062
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,060
your applications as features rather

1063
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,000
than creating separate products for

1064
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,380
that's it for me again my name is Kyle

1065
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,750
tyack Kate I ever spoke do you can catch

1066
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,700
me on the twitters at geek gone nomad

1067
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,110
and if you guys want to play around with

1068
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,570
this stuff we spoke that IO are the

1069
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,770
holes example and source is all

1070
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,300
available to at that github URL at the

1071
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,070
bottom if you can't read it feel free to

1072
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,470
come up and I'll open it up to questions

1073
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:33,950
if we have time if not no questions no

1074
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:36,140
questions all right well then just find

1075
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,430
me afterwards I also brought a bunch of

1076
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,900
koozies for you guys if anybody wants a

1077
