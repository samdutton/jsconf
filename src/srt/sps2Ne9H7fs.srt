1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,240

how was everybody's morning yeah Judy

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,219
does anybody need a stretch before we

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,349
start ok cool so my name is Serena I am

4
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,750
some people know me as era either way

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,460
whichever works for you i'm a developer

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,950
in all things javascript and you can

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,529
find me on their interwebs by the

8
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,340
following handles of things alright and

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,599
today i would like to talk about

10
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,880
building interactive and p.m.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,140
command-line modules all the things and

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:49,650
let's move on so i want to talk about

13
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,440
some of the things that you know said

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,340
said some groundwork the command line

15
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,710
modules i right are a note and that's

16
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,360
basically what I'll be talking about but

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,100
obviously whatever I talk about doesn't

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,229
have to be specifically a node it could

19
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:05,579
be written in shell it could be applied

20
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:07,259
to shell scripts it could be a prior to

21
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:11,130
rubygems Python scripts and I will be

22
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,829
referring to the command line modules as

23
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:15,509
CLE modules for the rest of the

24
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,719
presentation and I like writing mine in

25
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,850
node because I can basically can do the

26
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,039
same thing in any other possible

27
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:26,539
language basically because of the

28
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:29,700
JavaScript community which is wonderful

29
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,729
to work with and there are just so many

30
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:35,520
tools available that I can plug in into

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,130
whatever i'm writing and i don't have to

32
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,259
rewrite them again and they're basically

33
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,399
built for my convenience and delight and

34
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:47,789
somebody's got no somebody's it's nice

35
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,409
to get by with a little help of your

36
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,209
friends basically the Beatles set it

37
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:54,869
right or it's nice to get by with a

38
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:56,219
little help of the tools that are

39
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:02,189
available to me all right so what's a

40
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,020
command line module because some people

41
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,539
might not know what that is essentially

42
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:09,349
it's a program that you interact with

43
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:11,640
inside your terminal or your command

44
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,370
line or command prompt the ones you're

45
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,149
most likely available are

46
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,470
mcdeere make directory it's actually a

47
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,709
command-line module that's built into

48
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:31,500
unix another one get in it also one that

49
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,440
you would work with that work the dip

50
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:46,500
and another one npm in it

51
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,650
um kind of three that you're familiar

52
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:56,860
with more or less so programming is very

53
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,780
similar to art for me and creative

54
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,090
process that requires you making

55
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,090
creative things building things with

56
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,500
your hands make making making art but

57
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,590
making it through a program and to make

58
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,859
a successful art piece we often must

59
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:19,120
play place limitations on ourselves to

60
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,640
actually get creative and otherwise

61
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,769
we're just stuck in like this paradox of

62
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:26,560
choice and 179 options of salad dressing

63
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,099
that Barry Schwartz talked about in his

64
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:32,680
stuck talk being kind of paralyzed by

65
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,859
choice and so we kind of sit there and

66
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:38,109
it's like what I have so many options

67
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:40,180
when I build my tool and what do I do

68
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,040
with myself and like how do I approach

69
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,569
this problem when there's no 179 ways of

70
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:51,160
solving it so when we're faced with the

71
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,709
task to do on the website of things of

72
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:56,889
our projects the sheer possibility kind

73
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:59,310
of becomes really limiting and really

74
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,049
stressful which is why it's so

75
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:04,900
interesting to work with command line

76
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,239
interface because you're limited to just

77
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:09,760
working with the command line and you're

78
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,650
limited to just one screen and you were

79
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,269
limited to colors and you're unable to

80
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:16,299
kind of work with any of the fancy

81
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,239
things that the web provides for you and

82
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,280
it's kind of refreshing and it gets you

83
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,470
to be to solve problems in the very

84
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,030
creative ways I think and given that you

85
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,860
are in a command line you can you can do

86
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,389
a bunch of different things with the

87
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:33,039
tools that you already have built in

88
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,110
within your applications at work or side

89
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,580
projects that you're working on so how

90
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,310
can we accomplish this on the command

91
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,159
line and keep that same awesome user

92
00:04:45,159 --> 00:05:02,550
experience and I think this kind of

93
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,900
this google hang up so have they told

94
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,790
you about how we hook this up I should

95
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,500
tell me about how we hook this up we'll

96
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,020
take a pause so this computer is hooked

97
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,470
up to this project to this monitor that

98
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,320
I have my speaker notes on and then I am

99
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,310
google hangout in my presentation to

100
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,470
that computer and that computer now

101
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,180
projects it to the screen which is why

102
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,730
there is a lag don't you love the love

103
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:35,260
love Linux machines okay so um adesso

104
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,240
and as i was saying and awesome thing

105
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,639
for me to kind of accomplish that user

106
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,550
experience is to be able to do one thing

107
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,000
and one thing well as the unix sensei's

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,760
have mentioned before and you know it's

109
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,830
kind of that minimalist approach to

110
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,389
solving problems so basically the UNIX

111
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,490
philosophy and that's kind of the

112
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,210
solution to working with building those

113
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,800
interactive and user-friendly

114
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,370
command-line experiences and being able

115
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,260
to work with those same constraints that

116
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,030
the command line provides for you in

117
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,530
india of working with a browser so the

118
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:18,039
key here is actually the UNIX design

119
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:19,930
patterns that we may have done in school

120
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,590
or we may have never done in school or

121
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,419
we may have heard of or we may not have

122
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:28,750
heard of so I think to dive into this a

123
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,400
bit more will actually give us a little

124
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,560
bit a little bit more perspective it's

125
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,970
kind of there's there's maybe 10 or

126
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,860
eight to eight to ten different kind of

127
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,169
patterns you can implement when you work

128
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:47,169
with the unix-like command line I'm

129
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:49,300
going to talk about four that are sort

130
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,070
of the ones i've used quite frequently

131
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,800
that's filter cantrip source and ed

132
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,940
pattern and they're kind of you've used

133
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,039
them before in terms of you might have

134
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,919
used a tool that uses that or you might

135
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:14,840
have implemented it yourself I still

136
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,200
so filter is pretty awesome that's kind

137
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,620
of like a grep all it takes is it takes

138
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,380
an input and the greps or filter stuff

139
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,230
out of that input and gives you an

140
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:31,030
output another kind of thing is sort or

141
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,700
TR on the command line that you would

142
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,370
use with the Linux then kind of you pass

143
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,080
it in the argument you tell it where to

144
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,310
look for just like the usual grep works

145
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,490
and a way that I've done it before is I

146
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,580
built this this was my first command

147
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,180
line module and all it did was if the

148
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,980
dick was going to work all I did is it

149
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,590
took it took a string and just I would

150
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:05,150
put it a picture of actually output it I

151
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,840
would put it I'm not that slow of a

152
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:23,740
typewriter oh come on close the string

153
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,780
okay I would put it and fixture hahahaha

154
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,930
so this is like the very first kind of

155
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,360
module to work with and all it took is a

156
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,340
string and an argument to make the

157
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,710
wombat yellow and it outputted that

158
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,050
argument so kind of like that that

159
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,390
filter function takes an outfit modifies

160
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,270
and outputs it back and there are

161
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,920
obviously like way more complicated ways

162
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,820
that you can do this source is kind of a

163
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,900
similar it's a filter like function PS

164
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,710
is is a similar one so it's basically

165
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,870
takes no input and the output is based

166
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,150
on the startup condition or the current

167
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,190
conditions that you have so PS kind of

168
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,890
looks at whatever is happening right now

169
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:13,120
and that's kind of it or I guess another

170
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,530
example you could say is that when

171
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,690
you're dealing with node you could be

172
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,100
looking at the current directory and

173
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,050
saying like what's happening there and

174
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,270
then dealing with that as you pipe it to

175
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,280
a different kind of

176
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,610
unix pattern that you want to work with

177
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:38,720
can drip is is oh well canter okay so

178
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,350
may make directory is is a type of can

179
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,750
trip so what this does is it basically

180
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,470
it takes no arguments and all it does is

181
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,240
create something based on whatever

182
00:09:53,240 --> 00:10:06,160
arguments you do and okay

183
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:10,880
hurry and then another example oh my god

184
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,670
I'm really sorry but okay and another

185
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,370
one that I've done was it takes so

186
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,589
basically takes one takes an argument

187
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:23,420
and does something based on whatever

188
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,060
your functions described I was recently

189
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,320
working with I was recently in Lebanon

190
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,470
to work on a data visualization project

191
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,370
for one of the human rights

192
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,130
organizations and I needed to write a

193
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,110
scraper that would basically take all of

194
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,870
their information in and I chose to make

195
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,420
it into your command line module and my

196
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,940
little contra bala did is told my

197
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,839
program to scan and it would scan the

198
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:54,079
particular page or scrape the particular

199
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,529
page that I need it and then it's not

200
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:59,360
very pure in terms of what the function

201
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,920
did and then it put it into the JSON

202
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,570
according to like the UNIX philosophies

203
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,399
technically you try to keep you out but

204
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,050
as pure as possible so turning it into

205
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:13,040
disans not very UNIX philosophy in terms

206
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,199
of that but basically just kind of use

207
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:20,180
give it one kind of input and then it

208
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,260
deals with the output on its own okay I

209
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,750
think we need a one bad break

210
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:32,340
if we can get the diff to work that is

211
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:44,280
we can't that's okay

212
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,600
and if i can get this site to change on

213
00:11:46,600 --> 00:12:07,120
52

214
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:15,800
Wow okay no this is okay so the next

215
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,450
one's kind of the ED pattern sorry but

216
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,470
the lack of wombats so basically what a

217
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,520
ed does it takes a file and modifies the

218
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,310
output file so I was I'm working on

219
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,210
something called a command line texting

220
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,070
module so basically allows a user to

221
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,100
text within the command line and one of

222
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,560
the aspects of that project is for the

223
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,500
user to be able to set up their own

224
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,360
config files these are like totally

225
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,120
arbitrary numbers I'm putting in but the

226
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,920
idea is for the user to be able to add

227
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,150
their kind of information and then for

228
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,780
me to write that file and most of the

229
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,700
times the file already exists so we're

230
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,220
modifying that particular file and I'll

231
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,770
give an example a little later as I go

232
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:15,020
through the actual code so given those

233
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,110
particular patterns that we talked about

234
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,330
what might be the general guidelines for

235
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,240
writing interactive clays I think that's

236
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,980
I know what we want to talk about and as

237
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,930
I've been working with some of them over

238
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,640
the past couple of months I kind of came

239
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,030
up with a little list that I like to use

240
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:38,030
when I start on a new project I try to

241
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,180
work with giving options to users I

242
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,400
think it's super important to be able to

243
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,350
give a user as to what they want to

244
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,770
modify and how they want to work with a

245
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,870
particular with your program whether

246
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,290
it's commands or arguments and they

247
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:58,220
would be able to specify if you never

248
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,560
know whether users used your program

249
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,890
before if they've ever used command-line

250
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,870
modules before so they might not know

251
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,910
the particular patterns of guitar in PM

252
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,890
use which are very similar kind of

253
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,560
verbose options help I mean you don't

254
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,200
have to reinvent the wheel there's a

255
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,820
bunch of them that already parse the

256
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,310
options for you that you will be able to

257
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,020
kind of work with and

258
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,590
set them up and there is a real life

259
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:30,950
example of very tiny and very dark that

260
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,350
I worked with before to set up the

261
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,690
command line texting module so basically

262
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,950
i have i have three commands that the

263
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:44,270
modules the module uses one start one is

264
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:47,450
config and one is add and two of them

265
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,490
kind of have their options so if a user

266
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:53,360
goes to start the conversation they can

267
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,730
add different options of who they want

268
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,830
to start the conversation with so that's

269
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,480
the option with to the command start or

270
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,790
if they're just going through config I

271
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,470
work with the config option and then

272
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,260
parse that option later on and I used

273
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,810
yards but I mean they're all kind of the

274
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,630
same in that regard mainly yards because

275
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,030
their documentation Xin pirate speak so

276
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:22,640
that's kind of cool I like to set up

277
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,080
some defaults for argument parsing

278
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,480
because that's that's really neat and

279
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,030
sometimes with especially config files

280
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,830
you kind of sometimes you set those up

281
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,840
already Andy the user doesn't have to

282
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,890
modify them afterwards so I sometimes

283
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,600
would set that up already and I don't

284
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,700
have to worry about it and it's nice and

285
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,180
neat in terms of that super important

286
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:51,680
one is

287
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,790
log your errors it's it's really it's

288
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,600
really really crucial because program

289
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,920
could be terminated the user doesn't

290
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,600
know what happens and then it just kind

291
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,720
of works like that and the program

292
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,640
explodes so it's really important to

293
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,000
kind of walk your user user through even

294
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,880
if it's with errors or just without

295
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,490
errors again you never know if the users

296
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,590
used your program before or so used a

297
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,360
command line program before in general

298
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,580
and just kind of taking them by the hand

299
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,980
and saying okay we're going to do this

300
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,780
now and we're going to do this now just

301
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,340
like you would in the browser you would

302
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,110
in the command line it's enough

303
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,350
exploding in the face so we talked about

304
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,710
for kind of different unix design

305
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,650
patterns and kind of combining them

306
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,530
together is pretty neat because then you

307
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,390
are able to kind of work with different

308
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,550
concepts and actually progress your

309
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:50,440
program a little further so I think that

310
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,570
kind of increases the possibilities of

311
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,510
different things you could do so the

312
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,330
possibilities are pretty much endless at

313
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:03,010
that point so with the fact that you can

314
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,449
pretty much build anything work with

315
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:06,280
your existing API and get your

316
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,260
co-workers to handle certain things via

317
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,280
the command line module you could build

318
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,650
a node module that has a command line

319
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,930
extension so for example you're just

320
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,579
building some sort of abstraction and

321
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:24,790
you know your your program is just

322
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,589
supposed to use that but what if you

323
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,420
abstract certain things out and just

324
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,760
write some option parsing and then you

325
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,570
are able to make it a command line

326
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,080
extension and a cron job because I mean

327
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,350
you could write shell scripts but I mean

328
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,610
notes so much more fun and it's

329
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,920
asynchronous so why not write in a note

330
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,160
and then just make it a cron job and I

331
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,660
mean you can build all three together

332
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,310
and that's kind of fun to use tools I

333
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,140
think that's pretty important because

334
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,960
note has so many awesome tools you could

335
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,680
use there is FS everybody or so many

336
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,970
people use FSI

337
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,830
to be able to get things done to write a

338
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,710
file read a file and things like that

339
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,270
and then again we can pipe it to the

340
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,160
existing patterns we've already built

341
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,830
out and if the tools are there for you

342
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,480
you might as well use them already I'm

343
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,850
exploit the tools you have like doing

344
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:33,250
your laundry and stuff that was a long

345
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,400
back brake and the one of the one of the

346
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,340
kind of really important things is

347
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,880
building your tools with empathy it's

348
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,640
not everybody who uses the product that

349
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,660
you've built out has a mac for example

350
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,520
so testing on different machines is

351
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,250
super important as a linux user that

352
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,360
sometimes i get left out not everybody's

353
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,130
used a command-line product before it's

354
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,870
really important to be able to kind of

355
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,520
again guide them through the

356
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,440
presentation what would you do if you

357
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,460
were in their shoes and you know being

358
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,120
able to kind of work even if it's just

359
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,040
built out for your co-workers and not

360
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,500
for the open source community in general

361
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,710
you should still be able to kind of

362
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,660
build it out so it's not just for your

363
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,220
own use and you kind of look remember

364
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,320
and if you think about it if you open up

365
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,670
whatever you've written three or four

366
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,400
months ago you will need not necessarily

367
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,800
remember which kind of options you've

368
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,960
set out to your program to have if they

369
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,690
weren't verbose and it just said m and

370
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:45,160
am i doing for time I thought I kind of

371
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,870
rushed through this but I now that I

372
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,400
have a little bit more time I can show

373
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,720
you one of the projects that I'm working

374
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,510
on right now which hopefully i can with

375
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:58,390
a screen casting thing on I worked with

376
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,450
the three so on line 13 it was number

377
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,480
one that started with start and what

378
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,550
that would do is just start a server for

379
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,560
the text messaging to go through and and

380
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,590
26 would set up the config which you can

381
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,340
probably barely see

382
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,289
and then that would kind of launch my

383
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:20,960
the prototype that I have for the config

384
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,510
file and work through the particular

385
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:28,220
arguments of the user parses and add

386
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,330
would add a particular user to the to

387
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,130
their already existing config file if

388
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,220
you wanted to text with other people I

389
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,779
don't think I can zoom in so i won't go

390
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,850
into into too much detail because that's

391
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,140
probably just really painful on the eye

392
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,610
I'll end it here sorry about the

393
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:49,429
technical difficulties I think thank you

394
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:51,140
so much for having me this was a

395
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,970
pleasure and again sorry for the
