1
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,550

you

2
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,050
hello Berlin it's good to see you guys

3
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,910
it's good to be here

4
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,890
I'd like to start with a huge thanks to

5
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,290
the conference organizers for this like

6
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,330
beautiful event and really nice space

7
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,280
that I'm speaking in today and

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,860
especially to Yann over there who lunged

9
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,350
me to apply to speak at this because I

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,390
probably wouldn't have otherwise and I

11
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,070
also wouldn't be experiencing this

12
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,080
really warm and friendly community that

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,620
you all are it's really lovely

14
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,580
secondly I've got quite a lot of

15
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,110
material to run through so I don't think

16
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,629
we'll have time for Q&A and even if we

17
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:58,220
did I realized that I'm one of the last

18
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,410
things that's standing between you and a

19
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,780
cold beer so I'll be standing or had a

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,089
parent at the stage at 7:00 p.m. after

21
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:06,890
the final talk is done if you want to

22
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,970
come up and say hi right so my name is

23
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,940
Hannah Donovan or at hand on the

24
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,230
internet that's another way you can ask

25
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,810
me questions and I'm based in London

26
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,020
where everybody looks like this

27
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,470
obviously and I'm what I call a full

28
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,119
stack designer so I do everything from

29
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:31,180
like UX and user research through to

30
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,560
interactions and interfaces and then

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,869
like graphic design and icons and some

32
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:38,810
CSS that kind of thing and I combine all

33
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,799
of these skills together daily to make

34
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,689
products and I mainly make products in

35
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:47,299
the digital music space so you may know

36
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:50,060
me from some serious things like last.fm

37
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,520
where I helped shape the product early

38
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,649
on and led design there or you may know

39
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:57,619
me from some not so serious things like

40
00:01:57,619 --> 00:01:59,780
drinketh I this was sort of an

41
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,509
accidental hack day success if you

42
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:05,000
haven't tried it out be careful it might

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,950
kill you with the quantities and lastly

44
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,950
my current project this is my jam where

45
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,500
I'm co-founder and design director so if

46
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,880
you don't know about this is my jam it's

47
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,160
a place to put your favorite song right

48
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,470
now and it's not just any song it's like

49
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,330
the song that you can't get out of your

50
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,560
head right now the one that you've got

51
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,140
on repeat on your phone and you only get

52
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,670
one you can put it on your profile and

53
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,200
you can sort of change up your profile

54
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,120
it customize it to really tell the world

55
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,860
how you feel about this particular piece

56
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,920
of music and what you get is a playlist

57
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,640
of

58
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,370
songs from your friends and it's sort of

59
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,650
like this ever-changing hand-picked

60
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,720
radio station by people whose music

61
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,300
tastes you trust and it's a slow music

62
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,550
service we don't really encourage you to

63
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,500
post that often which is kind of an

64
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,010
unusual thing I suppose we focus on the

65
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,959
quality rather than the quantity of the

66
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,790
posting but despite all that we just

67
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,070
recently had 1.3 million jams posted

68
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,410
which is pretty cool so I'm excited to

69
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,350
share that with you music and design are

70
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:13,400
my passion and my life's work other

71
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,660
highly important things that you might

72
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,340
want to know about me I recently

73
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,070
purchased a reindeer pelt I'm not joking

74
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,019
it's the softest thing that I've ever

75
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:23,480
touched and I wrote most of this talk

76
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,450
sitting on it I play orchestra with a

77
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,980
real Orchestra here we play music like

78
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,410
that we rehearse in spaces that look

79
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,500
like that and I also play with a comedy

80
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,150
orchestra which plays music like that

81
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,760
and our rehearsal spaces look like this

82
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,620
and my favorite film is Monsters Inc I'm

83
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,650
about six years old up here so just keep

84
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,600

whatever I'm mostly going to be talking

95
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,610
about feels yeah let's just get this out

96
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,810
right away at the beginning of this

97
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,190
presentation so if you want to like run

00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,070
for the door now is your chance okay in

99
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,820
2011 I quit my job at last.fm and I was

100
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,949
sort of clinging to what was left of my

101
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:28,600
ability to make things which at the time

102
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,500
was not a whole hell of a lot okay and

103
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,090
since then I've been working on this as

104
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,270
a design problem as makers burnout is

105
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,430
something that we all face it's not a

106
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,080
very nice thing it might be big it might

107
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,740
be small

108
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,039
mine was mine was pretty big yeah and

109
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:46,750
that's the story that I'm going to tell

110
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,060
you about today so let's get started

111
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,020
all right well back up to 1999 so I went

112
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,729
to design school it's kind of like art

113
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,410
school was very traditional graphic

114
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,419
design sort of focus thing did a lot of

115
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:00,220
art classes as well I fell in love with

116
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,750
the web while I was there you guys can

117
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,010
probably guess the rest of that story

118
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,620
and you know like art school and owl

119
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,229
says there was a lot of this going on

120
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:10,900
there definitely but there were also

121
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,639
some other things that I learned that

122
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,620
was sort of the beginning of a lifetime

123
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,240
of learning about the things that I'm

124
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,520
going to address today like the value of

125
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,180
good critique or you know create a block

126
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,229
or things like this like what it what's

127
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:29,080
required to make good work and I

128
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,539
graduated which was cool and I got my

129
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,460
first design job which was great I think

130
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,560
much to my parents surprise I wasn't

131
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,729
doing that and I got an even better

132
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:41,500
design job in a better city so that was

133
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:41,919
cool

134
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,360
and then I got like a super awesome

135
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,400
design job in a really awesome City and

136
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,990
that was great too I felt like I was

137
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,070
sort of living the dream and then wait a

138
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,599
minute this is nothing that's not how

139
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:54,430
it's supposed to go right this is not

140
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,139
the right trajectory for that but I was

141
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:02,770
totally totally burnt out completely

142
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,740
broken depressed frustrated exhausted I

143
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,630
couldn't even pick up a pencil and

144
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,800
sketch anything so like you do I left my

145
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,150
job in February of that year

146
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,890
packed a suitcase and ran away from it

147
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,310
all right so two months later I'm

148
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,510
somewhere in Hong Kong

149
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,210
I'm still pretty miserable at this point

150
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,270
I thought I might never be able to

151
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,400
design anything ever again I thought

152
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,430
maybe I had completely forgotten how

153
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,140
whatever tap of creativity I used to

154
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,060
just be able to turn on and things would

155
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,370
come out of it now like wouldn't even

156
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:41,950
drip and this tap of creativity is also

157
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,050
the only way that I have to make a

158
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,020
living to write so huge problem there

159
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,260
and then I get this text from my

160
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,240
longtime friend and colleague Matthew

161
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,520
gall and he's sort of like hey I know

162
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,930
you're off the grid and like running

163
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,280
around the world and like where are you

164
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,990
but I'm really desperate for a designer

165
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,370
could you please help me with something

166
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,950
on this project and I thought about it

167
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,380
for a bit and then I texted him back yes

168
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,130
and it was in that moment when I did

169
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:14,110
this that I realized that this is the

170
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,530
commitment to a creative life no matter

171
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,500
how you might be there is only

172
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,470
one way out and that way out is to keep

173
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,890
making so enough of me why does this

174
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,780
matter to you guys well first of all

175
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,520
it's because of this how many people

176
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,350
here have dealt with something similar

177
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,350
maybe on a less drastic scale okay just

178
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,380
raise your hand okay so it's like almost

179
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,480
half of you and you know if it hasn't

180
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,490
happened to you yet there's a very good

181
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,280
chance that it might so this is a real

182
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,900
issue guys we all make our money this

183
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,510
way right and you know there's there's

184
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,070
ways to get around this you're probably

185
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,840
familiar with some of these ways there's

186
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,930
ways like this and this and you know

187
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,850
that and I like those things those

188
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,350
things are cool don't get me wrong but

189
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,270
they're not super effective in the long

190
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,160
term and that's what I want to talk

191
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,860
about a bit more and you'd also think

192
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,660
that like the most important thing is

193
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,030
that we all understand and are able to

194
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,790
take care of what keeps us creative

195
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:19,060
right but from my conversations with

196
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,470
peers in the tech

197
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,380
I'm not totally convinced that that

198
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,280
actually happens for instance if you did

199
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,440
a CS degree you might not have even had

200
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,660
that sort of like first brush with like

201
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,750
the personal creativity bla that I was

202
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,460
forced to have to deal with in design

203
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,849
school you know early on and and that's

204
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:42,789
that's crazy because it doesn't matter

205
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,670
what you call yourself or what tools you

206
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,140
make things with or how you make them

207
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,480
what matters is that we're all makers

208
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,540
and that we all need to take care of

209
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:58,240
this and because we don't talk about

210
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,990
this problem it's really self

211
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,280
reinforcing especially in the in the

212
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,590
startup community I find that we really

213
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,870
really focus on tools we talk about the

214
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,270
efficiency of things it's all like lean

215
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,840
this and Minimum Viable bla that and we

216
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,120
treat ourselves like a tool that can be

217
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,910
optimized for even higher performance we

218
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:26,080
separate the making from the maker how's

219
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,330
the company doing we ask each other well

220
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,220
the company will be doing fine if people

221
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,990
are making things and people will only

222
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,850
be making things if they're in a space

223
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,470
where they feel like they can make good

224
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,830
things right as a quick aside I think

225
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,600
it's really interesting that recently

226
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,980
people have been talking about failure a

227
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,110
lot in the tech community but I think

228
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,820
it's really only the tip of the iceberg

229
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,250
in sort of talking about people and I

230
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,900
hope that as a community we dig deeper

231
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,000
there but you know it's hard because of

232
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,930
this right so hopefully we can cuz we

233
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,870
need to learn from each other you all

234
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,170
right

235
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,270
I think it's like time for a little owl

236
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:05,290
break that was a lot so far yep

237
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,710
this is did you guys like owls I love

238
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,350
owls they there's so many you love owls

239
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,820
- there's so many fascinating things

240
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,140
about owls like did you know that they

241
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,089
can basically like hear with their face

242
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:18,430
it's amazing it's it's super cool hit me

243
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,589
up for more a love facts afterwards so

244
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:22,360
that's my hungover owl this is

245
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,260
definitely what I'm gonna look like

246
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,550
tomorrow morning I don't know about you

247
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,310
guys okay let's get back to business

248
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,339
so we're in Hong Kong it's 2011 you know

249
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,310
I feel really shitty

250
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,960
how do I dig myself out of this big hole

251
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,110
right two and a half years later these

252
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,300
are some of the methods that worked for

253
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,870
me to overcome my maker's block and have

254
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,330
continued to work for me actually so

255
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,820
what works for me might not work for you

256
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,300
you know this is not some kind of like

257
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,670
five-step self-help guide Oh God

258
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,040
but an opportunity for you to add

259
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,779
something to your toolkit if you think

260
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:01,400
it might be useful right so the first

261
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,320
thing here is learning when to stop we

262
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,560
come from a world of things that don't

263
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,130
have an end instead of like the physical

264
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,990
end to a record when the music stops

265
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,300
playing we have like a pause button on

266
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,390
our phones and we craft digital things

267
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,670
where we can sort of tweak and update

268
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,830
and revert as often as we would like to

269
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,320
and I think the lesson here is that it's

270
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,450
much easier to learn where the end of

271
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,800
something is actually if you work with

272
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,339
physical stuff early on in one of my

273
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:36,920
first painting classes in uni I remember

274
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,170
you know really harshly learning this

275
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,060
horrible lesson about over painting

276
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,790
which is basically when the painting was

277
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,700
better yesterday night then it is today

278
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,710
and now you have to throw it out and

279
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,480
start a whole new one and finish it at

280
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,950
exactly the same point before your

281
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,960
critique tomorrow it's not a good place

282
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,720
to be in encoding this manifests itself

283
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,960
as over optimising or over architecting

284
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,390
and it's applicable whether you're

285
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,460
working on like a really small part of a

286
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,790
system just one tiny feature or the big

287
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,010
picture right and I had to learn the

288
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,810
hard way in the big picture category

289
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,970
when to stop working at Loftus last.fm

290
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,250
because I was still tweaking things that

291
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,300
really didn't need to be tweaked anymore

292
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,440
but the other reason that this is really

293
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,959
important is I think that you need to

294
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:26,600
finish working on things to allow other

295
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,850
ideas to come in so my six-year-old

296
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,589
brain it's like it's like a small box

297
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:33,350
and I can like put one idea in one side

298
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,760
and then it rattles around in there for

299
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,560
a while but then I have to like push it

300
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,300
out the other side to make space for

301
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,420
more ideas to come in otherwise it just

302
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,300
all gets blocked up and

303
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,160
and there's no more space for new inputs

304
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,370
and we need new inputs to keep making

305
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,410
new things that's what keeps this cycle

306
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:56,950
virtuous and keep going secondly start

307
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,820
with something yep

308
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,110
when we feel like we can't make things

309
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,440
we're on a very steep and slippery slide

310
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,660
to feeling like everything we make is

311
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,090
 I'm sure you've been there at least

312
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,520
I'm sure you've been there at least
once before in your life and worrying

313
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,500
about it being is even harder at

314
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,210
the very beginning of a project because

315
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,830
at the beginning of a project we have

316
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,960
this extra barrier to overcome which is

317
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,540
like oh my god I'm staring at a blank

318
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,980
canvas how am I ever gonna make

319
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,390
something out of this or staring at a

320
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:28,780
blank whatever in fact I hate this

321
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,440
feeling so much that to this day I do

322
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,300
something that I call ruining my

323
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,980
sketchbooks which is like when I get a

324
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,080
brand-new sketchbook I'm just like too

325
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,480
afraid to start making something in

326
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,920
there because it's all pristine and

327
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,210
looks so nice and how could I ever

328
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,890
possibly fill it up with great stuff etc

329
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,440
etc so I take the first page and I

330
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,700
always write book of sketch and like

331
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,290
really sloppy writing and just like

332
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,970
doodle something stupid in there and

333
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,860
then flip the page over and then on the

334
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,690
next page I get down to business and

335
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:56,920
it's all fine after that

336
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,930
but I sort of ruin it first to like

337
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,930
lower the bar for myself that I can get

338
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,770
it done so don't worry about making

339
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,480
something because the first thing

340
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,340
that you make you know it probably will

341
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,020
be it's just about getting that

342
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,270
thing out faster making that stupid

343
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,630
doodle in like five seconds so that you

344
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,940
can get on to iterating something good

345
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,370
out of that and there's so many good

346
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,340
examples of this and LaMotte who wrote

347
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,780
bird by bird which is a really great

348
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,170
book on writing she calls upon writers

349
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:32,050
to write shitty first drafts that's what

350
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,240
she calls it and Fred Brooks the author

351
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,070
of the mythical man-month whom I'm sure

352
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,170
you have heard of says about first

353
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,810
systems plan to throw one away because

354
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,110
you will anyway

355
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,570
in fact since you know I'm just up here

356
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,280
sort of like exposing all these really

357
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,630
embarrassing things to you I'm going to

358
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,390
show you the very first version of Jem I

359
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,670
mean link this is really really bad you

360
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,870
know this was just sort of like one of

361
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,930
my first sketches of

362
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,670
but it it stuck a couple of things

363
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,950
together you know we knew we wanted the

364
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,350
jam itself to be really big which is

365
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,820
something that like at the time no one

366
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,140
on the internet was really doing like a

367
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,880
song was always like a little row or a

368
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,200
little button it wasn't like a big thing

369
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,839
we knew we wanted like some space and

370
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,899
for heard you know some writing about it

371
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:17,899
and today it looks like this and I look

372
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:18,980
at this and I still see a lot of

373
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,440
imperfections with it of course but it's

374
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,029
a hell of a lot better than it was at

375
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:25,040
the beginning it's just about getting

376
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,510
that shitty first thing done really

377
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:31,310
quickly and getting it over with third

378
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,279
here taking that small first step making

379
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:36,830
the prototype will actually help

380
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,130
motivate you do more and I think there's

381
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,810
this big commons miss common

382
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,149
misconception about making things that

383
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:46,550
it's like some kind of magical process

384
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,500
where like a lightning bolt comes down

385
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,270
and like hits you and your head explodes

386
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,830
you've got this amazing idea all of a

387
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,399
sudden in fact I often experience this

388
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:57,410
when people ask me oh how did you and

389
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,060
Matt come up with the idea for this as

390
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,690
my jam

391
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,660
tell me all about it and I'm like oh

392
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,390
well you know it was like five years of

393
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,279
really hard work working together very

394
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,279
closely you know working on social music

395
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:12,020
and the internet and understanding the

396
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,270
whole crazy ecosystem of like writes and

397
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,950
labels and their eyes glaze over right

398
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,630
and they're like wait what it wasn't

399
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,040
just like you woke up one morning and

400
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,660
you had this brilliant idea that's what

401
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,860
they always want me to tell them right

402
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,900
and I'm like no not how it works first

403
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,480
you have to take an action and then from

404
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,430
that you're motivated and and then

405
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,959
something happens you know you need to

406
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:32,450
let the sky get dark and stormy and

407
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,010
interesting first before there's a

408
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,730
lightning bolt a related concept to this

409
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,190
is one that Julia Cameron talks about in

410
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,890
her book the artists way which is that

411
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,140
we are like you know like sharks that

412
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,959
need to keep swimming to stay alive we

413
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:50,060
sort of need to keep making things to

414
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,920
stay true to ourselves to our integrity

415
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,010
and it really doesn't matter I don't

416
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,589
think how small or insignificant that

417
00:16:57,589 --> 00:16:59,510
thing is that you make as long as you

418
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,570
keep making it so when I felt like I

419
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,329
couldn't design anything what I did is I

420
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:07,790
actually started making a garden and

421
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,490
this is what it looks like

422
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,350
some plants actually turned out pretty

423
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:14,170
well and it wasn't bad garden you know

424
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,120
and this felt a little bit similar to

425
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,679
design for me because it was kind of

426
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,420
creatives kind of technical you make

427
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,579
things grow right I mean sure it's like

428
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:24,100
a totally crazy old lady habit you know

429
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,800
it's bonkers but whatever it was like

430
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,530
something that just helped the creative

431
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,210
shark inside of me you know feel

432
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,370
satisfied and it helped me see the light

433
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:38,470
at the end of the tunnel right this kind

434
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,120
of a big one I want to talk about habits

435
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,220
for a bit

436
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,010
so rightly so our industry places a lot

437
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,520
of importance on habits for getting

438
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,500
things done processes you know sort of

439
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,510
state of the art stuff a good example of

440
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,190
this is agile right it helps you get

441
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,410
things done and then there's like a

442
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,360
second kind of habit too that's really

443
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,550
important Twyla Tharp talks about this

444
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,830
in her book the creative habit she's a

445
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,780
choreographer she talks about the

446
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,000
importance of personal habits to keep

447
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,190
yourself sort of sharp and ready to be

448
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,780
able to make things so for her this is

449
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,179
like getting up super early in the

450
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:15,130
morning and this ritual of like hailing

451
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,290
a cab in Manhattan and going to the gym

452
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,640
where she does this insane workout

453
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,080
routine because that's how she keeps

454
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,630
herself ready for us it might be

455
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,360
something like you know reading a blog

456
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,610
every day that we or whatever something

457
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,670
to keep our knowledge up-to-date right

458
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,440
but there's a third a third and more

459
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,450
elusive habit that I need to tell you

460
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,300
guys about this habit is the one of

461
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,059
creating patterns for personal

462
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:43,150
serendipity because making things

463
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:48,580
requires unusual inputs we need the

464
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,040
unexpected in our life and that means

465
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,200
making space for the unexpected to

466
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,630
happen which is difficult when we're

467
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,130
following routines and sort of doing

468
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:00,640
things daily so an example of this is

469
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,929
this year actually team Jam and a couple

470
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:06,460
of people are a few people rather from

471
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,309
our co-working space hired this house in

472
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:10,480
Spain

473
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,400
just south of Barcelona it was really

474
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,870
cheap because we got it right before the

475
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,850
tourist season started nice six bedroom

476
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,470
house and we went there and did a bunch

477
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,230
of work and it was amazing we got so

478
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,490
much done like we had all these really

479
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,140
incredible ideas it was just a wonderful

480
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,179
experience and we're all like how did

481
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:28,670
this happen and I really think it was

482
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,320
just down to the fact that it was an

483
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,000
unusual environment there were different

484
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,320
inputs we had to think of things

485
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,570
differently it really helped us get

486
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,059
things done but it doesn't even need to

487
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:39,770
be that extravagant in fact it can be

488
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,500
really small and simple and cheap

489
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,100
another example of this is I use 750

490
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,710
words every day to journal and that's a

491
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,780
way for me to write down things

492
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,330
unexpectedly tidbits of ideas whatever

493
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,460
it's just like stuff but it's giving

494
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,140
myself the space and time for that

495
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:04,190
unexpected to happen I sometimes think

496
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,530
of this there's this this Tom Waits

497
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,360
interview that I saw once on video it's

498
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,429
it's really really good and he talks

499
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:11,780
about like someone asked him like how do

500
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,670
you write songs and he talks about the

501
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,990
songs as like because you know he's

502
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,570
crazy like butterflies and he's got a

503
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,010
butterfly net and he has to like catch

504
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,170
the songs right but there's an element

505
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,580
of truth to that which is like without

506
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,040
the butterfly net in the first place you

507
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,590
know you don't even know if you're going

508
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,059
to you won't don't even know if you

509
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:30,230
might be able to catch it and that's

510
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,090
what sort of creating these patterns for

511
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,670
personal serendipity is all about it's

512
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,830
kind of a you know it feels like a funny

513
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,630
thing to do because you don't know if

514
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,610
that serendipity is going to happen you

515
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,320
don't know if you're going to be able to

516
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,480
catch a butterfly but without even

517
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,280
creating the space to do that in the

518
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,170
first place you're never gonna get one

519
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,929
right another silly thing I do is

520
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:52,940
another freeze the only thing I do I

521
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,290
can't believe I'm telling you guys this

522
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,450
why did I why did I write this talk is

523
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,130
sometimes I walk around the neighborhood

524
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,370
and I look at moss and I I like textures

525
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,380
a lot so I like touching the moss and

526
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,179
occasionally I steal it and take it home

527
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:10,880
to my garden yep okay we're on the fifth

528
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,590
one I don't know how we're doing on time

529
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,600
there's like there's no timer up here

530
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,370
I hope we're all right okay I'm just

531
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,280
gonna keep on going by far the most

532
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,820
important technique is to do something

533
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,950
different this really helps me get

534
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,260
unstuck so one of my old painting

535
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,380
teachers used to say that that he would

536
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,690
always have two canvases going at the

537
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,490
same time usually one in oils and one in

538
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,960
acrylics and he'd like paint on one and

539
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,280
whenever

540
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,930
got stuck and it's like ah this isn't

541
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,220
working he just like turned his stool

542
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,810
around and he'd paint on the other

543
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,210
canvas until he realized oh that's how I

544
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,010
need to solve this one then he flipped

545
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,240
back around again and work on this

546
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,910
canvas and having something else like

547
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,860
that to help you get unstuck I find

548
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,890
really really cool works really well and

549
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,600
it's about taking the skills you have in

550
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,700
one category and just sort of shifting

551
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,830
them a little bit so try working in a

552
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,660
different medium or a different paradigm

553
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,290
or a different idiom or language so even

554
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,060
through this entire period while I was

555
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,280
actually working full time as an

556
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,980
interaction designer what I decided to

557
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,530
do was take on a bunch of side projects

558
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,740
of print work for friends this was

559
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,880
something that I hadn't done in like

560
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,380
seven years print work it's like a

561
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,790
completely different sort of technical

562
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,280
skill but I think it was really this

563
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,950
these side projects that helped me turn

564
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,980
my creative tap back on these side

565
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,990
projects with a deadline especially are

566
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,930
a really great way to sort of fake it

567
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,270
until you make it and I'm quite happy to

568
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,100
say that I'm not taking on any more side

569
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,720
projects because I now have so many

570
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,460
ideas of my own that I want to execute I

571
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,930
don't have time to be working on stuff

572
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,240
for other people I actually haven't

573
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,460
shown these too many people yet so I

574
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,020
thought you know like I'd show them to

575
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,180
you guys like why not you know might as

576
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,490
well say this is what I did so I made

577
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,800
these like silly cards for Matthew ogle

578
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,240
when he left last FM they had like

579
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,920
drawings of the web team members on them

580
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,930
they were planning poker cards for scum

581
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,780
and I collaborated with Jamie McKelvie

582
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,420
on a backup for an issue of Ironman I

583
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,760
did all of the infographics this is sort

584
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,830
of like Tony Stark's posthuman

585
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,230
understanding of the world because he

586
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,630
can do that kind of stuff we also

587
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,550
collaborated together on an album for

588
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,600
art brut where Jamie did the

589
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,070
illustrations and I did all the design

590
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,710
and the layout that year also my

591
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,530
grandmother turned 80 years old so my

592
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,360
sisters and I decided to make a cookbook

593
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,070
of all of her recipes because she's an

594
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,740
amazing cook and this included like

595
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,450
photographing everything like making it

596
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,130
photographing everything making these

597
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,530
illustrations and and all sorts of stuff

598
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,880
for that it was a pretty fun project we

599
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,620
made it into like a hardback really

600
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,940
beautiful object I did some identity

601
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,460
design for a friend of mine who runs a

602
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,690
speakeasy called

603
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,399
Manhattan's project that Orchestra that

604
00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:52,659
I was telling you about that I play with

605
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:54,399
I redesigned their logo for them this

606
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:55,450
year because it was their 50th

607
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,039
anniversary why not

608
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,820
and more recently actually I just

609
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,149
finished working on the logo for a brand

610
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:05,830
new comic that's coming out it's gonna

611
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,019
be out next month actually called 3

612
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:09,970
which is written by Karen Gillan if

613
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,169
you're into that kind of stuff and it's

614
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:16,269
about Sparta so once you find your

615
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:18,700
methods that work for you because these

616
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,870
are my methods they might not work for

617
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,259
you it's really important that you

618
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:25,389
codify them you need to work them into

619
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:26,769
your life so this doesn't happen again

620
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:31,779
and you also need to talk about them

621
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:34,000
with your colleagues too this will help

622
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,039
each other critique the methods behind

623
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:39,009
your work not just the work itself and I

624
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:40,570
think especially you know if some of

625
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,830
your methods are a little bit quirky

626
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,629
like you like to go pick moths out of

627
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:46,389
people's yards or whatever you know or

628
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:48,100
different to other people in your work

629
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,960
space like you need 15 minutes at the

630
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,639
beginning of each day to write your

631
00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:53,860
journal or whatever then talk to your

632
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,120
colleagues about them so that they

633
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,830
understand that these quirky habits are

634
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,419
not just like weird and wacky but it's

635
00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:00,850
actually what makes you a creative

636
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,889
person every single day so that you can

637
00:25:02,889 --> 00:25:06,029
come into work and do that great work

638
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:09,700
all right so we're nearly at the end and

639
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,679
I still haven't told you what's up with

640
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,149
the animals you guys wondering what's up

641
00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:15,159
with the animals yeah you're wondering

642
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:19,659
yeah so in 2011 I I sketched this little

643
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:22,269
guy for fun and I really had a lot of

644
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:24,759
fun doing it and then later on

645
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:27,340
owls right I got to hold duster who is

646
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,529
this like amazing African spotted eagle

647
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:31,870
owl he was 12 years old when I held him

648
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,610
so he was pretty old dude I really hope

649
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,110
he's still alive

650
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:38,860
and then I got this magic pen I call it

651
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,379
it's a Wacom inkling that records pen

652
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:44,139
strokes to vector which is pretty neat

653
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:47,080
and I needed a project to motivate me to

654
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,970
help learn how to learn how to use it

655
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,169
right because kind of different method

656
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:52,480
of drawing so when I was applying to

657
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,850
speak at Jay s conf I knew that I wanted

658
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,529
to talk about makers block I knew that I

659
00:25:56,529 --> 00:25:58,330
wanted to like tell this story and share

660
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,909
it with the community but I also knew

661
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:02,909
that I am needed to get energy

662
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:06,359
from somewhere to do it I need an action

663
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:09,539
to get the motivation rolling and I also

664
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:12,269
needed some kind of unusual element for

665
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:15,840
personal serendipity and I needed to do

666
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,659
something different which is why

667
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:22,139
sometimes you need to draw animals thank

668
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:36,560
you very much
