1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,240

it's my mic on somebody give me a thumbs

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,220
up if you can hear me because I can't

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,040
hear okay great um that works really

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,160
well because I can't see you anyway so

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,190
the first letter on this repository link

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,350
here is a tea I will share it again I

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,260
also tweeted it out my name is Katherine

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,300
mean I work at a company called spark

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,430
box I'm a full-stack developer or

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,510
whatever that means

11
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,140
I use she/her pronouns spark box is a

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,510
little web shop in Ohio we have about 40

13
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,969
people I spend most of my time working

14
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,420
on an enterprise level design system you

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,059
can ask me about later so today I'm

16
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,680
going to share with you a few tools and

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,940
techniques to make your pull request

18
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,710
more effective and more collaborative

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,320
because of time I hope to do a quick

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,480
summary of a few tools and you can

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,820
google them later after the event most

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,039
of these tools are not github exclusive

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,500
so I've met people from git lab and

24
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,789
bitbucket here and I know there's at

25
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,760
least one github person so hopefully

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,859
like you still find something even if

27
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,860
github is not your main technology to

28
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,290
start I should share a bit about context

29
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,470
and how SPARC box does code reviews we

30
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,020
steer north store nearly all of our code

31
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,060
on github we do have one bitbucket

32
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,060
client now that's kind of new we use

33
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,710
shared repositories dedicated to

34
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,920
whatever engagement we're working on

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,930
developers have whenever developers have

36
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,210
new code to add to the project they ask

37
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,579
another developer for a code review via

38
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:32,970
pull request I've come up with six sort

39
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,670
of rules that spark box adheres to while

40
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,189
using github and I will just say that I

41
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:40,799
came up with these rules for the spark

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,079
box process so I do not represent the

43
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,740
thoughts and ideas of my employer yes

44
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,570
rule number one is no one merges their

45
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,850
own code spark box likes to avoid the

46
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,729
concept of a developer island where one

47
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,770
developer is writing emerging all of the

48
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,200
code for a piece of a website last year

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,939
we had a cot lion who wanted an

50
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,829
additional full-time developer for a

51
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,390
side project but they would be the only

52
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,180
developer on that project we offered

53
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,590
instead to developers at half time

54
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,989
having a reviewer is that important to

55
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,560
us the second rule is

56
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,800
is never pushed directly to master

57
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,880
pushing directly to master is the

58
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,580
easiest way to break everything

59
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,489
requiring code review re reinforces the

60
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:25,080
quality that we've come to value as a

61
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,160
company third rule if you're working

62
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,800
with you I get a design review at work

63
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,599
box we have a position called a front

64
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,120
end designer on every project we design

65
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,700
this special designer often will write

66
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,650
front-end code so they may do some CSS

67
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,470
but not every company has designers who

68
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,630
know how to code and nor should they but

69
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,390
that's probably a different talk rule

70
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,480
number four if you are working on copy

71
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,580
get a get a copy review at spark box

72
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,680
this is usually the project manager or

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,410
the client themselves we have an

74
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,130
integrated development process so the

75
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,540
clients usually have access to the

76
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,390
repositories we're working on rule

77
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,180
number five is never ever push directly

78
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,720
to master again unless you messed up

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,599
which if you did find a buddy to pair

80
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,790
with which leads me to rule number six

81
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,560
which is these rules are more like

82
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,000
guidelines and I made them up but if you

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,859
follow these six rules it ensures that

84
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:27,959
we follow the basic spark mark spree

85
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,359
Creed which is working together for a

86
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:32,819
web built right if every piece of code

87
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,010
has at least two people contributing to

88
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:35,340
it

89
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,900
we often catch mistakes before they

90
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,380
happen so all of that is context for

91
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,019
about what I'm about to talk about it

92
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:44,790
may be different for you and your

93
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,799
company it's just how we like to work so

94
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,660
I'm not telling you how you should do

95
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,970
code reviews some challenges of

96
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,359
collaboration are getting a PR review

97
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,970
from a non coder or getting a PR review

98
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,410
from someone who's in a different time

99
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,780
zone currently I am five hours separate

100
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,190
from most of my team and nine hours

101
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,350
separated from the rest it's not that

102
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,500
easy working with developers who may be

103
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,980
only doing reviews on your project or

104
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:15,359
working with people who are assigned

105
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:18,959
directly to PR review and nothing else

106
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,900
so how do we improve these things so I'm

107
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,669
going to give you six steps I think I

108
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:27,260
guess I like

109
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,220
number six tip number one is write good

110
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,250
stories to ensure good pull requests we

111
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,440
have to write good issues at spark box

112
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,780
we often use and hub github projects

113
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,510
your our Trello to organize engagements

114
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,000
usually with something like scrum which

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,280
involves creating stories which is

116
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,280
usually a github issue representing a

117
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,740
bite-sized chunk of work so let's hope

118
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,660
these pictures were great all right

119
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,180
story should include the requirements of

120
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,400
the work and potentially a solution if

121
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,400
you have one in mind story or issue

122
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,050
doesn't need to be overly complicated

123
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,270
but it should be easy to understand a

124
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,370
well-written story makes for a clear

125
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,530
requirements when it comes time to do a

126
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,500
PR and this leads you to my very first

127
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,260
tool recommendation the only one then is

128
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,550
github exclusive but I'm sure there's

129
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,450
something similar on the other

130
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,390
technologies just for reference in the

131
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,610
photo this is my coworker Austin who is

132
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,950
a project manager explaining that

133
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,630
there's this footer it's not great so

134
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,920
maybe we can use some of these other

135
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,640
colors instead so github issue and

136
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,820
github issue templates and PR templates

137
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,100
allow you to add a markdown file to your

138
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,260
root directory to outline the issue

139
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,180
process I'll show you this link again in

140
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,510
a minute this is an issue template

141
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,330
here's my markdown it's included

142
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:54,830
directly in my project in addition to

143
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,570
adding the template file to the root of

144
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,310
your project you can also include it via

145
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,730
github directory PR templates are also a

146
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,320
thing that can go in this directory they

147
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,640
work the same way but have a different

148
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,010
file name and they come up when you do a

149
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:11,390
PR instead of an issue so here is the

150
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,100
issue template on github when I click

151
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,690
the new issue button the text field

152
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,220
populates with the contents of the

153
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,410
template file and then these example

154
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,630
files are stored in the repo I linked at

155
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,100
the beginning and I tweet it out and

156
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,310
I'll link at the end I think if you want

157
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,910
to take a closer look talk with your

158
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,620
project team to decide what you should

159
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,380
put into a template mine is just an

160
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,870
example it's very flat example but a

161
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,490
checklist is usually nice you can go

162
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,350
through and click things off so there's

163
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,689
that link again I'll give you about

164
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:45,860
thirty seconds three seconds two seconds

165
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,849
alright tip number two is get the basics

166
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:50,330
right

167
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,009
a good way to frustrate your pull

168
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:53,569
request reviewer is to send them

169
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:57,860
something with absolutely no context you

170
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,610
could respond in kind these are real

171
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,580
real PRS people from my co-workers the

172
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,979
great uhm but a few extra minutes to

173
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:09,289
write a thoughtful PR description can go

174
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:11,930
a long way toward easing the work of the

175
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:18,050
reviewer we try to include a quick

176
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,210
summary of the work being done usually

177
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,379
matching your commit descriptions linked

178
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:26,779
to any github issues or stories

179
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,039
especially use it if you're using

180
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:30,800
something like Zen hub or JIRA for agile

181
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,129
a link or screenshot of the original

182
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:36,050
design work if you're working on UI as a

183
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,120
developer I love screenshots in addition

184
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,159
to design files because I don't have to

185
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,379
open up Zeppelin every single time I'm

186
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,379
looking at something to build and

187
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:47,150
step-by-step testing instructions

188
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,520
including how to run the linter or how

189
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,339
to run the tests how to navigate to any

190
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,710
new work how specifically your new work

191
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,680
is meant to function so here's that PR

192
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,229
example again this is from my other

193
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,110
co-worker Bryan he's had a number of

194
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:08,240
these tips they should be written in the

195
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,370
context of the developer reviewing the

196
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,770
work for example a PR to a developer

197
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,979
who's only doing review or QA may look

198
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:17,210
completely different to the one who

199
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,349
wrote the build process alright next tip

200
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:24,520
enhance your pull request with gifts

201
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,770
this is my favorite gift because it's

202
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,569
cat and the cat is coding oh my name is

203
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:34,159
cat and I'm a coder so it's me I hope

204
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,779
you like that joke it's my only one so

205
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:40,159
what if a gift can be more than a quick

206
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,740
laughs gifts are awesome for showing nav

207
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,529
functionality transitions hover effects

208
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:47,209
animation - pretty much any visual

209
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:49,100
aspect of your work where a front-end

210
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,010
shop can you tell gifts are especially

211
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,050
useful for getting a design review of an

212
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,350
anime

213
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,270
or hover from someone who may not have a

214
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:01,010
site running locally here is my tool for

215
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,320
this one it's called record it there's

216
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,780
the link it's record it co record it is

217
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,700
a screencasting service that lets you

218
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,260
save your finished recording as a gif

219
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,650
and even gives you a hosted link an

220
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,440
example use case is foundry which is a

221
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,440
spark box blog the CMS that this foundry

222
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,210
is built upon is a really big deal to

223
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,670
set up it may take a full day especially

224
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,560
if it's for a designer a project manager

225
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,240
who's just trying to review one or two

226
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,970
lines of code or comic content by

227
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,310
including a gif you may give the

228
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,050
necessary context and allow everyone to

229
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,340
feel a little confident in what they are

230
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,190
approving so this is just a gif I made

231
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:40,850
of some functionality so here's the link

232
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,200
to record it again

233
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,690
a downside to record it is that it

234
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,450
doesn't currently support HTTPS which

235
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,760
means as you may know that it can't be

236
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,150
embedded directly into a PR on github it

237
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,150
can still be sent as a slack link or

238
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,500
just an email or whatever

239
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,200
an alternative I've recently discovered

240
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,800
gift box if Fox is a native app it

241
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,390
creates gifts and you can drop them into

242
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,130
github to host them just like you would

243
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,830
an image hosting on github gives you the

244
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,560
full security of your repository so

245
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,330
you're not violating your security

246
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,930
policies it does cost $5 wow this one's

247
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,430
really off

248
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,030
include it is included in set app if

249
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,640
you're a set app subscriber and I think

250
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,130
this one only works on Mac but there are

251
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,750
lots of giving tools out there it's sort

252
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,620
of the thought that counts all right the

253
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,010
next one is enhancing your pull requests

254
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,920
with video an important aspect of a

255
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,750
complicated PR is the ability to walk

256
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,700
someone through your code in the current

257
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,920
age devs are often distributed or remote

258
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,570
we work in different time zones and have

259
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,910
busy schedules sometimes it is nearly

260
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,890
impossible to schedule the 30 minutes to

261
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,540
step through your PR here's the tool

262
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:00,110
it's go video by video vidyard this used

263
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,200
to be called viewed it they changed it

264
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,150
right after I wrote my talks so I had to

265
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,230
change it

266
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,900
and go video is a Chrome extension they

267
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,090
also have a native app because not

268
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,800
everyone is a fan of Chrome hello and

269
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,990
was it last go video lets a user record

270
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,760
their screen their face and their voice

271
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,010
all at once

272
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,630
specifically we used a video project

273
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,150
like this on engagement where the main

274
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,850
reviewer me was not dedicated to the

275
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,920
project full time because I was not

276
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,930
available for stand-ups I didn't have a

277
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,550
direct hand in building the website and

278
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,780
I wasn't really familiar with the

279
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,760
changes being reviewed the dev had to

280
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,090
explain every change for every PR go

281
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,920
video is one of my new favorite ways to

282
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,720
start a code review I've made you a

283
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,460
video instead of showing you how it's

284
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,640
done hopefully works I keep meaning to

285
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,280
rerecord this but people tell me that

286
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,790
awkwardness is endearing so just just go

287
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,380
with it

288
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,870
hey there github purse this is go video

289
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,110
by viddy art as you can see it records

290
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,540
my entire screen plus a little me down

291
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,140
in the corner over here hello but I

292
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,060
think is super friendly and great for

293
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,790
doing video walkthroughs of pull

294
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,270
requests here you can see that I am on a

295
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,230
pull request and I can go into my file

296
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,960
changes I can look at the code I can

297
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,200
explain hey this class adds 3 M of

298
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,870
padding bottom to our smart box homepage

299
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,140
it hopefully fixes an issue I hope you

300
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,330
like it please merge it obviously I did

301
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:39,200
merge it because this is me and then

302
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,180
when you are done recording your video

303
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,840
you can go on to a screen one shows up

304
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,240
like this you can see that you can

305
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,820
change your title like cat is super

306
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,610
great at videos you should try it

307
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,060
sometime it's not that great just

308
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,090
kidding that's a bad joke so you can

309
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,800
change your thumbnail sort of scrub

310
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,500
through contacts and when you're done

311
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,670
you get a link right here that link is

312
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,310
HTTP so you can embed it directly into

313
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:13,220
your floor requests and whoever wants to

314
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,410
review your code gets a nice friendly

315
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,570
walk through and it doesn't matter about

316
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:22,680
time zones or anything fun like that

317
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:28,430
all right never again thanks that's

318
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,150
really encouraging so here's the link

319
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,970
again depending on the size of your PR a

320
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,160
walk-through video only adds about five

321
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,110
or ten minutes total to our set-up time

322
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,330
but it can potentially save the 30 to 60

323
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,130
minutes it might take to explain your PR

324
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:47,390
via slack or email I'm sorry or

325
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,180
scheduling a zoom meeting this is

326
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,410
especially useful when pairing

327
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,960
developers who have different schedules

328
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,880
for who a remote or who are not as

329
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,990
familiar with the engagement you're

330
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,830
working on all right two more tips

331
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,180
there's another give valuable feedback

332
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,210
sketch sketch is a free app we're going

333
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,760
directly into the tool here sketch is a

334
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,530
free app from Evernote it's probably my

335
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,270
favorite thing on all of these slides it

336
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,060
is loved by spark box for everything

337
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,220
from full-page decomps to quick design

338
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,960
edits to making memes of your coworkers

339
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:23,960
I use it daily here is an example I just

340
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,000
made this up sketch provides elegant

341
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,339
markup tools for drawing boxes adding

342
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:30,410
arrows and highlighting any necessary

343
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,750
changes you can just take a screenshot

344
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,420
and have at it that shift command for on

345
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,980
a Mac it took me a really long time to

346
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,300
learn that so now you don't have to

347
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,630
pretend you didn't know so here are some

348
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,010
real-world examples I pulled these

349
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,370
directly out of slack just didn't go

350
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,150
through them oh that one doesn't work

351
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,420
here's some muscles this is the best

352
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,600
joke in my slides and it's not even mine

353
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,910
all right so that's sketched by Evernote

354
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,410
you can just Google sketch you don't to

355
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,510
remember this whole link sketch works

356
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,490
well in the opposite direction I've

357
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,320
recorded it's an easy way for designers

358
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,480
to communicate desired changes with

359
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,240
developers say make this bigger reduce

360
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,790
the space here delete this link sketch

361
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,440
provides visual feedback for visual

362
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:24,470
thinkers all right last one one last way

363
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,900
to make your PRS friendlier is to be

364
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,660
friendly spot via github comments it's

365
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,370
no way to collaborate and let's face it

366
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,350
we know communication is very difficult

367
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,830

368
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,230
it doesn't communicate tone that's why

369
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,400
we invented emoji a co-worker of mine

370
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,050
Brian the one who wrote the really

371
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,440
awesome PR earlier also wrote an article

372
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,480
about this topic it's called stop giving

373
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,290
depressing code reviews the idea is to

374
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,720
give as much possible positive code

375
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,670
feedback as you do correction it's

376
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,860
really hard especially if you're an INTJ

377
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,810
like me you just go through and see all

378
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,040
the negative and you don't offer any

379
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,060
positive comments you can do it

380
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,850
so this is a picture Brian he knows I'm

381
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,840
including it instead of really going to

382
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,950
this topic I'm going to read you this

383
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,630
quote it says giving positive feedback

384
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,690
is an easy habit to adopt you're already

385
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,010
reading through the lines of code

386
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,080
looking for issues it doesn't take much

387
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,390
night it doesn't take much time to throw

388
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,580
in a nice or it looks great you see

389
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,670
something awesome say it so the link to

390
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,110
the full article is there but a few

391
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,210
positive comments make a huge difference

392
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,740
in the overall tone of your review

393
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,210
whether you're speaking with diviner

394
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,310
designers developers other team

395
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,650
contributors clients which are really

396
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:45,470
important so yeah be nice and that's

397
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,210
that's what I have hopefully at least

398
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,920

399
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,330
experience more accessible for your

400
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,510
entire team and not just the developers

401
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,610
with healthy dose of empathy we can

402
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,990
improve the way our co-workers review

403
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,120
the code we write and as a result we

404
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,430
create smoother workflows increase both

405
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,770
speed and communication and make better

406
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,449
