00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,329

popcorn Jas is an html5 video framework

2
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:49,070
that lets you bring the web into your

3
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,309
videos let's try it this video was shot

4
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:55,519
in New Orleans this one was shot in Cape

5
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:58,729
Town here are some clicker photos from

6
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:00,890
the guy in this video see how the

7
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,659
content of the video can change the web

8
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:04,909
page this is Will Ferrell dancing to

9
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:06,860
this exact song and here is what people

10
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,810
are saying about him on Twitter he also

11
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,110
has an article on wikipedia popcorn has

12
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,790
been used to show analysis of a

13
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,130
president speech to add value to a TV

14
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,979
show 2 mashup Donald Duck and glenn beck

15
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:20,990
and to understand the real justin

16
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,650
bieber's you even started working on a

17
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,270
graphical user interface for popcorn

18
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,329
called butter we have plugins for mini

19
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:31,790
web services already and popcorn is an

20
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,740
open source project that is evolving

21
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,320
constantly join us and let's make video

22
00:01:36,320 --> 00:02:14,210
and the web play nicely together

23
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:27,490
you

24
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,660
and this is kind of awkward because this

25
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,850
video is about man standing right over

26
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,800
there so it's like I think you might

27
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,480
have seen it once for who knows but this

28
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,430
actually just shows like us we've got

29
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:47,970
some plugins going on here we made that

30
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,570
video in at jquery conference in boston

31
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,959
in the fall just projecting some stuff

32
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,600
onto a screen during the party we can

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,120
add this wikipedia thing I mean this is

34
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:14,620
real casual so

35
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:25,560
it's very surreal it's a quick

36
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:44,339
demonstration of the declarative popcorn

37
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,489
that was me trying to be just as

38
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:49,400
controversial as Anton because we had

39
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,129
talks opposing each other at the jQuery

40
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:56,690
conference hey I can stir it up to trust

41
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,510
me and this everybody is a monkey riding

42
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,780
a dog actually was the demo for showing

43
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,260
how popcorn now supports YouTube and

44
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,530
Vimeo videos just as well as html5

45
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:35,030
videos so enjoy a monkey a dog yeah so

46
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,590
that was the monkey riding a dog thing

47
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,680
in case you were wondering oh god guys

48
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,160
stop talking to me on IRC it's kind of

49
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,590
funny mmm also this was kind of awesome

50
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,650
we had like a miniature conference in

51
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,710
New York at Tisch and I got paired up

52
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,710
with probably one of like the most

53
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,990
visionary kids I've ever met dude Greg

54
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,800
he had this idea like let's sync html5

55
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,320
video clips you know from like this Star

56
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,270
Trek trailer to wait a second this html5

57
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,490
or nurse from be taking machine I was

58
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,529
like you're nuts it's impossible

59
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:23,060
ain't no lower Concord

60
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,950
did that let me show you how it works

61
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:32,370
these keys cute wer you blah blah they

62
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,830
actually match up two instruments here

63
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,950
we can change what's going on but if I

64
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:45,450
do under you to do better so that's me

65
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,070
pressing buttons on the keyboard in case

66
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,180
you were wondering mhm so let's see here

67
00:05:51,180 --> 00:06:13,350
me actually throw down your like numeric

68
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,729
is going to raise

69
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:16,469
thinking about he's going to produce

70
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:18,510
next

71
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:23,100
under you plenty this is actually going

72
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,350
to the beat that's being produced down

73
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:29,250
here be fun / totally annoying so you

74
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,680

it's actually just going to sit here and

78
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,300
write some popcorn code using the API

79
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,660
for your entertainment purposes so you

80
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,210
can see basically how simple we have

00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,700
beaucoup with the help of some teams at

82
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,120
Mozilla made it to control html5 videos

83
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,780

84
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:15,810

immediately preceding the Great

141
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,040
Depression the halves are getting more

our economy is tanking it doesn't show

151
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,850
signs of improving their people losing

152
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,610
jobs our government responds to the

153
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,560
problems with bailouts and when you call

161
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,940
place where people work together in

162
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,610
peace and friendship and worship God and

163
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,160

184
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,210
night and this looks like a mirror we're

00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:13,399
more violent we have been tossed into

201
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:15,469
boiling water these people are

202
00:20:15,469 --> 00:20:18,950
cannibalizing random cannibalizing us

203
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,919
that's what Barack Obama is doing to the

204
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,159
American people I'm hoping the guy with

205
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:34,369
horns doesn't actually show up

206
00:20:34,379 --> 00:20:37,629
everything is about to change to the

207
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:41,169
extreme the insider extreme we invite

208
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:46,029
you to join up for 995 a month it's

209
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:48,220
gonna explain everything that is going

210
00:20:48,220 --> 00:21:14,230
on insider extreme is up and on hello

211
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,720
yes sick twisted freak and welcome to

212
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,159
the extremists who are you isn't that a

213
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:25,119
name of some stupid Disney curse you can

214
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,710
ask any question

215
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,130
Oh sucks to be you doesn't it when you

216
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:37,040
bought a house you bet that you could

217
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,170
pay it that nothing would happen it

218
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:44,600
happened you lost move on what boohoo

219
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,900
cry me a river hey I got an idea listen

220
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:58,700
to this get a job a lazy slob that

221
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,320
refuses to get off the couch and get a

222
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:24,220
job

223
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:30,590
I hope you enjoyed these snacks there

224
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:36,650
will be more later on so I was actually

225
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39,290
going to show a whole bunch of like like

226
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:43,309
artsy popcorn videos that were made at

227
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:45,350
butter camp in New York about a month

228
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:48,200
ago but I'm not gonna show that I'm

229
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,669
gonna save that for tomorrow what I am

230
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:51,500
going to show is probably the most

231
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,410
amazing thing you've ever seen in your

232
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:59,150
entire life so I'm not even really sure

233
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:03,260
how to introduce this aside from get

234
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,890
ready to have your goddamn mind blown up

235
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:10,160
max Ogden you want to stand up and a

236
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,299
prepare for takeoff all right everybody

237
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:17,419
this is what happens when you let

238
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:20,950
programmers play with Arduino 'he's a

239
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:25,100
potentiometer nodejs socket i/o and

240
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:29,020
popcorn Jas and YouTube all in the same

241
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:41,330
sentence uh excuse me just don't worry

242
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:56,419
about it max you wanna death are you

243
00:23:56,419 --> 00:24:03,700
doing that

244
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:16,070
oh god man what's up just in case you

245
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,690
guys are wondering he's using a soft

246
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:22,730
potentiometer over there to slide back

247
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,490
and forth except there was totally way

248
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:36,210
more awesome when yeah all right pause

249
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,320
know if you guys see that he's actually

250
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:48,390
doing that

251
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:55,220
mm-hmm are you doing that I wonder if

252
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,600
it's like trying to catch up with the

253
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,460
instructions this is pretty crazy we

254
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,640
just came up with this like about 45

255
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,590
minutes ago and hacked it together I

256
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:06,200
mean sorry hacking is so 1998 what I

257
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,180
meant to say was we artistic get

258
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,790
together we paint it we painted it with

259
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:15,500
our fingers oh and by the way that's

260
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:22,340
totally a monkey riding a damn goat this

261
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:30,080
is unbelievable if anybody wants to

262
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,730
actually come in like sit down and see

263
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,760
this afterwards we will most definitely

264
00:25:34,760 --> 00:26:01,190
accommodate yeah if you go see max you

265
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,530
can actually run the potentiometer

266
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:29,940
yourself

267
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:33,830
the future of remote control remote

268
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:49,020
controls will be taped to your keyboard

269
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:53,150
going to walk around at your level David

270
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,620
want to just come and check out in the

271
00:26:54,620 --> 00:27:08,259
lobby

272
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:23,699
did you do that tell you it was a long

273
00:27:23,699 --> 00:27:25,529
day with a lot of caffeine you know how

274
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:48,209
it go how do you do that I don't even

275
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:50,309
know how that works I didn't hear what

276
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:55,169
you said so anyway if you actually saw

277
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:56,969
the code managing this it's pretty

278
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:59,429
impressive I'll be it messy at the

279
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:01,769
moment but yeah come check us out we'll

280
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:03,029
be in lobby for the rest of this

281
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:06,029
intermission you can ask us questions

282
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:08,190
about what the hell it is we're talking

283
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:15,149
about what we did yeah all right okay

284
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:19,259
come on in I started doing this project

285
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:20,579
when I was like meeting with graffiti

286
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:22,289
writers and looking for a way to capture

287
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:24,569
an archive graffiti in a way that wasn't

288
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,519
just photos and video which is how

289
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:27,869
graffiti is typically been documented

290
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:29,729
part of the idea the software is that

291
00:28:29,729 --> 00:28:31,769
like graffiti writers don't see the

292
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:33,629
software they just write as normal and

293
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,339
it's about passively recording this data

294
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:38,069
and in the beginning I was just doing

295
00:28:38,069 --> 00:28:40,289
this myself about two years ago I

296
00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:42,209
released the software open source as an

297
00:28:42,209 --> 00:28:43,499
experimental trying to get more people

298
00:28:43,499 --> 00:28:45,479
involved in the software side and then

299
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:46,979
just the last six months of an

300
00:28:46,979 --> 00:28:48,479
experiment in low Earth opening up the

301
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:50,969
data and opening up the data has been

302
00:28:50,969 --> 00:28:52,889
much more interesting than opening up

303
00:28:52,889 --> 00:28:54,929
the software essentially I had all these

304
00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:56,519
files from meeting with graffiti writers

305
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:58,199
I was saving in this format that only my

306
00:28:58,199 --> 00:29:01,109
software was working with and now with

307
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:03,509
some friends we kind of defined what is

308
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:05,489
essentially a very simple XML file

309
00:29:05,489 --> 00:29:07,739
standard that it has a header and it has

310
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:09,329
some other things that are specific to

311
00:29:09,329 --> 00:29:10,889
different software but essentially it's

312
00:29:10,889 --> 00:29:13,290
just points with XY time

313
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,510
and z values there was a team of us that

314
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,920
that met up with this graffiti writer

315
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,340
named tenth one who was a like legendary

316
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,650
Los Angeles graffiti writer from the 90s

317
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,710
and he has ALS which is a like Lou

318
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,760
Gehrig's disease it's like a

319
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,440
degenerative disease that leaves you

320
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,290
paralyzed and so he has no motion except

321
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,970
for his eyes and so this software was

322
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,280
about creating an open source free

323
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,990
software suite that would allow him to

324
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,030
write graffiti with his eyes we were

325
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,340
using a playstation 3 camera mounting

326
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,110
into a pair of glasses to do I tracking

327
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,400
the second version that were going to be

328
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,870
releasing doesn't require it to be head

329
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,520
mounted anymore first iteration was

330
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,780
working with him as an artist to make

331
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,790
this piece for drawing graffiti second

332
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,020
version is hopefully going to be for

333
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,640
everybody else it's in a situation that

334
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,500
might not write graffiti but wants to

335
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,970
write emails I'm also part of the

336
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,440
graffiti research labs we've done the

337
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,180
laser tag project if you seen that one

338
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,760
where as a laser and you can hand it off

339
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,020
to graffiti writers and they write in

340
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,090
real time on buildings and so being a

341
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,920
part of all these different graffiti

342
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,600
related software packages that were open

343
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,100
source but not talking to each other

344
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,260
this graffiti markup language project is

345
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,730
about connecting all those things and so

346
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,790
essentially it's the least sexy part of

347
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,350
the project you know it's just a file

348
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,880
standard so it's actually kind of born

349
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,800
to talk about but it's allowed for all

350
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,570
these interesting things to happen which

351
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:27,030
is that like 10th for example is now

352
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,340
writing into a format that's the same as

353
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,830
like his friends in the scene that are

354
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,090
riding with a hand or running with the

355
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,160
can or running with a pen and so now the

356
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,230
data is saved in a similar format so we

357
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,000
can go and project temps tags the same

358
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,550
way that we're projecting other tags and

359
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,100
so it was the first step was getting all

360
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,780
the software i was working on connected

361
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,820
into this gml standard but now the next

362
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,650
step is I've been trying to like for

363
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,270
more of a community around this and even

364
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,520
though it's kind of a very niche sort of

365
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,230
a most ridiculous thing I find that it's

366
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,570
in people have sort of an interest in

367
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,860
graffiti there's sort of a pop culture

368
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,690
reference there and so I'm using this as

369
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,210
a way to get people even though even if

370
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,010
they have no interest in graffiti or

371
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,060
they have no interest in open-source

372
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,590
it's a good way of getting people

373
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,480
introduced to these things which I think

374
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,370
are so interesting if you want to get

375
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,650
the software I have it at graffiti

376
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:16,110
analysis com there's two sides of the

377
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,000
application there's one for capturing

378
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,340
and one for playback and so that so if

379
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,900
you want to do capturing it's this two

380
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,160
point O capture application and this one

381
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,790
runs on all the

382
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:30,000
various platforms and you don't really

383
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,370
need anything fancier than a laptop with

384
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,500
a built-in webcam to do the capturing

385
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,570
however when you're in situations like

386
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,850
this where you're sitting in semi direct

387
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,550
sunlight you get less control with the

388
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,500
webcam than you do with cameras that

389
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,340
have the ability to change to manually

390
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,230
the light level this is just an external

391
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:52,560
USB video so now that you've watched a

392
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,180
few minutes of this what you actually

393
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:58,220
saw there was a mash-up of popcorn j/s

394
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,350
synchronizing with the processing j/s

395
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,900
with GM l which is graffiti markup

396
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,660
language in those tags were actually

397
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,330
being drawn in real time with processing

398
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:13,410
and gml instructions in sync with the

399
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:17,070
video of course using popcorn Jas this

400
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:20,340
was a project that came from the the

401
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,130
mini comp we had in New York about a

402
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,710
month ago called butter camp so I'll be

403
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,420
quiet and turned volume back up and let

404
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:32,490
you continue watching and the more if

405
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,960
you're really looking for a precise

406
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,700
capture you want the camera really

407
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,890
perpendicular to the page and so this

408
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,840
goes over that capture system as well so

409
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,680
if you're interested in the more

410
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,110
advanced one I have I have a vector file

411
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,760
which I laser cutter you can just laser

412
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,740
cut them but really the parts are there

413
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,150
really simple to cut out just with foam

414
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:51,330
core the most expensive piece in the

415
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,830
building is capture case is just this

416
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,380
plexiglass which goes on the front this

417
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,060
is like super low tech and everything

418
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,040
but it gives you it gives you a really

419
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,080
nice just blank screen you can take the

420
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,480
page too so that when you're attaching a

421
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,040
light source of the graffiti marker the

422
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,750
lights going through the pages that have

423
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,090
reflected off of it I can show more

424
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,230
about this later I've actually been

425
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,360
using the behind the hand method more

426
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,070
and more lately because you can capture

427
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,380
in the street with like just 5 to 10

428
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,940
seconds setup work in the right scenario

429
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,010
so i'll show the behind the hand capture

430
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:21,780
method now which is a bit easier what

431
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,370
you're going to see in the upper left is

432
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,080
just the raw video stream that's coming

433
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,910
in from the camera to get a different

434
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,500
camera like right now I'm telling it to

435
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,910
bypass this camera and look for other

436
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,380
cameras but you don't have to worry

437
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,850
about that if you only have one camera

438
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,010
connected the first thing to do is when

439
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,420
this image comes up when you're getting

440
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,460
your raw feed in

441
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,559
this is why these cameras are so nice as

442
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,779
does that can like I can really control

443
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:43,520
how much lights coming in there's like

444
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,899
some blue and pink lines that are

445
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:46,880
showing what the software thinks is its

446
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,710
tracking right now the bottom screen is

447
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,029
showing what it thinks the light source

448
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:51,740
is what we want to see is like a nice

449
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,679
dime size perfect circle and that means

450
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:56,149
we're getting a good capture any light

451
00:33:56,149 --> 00:33:57,470
source you can get on can probably be

452
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,570
used as a tracking device i like to use

453
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,419
ones that have click button on and off i

454
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:04,220
usually mount the light source to the

455
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,960
top you want to keep the cameron away so

456
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,640
that the hand doesn't block the light

457
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,000
source so this part is not rocket

458
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,550
science but if there's like a chisel tip

459
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,080
I try to keep this mounted above the

460
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,490
chisel tip and then keep it pulled back

461
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:17,990
from the page enough that if someone's

462
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,490
using their if they're rotating their

463
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,500
hand they're not going to hit it but

464
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,839
again this is like pretty simple in a

465
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,169
bit of trial and error the brighter the

466
00:34:27,169 --> 00:34:29,300
light of course the more difference of

467
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,740
getting your threshold value between the

468
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,389
ambient light and the light that's being

469
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:34,099
tracked if you just look at this window

470
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:35,839
you can see this is obviously not a

471
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,669
clean capture when I have this situation

472
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:40,129
I can usually adjust this down and just

473
00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:41,810
by using the camera not even using aim

474
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,040
this software you can see I'm already

475
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,419
starting to get a pretty clean capture

476
00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:46,339
right there's not a lot of like fancy

477
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:47,720
settings in this app but the one that

478
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,820
we're going to really be caring about is

479
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,619
this threshold this is doing a similar

480
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:53,149
thing to opening up the Lightning camera

481
00:34:53,149 --> 00:34:55,339
but it's just saying how different is

482
00:34:55,339 --> 00:34:57,170
this pixel from the pixels surrounding

483
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,119
it and based on that level it's going to

484
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,220
say use it or don't use it right now I'm

485
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,990
actually pretty close like I'm getting a

486
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,820
pretty decent capture with the way it is

487
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,920
I would call this off work on set you

488
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,599
can click save and then if it crashes

489
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:10,700
will have the sayings there's two loads

490
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,260
one for capturing behind the hand and

491
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,089
one for capturing through a piece of

492
00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:16,369
glass right now if I move from left to

493
00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:18,349
right on the page I can see that my

494
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:19,730
track is moving from left to right in

495
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:22,010
the page also but if I move the camera

496
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,300
two behind I'm going to want that to

497
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,210
reverse and so in the second tab you can

498
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,339
just hit flip x and then if we're set up

499
00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:30,530
in the other mode it'll work from from

500
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,630
the mirrored perspective enter advances

501
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,830
you through the different modes in the

502
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:37,609
software so if I hit return then i'm

503
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:39,589
going to start recording so usually I'll

504
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:41,060
meet with the graffiti writer and I'll

505
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,859
just say ok start writing and I'll start

506
00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:45,109
recording and another enter to stop it

507
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:46,490
leaves recording mode and it goes into

508
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,859
an edit mode the Z is kind of linear so

509
00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:50,150
it says if you're writing on a page

510
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,859
kind of constantly pulling away it's

511
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:53,569
kind of about data visualization so it's

512
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:54,799
about trying to understand more about

513
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:56,839
how the ink is layering up but also from

514
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:58,339
an editing standpoint it makes it easier

515
00:35:58,339 --> 00:35:59,450
because you can kind of see where

516
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,980
everything is beginning and ending all

517
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,200
the panning and zooming and tilting all

518
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,819
happens between left click and right

519
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:12,500
clicking and dragging so by clicking and

520
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,270
dragging these two points that can I can

521
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,010
set what was junk at the beginning what

522
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,720
was junk at the end and you can name the

523
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,180
file here and then when you hit enter

524
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,740
again it will take you into a playback

525
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,059
mode and show you what you've captured

526
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:25,760
at this point it's also saved the dot

527
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,069
GML file to the the root directory of

528
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:34,520
the app is running in I'll just get some

529
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:39,170
data so I'll call this one test GML so f

530
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,990
will pop it back out a full screen under

531
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,329
tags there's a folder with the name that

532
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:46,099
I just name the file and so here's the

533
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:49,130
gml file the idea is that you open this

534
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,049
up and it's kind of human readable like

535
00:36:51,049 --> 00:36:52,789
it's meant to be kind of like

536
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:55,039
introductory like hobbyist hackers

537
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:56,960
hobbyist programmers to get involved

538
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,180
with this the playback mode has some

539
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,799
functionality that the recording mode

540
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:02,960
doesn't have the kind of basic way the

541
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,900
visualization is working is besides the

542
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,000
deep Z dimension which is meant to like

543
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,440
give you some more understanding of how

544
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,569
this ink is layering up it's it's not

545
00:37:11,569 --> 00:37:13,520
meant to represent the actual ink that's

546
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,109
on the page it's meant to represent the

547
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:17,119
motion of the tag that that's one reason

548
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,680
also you're capturing a single line

549
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,630
there's of course other software's that

550
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,460
can capture multiple strokes but for my

551
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,020
interest I like recording all the

552
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,609
movements like when the pen comes up and

553
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:27,200
moves to the other side graffiti is very

554
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,880
dictated by like riding in a very

555
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,980
specific place at a specific time and so

556
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,599
the ink on the wall is like not just

557
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:34,190
about someone's vision of what a

558
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,809
graffiti tag should look like it's like

559
00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:37,670
dictated by you know who's walking

560
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,990
around the corner what part of town is

561
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,760
it in like you have like five to ten

562
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,500
seconds to make this form and so for me

563
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,720
capturing all that motion was just an

564
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,220
interest from a research standpoint and

565
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,420
so that's why I'm getting all the

566
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,039
movements so even when the pens up the

567
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:50,660
thinner the line is the faster the pen

568
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,890
was moving so even when this isn't

569
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,450
playing back you can get some sense of

570
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,549
like the motion and then these the

571
00:37:55,549 --> 00:37:56,839
particles that are getting thrown off

572
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:58,400
our kind of based on velocities you

573
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,349
round a corner very smoothly for example

574
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:02,090
you get this even throw of particles

575
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:04,100
if you had a jagged one you get a spike

576
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,020
the intent is meant to sort of just

577
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,790
amplify that motion it's all about like

578
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,500
trying to see this sort of like dance

579
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,180
that happens when no one's looking right

580
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,160
so that's the basic functionality the

581
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,960
playback mode there's some other things

582
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,150
that you can turn on like there's an

583
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,980
audio setting that'll just take the

584
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,300
audio from the mic and you can get

585
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,280
interaction with so if you're projecting

586
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,690
this outside you can be picking up

587
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,730
ambient things there's also setting more

588
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,320
settings for doing things outside with

589
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,090
it there's an architectural interface so

590
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,380
good graffiti writers aren't just

591
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,940
slapping stuff up anywhere they're very

592
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,920
conscious of like what the architecture

593
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,210
is what the structures are how they're

594
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,830
fitting in and so the software is meant

595
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,930
to work the same way also so if we're

596
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,220
going to project here there's a way

597
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,350
where you can tell the software where

598
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,910
all these corners are like where the

599
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,560
edges are so that when it's when it's

600
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,120
playing back it can interact with that

601
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,830
there's also this warping mode so that

602
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,140
you can if you're projecting at an angle

603
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,550
we're projecting on a surface that isn't

604
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,440
true you can you can set this so that

605
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,840
it's like you can deal with this outside

606
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,520
of the sort of key stoning functionality

607
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,560
the projector so the way the basic way

608
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,000
the architecture settings work is if

609
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,830
you're projecting on something it just

610
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,600
gives me like a simple drawing interface

611
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,700
and I'd outline all these shapes it just

612
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,470
takes about a minute or two and then

613
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,230
when I hit save the software knows that

614
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,120
those angles are to be recognized as a

615
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,720
Ledge so that then when the particles

616
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,830
are interacting with it will start

617
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,420
bouncing off that surface and it's a

618
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,860
little bit of a visual trick and it's

619
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,060
not super high-tech course there's

620
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,530
people doing like much more advanced

621
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,630
stuff with like projection mapping stuff

622
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,550
but it's just a way to like tie in the

623
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,860
graffiti tags to like the environment

624
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,750
and a little bit more graffiti analysis

625
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,010
is kind of the first thing that I made

626
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:36,320
as an open source software example but

627
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,430
now that so many other people are

628
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,750
building this and trying to point to

629
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,520
what others are making as well that use

630
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,710
the same format because now once you

631
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,120
have that file you can pipe it into all

632
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,340
these different places and so I'm

633
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,840
starting to archive that at graffiti

634
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,300
markup language com and so this is a

635
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,880
place that's pointing to all the

636
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,230
projects that i'm finding on the web

637
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,580
some of them me some of my friends

638
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:59,810
images so there's uh one more demo that

639
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,220
i want to actually jump to so i'm going

640
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,650
to cut this one short but actually just

641
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:07,460
discovered yesterday thought it's pretty

642
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:23,160
cool so give me a second to find it so

643
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:27,680
so this is actually somebody used

644
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,290
popcorn jss sort of a production tool

645
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:33,350
and everything is then been synthesized

646
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:36,380
into and packaged into a single video

647
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,750
which is really interesting or

648
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:42,760
interesting use of the technology so

649
00:40:42,760 --> 00:42:34,150
enjoy

650
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,780
so you get the idea that's pretty cool

651
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,840
stuff I'm actually going to part ways

652
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,890
with you know and i'll see you guys all

653
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,620
at five o'clock for the last

654
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:50,170
installation of snacks with popcorn jas

655
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:53,760
this is a two-part deal for the first

656
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,180
part if you're easily offended by vulgar

657
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:02,130
words like the S or f words I'd like to

658
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,570
ask you to leave the room for maybe the

659
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:07,440
next three minutes or earmuffs even so

660
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,960
this is a sorry about the ScreenFlow

661
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,880
demo I didn't make this but this is

662
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,160
totally awesome i found this on twitter

663
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,770
yesterday this is the result of some

664
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:24,060
pretty fun stuff that somebody took the

665
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,030
time and screencast themselves creating

666
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:30,180
a popcorn project it's a minute and 20

667
00:43:30,180 --> 00:44:13,430
seconds long let's watch it he left us

668
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:22,080
oh shit

669
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:32,650
oh this is daddy why aren't you smiling

670
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:35,650
oh shit particular by other people

671
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,660
messing with their shit I mean shit you

672
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,720
wouldn't be Vicky yeah I didn't open up

673
00:44:40,720 --> 00:45:03,520
shit shit sweet right there pretty

674
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:12,060
awesome right all right and for but I

675
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:17,980
did that again hold on and for the very

676
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:21,670
last thing this is a pretty tremendous

677
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:25,000
and I'm totally stoked that I get to

678
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:36,970
show this off let's go on so everybody

679
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:38,820
here is familiar with the Khan Academy

680
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:44,320
ya know maybe whatever so basically this

681
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,060
demonstration was created by David

682
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:49,390
Humphrey and Bobby rector of Mozilla at

683
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:53,070
the Seneca College in Toronto and

684
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:56,530
through the seedot program and what

685
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:58,390
they've done is they've taken a Khan

686
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:01,170
Academy one of the one of their

687
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:04,030
educational videos and they've made it

688
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:05,850
into an interactive educational

689
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:10,060
experience so I'm actually going to demo

690
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:13,510
said experience for you live here which

691
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:15,130
is pretty awesome this is actually just

692
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:19,360
published i think hours ago uh or was

693
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:24,760
yeah yeah hours ago so i'm going to shut

694
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:29,430
the mic off and jump to this one awesome

695
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:34,900
all right here we go where we left off

696
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,130
in the last video I think we're getting

697
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,590
a reasonably good appreciation for how

698
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:42,040
huge the Sun is especially relative to

699
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,430
the earth and how far the earth is away

700
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,410
from the Sun that most of these diagrams

701
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:49,690
that we see when we in science textbooks

702
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:51,820
they don't give justice in fact you know

703
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:54,040
when I showed it this this Sun over here

704
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,930
that was about five or six inches across

705
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:57,880
I said you would be just this little

706
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:01,090
speck about that 40 feet the entire

707
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:03,250
piece this is would be but right to the

708
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:05,500
left right or would have a radius its

709
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,510
orbit would have a radius of about four

710
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:09,010
dancing song this you know you wouldn't

711
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:10,600
even notice it if you were looking at

712
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,800
this thing over here would be this

713
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,350
little speck orbiting at this huge huge

714
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:16,690
distance if you look at this Sun over

715
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:18,550
here this Sun over here if I were to

716
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,080
draw the whole Sun it looks like would

717
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,400
have a it looks like i would have a

718
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,260
diameter of about 20 inches so in this

719
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,930
situation in this situation this earth

720
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:28,330
right here this is drawn to scale this

721
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:30,070
earth would not be anywhere near this

722
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,470
close it would be it would be about

723
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:36,690
about 200 feet that way or about the

724
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,859
60-meter so you can imagine if the right

725
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:41,109
was this size this is all synchronized

726
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:42,520
to this video down in the corner this

727
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,680
little speck of an earth this little

728
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,480
thing right here would be sitting on

729
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,100
wouldn't even not wouldn't even notice

730
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,840
it this is you you might notice this

731
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,980
from a distance but you wouldn't even

732
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,630
see this thing over here and the other

733
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:54,550
planets are even further well not all of

734
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:55,810
the other planets obviously you have

735
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:58,390
mercury you have mercury here I'll drink

736
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:59,380
a little bit i'll just list them here

737
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,900
just in case that's mercury if it's not

738
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,119
debated whether it's a planet pluto is

739
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:06,340
the smallest but some people debate

740
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,230
whether it's really a planet or kind of

741
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:10,060
just you're a dwarf planet or on any of

742
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,530
those types of things but then you have

743
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:14,440
Venus probably the closest in size to

744
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,119
the earth or it is the closest in size

745
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:19,990
of the earth and then you have Mars and

746
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:23,530
then you have one son then Jupiter is

747
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:25,660
five times further than Earth so this

748
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,940
would be this if I were to actually do

749
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,740
this the scale distance this would be

750
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:34,180
300 meters away 300 meters so if I had a

751
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:37,660
nice big maybe medicine bald sighs son

752
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,700
right over here maybe basketball-sized a

753
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,290
little bit bigger than a basketball this

754
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:43,270
looks on my screen then I would have I

755
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:45,160
would put this little this little thing

756
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,140
that's smaller than a ping-pong ball i

757
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:49,060
would put this three football fields

758
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:52,600
away that's how far there is and then

759
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,460
Saturn's about twice as far as that

760
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,470
Saturn is about nine times the distance

761
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:58,990
let me let me make it clear this is the

762
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:01,180
earth is one after thatl unit away

763
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,250
everything runs synchronized its launch

764
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,290
the video perfectly tire educational

765
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:07,660
experience is broken out of the corner

766
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,310
binds a prog taken on the whole screen

767
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:12,010
5s completely interact astronomical unit

768
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:13,780
so a little bit more than five times the

769
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,630
distance of the Sun to the earth and

770
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:19,290
Saturn Saturn is approximately nine

771
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:22,150
astronomical units or nine times the

772
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:25,119
distance from the Sun to the earth so

773
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:27,130
once again this would be nine football

774
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,210
fields away or another way to think

775
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:29,980
about it be essentially a kilometer away

776
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,980
if we had a kind of a medicine ball size

777
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:36,190
son this little smaller than a pink pong

778
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:39,730
bald Saturn would be a kilometer away

779
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:42,400
then I just want it really so you can

780
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,170
see how this could have tremendous

781
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:46,270
impact and obviously not just education

782
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:49,570
but any sort of forward thinking

783
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:53,109
progressive media interaction that might

784
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:55,480
take the place of a long-standing

785
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:59,619
juggernaut in the field I don't know

786
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:01,840
possibly flash a lot of these things can

787
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,570
be achieved and thoroughly believe that

788
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:06,280
popcorn j/s could be the foundation for

789
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,590
that once again this demonstration was

790
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:10,570
created by David Humphrey and Bobby

791
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:14,170
Richter of Mozilla tremendous work these

792
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:17,290
guys are amazing and with that i'm going

793
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:20,970
to say goodnight to all of you roads

794
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:27,280
take me home to the place I belong hold
