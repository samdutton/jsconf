00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:23,699

everyone hello there my name is miles I

2
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,720
work at a company called famous

3
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,029
industries heading up the famous org

4
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:32,500
project believe it or not but I actually

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,470
got into programming through music and

6
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,860
art this is an example of one of my

7
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,579
installations that I did in my undergrad

8
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,809
it was called string theory it involved

9
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,079
cnc milling a bunch of wood a whole

10
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,690
bunch string a lot of string some lasers

11
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,129
some water some cold rolled steel I have

12
00:00:57,129 --> 00:00:59,680
some scars from learning to weld it was

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,660
a great project and it involved

14
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,089
internally a bit of code with an Arduino

15
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:07,240
a bit of like hacking with the DMX

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,880
protocol it was just like I actually

17
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,550
found art was a really great way to

18
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,759
learn about coat and learn about systems

19
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,490
and how to build these large things

20
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,750
another project that I did was the

21
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,840
speaker bot this is a really quick demo

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:35,289
so I'll just let it play out so the

23
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:37,599
speaker bot had an embedded Linux system

24
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,489
and a Wi-Fi router in it and then there

25
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:41,530
was a connect hidden in the wall and so

26
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,750
using Skelton tracking I was able to

27
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,729
essentially make like a little theremin

28
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:49,270
type device another project that I did

29
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,190
was the voxel meter this is a fun

30
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,610
project using voxels to represent sound

31
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,590
and so what we're going to be talking

32
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,840
about today is a little bit of kind of

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,330
what what you're seeing visualized here

34
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,879
what does that mean what is sampling how

35
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,950
does audio get represented digitally on

36
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,739
a system so actually I should probably

37
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:11,890
pause that great so all of this started

38
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,590
with the device called a mano it's a

39
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,030
grid of buttons it does absolutely

40
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,950
nothing unless you program it to do

41
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,170
things and through that I learned a

42
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,840
programming language called max/msp it's

43
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,099
a visually based programming language

44
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:25,360
node based programming it's

45
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,970
really fantastic if you're an artist or

46
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,710
you know someone who's an artist or

47
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,740
wants to learn about sound or music or

48
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,110
GL it's a really great platform for

49
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,160
learning this it also allows access to

50
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,200
the entire internal API through

51
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,090
JavaScript and this is one of the ways

52
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,990
in which I originally got into

53
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,640
JavaScript was actually scripting in

54
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,510
max/msp for making installation art it

55
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,010
also if any of you are music producers

56
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,810
and use Ableton you can use Mac's to

57
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,940
control all of Ableton and all its inner

58
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,890
workings and this is just an example of

59
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,540
you know like how hairy a patch can get

60
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,790
it's a really kind of crazy way of

61
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,130
programming and if you thought you know

62
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,660
closures shifting right was bad just

63
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,200
look at some crazy max code but so my

64
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,570
love of music and technology brought me

65
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,489
to California to study at Karma the

66
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:13,840
Center for computer research and music

67
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,390
and acoustics wellick arm I had an

68
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,610
opportunity to learn about sound the

69
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,890
math behind it physics behind it how we

70
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,959
compute it Electrical Engineering and

71
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,700
most interestingly you know like how our

72
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,050
brains interpret sound so this brings us

73
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,790
to the topic that we're going to be

74
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,830
looking at today which is what is

75
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,170
sampling and so many of you might think

76
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,150
that I'm talking about sampling like in

77
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,820
the classic MPC sense of sampling blocks

78
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,350
of sound but that's not what we're

79
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,000
actually talking about today it's

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,140
technically correct but we're going to

81
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,580
go a little deeper we're going to talk

82
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,269
about sampling sound in the sense of

83
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,040
sampling individual chunks of sound so

84
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,860
that we can represent it digitally so a

85
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,720
definition of sampling is sampling as a

86
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,840
method of converting data converting an

87
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,600
analog signal to digital data digital

88
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,220
data which can eventually be turned back

89
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,910
into an analog signal so well we can

90
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,260
make sample many things today we're

91
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,400
going to specifically talk about

92
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,340
sampling sound so you can also sample

93
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,890
any sort of signal and a signal could be

94
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,019
you know like a potentiometer or a

95
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,930
button or a twitter feed could be

96
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,400
considered a signal I mean if you get

97
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,050
into really deep in sample theory like

98
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,970
everything is a signal and everything

99
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,960
can be sampled but we sample sound every

100
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,400
single time we make a digital recording

101
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,530
an unlike analog recording which happens

102
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,120
in constant time a digital recording

103
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,129
needs to be represented in sample blocks

104
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:41,709
you can kind of think of a sample as a

105
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:47,139
pixel for sound so I'm going to give you

106
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:49,749
a bit of a primer on some sound terms

107
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:51,669
that we're going to use to make sure

108
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:53,229
that you're all on the same page as me

109
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:55,839
as we're getting started sample rate

110
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,249
you're going to hear this a lot and the

111
00:04:57,249 --> 00:04:58,899
sample rate is the number of samples

112
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,509
used to represent a second of sound and

113
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,449
a common sample rate is 44.1 thousand

114
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:06,369
samples and we're going to get into that

115
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:09,819
and why that is that number in a bit bit

116
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:11,740
depth and the bit depth is the number of

117
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,409
bits that's used per sample to encode

118
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:18,330
the data a common bit depth is 16 bits

119
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,610
codec a codec is an algorithm used to

120
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,189
encode a signal into digital data a very

121
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:28,360
common codec that we use is mp3 so let's

122
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,889
tie all of those things together and

123
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:31,599
kind of like figure out how this works

124
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:34,449
and we'll start by talking about a CD so

125
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:37,959
it's ed is encoded using PCM at 16 bits

126
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:42,300
per sample at 44100 samples per second

127
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,969
the algorithm is called PCM and it

128
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:48,429
involves basically taking each channel

129
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:50,229
and encoding it as a floating point

130
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:53,110
number between minus 1 and 1 there's

131
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,519
this is a floating-point way of

132
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,050
representing it there's integer

133
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,579
algorithms as well but this is just like

134
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:00,009
the simplest agrestic rock so we're just

135
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:01,929
going to talk about that and you can

136
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:03,879
actually think about PCM encoding as an

137
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:06,429
array and each channel gets interleaved

138
00:06:06,429 --> 00:06:08,829
so we can think about the array of

139
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:11,439
samples that are on a CD as the first

140
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,999
sample left channel than the first

141
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:14,289
sample the right channel all the way to

142
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:15,699
like n number of samples that you have

143
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,699
in your recording and so this will be

144
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:20,829
referred to as a lossless form of

145
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:23,139
encoding I mean it's not entirely

146
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:25,240
lossless when you sample a nun sample

147
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,059
like that does disrupt the signal but as

148
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:30,309
far as encoding methods are concerned

149
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:34,059
PCM is considered lossless a form of

150
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:37,089
lossy encoding would be mp3 mp3 actually

151
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:39,819
uses a variety of heuristics based on

152
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:41,679
Psychlo acoustics to essentially say hey

153
00:06:41,679 --> 00:06:42,849
we don't need all these bits and throw

154
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:44,379
them out and then like it's actually

155
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:48,309
lossy so there are limitations to

156
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:49,809
sampling though and those limitations

157
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,789
are part of the reason why we have these

158
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:52,540
random number

159
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:57,070
like 44100 so this makes sense to

160
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:02,290
everyone right no okay this something

161
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,260
that's called the Nyquist limit its name

162
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,780
it after Harold Nyquist his work was

163
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,520
built upon by Claude Shannon creating

164
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,690
what we know today is the fields of

165
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:15,730
sampling and information theory yeah the

166
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,040
Nyquist limit like really simply states

167
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,800
that the rate in which you sample a

168
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,810
system will dictate the maximum

169
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,310
frequency that can be represented in

170
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,240
that system so at 44100 we can only

171
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,730
represent samples and frequencies up to

172
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,660
20 2050 which sounds like kind of a

173
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,820
random number and anything higher than

174
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,800
that actually gets aliased around back

175
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,470
to the beginning and we'll come back to

176
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,550
that again and that's kind of like I'm

177
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:47,200
Metta thing but so 44.1 kilohertz not

178
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,570
gigawatts it's the standard sampling

179
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,620
rate used in audio but why it's actually

180
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,650
the human ear is the reason so the human

181
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,600
here only the human ear only hears

182
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,450
frequencies up to and around 20,000

183
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,050
Hertz so because of that we can know and

184
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,670
it's just a basic heuristic well there's

185
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,310
no need to encode any more samples we

186
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,380
could take 44100 samples we can

187
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,140
represent signals up to 20,000 Hertz and

188
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,520
pretty much everything that was in the

189
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,380
signal that a human would hear would be

190
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,450
represent would be represented it's an

191
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,310
optimization for compression it

192
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,840
minimizes the data that we need about

193
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,500
the samples so you may ask why would we

194
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,890
sample higher so some recording studios

195
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,540
will actually record at 96 kilohertz

196
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,120
this partially allows you to avoid

197
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,430
aliasing in 96 kilohertz I have a

198
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,169
diagram here to show it gives you a lot

199
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:39,880
more Headroom so you'll have what's

200
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,680
known as like supersonic noise that will

201
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,479
end up in a signal so if you're doing

202
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,040
like live recording in a studio one

203
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,540
thing you may want to do is actually

204
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,450
like record your drums at 96 k do a

205
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,330
filter of those top samples and then

206
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,460
sample down to 40 41 so you don't end up

207
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,170
having those high frequencies aliasing

208
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,330
and creating noise now when you just

209
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,740
have one signal it doesn't really make a

210
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,940
big difference but as you start

211
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,640
combining 5 10 15 different signals all

212
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,370
that noise starts adding up and you

213
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,630
start having a recording that doesn't

214
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,420
sound very professional so what is a a

215
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,250
lower sample rate sound like that's a

216
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,440
really interesting question a telephone

217
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,570
a telephone actually filters are

218
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,520
actually samples things at 8,000 Hertz

219
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,240
and I've got a really great live demo to

220
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,140
show us so here is an example of a

221
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,080
recording of a voicemail message sample

222
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:37,570
dick 44 1

223
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,660
I must be out or I pick up the phone

224
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:48,870
where could I

225
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,160
so if we were to resample that at 8,000

226
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,450
Hertz we're going to notice it actually

227
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,160
sounds exactly the way we would expect

228
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:06,530
it to sound on a telephone I must be out

229
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:16,220
all right pick up the phone

230
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,200
and that's actually not random that

231
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,450
phone is sampled at 8,000 Hertz the

232
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,160
human voice most of what is part of the

233
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,260
human voice that the ear recognizes sits

234
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,810
around you know like 3,000 to 4,000

235
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,610
Hertz so there's no real reason to

236
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,070
encode all that extra information and by

237
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,990
only encoding at 8,000 Hertz we could

238
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,670
send a whole bunch more data over the

239
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,220
water so let's go back to the human ear

240
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,080
and like let's get into some really cool

241
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,370
stuff and talk about what might why

242
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,120
music works so the human ear inside the

243
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,070
cochlea actually has an exponential

244
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,570
response so you have all these little

245
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,430
hairs so if we go and look at that

246
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,050
diagram starting at the center the hairs

247
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,850
kind of go out and they react to

248
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,880
frequencies in an exponential pattern so

249
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,610
as it goes out you know the response

250
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,680
rate I'm just describing something by

251
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,090
saying what I said it doesn't really

252
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,950
help so I'll actually show some diagrams

253
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,920
so an example would be a for the note a

254
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,930
4 is 440 Hertz the note a 5 is 880 hurts

255
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,730
this is like really crazy when you think

256
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,530
about it because as we actually

257
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,510
experience sound exponentially we

258
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,820
experience pitch linearly so there's

259
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,680
actually like this tie between an

260
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,270
empirical fact and kind of like an

261
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,240
emotional response as frequency grows

262
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,770
exponentially we experience pitch

263
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,800
linearly boom like that is so cool and

264
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,660
like all of music is built on top of

265
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,600
this this idea it was actually

266
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,310
originally discovered by Pythagoras as

267
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,400
far as I know and he discovered what we

268
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,620
allot of what we now have created and

269
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,980
know as the Western musical canon the

270
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,610
chromatic scale Pythagoras the diatonic

271
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:55,310
scale Pythagoras the circle of fifths

272
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,170
Pythagoras the greatest musical

273
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,510
achievement in the modern era well that

274
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,370
was actually fishes set to rotation jam

275
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,290
during deer creek sunday august 10th

276
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:08,310
1997 but yeah like they couldn't have

277
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,630
done that if it wasn't for Pythagoras

278
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,690
musical notes as we know them have

279
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,880
existed longer as a means of

280
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:24,760
communication than the English language

281
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,450
that's like crazy that gets me like so

282
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,010
excited it's like the idea that if

283
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,150
you're like playing guitar and you're

284
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,560
playing in a key that's like positive

285
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,120
like that's been communication between

286
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,510
people longer than the English language

287
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,190
now I know I'm probably wrapping up like

288
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,010
way quickly here wow it's been like 13

289
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,340
minutes I'm supposed to have 30 but I

290
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,690
think that's all that I have right now

291
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,720
on paper but that does give us time I

292
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,120
think for a couple questions about music

293
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,580
and sound if anyone has any but that's

294
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,590
all that I have for right now thank you

295
00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:15,150
all go oh yes mm-hmm I can do a live

296
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:23,370
demo so you mentioned max/msp as in a

297
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,100
really great environment for artists to

298
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,410
look into music I was wondering what

299
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,550
kind of capabilities you had in that

300
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,290
yeah totally I'll just do a quick live

301
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,600
demo because we've got a bit of time so

302
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:46,690
let's take a look so this is max

303
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,000
we can go and we can start a new project

304
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,640
and we can start by just making a cycle

305
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,030
at 440 Hertz and we'll connect that to

306
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:07,850
the output we got some sound going so

307
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,170
what we can do that's really interesting

308
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,360
too is like any time you're actually

309
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,790
changing the amplitude is just

310
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,700
multiplying so we can take you know the

311
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,230
output of this and put it into a

312
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:24,110
multiplier here we can connect it then

313
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,120
we can make another cycle that's running

314
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,520
it like 10 Earth's we can connect that

315
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,840
and multiply by it and now we're going

316
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,620
to get amplitude modulation

317
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,390
and then we can take you know another

318
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,800
one of these and we can do frequency

319
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,610
modulation as well so we take another

320
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,890
cycle will put it through like a number

321
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,800
object turn that signal into like an

322
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,310
actual number then we want to do we want

323
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:56,010
to take it we want to add one to it so

324
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,780
that it's not zero based anymore and

325
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:16,860
then we can multiply it by like 220

326
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,130
we can just start kind of like changing

327
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:39,439
that

328
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:41,429
we could like literally just copy this

329
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:44,089
whole thing we can encapsulate it

330
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:47,540
we can duplicate it

331
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,860
add another one

332
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,110
popping this one

333
00:15:53,120 --> 00:16:33,360
change this one to be like

334
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:43,130
that's music I guess so this is the

335
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,420
monome that I was talking before and

336
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,560
just let me know when we need to stop

337
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,210
because I'll just keep going so I built

338
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,330
this one a couple years ago I think I

339
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,640
can just kind of like yeah so the case

340
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,500
comes out and there's like electronics

341
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,400
in there it's really pretty and so the

342
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,950
case the top part is steel milled

343
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,440
aluminum and then this was like hand

344
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,170
routed it actually was another ma noms

345
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,760
case and then I got it secondhand

346
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,500
through a form you could tell the edges

347
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,390
where I roughly routed it to shove this

348
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,690
case in so that it all fit so we plug

349
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:20,300
this in it's going to give a light and

350
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,620
so there's some fun things that we can

351
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,600
do like really quickly with this so we

352
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,700
can open up monome cereal which is this

353
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,740
communicates the computer through cereal

354
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,810
monome cereal picks up the serial

355
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,190
communication and then converts that

356
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,860
into osc which is open sound control

357
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,660
it's an alternative to MIDI it's really

358
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,180
nice because it does everything over UDP

359
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,190
so you can do a lot more than you can

360
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,130
with MIDI MIDI you really only have like

361
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,200
128 messages osc is kind of like

362
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,700
infinite so here's an example of a patch

363
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,930
for a spectrometer so we can go and grab

364
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,310
my voice and then we can just see like

365
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:03,260
really quickly that and this is this is

366
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,790
like totally building on everything that

367
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,040
we were talking about earlier too we're

368
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,070
taking a sample of my voice we're

369
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,540
putting them through a Fourier transform

370
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,640
and so a Fourier transform what it's

371
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,890
going to do is going to take the sound

372
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,600
that's currently being represented in

373
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,430
the time domain is going to put it

374
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,020
through a transform and represent it in

375
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,670
the frequency domain so each one of

376
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,440
these bins is actually representing a

377
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,720
chunk of frequencies and then over time

378
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,850
were able to basically say hey you know

379
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,170
like I just care about the granularity

380
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,540
of an eight-by-eight grid and so we can

381
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,430
kind of like take a look at max

382
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,410
programming a little bit here if we dig

383
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,470
in this was this patch was written by

384
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:42,050
Brian Crabtree was online noticed n teh

385
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:45,440
n is the creator of the mono he's really

386
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,590
cool guy that this is basically

387
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,460
what's going on under the hood which you

388
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,560
know makes a ton of sense but I mean

389
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,880
like there's other fun things that we

390
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,280
could do to so like in Ableton for

391
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,310
example let's see if this works I can go

392
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:09,290
to my mu max for live folder I have this

393
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,510
one thing I really love using called

394
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:15,860
Raptor we throw a raptor in here that's

395
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:21,170
not raptor that's Raptors so there's

396
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,140
raptor and i connect raptor to the

397
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,880
monome and now it shouldn't be yeah

398
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,830
that's exactly what I'm expecting and we

399
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,720
can go and grab like there's this synth

400
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,600
I really love I'm called boards and it's

401
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,830
like a boards of canada ripoff

402
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:37,280
instrument everything sounds good like

403
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,750
you don't even need to like think it's

404
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,880
just like you throw this in i'm going to

405
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,710
like make up like a hit right now it's

406
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:52,940
amazing so raptor like i'm not a huge

407
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,550
fan of see so let's go into G and we'll

408
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,860
set up this loop group to be four bars

409
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:34,730
so we can kind of start

410
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,940
so we can kind of just like let that go

411
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,940
and just duplicate it and then just like

412
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,380
put in another syntha someone made that

413
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,970
I don't have to think about like we'll

414
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,620
just do something that has the word base

415
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:49,390
in it down that's not easy well you know

416
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,830
what's actually really great for not

417
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,300
having to think of it I really love not

418
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,870
thinking about things there isn't it the

419
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,880
instrument racking here has these like

420
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,680
evolving sits that are really awesome

421
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:08,920
yeah these rhythmic ones know the

422
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,920
ambient involving yeah something like

423
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:53,080
that it's gonna be music

424
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:59,450
you

425
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,409
what's awesome is out of everyone in

426
00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:02,160
there

427
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,990
track so i can just go and

428
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:17,149
we put him on time

429
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:22,140
it's the one analytical GG

430
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,809
you know what my able to do

431
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:44,010
yeah yeah you know the rest on backwards

432
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,550
you got together always good

433
00:22:48,550 --> 00:23:44,510
yo

434
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,510
so something like that you can do really

435
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:57,260
easily are there any other questions I

436
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,830
cool i'll call it now thank you so much
