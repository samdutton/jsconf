1
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:18,890

so as just mentioned I'm a designer a UX

2
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,529
designer I work at no Jitsu a company

3
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:23,779
which does cloud orchestration software

4
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:26,960
but and now I also organize JavaScript

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,189
meetups in Poland in Krakow and I also

6
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:36,460
helped run the number mattress nodejs

7
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,940
evangelism company sort of kinda so to

8
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,530
help with jQuery right

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,409
I mean jQuery sucks are you a real

10
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:49,100
programmer or jQuery programmer right am

11
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:49,489
i right

12
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:51,469
are you agreeing with me we're Chris

13
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:59,840
with me okay no like are you insane man

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,079
okay let me tell you a story I'm a

15
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,660
designer I'm not a JavaScript developer

16
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,250
which is kind of weird because I met Jay

17
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,910
as confroy so when I started designing

18
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,729
which out when I started designing I

19
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:16,910
also started thinking okay so I should

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,910
be able to code my designs right I think

21
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,349
that every designers come to this

22
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:24,920
conclusion right so I started coding I

23
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,330
learned Fernan a CSS HTML and then I

24
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,429
started working at new Jitsu

25
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:34,759
so no Jitsu is a really cool company and

26
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,810
they're full of really good nodejs

27
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,729
developers contributing to core really

28
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:43,580
awesome people so I thought hmm maybe I

29
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,000
should learn how to do JavaScript right

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,200
because it doesn't make sense to write

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,270
on so I started programming and this

32
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,060
made me think about the tools that I'm

33
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,670
using on my daily basis because if you

34
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,349
are a designer usual you are using

35
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:02,860
Photoshop that's natural

36
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,470
Photoshop is the base for your work on

37
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,930
the other hand Photoshop is really a

38
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:15,620
mysterious black box we have no idea how

39
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,190
it works sometimes it crashes is doing

40
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,810
really really really weird things and

41
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,939
you don't necessarily know why it's

42
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:27,439
happening you just get this weird

43
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,670
message or spinning

44
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,890
wheel whoops it's crashed hmm okay let

45
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,099
me start and start working again so we

46
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,709
cannot be back Photoshop errors right so

47
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:40,099
it's a black box on the other hand the

48
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:42,590
web is not a black box the nature of the

49
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,950
web says that and the software itself

50
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:50,989
it's very different it's open and we

51
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:53,690
have this amazing thing the ability to

52
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,510
view the source which is a very very

53
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,720
very powerful tool it was very hard a

54
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,170
few years ago when we had no github it

55
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,900
was very hard to check how it works and

56
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,000
learn from code but then there was

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,830
github and now we are able to read the

58
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,989
code which is so awesome we can learn a

59
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:17,480
lot so this makes me think about the

60
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,810
root cause of this problem is jQuery

61
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:26,420
crappy our other libraries crappy so it

62
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,500
all comes down to two kinds of people

63
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,440
operators and engineers operator is a

64
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,250
person who knows how to use a tool ok so

65
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,799
I can take a toaster and make a toast

66
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,690
like everyone can do that it's so easy

67
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,540
but do I know how it works

68
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,250
not necessarily I just know how to use

69
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,380
it I just know how to make a toast an

70
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,459
engineer knows how the thing works from

71
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:55,070
the ground up so he can modify you can

72
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,220
adjust it for their knees he has full

73
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,730
awareness of the code so we should aim

74
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,859
towards being engineers right

75
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:08,420
everyone is saying read the

76
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,950
manual right we all know this expression

77
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,940
but it leads us to a question which is

78
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:21,289
to be actually ritika who read jQuery

79
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:25,940
code base that's actually surprising but

80
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,310
still is like 10 percent or 20 maybe how

81
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,080
many of you reads the code base of every

82
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,280
library you are using nice it's like 10

83
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,110
people and it's probably like hundreds

84
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,070
in the room or more

85
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,190
so for me read the code is the

86
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,960
new read the manual it's kind of

87
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,480
a generalization but the Internet is

88
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,310
giving us this opportunity to bitch

89
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,560
about things right usually you go in

90
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,410
like oh my god this website is so awful

91
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,600
or the software I had this terrible

92
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,570
experience with that product so it gives

93
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,840
this freedom for people to complain not

94
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,210
necessarily while being anonymous you

95
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,640
can just sign in and bitch about it on

96
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,820
Twitter Facebook whatever but mostly

97
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,900
it's about people being really lazy

98
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,030
because as we've seen ten people said

99
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,440
that they're actually reading the code

100
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,200
basement they are using library so we

101
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,290
are kind of lazy we don't care about

102
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,020
checking the code we're using so

103
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,120
basically we're using a tool without

104
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,060
knowing how it works and how we are in

105
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,610
position to judge this software or the

106
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,700
library we don't necessarily know how it

107
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,380
works

108
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,990
so is it hype because it's a very hype

109
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,910
opinion jQuery sucks everyone knows that

110
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:56,780
right so the human factor makes it worse

111
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,490
so we established that is really

112
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,730
valuable to read the code what are the

113
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:10,500
benefits of it so libraries are trying

114
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,780
to solve a lot of problems a very broad

115
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,140
spectrum usually which naturally affects

116
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,460
the level of complexity so you're not

117
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,490
actually sure how much complexity are

118
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,260
willing to take on you when you're

119
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,850
choosing a library because you're not

120
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,880
reading the code you're just like ah

121
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,890
okay I have this client and he wanted

122
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,410
this fancy date picker so I found this

123
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,780
cool library which is doing fancy date

124
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,900
pickers so we just use it and whatever

125
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:46,640
it works it's nice and fancy but this is

126
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,840
this really affects the complexity

127
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,720
you're willing to deal with and this is

128
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,450
also a problem of cognitive load

129
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,890
which is translated to the difficult

130
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,660
difficulty associated with the

131
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,310
understanding of a certain content

132
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,540
concept so should libraries really be

133
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,660
that complex should they solve that many

134
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,570
issues or should they be more

135
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,900
specialized for me kind of the idea of

136
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,720
the library is that is addressing one

137
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,600
issue or maybe a few small issues it's

138
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,850
not like oh let's just put Ajax in

139
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,280
jQuery because Jake Ajax is so cool so

140
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,840
let's put it there but why on the other

141
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,850
hand so maybe they should not follow

142
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:35,700
that all-in-one concept on the other

143
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,700
hand while reading the code of the

144
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,100
library we can see some good patterns

145
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,230
usually libraries are written by good

146
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:49,200
developers like powers of course and we

147
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,910
can notice good patterns we can benefit

148
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,370
from that we can learn because not all

149
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,210
of us are really great programmers right

150
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,130
on the other hand some parts may be

151
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,040
really really over engineered may be

152
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,120
very complicated

153
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,780
unnecessarily and we all strive for

154
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,760
simplicity the solution we may take is

155
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,220
to choose a micro framework over a

156
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,520
library because I've said the library is

157
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,980
usually huge its kind of framework ish

158
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,850
and micro framework has usually modular

159
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,800
approach it's very lightweight is

160
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,500
addressing a specific issue for example

161
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,540
if you go to micro J's what tile you

162
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,340
have this all really tiny libraries

163
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,430
which will work great for my well

164
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,100
they're easy to understand because the

165
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,580
code base is smaller on the other hand

166
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,490
libraries have some benefits to their

167
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,100
well tested they have better cross

168
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,230
browser compatibility they have

169
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,460
backtracking software more documentation

170
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,650
sometimes they are more reliable for

171
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:03,540
production so do not give this talk only

172
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,000
inspirational there's some examples I

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,250
said to halogen which

174
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,550
a query but jQuery is good for central

175
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,320
and thanks of course like every library

176
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,610
is and when is used in a good way by

177
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,800
someone who is aware of the fact that

178
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,660
what he's doing with the software he has

179
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:30,270
- that's a really common comparison to

180
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,360
choose jQuery and CSS because jQuery is

181
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,280
doing all the weird things they're

182
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,830
mapping CSS selectors so you can use

183
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,200
selectors either in CSS or of jQuery

184
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,050
that's kind of weird and may sound

185
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:47,370
insane right so jQuery has a lot of

186
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,040
stuff which is actually very easily

187
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,960
achievable by pure CSS but also it has a

188
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,060
lot of stuff which cannot be achieved in

189
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:03,720
CSS for example the parent selector it's

190
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,790
not available in CSS it is specified in

191
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,320
a working draft but on the other hand

192
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,380
it's raising really serious performance

193
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,960
issues because all elements on your

194
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,450
website need to be loaded and then the

195
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,310
meshing grill needs to be evaluated for

196
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,990
a child within the element so if you

197
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,360
have three paragraphs in one element and

198
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,120
one diff it needs to go three times so

199
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,500
it's like a really really severe

200
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,650
performance issue on the other hand as

201
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,600
I've said you have a lot of things you

202
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,880
can achieve both with jQuery and CSS so

203
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,000
which way to choose you can use the

204
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
animate function oricon is CSS

205
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,960
animations before in the past you

206
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,339
weren't able to do that because there

207
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,530
was no CSS animation but now we have all

208
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,650
this crazy html5 CSS free hype and

209
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,520
amazing tools and if talking about

210
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,500
animation we have over 80% of support

211
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,720
which is kind of foreign oil but it's

212
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,560
achievable through CSS so sometimes when

213
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,000
you think about the solutions you want

214
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,570
to choose CSS is the way to go but why

215
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,930
because it has native execution so it's

216
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,220
being rendered directly in the browser

217
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,280
the processor is written in C++ so it's

218
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,880
faster

219
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,100
javascript which needs to be interpreted

220
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,529
you can have hardware acceleration for

221
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:29,290
some people CSS is way more

222
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,480
straightforward the JavaScript like for

223
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,149
example imagine me I'm a designer so

224
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:36,250
kind of CSS is more appealing than

225
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,950
JavaScript I can look at JavaScript like

226
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:39,550
a year ago

227
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:43,540
and I'm like oh not understand I don't

228
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,690
know what's happening in here

229
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,339
but as I've said not everything is

230
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:51,339
possible with in-plane CSS like for

231
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:55,690
example you can append content with same

232
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,720
content and append some text but on the

233
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,700
other hand it's very it's very difficult

234
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,500
also as I've said it may be potentially

235
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,560
easier for designers on the other hand

236
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,500
if you're doing all this crazy

237
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,600
animations transformations into thing

238
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,140
about the degradation issue not all of

239
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,640
the browser's are supporting the thing

240
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,200
you're trying to do but let's shift from

241
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,870
jQuery problem to a different library

242
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,550
because I think that the idea behind

243
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,149
this talk is more it can be targeted to

244
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:35,649
where every library so you know Express

245
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:39,880
when I was expressed yeah okay so

246
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,149
Express is good but do you know how it

247
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:50,860
works that's a really really basic

248
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,040
example this is like native No

249
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,120
and you can shoot the same thing with

250
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,660
express nice right but it's usually

251
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,410
easier and better to read native code so

252
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,020
what's wrong with Express well nothing

253
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,089
is wrong with Express if you think about

254
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,550
the solution and think you are trying to

255
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,800
achieve because if you try to install

256
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,870
Express you will see all the dis

257
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,520
dependencies and you have all these

258
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,930
different module outers

259
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,430
so you need to think of the modulus

260
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,410
maintained if it's good there are all

261
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,779
these considerations you need to think

262
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:37,289
about it so what's the better approach

263
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:41,319
first of all modularity so separating

264
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:44,029
separation of concerns separating the

265
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:46,009
presentation layer phonetic separating

266
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:47,689
functionalities to make them work

267
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:50,720
together but on the other hand managing

268
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,720
their independent nature also clarity

269
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,629
making the code readable to all

270
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,939
simplification but now not of the course

271
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:06,410
of understanding considering distributed

272
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,179
teamwork also a lot of us are working

273
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:09,889
for startups we are working on

274
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:12,980
distributed teams so having really clear

275
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,160
cut is very important and especially

276
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,689
when you are working on our fizzers

277
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:19,489
project you want people to understand

278
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:21,649
your code it's not only about commenting

279
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:26,579
it's also about the readability

280
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:30,980
another thing is composition so we said

281
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,189
it's really important to separate logic

282
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:38,119
from layout but it's also very important

283
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:40,819
to connect these things in a really good

284
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:43,850
way because libraries usually are

285
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,730
designed to work on their own there are

286
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,699
not necessarily designed to work with

287
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:51,799
each other because as a library after

288
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:55,220
how you can think that ok I should work

289
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,989
with that and that and that different

290
00:14:56,989 --> 00:14:58,489
library you're not thinking about it

291
00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:01,309
you're usually thinking yeah just I just

292
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:02,660
made this library this is this was

293
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,399
solved this issue and it should just

294
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,579
work that's all so you should have write

295
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:10,819
conflicts like jQuery does you can use

296
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:14,209
not no conflict function to avoid

297
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:16,579
problems with other libraries a really

298
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:20,259
good example of designing for connection

299
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:23,779
is piping in Unix

300
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:26,660
so we are standing Center are just an

301
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,419
are in by piping so now of course the

302
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:35,830
hello will be copied to your clipboard

303
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,340
another thing is instrumentation

304
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:46,790
simplifying debugging so you can either

305
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:50,180
do the thing on the left but you can

306
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,610
also do the longer take the longer

307
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:00,170
solution but why well you probably want

308
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,040
to you probably would like to check your

309
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,680
code after you deploy to production but

310
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,540
you don't want necessarily to have this

311
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,720
code then the production right so you

312
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:21,200
can either enable debugging or not you

313
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,260
should also avoid surprising people

314
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,130
people don't like surprises

315
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:31,250
so don over engineer or or create new

316
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,350
path me work patterns if there are

317
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,510
already patterns established for that

318
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,089
and this is really really a good example

319
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:41,060
taken from node for a really really good

320
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,730
pattern this is a really everyone knows

321
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,860
that if you're doing note you know that

322
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,300
you need to return error first it's

323
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,310
really straightforward so why you should

324
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,130
invent your own solution if there's

325
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:58,730
already a solution you should optimize

326
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,040
the speed of how you are coding and how

327
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,140
you are reading so bill and ship fast

328
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:09,740
prototype before polishing and be

329
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,480
diverse about the solutions you are

330
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,560
chilling there is no single valid and

331
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,010
best approach to solving your issue you

332
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,439
need to explore research the tools that

333
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,420
are available and choose the best one

334
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,670
for your job maybe it's Drake word maybe

335
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,980
its depth oh maybe it's something else

336
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,290
maybe you should write your own tool

337
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,450
because that's the way to go for you

338
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,740
and there's a really dangerous and false

339
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,390
assumption that you shouldn't be writing

340
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,710
your own code because you are

341
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:46,490
reinventing the wheel why doing that

342
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,429
and the last thing is extensibility so

343
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:52,940
thinking about progressive enhancement

344
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,440
you should be using features which are

345
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,990
available now they are well tested you

346
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,429
need to keep in mind the current support

347
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:02,130
but on the other hand into account the

348
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,980
fact that the future might be here

349
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,250
faster than FN so maybe you should

350
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,960
consider graceful degradation in some

351
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,450
browsers maybe you shouldn't be thinking

352
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:18,270
about about that it won't work and some

353
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,150
browser that's all about the

354
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,000
specification for the project you have

355
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,250
but you need to think about the status

356
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:32,970
coming in so it all comes down to not

357
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,059
disapprove about the solutions you are

358
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,309
using you're not necessarily been using

359
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:40,470
not don't disapper solutions because

360
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,419
because you don't know them that's what

361
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,309
people do right you say - how will

362
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:46,350
jQuery and you were like yeah but like

363
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,940
20 people just said that they read the

364
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,429
codebase so how you are basing your

365
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,340
opinion is it the hype opinion you are

366
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,960
taking or do you actually have an

367
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,270
argument in here you need to explore the

368
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,309
options you need to read the code you

369
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:01,140
