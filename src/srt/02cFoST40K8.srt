00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:16,630

[Music]

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,260
yeah so this talk is that it's not

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,720
actually that's scary it just has some

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,210
unusual things some flickering moments a

5
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,000
few unsettling pictures nothing graphic

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,410
nothing where you'll be looking at it

7
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,090
and you'll say like wow this is

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,669
disturbing I and I know why it's

9
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:35,219
disturbing no it's it'll be more like I

10
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,960
don't know why but this looks this is

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,649
weird to me and we'll be asking why and

12
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,780
we'll also be talking about some things

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,129
some of the kinds of things that we

14
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:47,760
don't usually talk about and all sorts

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,680
of stuff kind of wants to pour down

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,750
river when you open locks like that and

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,750
so I want you to be here for it but if

18
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,760
you can't be here for it then take care

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,590
of yourselves otherwise hello my name is

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,790
Oishi and today I want to talk with you

21
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,640
about a hobby I want to share some of

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,990
the things that I've learned at the

23
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,760
intersection of computational

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,540
neuroscience and machine learning for

25
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,610
years I've been fascinated by how we

26
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,299
think how we perceive how the machinery

27
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,580
of our bodies results in qualitative

28
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,430
experiences and why we have the kinds of

29
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,470
experiences we do why they're shaped

30
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,680
like this and not like that why we

31
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,770
suffer for years

32
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,860
I've also been fascinated by AI and I

33
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,530
think we all have we're watching these

34
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,770
machines begin to approximate the tasks

35
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,740
of our cognition sometimes in unsettling

36
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,399
ways and so today I want to share with

37
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,740
you some of what I've learned some of it

38
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,829
is solid research some of it is solid

39
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,860
speculation and all if it speaks to

40
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,200
truth that I have come to believe which

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,469
is that we are computations our worlds

42
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:07,500
created on an ancient computer powerful

43
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,760
beyond imagining so let's begin

44
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:20,620
part-1 hallucinations this person is

45
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,440
Michaela pareo Nieto and he has

46
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,620
something to show us it starts with

47
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,630
these simple patterns and splashes of

48
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,510
light and dark kind of like images from

49
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,480
the first eyes

50
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,880
these give way to lines and colors and

51
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,720
then curves and more complex shapes

52
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,040
what's happening is that we are diving

53
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,660
through the layers of the inception

54
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,200
image classifier and it seems that there

55
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,560
are whole worlds in here shaded multi

56
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,709
chromatic hatches the crystalline farm

57
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:58,910
fields of an alien world the cells of

58
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:03,050
plants to understand where these visuals

59
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,280
are coming from let's take a look inside

60
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,110
the job of an image classifier is to

61
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,300
reshape its input which is the square of

62
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,910
pixels into its output which is a

63
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,950
probability distribution so the

64
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,320
probability that this image is of a cat

65
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,660
the probability of a dog a person a

66
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,230
banana a toaster it performs this

67
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,820
reshaping through a series of

68
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,850
convolutional filters now convolutional

69
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,660
filters are basically Photoshop filters

70
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,239
each neuron in a convolutional layer has

71
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:37,940
a receptive field some small patch of

72
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,070
the previous layer that it's looking at

73
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,310
and each convolutional layer applies a

74
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,590
filter specifically it applies an image

75
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,190
kernel a kernel is a matrix of numbers

76
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,810
where each number represents the weight

77
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,290
of the corresponding input neuron so

78
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,450
each pixel in a neurons receptive field

79
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,850
is multiplied by its weight and then we

80
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,650
sum all of them to produce the output

81
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,519
neurons value we apply that same filter

82
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,130
across every neuron in a layer and the

83
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,989
values in that filter are learned during

84
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:11,810
training so we feed the classifier

85
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,370
labelled image that's something where we

86
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,150
know what's in it

87
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,120
it outputs predictions and then we math

88
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,609
to figure out how wrong those

89
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:21,830
predictions were and then we math again

90
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,220
to figure out how to change the values

91
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:25,910
in this fill

92
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,240
to produce a better result so the term

93
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,980
for that is gradient descent the deep

94
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,050
dream process which is what's creating

95
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,500
these visuals inverts that so this

96
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,320
visualization is recursive to compute

97
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,870
the next frame we feed the previous we

98
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,090
feed the current frame into the network

99
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,040
we run it through the networks many

100
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,170
layers until we find that layer that

101
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,770
were interested in and then we mask what

102
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,900
could we do to the input layer to make

103
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,900
that layer activate more and then we

104
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,880
adjust the input image in that direction

105
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,850
so the term for this process is gradient

106
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,900
ascent finally we scale the image up

107
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,460
very slightly before feeding it back

108
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,590
into the network for the next frame that

109
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,750
kind of keeps the network from fixating

110
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,490
on the same details in the same places

111
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,620
and it also creates this really wild

112
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,580
zooming effect every hundred frames or

113
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,250
so we move to a deeper layer or a layer

114
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,890
that's off to the side inception has a

115
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,410
whole lot of layers and they are not all

116
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:35,900
arranged in a neat linear stack and that

117
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,530
gives us this so we started with these

118
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,960
rudiments of light and shadow and now

119
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,960
down here we kind of have a city of

120
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,620
kodamas situation happening but then

121
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,000
we're about to enter the spider

122
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,160
observation area in which spiders

123
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,190
observe you but it's okay because soon

124
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,390
the spiders will become corgis and the

125
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:04,480
corgis are going to become the 70s later

126
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,140
we've got this space of nearly human

127
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:14,270
eyes which will transform into dog slugs

128
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:20,060
and then dog bird slugs deeper

129
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,110
unfortunately we had a saxophonist

130
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,090
teleporter accident

131
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:31,159
and finally the flesh zones

132
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:37,909
with a side of lizard so when I first

133
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,349
saw this I was like should I tell the

134
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:40,639
story when I tell the story when I first

135
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,489
saw this I I thought it looked like

136
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:45,860
nothing so much as US President Donald

137
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,399
Trump and and I resolved to never tell

138
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,649
anyone that certainly not on stage until

139
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:53,869
my best friend was watching the same

140
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:57,050
video and she said you know this this

141
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,319
just kind of reminds me of and I think

142
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,429
that actually says more about the state

143
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:03,559
of our neural networks than this one I

144
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:05,809
think the lizard juxtaposition has

145
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:06,759
something to do with it

146
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,439
but I do want you to notice and think

147
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,059
about what it means that all of the

148
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:19,719
flesh in this network is so very pale so

149
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:26,949
this is pretty trippy yeah why is that

150
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:29,419
what does it mean for something to be

151
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:33,199
trippy to figure that out let's take a

152
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,959
look inside ourselves meet Scully Scully

153
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,479
doesn't need all this trust we're just

154
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:43,699
looking at Scalia's visual system which

155
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:47,539
starts here in the retina now Scully is

156
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:49,789
retina your retina our retinas they're

157
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:51,860
actually pretty weird light comes into

158
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,869
them and it immediately hits a membrane

159
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:56,749
there's a layer of ganglions which are

160
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:58,879
not actually particularly photoreceptive

161
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,519
that they are a little then there's a

162
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,469
layer of more stuff that does important

163
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:05,749
things presumably and at the back are

164
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:07,429
the photoreceptors the rods and cones

165
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:11,659
which sends luminance and color so when

166
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:13,459
light comes in it has to go through

167
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,349
these four layers of tissue hit a

168
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:17,839
photoreceptor that photoreceptor is

169
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,999
going to get excited it'll send out a

170
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,009
signal to its ganglions which then have

171
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:25,249
to send it to the brain somehow through

172
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:27,139
the optic nerve which is drilled through

173
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:30,169
the center of your eye which means the

174
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:32,180
sent the sensors in our eyes are mounted

175
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,819
backwards and there's a hole in the

176
00:08:34,819 --> 00:08:36,740
center of them and it's all okay because

177
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,219
we patch it up later in software

178
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,290
a couple of other problems with our eyes

179
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,310
too one we have about 120 million

180
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,440
photoreceptors and there's 10 times your

181
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,060
ganglions than that so it can't be a

182
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,399
one-to-one mapping and to the bandwidth

183
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,190
of our optic nerve is 10 megabits which

184
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,620
is not you know like a lot I don't know

185
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,389
when the last time you tried to watch

186
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:03,550
video over a 10 megabit connection is

187
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,339
but it's much slower than Wi-Fi our

188
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:09,160
cameras are about 100 megapixels it's

189
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,829
not gonna work and so our retinas do

190
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:14,019
what you would do if you were given does

191
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:16,360
design constraints they compress the

192
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,829
data each ganglion is connected to a

193
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:22,829
receptive field that's a hundred or so

194
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:26,110
photoreceptors that is that are divided

195
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,850
into a central disc and a surrounding

196
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,209
region so when there's no light on any

197
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:34,570
of them the ganglion doesn't fire when

198
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,910
the whole field is illuminated the

199
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,810
ganglion fires very weakly when only the

200
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,850
surround is illuminated and the center

201
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,339
is dark half the ganglions in your

202
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:48,279
retina fire release strongly and the

203
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,500
other half don't fire at all in the same

204
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,800
situation but those ganglions behave the

205
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,290
opposite way they fire when the center

206
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,050
is bright and the surround is dark so

207
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,390
these different species of ganglions

208
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,589
they're not actually different species

209
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:04,120
they're just ganglions that naturally

210
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,180
behave this way they're scattered

211
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,260
they're distributed evenly throughout

212
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,660
your retina and if you think about what

213
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,880
this does creates an edge detection

214
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,199
filter so we're doing processing even in

215
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,140
our eyeballs in order to down sample the

216
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,000
image coming in from our photoreceptors

217
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,399
a hundred times while retaining vitally

218
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,680
important information namely where the

219
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:32,019
boundaries of objects are okay so then

220
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:33,970
the signal is going to go into the brain

221
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,790
it's gonna hit the optic chiasma where

222
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,139
the data streams from our left and right

223
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:41,019
eyes cross where we extract stereo

224
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:43,209
vision it's gonna get processed by the

225
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,130
thalamus which is a switching center for

226
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,079
all kinds of signals in your brain it's

227
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,699
responsible amongst other things for

228
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:52,060
running our eyes autofocus each step in

229
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,890
the signal pathway is doing a little bit

230
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:54,940
of processing

231
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,020
extracting a little bit of information

232
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,510
and that's all before we even get to

233
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,930
hear the visual cortex all the way

234
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:05,950
around back our visual cortex is

235
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,850
arranged into a stack of neuronal layers

236
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,440
the signal stay is actually pretty

237
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,480
spatially coherent throughout the visual

238
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,760
cortex so there's some slice of tissue

239
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,890
in the back of your brain that's

240
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,110
responsible for pulling faces out of

241
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,060
this particular chunk of your visual

242
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,220
field I mean more or less your brain is

243
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,420
very squishy each neuron in a layer of

244
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,600
our visual cortex has a receptive field

245
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,280
some chunk of the entire visual field

246
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,090
that it's looking at and neurons in a

247
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,330
given layer tend to respond to signals

248
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,660
in the same way and that operation

249
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,550
distributed over a layer of neurons it

250
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,450
extracts features from the visual signal

251
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,950
early layers extract simple features

252
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,430
like lions and curves and edges and then

253
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,860
later layers extract more complex ones

254
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,980
like gradients and surfaces and objects

255
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,180
Aya's faces and movement it's no

256
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,560
accident that we see very similar

257
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,750
behavior in Inception because

258
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,220
convolutional neural networks like

259
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,950
Inception were inspired by the design of

260
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,420
our visual cortex of course our visual

261
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,460
cortex is different from inception in

262
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,720
many ways inception is a straight shot

263
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,570
through it has branches but no cycles

264
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,020
our visual cortex contains feedback

265
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,540
loops these pyramidal neurons that

266
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,570
connect deeper layers to earlier ones

267
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,730
those feedback loops allow the results

268
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,070
of deeper layers to inform the behavior

269
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,830
of earlier layers so we might turn up

270
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,680
the gain for edge detection along the

271
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,900
edge of what is later detected to be an

272
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,520
object this lets our visual system adapt

273
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,070
and focus not optically but

274
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,589
attentionally it gives us the ability to

275
00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:00,160
ruminate on visual input well because we

276
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,050
become consciously aware of it improving

277
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,589
our predictions over time you know this

278
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:07,960
feeling I think you think you see one

279
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,680
thing

280
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,060
and then you realize that something else

281
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,830
and these loopback pyramidal cells in

282
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,050
our visual cortex are covered in

283
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,140
serotonin receptors different kinds of

284
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,820
pyramidal cells respond to serotonin

285
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,790
differently but generally they find it

286
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,779
exciting and don't we all you might be

287
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:30,700
familiar with serotonin in its starring

288
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,230
role as the target of typical

289
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,029
antidepressants which are serotonin

290
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:35,320
reuptake inhibitors

291
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,270
when serotonin gets released into your

292
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,800
brain they make it stick around longer

293
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,040
thereby treating depression some side

294
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,730
effects may occur most serotonin in your

295
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,830
body is actually located in your gut

296
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,470
where it controls bowel movement its

297
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,149
signals to your gut that it's got food

298
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:54,100
in it and it should go on and do

299
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,920
whatever it does to food and that seems

300
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,209
to be with the molecule signals

301
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:00,310
throughout your body resource

302
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,250
availability and for animals like us

303
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,860
with complex societies resources can be

304
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,290
very abstract social resources as well

305
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,170
as energetic ones that your pyramidal

306
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,930
cells respond excitedly to serotonin

307
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,630
suggests that we focus on that which we

308
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:21,250
believe will nourish us now it's not

309
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,350
correct as a blanket statement to say

310
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,450
that pyramidal cells are excited by

311
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,550
serotonin there are different kinds of

312
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,770
serotonin receptors and their binding

313
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,740
produces different effects so 5-htt 1a

314
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,920
receptors tend to be inhibitory somewhat

315
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,550
drowsiness inducing 5-htt 3 receptors in

316
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,220
the brain they're associated sensations

317
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,920
of queasiness and anxiety and in the gut

318
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,390
they make it run backwards so

319
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,240
anti-nausea drugs are frequently 5ht 3

320
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,230
antagonists there is another serotonin

321
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,990
receptor one that the pyramidal cells in

322
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,390
your visual cortex find particularly

323
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,420
exciting

324
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,540
this is the 5-htt 2a receptor this is

325
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,910
the primary target of every known

326
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,980
psychedelic drug this is what enables

327
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,050
our brains to create psychedelic

328
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:18,830
experiences so

329
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,110
you go to a show you eat a little piece

330
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,660
of paper and that piece of paper makes

331
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,910
its way down into your stomach where it

332
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,459
dissolves releasing molecules of fly

333
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:30,470
surgit acid diethylamide into your gut

334
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,490
now LSD doesn't bind to 5 HT 3 receptors

335
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,260
particularly so if you feel butterflies

336
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,420
in your stomach it's likely just because

337
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,860
you're excited because you know what's

338
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,810
gonna happen and what's gonna happen is

339
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,290
this LSD will diffuse into your blood it

340
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,880
has no trouble acrossing the blood-brain

341
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,649
barrier because it's tiny but powerful

342
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:51,890
like you it will diffuse deep into your

343
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,079
brain into your visual cortex where it

344
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,540
finds a pyramidal 5-ht to a receptor and

345
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,839
locks into place it will stay bound

346
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,510
there for around 221 minutes that's 4

347
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,209
hours which is a very long time they

348
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:06,890
think that a couple of proteins snap

349
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,260
into place and form a lid overtop of the

350
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,620
receptor trapping LSD inside which would

351
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,660
help explain why it's so very potent

352
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,760
with typical doses about a thousand

353
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,779
times less than most other drugs so

354
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,420
while it's rattling around in there the

355
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,029
little molecule of LSD is stimulating a

356
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:28,399
feedback loop in your visual cortex it's

357
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,760
sending the signal pay attention what

358
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,910
you're looking at may be nourishing the

359
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,040
pattern finding machinery in your brain

360
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,410
then starts to run over time and at

361
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,959
different rates in one moment the

362
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,820
pattern in a tapestry seems to extend

363
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,950
into the world beyond it in the next

364
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,839
it's the trees that are growing and

365
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,149
breathing the perception of movement of

366
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:51,800
visual hypothesis that's been allowed to

367
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,420
grow wild with deep dream we asked what

368
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,520
would excite some layer of Inception and

369
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,829
then we adjusted the input image in that

370
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:04,339
direction but there's no comparable

371
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,929
gradient ascent process in the

372
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:09,079
biological psychedelic experience that's

373
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,089
because we're not looking at a source

374
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:13,610
image we're looking at the output of the

375
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:17,589
network we are the output of the network

376
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:20,689
the output of your visual cortex is a

377
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:23,329
signal carrying visual perceptions these

378
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:26,240
like proto qualia which will be

379
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,890
integrated by other circuits in your

380
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,900
brain into your next moment of conscious

381
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,710
experience

382
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,650
inception poor thing never gets that far

383
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,000
we never even run it all the way to the

384
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,010
classification stage we never ask what

385
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:44,110
it sees in all this but we could we

386
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,029
could perform the amplification process

387
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:48,340
on a final result rather than an

388
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,190
intermediate one maybe we ask what would

389
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,130
it take for you to see this banana as a

390
00:17:54,130 --> 00:18:00,250
toaster or say don't these skiers look

391
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,450
like a dog so these are adversarial

392
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,760
examples images that have been tuned to

393
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,070
give classifiers Frank hallucinations

394
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,049
the confident belief that they're seeing

395
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,289
something that just isn't there and

396
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:16,179
they're not completely wild these robot

397
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:19,240
delusions I mean that sticker does look

398
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,860
quite a lot like a toaster and it's very

399
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,250
shiny and those skiers do kind of look

400
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,919
like a dog if you squint and I mean

401
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:29,409
there's the head there's the body and if

402
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,990
you were far away and tired and drunk

403
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,190
you might think that it was a big dog

404
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,600
but she probably wouldn't conclude that

405
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,779
it's a big dog there are current

406
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:43,059
properties of our visual cortex not to

407
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:44,169
mention the whole rest of our brains

408
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:46,029
mean that our sense of the world is

409
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:48,610
stateful it's a continuously refined

410
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,919
hypothesis whose state is held by the

411
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:54,039
state of our neurons laying the

412
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:56,440
groundwork for capsule networks sera

413
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,630
sabor Nicholas frost and Geoffrey Hinton

414
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,200
write a parse tree is carved out of a

415
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,809
fixed multi-layer neural network like a

416
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:08,860
sculpture is carved from rock our

417
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,279
perceptions are a process of continuous

418
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:15,669
refinement which may point the way

419
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:17,409
towards more robust recognition

420
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:20,080
architectures recurrent convolutional

421
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,640
neural networks that ruminate upon

422
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,429
images making better classifications or

423
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,380
at least providing some kind of signal

424
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,100
that something is off about an input

425
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,960
there are adversarial examples for the

426
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,590
human visual system after all and we

427
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,049
call them optical illusions and they

428
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:41,169
usually feel pretty weird to look at in

429
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:43,780
this image we can feel our sensory

430
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,679
impression of

431
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:46,240
scene flipping between three

432
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,450
alternatives a box a little box in front

433
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,320
of a big one a box in a corner and a box

434
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,730
missing one in this monkey illusion

435
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,100
there is something scintillating about

436
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,379
the color of the dots which are all the

437
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:06,730
same and are all brown if we design

438
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,169
convolutional neural networks with

439
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:10,210
recurrence they could exhibit such

440
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,029
behavior as well which maybe doesn't

441
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:14,619
sound like such a good thing on the face

442
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:16,480
of it like let's make our image

443
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,889
classifier it's vacillating and

444
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:19,659
uncertain and then put them in charge of

445
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:22,450
driving cars around but we drive cars

446
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:26,200
around and it's our ability to hem and

447
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,269
haw and reconsider our own perceptions

448
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,369
at many levels that gives our perceptual

449
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:32,490
system such tremendous robustness

450
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,009
paradoxically being able to second-guess

451
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:38,230
ourselves allows us greater confidence

452
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,350
in our predictions we are doing science

453
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,749
in every moment the cells of our brain

454
00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:46,090
continuously reconsidering and refining

455
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,279
shifting hypotheses about the state of

456
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:51,070
the world and this gives us the ability

457
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,289
to adapt and operate within a pretty

458
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:56,230
extreme range of conditions even while

459
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:09,010
we're tripping face or well asleep

460
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:18,280
dreams

461
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:24,420
these are not real people like the

462
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,270
unpeople of Monica showed us yesterday

463
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,920
these are the photos of fake celebrities

464
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,260
dreamt up by a generative adversarial

465
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,930
Network a pair of networks which are

466
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:38,340
particularly creative the networks get

467
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,990
better through continuous mutual

468
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,680
refinement and it works like this on one

469
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,820
side we have the Creator this is a deep

470
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,790
deep learning network not unlike

471
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,780
inception but trained to run in Reverse

472
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,980
this network we feed with noise

473
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,110
literally just a bunch of random numbers

474
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:02,700
and it learns to generate images but it

475
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,010
has no way to learn to play this game

476
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,690
and the technical parlance it lacks a

477
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,260
gradient without another opponent the

478
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,490
adversary the adversary is an image

479
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,230
classifier again like Inception

480
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,090
but trained to run on only two classes

481
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:21,840
real and fake it's job is to distinguish

482
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,530
the creator's forgeries from true faces

483
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,030
we feed this network with the ground

484
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,820
truth with actual examples of celebrity

485
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,840
faces and the adversary learns and then

486
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,670
we use those results to train the

487
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,100
creator so if it makes a satisfying

488
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,040
forgery it's doing well if it's

489
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,140
forgeries are detected we back propagate

490
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,550
the failure so that it can learn I

491
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,660
should tell you that the technical names

492
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,490
for these networks are the generator and

493
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,680
the discriminator I changed the names

494
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,680
because names are important and also

495
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,020
meaningless they don't change this

496
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,670
underlying structure of the training

497
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,900
methodology which is a game these two

498
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,790
neural circuits are playing with each

499
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,960
other and competition is inspiring when

500
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,570
we spar our opponent creates for us the

501
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,640
tactical landscape that we must traverse

502
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,640
just as we do the same for them together

503
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,700
our movements ruminate on a space of

504
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,680
possibility is much larger than any

505
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,790
fixed example set agains can train

506
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,250
remarkably well on relatively small

507
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,820
amounts of data

508
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,650
and it seems likely that this kind of

509
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,750
adversarial process could be helpful for

510
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,290
neural circuits of all kinds it was not

511
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:42,190
without its quirks games are not

512
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,670
particularly great at global structure

513
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:48,340
this is fallout cow it is a cow with an

514
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,980
extra body just as you may have spent a

515
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,570
night walking through a house that is

516
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,080
your house but with many extra rooms

517
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,670
these networks are also not super great

518
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,360
at counting

519
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,780
so this monkey has eight eyes because

520
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:05,530
sometimes science goes too far do

521
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,360
something for me next time you think

522
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,890
you're awake which i think is now count

523
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:16,220
your fingers just to be sure

524
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,790
I've been awkward if I didn't have five

525
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,670
now if you find that you have more or

526
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,400
fewer than you expected please don't

527
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,660
wake up just yet we're not quite done

528
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,980
another interesting thing about this

529
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,510
training technique is that the generator

530
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,300
is being fed noise a vector of noise

531
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,460
some random point in a very high

532
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,070
dimensional latent space and so it

533
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,710
learns a mapping from this space onto

534
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,550
its generation target in this case faces

535
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,350
if we take a point in that space and we

536
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:55,910
just kind of drag it around we got this

537
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,890
which is also pretty trippy no I mean

538
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,380
this resembles things I've seen things

539
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,420
someone who isn't me has seen on acid

540
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,660
this resembles the sorts of things that

541
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,430
you may have seen in long-forgotten

542
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:14,350
dreams now I don't have a Magic School

543
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,600
Bus riot to take us on to understand why

544
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,890
that is but I do have a theory when we

545
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,110
see a face there's a bunch of neurons in

546
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,820
our brain that light up and begin

547
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,040
resonating the signal that is the

548
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,450
feeling of looking at that particular

549
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:32,650
face taken together all of the neurons

550
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:35,560
implicated in face detection produce a

551
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,590
vector embedding some mapping from faces

552
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,110
to positions in a high dimensional space

553
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,750
and so as we drag around the generators

554
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,620
vector here

555
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,190
we are also dragging around our own

556
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,020
which is a novel and kind of unsettling

557
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:55,419
sensation so that's a wild theory but

558
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:57,490
it's not totally without neurocognitive

559
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:05,580
precedent here we have a rat in a cage

560
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,140
so we've hooked an electrode up to a

561
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,150
particular neuron in the rat's brain and

562
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,549
these pink dots are the locations where

563
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:15,580
it's firing if we speed this whole thing

564
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,919
up then we're gonna start to see a

565
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,360
pattern emerge this neuron is a grid

566
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,539
cell so named because the Centers of its

567
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:28,020
firing fields produce a triangular grid

568
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,520
there's lots of different grid cells in

569
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,120
your brain

570
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,919
each aligning to a different grid and

571
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:35,230
they collect data from your visual

572
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,630
system from head Direction cells which

573
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,929
encode the position of your head and

574
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:43,630
together these cells can they construct

575
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,029
an encoding of our position in 2d

576
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:49,000
euclidean space this operates even in

577
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,130
our sleep if earlier you discovered that

578
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,720
you were dreaming and you want to see

579
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,250
the end of this talk which are having

580
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,559
trouble not waking up oh neuro knots

581
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,669
recommend spinning around this detaches

582
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:03,159
you're perceived body the one with 12

583
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:05,559
fingers and three extra bedrooms from

584
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:09,000
your physical body which is lying in bed

585
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,289
this positioning system is something

586
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:13,450
which on some level you always knew

587
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:17,020
existed after all you know where you are

588
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,960
in space you have a sense of space as

589
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,600
you move through it and it's likely even

590
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,409
necessary

591
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:25,179
if we believe that cognition is

592
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:28,149
computation that our qualitative sense

593
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:30,130
of position has a neurocognitive

594
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:34,029
precursor some signal in the web that

595
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:37,840
tells us where we're at in many senses

596
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,779
of the word

597
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:50,349
part three sticks and stones they say

598
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:51,969
you can't tickle yourself because you

599
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:53,579
know it's coming

600
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:56,440
specifically when your brain sends an

601
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,779
action command to your muscles it's

602
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:01,809
called an efference when an efference is

603
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:05,979
sent your brain makes a copy now makes a

604
00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:09,309
copy sound so planned so engineered your

605
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:11,499
brain is this big messy evolved signal

606
00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:13,690
processing mesh so another way to think

607
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:18,489
of efference copies is as reflections we

608
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,469
take the efference and we send it out to

609
00:28:20,469 --> 00:28:21,759
the peripheral nerves where presumably

610
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:23,969
it's going to make some muscles contract

611
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:27,309
meanwhile from the efference copy we

612
00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:28,839
predict how our body's state will change

613
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:32,349
and we use that to update our brains

614
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:35,949
model of our body's state now if we

615
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:37,449
didn't do this then we would have to

616
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,549
wait for sense data to come back to tell

617
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:41,379
us what happened I mean where is our

618
00:28:41,379 --> 00:28:43,659
hand right now and then we would face

619
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:45,249
the same problem is trying to play a

620
00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:46,839
twitchy video game over a crap

621
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:49,599
connection signals take about 10

622
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:51,729
milliseconds to travel from our brain to

623
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:53,440
the periphery and about 10 milliseconds

624
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,619
to come back it's just not that low

625
00:28:56,619 --> 00:28:58,419
latency or high bandwidth our nervous

626
00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:00,759
system and so to enable smooth

627
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:03,429
coordinated movements our brain has to

628
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:08,919
make predictions so life goes on but in

629
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:11,859
a moment we have another problem see we

630
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:14,019
still receive sense data from our nerves

631
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,569
and if we update our models again they

632
00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:19,209
would fall out of sync and so we

633
00:29:19,209 --> 00:29:22,359
attenuate this signal and keep the model

634
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:26,199
in sync this attenuation applies even to

635
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:28,209
our sense of touch when that touch is an

636
00:29:28,209 --> 00:29:31,409
expected consequence of our own movement

637
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:34,419
now expected consequence that's quite a

638
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:37,119
complicated model and aspects of it are

639
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,709
likely distributed throughout our brain

640
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:40,869
but there is one place that is

641
00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:44,219
particularly important in maintaining it

642
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:48,579
the cerebellum the cerebellum is very

643
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:49,209
special

644
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:52,029
it contains half the neurons in our

645
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:55,000
nervous system all action commands

646
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,860
from the brain to the body wrap through

647
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,049
it and all sensations from the body to

648
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:01,110
the brain as well it has long been

649
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,640
recognized as vitally important to motor

650
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:10,030
coordination like this people with

651
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,799
cerebellar damage have trouble

652
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:14,740
performing this action smoothly with

653
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,880
cerebellar damage

654
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,570
it's our movements become jerky and

655
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:23,830
laggy it's theorized that the cerebellum

656
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:27,100
acts as a Smith predictor our brains

657
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,049
controller for our latency distant

658
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:31,510
body's able to estimate the body's

659
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:34,030
current state integrate sensory feedback

660
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,850
to update that model and decompose

661
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,740
grouse action commands generated

662
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,049
elsewhere in the brain into a fine-tuned

663
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:44,970
continuously varying control signal and

664
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,500
once you've evolved it the thing like

665
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,830
that has many uses there's a growing

666
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,630
body of evidence implicating the

667
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,659
cerebellum in language which makes sense

668
00:30:55,659 --> 00:30:58,049
uh pterence is a kind of movement and

669
00:30:58,049 --> 00:31:01,000
language she said kind of gesticulating

670
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,169
is not limited to utterance the work of

671
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:07,539
moving words it's not so different from

672
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:09,220
the work of moving the body they are

673
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,890
both transformations from the space of

674
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:14,740
internal states of efference and ideas

675
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,350
to the space of world coordinates and

676
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,390
external sense impressions and back

677
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:23,830
again and what happens when this

678
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,770
predictor encounters a problem when

679
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,809
there is an irreconcilable discontinuity

680
00:31:28,809 --> 00:32:03,220
in the model

681
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:16,160
[Music]

682
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:19,710
these are not extremely different

683
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:23,890
they're both visceral and guttural they

684
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:28,690
shake our bones and jokes too are shaped

685
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,330
like trauma

686
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:33,340
they're both shattering the

687
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,850
Illuminations of discontinuities

688
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:42,090
paradoxes which cannot be and yet are

689
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,980
things that we must revisit again and

690
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,740
again water smoothing the edges of

691
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,780
cutting stone the machinery of our

692
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,690
brains trying to make sense of a world

693
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:57,310
that resists it these last few months

694
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:00,940
have been very difficult for me the

695
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:06,550
world is heavy my heart is heavy we

696
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,880
build cages for kids to Diane we live in

697
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,890
drowning cities built by slaves

698
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,100
meanwhile I spend my days trying to make

699
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:19,390
numbers into bigger numbers there are

700
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,520
days when I open my email and every

701
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,860
subject line is a stone and I think I

702
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,780
should put these all into my dress and

703
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:32,500
walk into the sea but I don't because I

704
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:39,310
remind myself because I remember that I

705
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:43,630
am a process of creation I am a song

706
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,810
singing myself we our story is telling

707
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:51,040
ourselves a see understanding itself our

708
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,550
churning waves creating every moment of

709
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:57,929
exquisite agony and exquisite joy and

710
00:33:57,929 --> 00:34:04,560
everything else it's you it's all you

711
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:10,270
you are everything everything you have

712
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:13,390
ever seen every place you have ever been

713
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:15,580
every song you have ever sung every god

714
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,890
you have ever prayed to every person you

715
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:18,910
have ever loved

716
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:22,030
and this boundaries between you and them

717
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:28,210
and the sea and the stars are all in

718
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:35,470
your head

719
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,900
thank you
