1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190

on a small software firm called

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,629
balderdash we do nodejs consulting and

3
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:09,599
so forth I'm on github on Twitter etc

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,389
you can find me if you want to follow

5
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,719
what I'm doing but right now I'm going

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,310
to talk about use myself almost as a

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,369
case study for like the just totally

8
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,859
ridiculous and crazy career path that

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,689
I've had ever since I started

10
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,620
contributing seriously to open sores and

11
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,649
I'm trying to draw some lessons from

12
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,680
that generalize some things and figure

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,430
out what I've learned in this process

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,090
might be of interest to other people

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,629
alright so general outline a program

16
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:51,660
time going to talk about talk about

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,989
myself because I'm up here and I know

18
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,430
most about myself talk about the open

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,159
source economy how open source can flow

20
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,979
into an actual profitable lucrative

21
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,600
career and how contributing to that and

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,220
injecting yourself into that world can

23
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,710
be a really bad experience I know a lot

24
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,360
of us here contribute open source anyway

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,689
but it's it's a good reminder I think in

26
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,080
a good sort of helpful way to inspire

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,540
people to contribute more if I can also

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,590
convince you they're gonna you're going

29
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,140
to make money doing it three I have some

30
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,400
this this layout right here's is

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,130
misleading but 3 i'm actually I have

32
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,909
some questions that I think

33
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:42,689
introspective type questions that I

34
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:44,250
think are good to ask yourself as your

35
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,770
sort of sorting out where you want to go

36
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,100
with your career what types of things

37
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,860
are valuable spends of your time and

38
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,000
which things maybe aren't and for how to

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,570
actually utilize all of this to make

40
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,219
money or if your profit could be

41
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:03,960
anything right if you're if you if your

42
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,840
goal is to solve some problem that's

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,489
never been so altered or just build some

44
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,090
applicant for your own purposes building

45
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,860
it in a cave by yourself

46
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,000
even if you're going to be the primary

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,820
user is not the best way to do it it's

48
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,130
going to be way more fun to go out in

49
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,720
the world and find other people who care

50
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,720
about the same stuff you do so okay this

51
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,390
is the part where I talk about myself I

52
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,180
live in Norfolk Virginia that's

53
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,080
balderdash whoo all right yes that's my

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,530
my team back there obligatory clapping

55
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,740
for me we've got an office where real

56
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,810
place we do real things we have a lot of

57
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:51,300
fun so this is my resume I i bought a

58
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,060
really big book from books-a-million

59
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,709
before I had any money my mom bought it

60
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,080
for me and I convinced because I

61
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,090
convinced her and I had this vague idea

62
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,340
that like C++ was like a thing that the

63
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,260
people were doing in the real world so

64
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,430
I'm like yeah I should just get this

65
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,380
real big book and just like read it and

66
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,030
learn C++ bad idea um I you know I have

67
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,709
a brain probably wasn't able to collect

68
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,310
most of the concepts but I was able to

69
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,650
write little programs that did useless

70
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,489
stuff but it was a fun exercise I went

71
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:26,160
to college got a CS degree started a

72
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,930
bunch of failed businesses in college

73
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,269
and so then I just left college with an

74
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:35,519
even more urgent need to make money I'm

75
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,840
really bad a really bad employee um I've

76
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,799
I've learned this myself the hard way uh

77
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,100
and I think I'm like a lot of people

78
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,299
though because I've worked with other

79
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,010
people who were terrible employees for

80
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,670
some reason and because i think we're

81
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,580
developers so we're all hired anyway

82
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,190
right if we don't have a code and your

83
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,380
if any sort of engineering background or

84
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,530
if you learn stuff yourself you can get

85
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,900
a job writing code even if you're

86
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,019
terrible so I think I'm in that category

87
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,670
actually I feel like I'm pretty decent

88
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,470
at writing code but i'm bad at being an

89
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,660
employee about it like being productive

90
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,209
in that environment and I could

91
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,800
contribute open source so I have some

92
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,370
testimonials from some some people I

93
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,190
know

94
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,120
Ryan Quinn fortunately isn't here but um

95
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,670
what like the second month I hired him

96
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,490
he gave me this feedback which if you

97
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,200
want to call it feedback then that's

98
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,750
fine uh but it's it was really

99
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,340
interesting actually because he's like

100
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,170
he literally said this he said you're

101
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,370
actually really terrible at your job

102
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,270
like what are you doing and in n he said

103
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,770
can we hire like a real project manager

104
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,960
who actually knows how to manage

105
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,270
projects because I'd never been he's

106
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,470
right I'd never been a project manager

107
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,170
before and now I'm in position where I'm

108
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,320
managing a business and we have a ton of

109
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,520
different projects so I'm actually

110
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,430
managing multiple things and this was

111
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,810
earlier this year when we were just

112
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,160
getting started and was not very good at

113
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,340
it also my mom every time I tell her

114
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,810
that I quit or get some new job she

115
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,210
she's very supportive I mean she

116
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,820
ultimately doesn't care she just she

117
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,080
doesn't care like oh you're working on

118
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,570
some new thing I'm as long as you like

119
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,460
what you're doing that's that's good

120
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,020
enough for me so these are some things

121
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,770
that people say about me talk about open

122
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,970
source because that's really what this

123
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,300
whole kind of my whole thesis kind of

124
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,910
orbits around open source so first

125
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,300
consulting the this is these are some of

126
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,030
the differences between working for a

127
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,370
traditional kind of software company or

128
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,270
another company where you're at

129
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,220
department in them if you're a

130
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,470
consultant or if your team of

131
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,340
consultants you don't you don't get paid

132
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,930
for showing up you get paid for doing

133
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,520
things you have lots of customers your

134
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,430
customers are your bosses and because

135
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,900
you have lots of them if you don't like

136
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,400
one you can you can get rid of them and

137
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,340
not have to find a new job you just make

138
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,190
less money temporarily that's it's a

139
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,770
nice it's a nice distinction and the

140
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,480
bottom one is important if you start out

141
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,780
a loan which depending on how you if you

142
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,130
if you want to start a business if your

143
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,400
entrepreneurial if you

144
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,040
start some open source project you can

145
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,570
either start alone you can find a group

146
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,509
of people in real life and go that route

147
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:50,870
but as you become more busy instead of

148
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,180
just working more and trying to be like

149
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,610
the superhero in your company you can

150
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,289
just work the same amount but hire other

151
00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:00,590
people to work with you this is really

152
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:04,639
cool when you find a project or business

153
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,130
that other people care about it in the

154
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,310
same way you do a good way to to meet

155
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,350
other people that way open source

156
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,949
economy there's some parallels here so

157
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:17,389
you build up your reputation your

158
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:20,120
networking your kind of stature your

159
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,300
clout on an open-source land by doing

160
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,580
things that's the same bullet point as

161
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,150
the first one in the consultant one and

162
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,010
when I say consultant I really just mean

163
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,380
like someone who's unemployed but still

164
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,030
makes money I feel like I fall in that

165
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:40,340
category open source is based on results

166
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,440
you've got to do stuff you commit code

167
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,810
you build some new project you're good

168
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,039
at reviewing other people's

169
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:47,780
contributions you're good at moderating

170
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,570
discussions in the in the issues things

171
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,820
like that and once you're there enough

172
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,590
and people kind of get used to you and

173
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,539
you meet other people online and then

174
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:58,070
you can go to conferences like this and

175
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,110
put faces to like github handles and

176
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,930
Twitter handles and so forth that's when

177
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,750
you actually begin to trust people this

178
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,409
isn't really the case when you're trying

179
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:12,110
to get hired at a company every company

180
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,699
like the interview process at most

181
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:15,220
companies is just complete voodoo-like

182
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,380
they you know studies show that they

183
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,639
decide whether they want to hire you in

184
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,030
the first 19 seconds or something and

185
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,460
it's just it's terrible so you end up

186
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,810
working with a bunch of people who were

187
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,510
hired in the first 20 seconds of them

188
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,940
seeing you and so like you look like the

189
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,669
person interviewing you right then you

190
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,930
like they're going to mediately like you

191
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:40,680
more because we're flawed human beings I

192
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,709
already covered the other two things

193
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:44,570
although the bottom thing is important I

194
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,430
think open source before if you look at

195
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,000
it kind of academically at a really

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,180
macro level it looks like this magical

197
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,200
communist

198
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,740
stick sort of symbiotic magic land where

199
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,730
everyone's just doing everything for

200
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,250
free and let's just all build things for

201
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,930
the good of the community and and all

202
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,880
this stuff but if you actually zoom in

203
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,800
and been witness the mechanics of how

204
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,720
everything's working everyone is super

205
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,340
selfish they want to do what they want

206
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,470
to do or they're trying to use it as a

207
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,260
means to some end to make money or to

208
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,140
become famous like if you you know build

209
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,090
some build some open source project with

210
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,590
a gazillion github stars right and

211
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,120
that's like that's like a strange form

212
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,160
of currency in our in our niche of the

213
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,680
world and it's it's pretty cool I mean

214
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,600
everyone is competing there are tons of

215
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,060
competing projects there's no there's

216
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,250
never any there's nowhere on github or

217
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,440
an open-source land nope one project

218
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,790
that rules them all except for maybe

219
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,310
maybe Linux that's sort of the like the

220
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:50,510
granddaddy of everything three this is

221
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,410
this is like these are some of these are

222
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,780
like banal platitudes just kind of

223
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,660
pointless cliche advice but these guys

224
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,010
are going to flow into some other things

225
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,190
i'm talking about also if you're bad at

226
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,390
stuff you can do it if you want but my

227
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,670
general feeling is that to use another

228
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,920
cliche like catching a falling knife is

229
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,000
painful if if you're going to if you're

230
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,180
going to be swimming upstream or

231
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,190
anything else like that where the odds

232
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:26,060
are against you don't do them unless you

233
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,650
like really care about them unless

234
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,910
you've gone your whole life like i

235
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,140
really want to do this one thing that

236
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,060
I've never done I've never experienced

237
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,120
and I want to learn it cool go do that

238
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,030
and become not bad at it right if you're

239
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,650
bad at stuff and you're never going to

240
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,060
get a good at it don't waste your time

241
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,040
right focus on things you care about and

242
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,000
things that you love and hopefully the

243
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,260
overlap of things you're good at and

244
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,450
things that you like doing that will

245
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:57,079
grow over time

246
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:02,279
I talked about earlier its rich strong

247
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:07,680
Lee incentivized inside of companies to

248
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,660
try to save the day when other people

249
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:14,699
won't or can't every business has

250
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:17,009
problems especially in software where

251
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,329
look nobody really knows what they're

252
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:24,180
doing it's it's really it's really

253
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,189
enticing to say you know what I'm gonna

254
00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:28,230
I'm going to bite the bullet I'm gonna

255
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,670
stay up on I I'm gonna make our delivery

256
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,610
happen on Monday or whatever i'm going

257
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,160
to stay up over the weekend like guess

258
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,230
what all deadlines are anyway

259
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,779
it at some level of every company

260
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,670
depending you all you have to do is go

261
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,279
up high enough you never reach a point

262
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,879
where the deadline is actually something

263
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:50,249
important it's just it you just go all

264
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:51,870
the way and it's everybody making

265
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,420
updates all the whole way there's never

266
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,209
any well we have this delivery has to

267
00:11:57,209 --> 00:11:58,949
happen when these planets align or the

268
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:00,209
world's going to explode that's never

269
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:01,800
going to happen deadlines are always

270
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,360
crap so if you're going to stay up all

271
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,209
night to try to help your boss look good

272
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:08,089
to their boss so that they look it's

273
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:12,639
it's it's it's all crap all the way down

274
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,329
don't do it because you're doing

275
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:17,309
yourself a disservice because guess what

276
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:19,920
you just you just stayed up all night

277
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,809
you made some delivery happen you did

278
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:24,059
the work of four people in two days and

279
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:26,040
because you didn't get any sleep first

280
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,120
of all you probably wrote a bunch of

281
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,470
crappy code you're gonna have to

282
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,920
maintain forever and now you've inflated

283
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,050
the expectations of yourself to everyone

284
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,360
around you forever you're screwed you

285
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,860
can never you have to do this all the

286
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,790
time it's it's a it's a bad place to be

287
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,709
it's another kind of vortex right the

288
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:45,839
imposter vortex something I think I

289
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:46,800
think we talk about a lot of this

290
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,829
conference which is good I have a

291
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:51,420
slightly different way of looking at it

292
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,600
though I think that a lot of the popular

293
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,230
lore around imposter syndrome is robots

294
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:02,429
around you know you you can you can

295
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:04,259
you're actually really good at what you

296
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:06,480
do deep down inside you just use don't

297
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,240
realize it and looking at everyone

298
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,920
around you look at them do stuff

299
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,130
you're you're seeing that is a well

300
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,829
they're so successful but I don't feel

301
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,440
that way so I you know I don't know how

302
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,110
to get there to me imposter syndrome is

303
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,810
actually the way I sort of avoid this

304
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,630
whole process is that I decided several

305
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,730
years ago that nobody actually has any

306
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,500
clue what's going on we're all just sort

307
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,420
of stumbling and bumping around in the

308
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,029
world in this like this really thin air

309
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:38,190
soup that we're all in together it's

310
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,829
keeping us alive and we're just trying

311
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:43,019
to figure it out right I happen to have

312
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:46,680
a degree from somewhere and the piece of

313
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,089
paper says like great like you learned a

314
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:52,380
bunch of stuff good for you but what

315
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,370
that what employers see is oh this

316
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,899
person knows the stuff we need them to

317
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:00,870
know no nobody knows anything our job is

318
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,209
to figure stuff out it's not to know

319
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:07,980
what we're doing looking at it that way

320
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,360
I don't feel like an imposter being up

321
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,639
here talking to you about this about all

322
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,130
this stuff because I'm trying to say

323
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,959
that I don't know what I'm doing right

324
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,899
that's that's my goal here and if i can

325
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:24,089
get up in and make a powerpoint

326
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:25,649
presentation something called powerpoint

327
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:30,930
so it's something else about this next

328
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:34,290
time you you're feeling apprehensive or

329
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,600
blocked by something that's that's

330
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,810
abstract like an emotion or a certain

331
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,089
disposition toward feeling like you

332
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,589
shouldn't start something because why

333
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:48,209
bother that's this is it's fun just just

334
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:50,699
do stuff because it's fun and in the

335
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,050
open source world you'll find other

336
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,399
people who want to do the same thing and

337
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:59,370
care about the same stuff it turns out

338
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,500
that job titles are actually marketing

339
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,149
terms job titles don't confer or convey

340
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:09,899
expertise or knowledge they're designed

341
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:12,930
to make people good and not bit like in

342
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,600
do hard work at their jobs right my

343
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,130
first job out of college was working for

344
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,690
a Wall Street firm and have this

345
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:23,750
interesting interesting take

346
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,780
on how to get productivity out of people

347
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:32,630
and it wasn't good the mindset is or was

348
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,810
or this isn't general but we heard

349
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,400
people talk about this a lot if you if

350
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,710
you get somebody to work 80 hours a week

351
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,620
for a year then in and get burned out

352
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,420
that's like that sucks right because

353
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,000
then you lose some some valuable person

354
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,950
that knowledge that's been built up over

355
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,710
that year is now going somewhere else

356
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:55,370
you lose this continuity but to a lot of

357
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,100
managers that's that's fine because for

358
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,410
that year you got two people for one and

359
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,090
they're burnt out there going to leave

360
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,440
something leave and go somewhere else

361
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,850
because what you can find somebody else

362
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,200
who's willing to do that there's this

363
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,600
endless line of people you can always

364
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,540
hire to be superheroes and try to get

365
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,760
that next next job title that next

366
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,920
promotion for like a four percent raise

367
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,550
or whatever probably whatever company

368
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,070
you work for like they have so much

369
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,040
money there's so much money this is this

370
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,900
is America it turns out that that money

371
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,760
is like everywhere except for where it

372
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,040
needs to be like there's tons of it

373
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,900
everywhere except it's not being up like

374
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,030
it's not applied to the right things

375
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,800
it's sitting in you know corporate bank

376
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,260
accounts and all these companies are

377
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,089
just buying Treasuries because they

378
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:42,430
don't have anywhere to put their money

379
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,900
they're paying it out as dividends and

380
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,880
so forth which is great like if you

381
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,560
should build up your career and buy

382
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,790
socks and 401k and all that but um you

383
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,380
know that'll be good for you but while

384
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,730
you're working there they're

385
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,990
incentivized to pay you as little as

386
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,520
possible while keeping you happy and

387
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,480
feeling important I think the open

388
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,250
source world back to this this

389
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,260
meritocratic mindset of produce results

390
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,230
hang out with people network it's a much

391
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:17,000
it's much more direct path toward doing

392
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,380
what you're supposed to be doing instead

393
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,150
of playing you know playing some

394
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:26,569
corporate corporate game this is sort of

395
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:30,020
how we get there right if we want to do

396
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,440
it we want to do

397
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,840
you could start moonlighting right if

398
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,789
you work somewhere now if you're

399
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:40,000
unemployed then that's great right you

400
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,129
have you have so much time and freedom

401
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:45,190
to like peer above all the crap and like

402
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,629
sir billi evaluate these sorts of things

403
00:17:46,629 --> 00:17:50,470
on your own you like look for a job

404
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,970
right so you can you can like pay your

405
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,460
bills and stuff but it's good to stake a

406
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,519
step back and think about what's out

407
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,059
there and realize that open source is

408
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:03,759
actually a very viable path toward the

409
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:05,440
type of career I think that a lot of us

410
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,480
want but we're not quite willing to make

411
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,220
the leap right the whole the boats

412
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,750
leaving the dock sort of thing and like

413
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,460
you've got one foot over here and you're

414
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,330
trying to make sure that the boat

415
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,039
doesn't leave but in like and then you

416
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:20,950
fall in atwater striking that balances

417
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:29,649
is important commit everything this is

418
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:31,210
just how how you exist as much as

419
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,610
possible right you want to inflict your

420
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,740
ideas on the world and that sounds like

421
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,690
a violent thing but by putting yourself

422
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,149
out there and by doing logging

423
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:42,909
everything you do in software if you're

424
00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:48,100
at software developer don't don't hold

425
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,019
back just just commit everything push

426
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:51,940
everything I wrote some stupid little

427
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,580
thing I wrote some idea paid like list

428
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,679
of ideas that I have well if someone has

429
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:57,850
the similar ideas you they're going to

430
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,980
google it and find your project and then

431
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,659
start asking you about hey were your

432
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:04,659
thoughts here can I do this or this like

433
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:06,759
I think I can do this better can I like

434
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:09,340
submit a pull request yeah great right

435
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,460
then you find a team sort of naturally

436
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,419
through through the open source

437
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:17,740
community process who all care about the

438
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,230
same thing that's really cool finding

439
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,669
people who care about the same thing as

440
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:23,860
you not just having a bunch of people

441
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,789
hired and planted on this team like

442
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:30,549
coincident to you like geo proximal to

443
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:36,639
your person it's it's much more magical

444
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:41,320
maybe I don't know what the word is it's

445
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,610
it's not forced

446
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,120
there's something having having things

447
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,520
naturally arise from like they're like

448
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,320
the great initial conditions as it's

449
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,100
it's it's cool in and of itself having

450
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,900
thing's for sure you can learn to get

451
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,250
along and build rapport with your team

452
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:04,429
but doing this naturally in open source

453
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:06,470
finding people who care about the thing

454
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,299
you care about before they're forced to

455
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:13,850
do it is is really neat so right i

456
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:18,679
already already mentioned this the point

457
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:20,990
is important and this goes back to some

458
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,700
of the things i was talking about near

459
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,720
the beginning is don't try to be good at

460
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,700
everything right if you think you're

461
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,500
good at everything you're probably wrong

462
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,820
i'm going to create a huge mess for

463
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,559
everyone around you so just stop dude

464
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:35,590
stop that right don't try to be a hero

465
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,330
try to be good at things you care about

466
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:42,830
and by caring about them and by wanting

467
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,809
to improve that's all that matters

468
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:47,210
you'll get there right if you care about

469
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,070
stuff you don't need to know everything

470
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,559
up front again none of us in this room

471
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:53,540
or in this building or in this industry

472
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,679
none of us are paid to know stuff before

473
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,179
we're doing it we're paid to figure it

474
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:01,640
out as we go because nobody nobody knows

475
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,340
how to do this its software it were

476
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,900
engineers engineering stuff we're

477
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,640
building new things if you were already

478
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,010
done we be it wouldn't it wouldn't be

479
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,510
the same right we it wouldn't matter

480
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,669
that we could figure stuff out we being

481
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:21,380
we'd be some other field this is this is

482
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,720
a kind of a grand izing statement a

483
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:29,130
little bit don't don't go flip the table

484
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,150
if you do make sure no one's out no one

485
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:36,110
else is around but video it and put on

486
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:41,490
YouTube maybe

487
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,070
in the meantime contributing to open

488
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,340
source is fun not everyone has a ton of

489
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,600
time after work to just continue to sit

490
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,470
at your computer and write code but I

491
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,060
think one of the things that we get

492
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,590
sucked into is again I bet very few of

493
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,480
us in here work only 40 hours a week and

494
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,470
most of us don't get paid for those

495
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:13,700
extra hours you're just giving your

496
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,360
company money by doing that they already

497
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,560
have they have plenty of money that

498
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,470
they're not giving to you so don't

499
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,940
there's any reason for you to feel loyal

500
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,480
in that way unless you really like what

501
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,590
you're doing you know what if you don't

502
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,640
care how much you're getting paid and

503
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,240
you really love it keep going that you

504
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,680
know that's that's what we're focusing

505
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,190
on here is doing what you want to do you

506
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,330
can look for other jobs in the meantime

507
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,370
if you just want to get paid more while

508
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,720
you're doing stuff even if you like what

509
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,370
you're doing go find another job offer

510
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,880
and negotiate it's a it's a great way to

511
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,970
unlock value that's there already but

512
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,460
that you can't quite honored because

513
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,890
you're in some sort of pay band or

514
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:59,390
whatever your company or if you know

515
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,440
they don't want to give you a raise you

516
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,910
can just leave and go get more money

517
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,070
somewhere else right you'll you'll make

518
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,510
the same sorts of friends that you you

519
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:11,730
currently have in your current company I

520
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,520
know a lot of us are nervous about

521
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,850
contributing there's this there's this

522
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,660
on Twitter there's this thing called

523
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,740
your first PR your foot pull request

524
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,140
this is how to start getting into github

525
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:31,910
it looks for pull requests or issues in

526
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,670
github that are accommodating to a

527
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,160
first-time github user or a first time a

528
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,160
new developer or maybe you're not

529
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,510
developing anything oh maybe improving

530
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,950
documentation or something like that

531
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,810
this is a good way to to get started I

532
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,820
recommend if if you're if you're not out

533
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,220
on github

534
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,350
or some other open source community

535
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,679
website take a look at this it's pretty

536
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:58,900
neat I actually went back and there's

537
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,700
another website is it's like what was

538
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,010
your first pull request ever and I went

539
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,419
in that it was like really nostalgia

540
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:06,059
standest alg akit was like something

541
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:09,700
with google web toolkit that I I don't

542
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,929
know I don't know I remember what I did

543
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:16,840
but man i wish i was over there holy

544
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,679
crap its Twitter exploding they may

545
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:27,820
announce some other amazing thing this

546
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,690
is my goal right we can all do stuff we

547
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,400
don't know how to do because we lose

548
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,380
track the fact that we do this every day

549
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,539
anyway we're all doing stuff we don't

550
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:41,020
know how to do I didn't know any of the

551
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,270
words I was going to say up here until

552
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,669
I'm up here right that's that can be

553
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:49,270
extended to anything right I don't know

554
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,500
what all the code is going to look like

555
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,470
for something I'm gonna build I might

556
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,760
not even know what I'm going to build

557
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,580
but I'm going to work through it both in

558
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,309
my head on paper and then in the

559
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:03,669
community get that feedback loop started

560
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,520
and just just do stuff right it doesn't

561
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,049
matter if it maybe build something and

562
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:11,260
nobody uses it right that's that's fine

563
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,299
nothing is a waste of time if you get

564
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:15,070
practice and you're able to hone your

565
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,460
skills in the meantime that's it is if

566
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,460
you have fun awesome right having fun is

567
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:28,690
is its own has its own value this is my

568
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:33,220
last slide by the way I think that if

569
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,780
you're interested in it actually is my

570
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,840
last slide okay making sure I'm gonna go

571
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,419
back to the front if you have questions

572
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:45,730
about anything i'm on twitter or github

573
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,820
I feel free to contribute to any of my

574
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,190
projects right because again open source

575
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,240
I'm selfish right I want people to

576
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,700
contribute to my stuff and you never

577
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,289
know once you build up this reputation

578
00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:02,140
on github you can start looking at you

579
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,970
you get known right I can

580
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,890
I can look around github and around the

581
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,230
community and around here and take oh

582
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,970
yeah that's you know that's that person

583
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,330
from github and you once you are that

584
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,000
vertex in this social connection that

585
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,309
people are making as they go through out

586
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:23,240
you know their lives in the career you

587
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,659
become more valuable right opportunities

588
00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:29,659
actually do come from other people it it

589
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:31,580
matters how hard you work and who you

590
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:35,990
know so I think in our industry open

591
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,030
source is the best way to leverage that

592
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:43,520
sort of networking process you don't

593
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,210
want to toil in obscurity and it's good

594
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,890
to get out there and do things that you

595
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,840
know maybe you're not comfortable with

596
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,210
but you'll you'll get there that's it

597
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:00,280
you can be the CEO of anything you want

598
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,049
especially if you're unqualified makes
