00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:13,220

[Music]

2
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,139
so this is party bus United so

3
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,750
previously we always had note bots at

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,270
JavaScript conference but in all this

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,670
what we did was the right-hand side

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,400
which were like simple BOTS cars that we

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,050
you would we would give the participants

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,300
and they would work on it and make it

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,759
stylistic so this times we wanted to be

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,380
more adventurous and try something new

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,690
so in the first session what we did was

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,960
we met made that so everybody get a

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,210
clear idea on how to control robots

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,879
using nodejs then what we wanted to do

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,789
was for them to make a bot that you

16
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,530
would use in a party it can be vaguely

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,469
at a party but then it's okay so we

18
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:58,469
brought a lot of stuff for them we had

19
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,420
poppers we were hoping to use some

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,899
flames or five lugs also but then we

21
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,280
didn't thank God I guess so those are

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,700
the things so I'll present to that two

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,390
that are here so this is one of the bots

24
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,700
one of the participants made its a

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,340
clapper so there is a motor running that

26
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,790
raises the wood thing and then it just

27
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,420
drops the next one is something like a

28
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,490
windmill so there's a fan so the idea is

29
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,680
when you turn up the turn on the lights

30
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,920
at home or the party is finished and

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,759
everybody turns of the lights then the

32
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,880
fan try gets blowing so that's the idea

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,710
behind it so then we'll go into the

34
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,560
other demos so if you can go to the live

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:01,649
demo live view so yeah so this would do

36
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:08,250
it first and the second

37
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,240
so this is supposed to be a cocktail or

38
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,260
a drink maker kind of thing so the idea

39
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:26,110
is let's see first okay so the idea is

40
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,270
this is supposed to work wireless in the

41
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,670
future or it's supposed to be working

42
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,460
Wireless so the idea is when somebody is

43
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,940
pouring the water here for the water

44
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,200
there so if there is a cup it if it pour

45
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,830
the water there in if you do it really

46
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,960
good it could be something like a magic

47
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,810
trick so that's our first pot that we

48
00:02:52,810 --> 00:03:02,260
made so the second one so the second one

49
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,250
is supposed to be something like so it's

50
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:22,910
another variation of a fan okay

51
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:33,300
yeah so you it actually blows very good

52
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:41,370
vend that's all right so let's now take

53
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,100
a look at the the other four who's gonna

54
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,880
talk about it

55
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,340
so first up please introduce yourself

56
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,380
for yourselves so my name is James and

57
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,660
this is Leon what did you set out to do

58
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,280
and is that the same thing is what it

59
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,060
became

60
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,980
roughly is so we started in the morning

61
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,470
with a car and then we decided that this

62
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,300
what looks like a toilet seat is

63
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,220
actually a basketball hoop so the

64
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,140
concept is like an arcade game where you

65
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,340
have a basketball hoop and you shoot it

66
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,489
in except one person can control it so

67
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:09,630
it makes it difficult for the other

68
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,720
person to score yeah passive aggressive

69
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:39,690
basketball hoop yes that's it

70
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,849
[Laughter]

71
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:48,139
except so oh it is my name is having us

72
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:53,809
and I have created a bot that that uses

73
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:56,449
mobilizer controller and besides it to

74
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:58,999
be can you the wise command like front

75
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:02,749
back left or right and it will do its

76
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:06,139
job accordingly so and this is working

77
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:37,740
yeah Wow

78
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:48,070
yeah so if I am giving the front

79
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,920
[Music]

80
00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:12,360
it will go left it will go right if I

81
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:23,630
will speak front walk back left right

82
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,980
[Applause]

83
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,220
for this I have used the emesis web RTC

84
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,340
SDK and I am recognizing the Y's and

85
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,400
after that I am sending that to the SDK

86
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,639
of RTC channel and after that it is

87
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,130
sending the signal to the robot and it

88
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,169
is doing its job accordingly that's

89
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:48,630
impressive to the design change while

90
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,830
you were producing it did you objective

91
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:53,610
change the intention change while you

92
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,539
were building it or was this more or

93
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,789
less what you set out to produce mmm

94
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:02,880
actually we can do little bit more thing

95
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,120
like machine learning on device

96
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,270
recognition so we can call either Google

97
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,349
library Google API dot AI or Watson or

98
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:18,360
we can use Alexa library and rest of the

99
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,880
things commands will be changed same the

100
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,930
similar thing can be used for mind

101
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,509
controlling we can train this for

102
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:29,789
controlling by mind so if somebody is

103
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:32,580
thinking far left it will go left it

104
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,870
will overwrite but for that I know one

105
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:47,099
emitter okay so let's start with who are

106
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,880
you oh hi I'm Melvin and this is San our

107
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,530
third member of the team is well yeah

108
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,419
he's somewhere out there having lunch

109
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:58,560
and a party but is going to dance and

110
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,930
any of a surprise what could possibly go

111
00:08:03,930 --> 00:09:00,540
wrong

112
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,890
okay yeah so hi this is Terry and this

113
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,680
is my partner mathé we have another one

114
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,830
para I couldn't find him so this is what

115
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:15,470
we this is the LED stripe and see what's

116
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:28,440
on it can alright okay what if I spin it

117
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:44,650
it's going up

118
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:54,629
intermittently okay the idea is you're

119
00:09:54,629 --> 00:10:00,000
supposed to see something this doesn't

120
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,319
seem like a robot how is this a robot

121
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:07,189
it's this is a robot who can have this

122
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,009
one-dimensional thing as a

123
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,290
two-dimensional degree display had you

124
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,250
intended that the Rebbe will have its

125
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,310
own arm to do this with it's actually

126
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,790
it's harder to use a human's beam

127
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,910
because you don't have like a steady rpm

128
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,319
that's the idea

129
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:29,189
so okay very cool okay how do we do on

130
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:35,129
the it's that called tech support

131
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:36,650
Lavallee

132
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,050
[Laughter]

133
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,500
all right

134
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,370
do you have other go this one or is this

135
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,129
[Laughter]

136
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:53,339
no are we giving up or is it all right

137
00:10:53,339 --> 00:11:11,970
this might be an appropriate moment okay

138
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:29,560
we're not seeing it sort of text okay

139
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:40,610
version two okay so this is me

140
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,579
attempting to pronounce names this time

141
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,740
because my co-host has already gotten

142
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,140
his turn so I'm just repeating the names

143
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,339
for those who have been who's had their

144
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:55,250
lightning talks being selected so first

145
00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:01,070
up is yuzu schwa the second person is

146
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:05,140
and um I've met the third person is from

147
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,920
param Sandra I'm sorry I'm really sorry

148
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,529
if I met any of your names the fourth

149
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:16,220
person is shilling Thai the fifth person

150
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:26,899
is you're sure you use person is rjl

151
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:30,740
elbow yeah that's that's it so if your

152
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,230
name has been caught you really should

153
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,649
show up at the through that is 2:45 time

154
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:39,500
slot where you'll be you'll be have a

155
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,760
chance to actually talk about your

156
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,040
lightning talks

157
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,630
great great thank you

158
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,940
hopefully all six people have heard at

159
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,010
least one of those announcements so

160
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,980
apparently this final partybot

161
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,510
having now built up the expectation is

162
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,510
going to dance for us

163
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,970
[Laughter]

164
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:11,950
this needs some music I if I sing

165
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:17,650
everybody will leave okay the most

166
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,660
exciting part of the dance hasn't yet

167
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,630
happened and I think all the electronics

168
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:28,860
just fell apart that's cheating

169
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:34,340
[Laughter]

170
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:43,930
but also effective yes okay anything

171
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,810
else we have a few minutes we'd like to

172
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,370
talk about things that didn't didn't

173
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:53,980
work yeah so one of the ideas was so one

174
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,510
of the ideas we had was to do there was

175
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,100
a sound controlled

176
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,350
so a sound control audio equalizer kind

177
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,580
of thing but with with actual like LED

178
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,790
no strips and one one thing we found out

179
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,940
was the the port or the sensor that we

180
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,490
were using was not not that powerful

181
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,860
enough or the quality was not that good

182
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,490
so we weren't able to do it one of the

183
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,080
other things we tried was like a nerf

184
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,560
gun that you can shoot one of the the

185
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,290
problem there was there was a thing in

186
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,350
the nerf grande one in in the nerf gun

187
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,950
that we had you have to charge it or do

188
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,890
some action beforehand and that was it

189
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,780
it was not only a trigger so that was a

190
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,620
hard thing too

191
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,930
so you need a sort of IOT optimized nerf

192
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,520
gun yes so those were those are the

193
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,440
things we tried well we did try we I

194
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,530
think we lost many boards on our Dino

195
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,990
nanos and who knows trying to make these

196
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:07,000
things and yeah it's hard yes I think

197
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,690
that's pretty much all that we try

198
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,800
did try alright well it's fantastic

199
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,810
I think huge round of applause for

200
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,670
actually making hardware work that's

201
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,350
always tough
