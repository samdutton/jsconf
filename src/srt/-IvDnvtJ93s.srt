the maze exists as a grid

61
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,590
we represent the amazing memory as a

62
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,259
one-dimensional array we can easily

63
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:58,229
translate between the XY coordinates of

64
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:00,600
the cells and the grid and the zero

these cells each sellers are so

67
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,800
contain simulation implemented as a

69
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,320
describe the cell and arrays to hold the

collections of actors that exist within

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,790
its neighbors a four element array

00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,810
representing north east south and west

74
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,230
if a given side of the cell is closed

75
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,580
the corresponding element in the

76
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,430
neighbors array is known if the side of

77
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,650
the cell is open the corresponding

78
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,690
element holds a reference to the

79
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,360
function object that is the neighboring

80
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,110
cell this lets us create a traversable

81
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,330
graph of cells that are connected

82
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,040
together and have cells that are

83
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,140
completely isolated from their neighbors

84
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,480
giving us access to a bountiful

85
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,550
abundance of powerful algorithms to make

86
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,910
a maze we start with a grid of

87
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,780
completely disconnected cells pick a

88
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,560
cell at random any cell will do pick a

89
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,510
neighbor of that cell ensuring that

90
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,100
neighbor has no connections of its own

91
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,360
create a mutual connection between the

92
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,410
two cells push the cell we came from

93
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,670
onto a stack or repeat the process from

94
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:33,150
the neighboring cell we selected as we

95
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,610
work our way through the grid we build

96
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,970
up a list of places we visited when

97
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,070
there are no more cells to explore we

98
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,320
pop an element off the stack and work

99
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,490
back the way we came

100
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,640
following up any unexplored cells we

101
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,510
find along the way when there's nothing

102
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:55,590
left on our stack we know we formed our

103
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:07,619
perfect maze

104
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:10,580
each cell is a self-contained simulation

105
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,909
it is a floorspace and collections of

106
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:15,860
actors that interact with each other

107
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,849
within that space a game loop runs 60

108
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:20,810
times a second

00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,340

00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,740
iterate through our array of cells

112
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,050
giving each one a chance to run its

113
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,240
simulation so it's actors can observe

114
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,010
their environment and react accordingly

115
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,979
the simulations use simple counters

116
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:41,990
periodic waveforms and the probability

117
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,760
of events occurring to modulate

118
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,149
parameters and trigger effects each

119
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:49,880
class of actor has a set of interacting

120
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,029
behaviors combining several simple

121
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:55,820
behaviors together can make for complex

122
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:01,820
results when an actor moves to the edge

123
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,430
of a cell and that edge is closed

124
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,790
they reflect off the walls exert a kind

125
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,500
of short-range as some topic

126
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,839
anti-gravity expressed as a force vector

127
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,350
and applied to the actors velocity

128
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,829
causing them to move away from the wall

129
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:21,740
if the side of the cell is open the

130
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,630
actor is moved into the neighboring cell

131
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,880
with a bit of mass applied to their

132
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:32,069
position to reflect their entry point

133
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:34,940
the human exhibits a consuming impulse

134
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:42,150
to seek the reactor sabotage and escape

135
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,000
the rats exhibit a base

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,100
flocking behavior with a cluster and

137
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,440
move together as a group or maintaining

138
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,850
some separation from their friends

139
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,710
the killer ants have the same base

140
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,800

142
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,400
behaviors beholden us be able to find

143
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,040
our way through the mains we always have

144
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
an origin and a desired destination

145
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,740
because we have a perfect maze we can

146
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,350
always find away from oneself to any

147
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,760
other from our origin we expand a search

148
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,740
frontier through every connected cell we

149
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,300
can find as we search we record the

150
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,370
place we came from and calculate the

151
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,040
cost in terms of distance for us to get

152
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,940
to each cell if for a given path there

153
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,070
are no more cells to explore we

154
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,839
terminate our search on that path if we

155
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,790
reach our destination our search is

156
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,130
complete and we use a list of places we

157
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:00,780
came from to determine our route we can

158
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,570
enhance the solver to the cost

159
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,270
calculation for each cell based roughly

160
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,950
on the distance from that cell to our

161
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,230
destination and following the path with

162
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,600
the lowest cost to help us reach our

163
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:20,910
goal quickly when the human enters the

164
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,450
maze he uses the formula to determine

165
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,570
the route to the reactor the steps of

166
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,190
the path are contained in an array of

167
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,230
cell indexes arranged an order from

168
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,380
start to finish from the seller humanism

169
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,110
we determine the exit that is connected

170
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,020
to the next step in the path and apply a

171
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,339
force vector to the human in that

172
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,080
direction pushing him out through the

173
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,540
exit and into the next cell until he

174
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,360
reaches the reactor when it's time to

175
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,860
escape the path is reversed

176
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:59,250
it would be too expensive to calculate

177
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,930
the path through the maze for each

178
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,920
individual rent so before updating each

179
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,570
cell determines the route through its

180
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,730
neighbors to the human applying a force

181
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,800
vector to all killer rats on the cell

182
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,450
pushing them out through the exit

183
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,029
creating the illusion that they are

184
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:23,470
seeking the human to devour his flesh

185
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,150
when a maze is created we need to seed

186
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,450
it with interesting objects some cells

187
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,520
have a special object in them like the

188
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,350
reactor or a rant Factory the first cell

189
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,270
in the maze is always the ingress the

190
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,480
human enters through the last cell is

191
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,270
always the reactor the human follows a

192
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,339
path from the ingress to the reactor and

193
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:50,339
back we can treat the sips of this path

194
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,190
as linear and pick points of random or

195
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,650
according to some rules placing items in

196
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,850
the cells referenced by those points we

197
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,550
can also place items off the path so

198
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,709
they have an effect on play but don't

199
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:10,630
interfere with the humans movement a

200
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,260
level counter is incremented each time a

201
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,320
maze is completed as the human

202
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,270
progresses through the levels the mazes

203
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,370
get larger with more devious entities

204
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,850
hiding in their depths the occurrence of

205
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,680
monsters in the first four levels is

206
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,580
hard-coded

207
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,339
but beyond that some cheap tricks are

208
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:30,959
employed to create the illusion of

209
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,810
forethought if we take a level number

210
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,630
and apply some modular arithmetic we can

211
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,850
activate a disable the occurrence of

212
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,010
certain effects and objects based on the

213
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:44,100
result every third level zooms to follow

214
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,010
the human every seventh lever has extra

215
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,339
power-ups every thirteenth level is a

216
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:57,310
tiny maze

217
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:03,770
the future is uncertain but one day soon

218
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:14,350
the human race must enter the maze of
