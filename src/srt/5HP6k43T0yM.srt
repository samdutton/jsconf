00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:20,080

all right hi how is everybody

2
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,220
I'm Tim actually I'll fix this for you

3
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,320
I'm from Australia so that was pretty

4
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,990
that was a pretty cool new joke I'm

5
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,250
allowed to do that because I'm actually

6
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,050
from Australia so that's alright

7
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,150
CSS cough god it's been such a big day

8
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,860
today it's been such a good day I feel I

9
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,380
feel so privileged to be amongst like

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,910
the speakers that we've had

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,280
it's truly special and everyone has been

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,590
like so insanely helpful I had this

13
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,590
weird moment earlier today where my I

14
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,510
didn't bring like a German convert a

15
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,910
plug and my laptop was getting getting

16
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,129
low and Mac started doing like power

17
00:00:57,129 --> 00:00:59,739
saving things and eventually just

18
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:01,570
stopped responding and I had to like do

19
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,620
that thing where you hold the power

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,360
button down and I felt really weird I

21
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,530
was like I was smothering it with a

22
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,380
pillow it's like Shh it's gonna be all

23
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,010
over soon that was I was a bit strange

24
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,080
so it was like yeah there's been such a

25
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,510
huge variety of talks today this is this

26
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,689
is a little bit of a different talk

27
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,040
because you're definitely not going to

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,659
learn anything if anything it's kind of

29
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:24,939
like an unlearning unlearning kind of

30
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:26,860
talk I've definitely seen the sketch

31
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,450
notes from my talks before and it's just

32
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,280
basically an empty page with my name

33
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,799
written in the centre so take your

34
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,439
thinking caps off we're gonna go on a

35
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,970
great great adventure I want to talk

36
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,700
about fun I want to talk about having

37
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,140
fun with the code and having fun with

38
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,340
the tools that we have because we have

39
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,890
so much power and we have so much

40
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,200
ability to create such crazy cool things

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,180
you know I'm happy to like talk about

42
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,479
CSS all day and I can talk about kind of

43
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,890
like the frameworks and stuff but in a

44
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,570
weird way I kind of feel like I'm

45
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,490
talking about building a kite and I'm

46
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,689
not actually talking about flying the

47
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:00,070
kite and flying the kite is the best

48
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,960
thing so that's that's kind of what this

49
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,549
talk is about this is my qualification

50
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:05,590
CSS for babies that's where I learned

51
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,410
everything so the first thing that I

52
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,880
want to talk about is this is this kind

53
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,370
of framework I you've kind of seen these

54
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,840
like star wipes going on actually

55
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,890
everything in this whole talk is

56
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,460
epileptic I'm sorry I really like I just

57
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,170
put oh there he goes well there we go

58
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,150
here's the CSS for that it's using mask

59
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,610
image with an SVG which is fantastic it

60
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,840
kind of gives you some cool things like

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,650
I can change it to hearts I can do a hot

62
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,360
which was really nice like a thumbs up

63
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,860
maybe some subliminal messaging there

64
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,290
like Tim's a cool guy Tim's a cool guy

65
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,480
Tim's a cool guy Tim's a cool guy

66
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,579
I put I put him a stash in that for Nick

67
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:45,049
actually which was nice yeah I also I

68
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:46,609
also put a donkey in that which is

69
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:48,019
technically an asswipe

70
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:50,060
so I was pretty proud of myself there

71
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,290
they hit my new in maturity levels but

72
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,930
let's stick with the star I found this

73
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,359
great video it was actually a tribute to

74
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:02,780
star wipes in a star wipe format which

75
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,889
was which was kind of like the

76
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:06,019
inspiration to want to make a

77
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,609
presentation framework because there's

78
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:09,349
so many this reveal Jay asked is like I

79
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:10,819
know there's a thousand systems to do

80
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,439
these things but none of them offered

81
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,939
star wipes which which was a little bit

82
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:16,549
distressing anyway this is kind of what

83
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:17,959
I'm talking about when I say fun like I

84
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:20,299
I really like to run into something and

85
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:22,159
kind of hit it head-on really football

86
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,780
and then kind of start exploring and

87
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,310
start going like a little bit deeper and

88
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,389
a little bit deeper and a little bit

89
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:29,359
deeper to see kind of where it can go

90
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:30,859
and what what we can kind of do with

91
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:34,819
with what we're creating in school

92
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:36,760
school in Australia was pretty laid-back

93
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,500
I was kind of like a little bit of a

94
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,889
lazy kid and I know CSS is is something

95
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,870
that you can kind of use lazily and you

96
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,090
can use aggressively and powerfully and

97
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,150
I sometimes I find myself leaning kind

98
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,099
of on the lazy side but it was also a

99
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,799
great way to kind of describe things so

100
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,440
here's me this is a weird format that's

101
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,819
the number I decided I was probably

102
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:01,400
about this 63rd thousandth Tim Holman in

103
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,620
the world which is you know it's just

104
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,090
nice I'm about seven thousand pixels

105
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,699
tall probably um

106
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:10,790
yeah mm wide I've got some padding now

107
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,919
that it's summer well summers ending but

108
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,599
hopefully I can get rid of that padding

109
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,099
this is kind of what I did with my

110
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:17,539
assignments in school you had to submit

111
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:19,130
assignments like it's three pages or

112
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,349
four pages of five pages or ten pages it

113
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:24,229
was particularly bad and you could kind

114
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:26,599
of cheat the system so like books I

115
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,190
bought a box it's a piece of paper of

116
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,580
course first increase the padding like

117
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,260
then you're gonna have less words in

118
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,000
each line it's gonna stuck in our faster

119
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,090
next increase the word spacing suddenly

120
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,969
like one page is at least two pages now

121
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:42,919
increase the letter spacing when you're

122
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:44,659
really like slip that one through the

123
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,300
teachers it's a good way to do it and

124
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,099
it's the lazy way it's the lazy approach

125
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:51,189
it's the Tim Holman tried and trusted

126
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:58,129
method for for development so I kind of

127
00:04:58,129 --> 00:04:59,419
wanted to put something like that into

128
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:00,949
this into this presentation that was

129
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:02,029
kind of like oh you know I've got to

130
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:04,580
talk for for 30 minutes or so what's

131
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,830
like the the padding decrease that I can

132
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,719
put on this so like into the framework

133
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:10,159
here I kind of build a system to like

134
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:12,740
slow down the transition so I can really

135
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,699
like play it slow make sure I get the

136
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,929
time that I'm kind of going for yeah you

137
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:22,189
know and that I can speed it up again it

138
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,539
can be like fostering the furious oh

139
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:24,499
that's not fast enough

140
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:27,459
Vin Diesel that's me what I'm developing

141
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:30,559
I liked I actually really like these CSS

142
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:32,360
puns in this I guess there's a ton of

143
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,830
them online there was a few like reddit

144
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,419
threads and this is like a nice one Lego

145
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,339
display:block I like it because I

146
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:39,759
understand it that's the main thing

147
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,659
Titanic float:none yeah so it's not in

148
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:47,149
bad taste so well no they didn't even

149
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:49,309
know about CSS back then periodic

150
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:51,259
display table that's a good one

151
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:53,479
muffins ready over for wide visible if I

152
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:54,680
made them you'll never get to that

153
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,979
status Chuck Norris's color is badass

154
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:01,819
naturally this is really cool I'm from

155
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,469
Australia that's the that's the rotation

156
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:05,329
that I have naturally in my eyes

157
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:07,180
everyone sitting on the roof right now

158
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,319
this was kind of me when I found these

159
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:11,269
these plums I was like I'm gonna be

160
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:12,769
great at this I'm like I can be a funny

161
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:15,979
guy I can make some weird jokes and all

162
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:17,179
of them turned out to be really

163
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:18,110
depressing actually

164
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,800
so like here's me here are my abs

165
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,059
display:none here's me here's my beard

166
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:28,939
now I've got like a patchy SVG mask over

167
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:31,339
it for the rest of my life this is my

168
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:34,099
regular transition speed like that's

169
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:35,269
pretty accurate

170
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,159
when seamless arrives at the door BAM

171
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,539
I'm fast as anything do you have

172
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:40,219
seamless here for me no like Chinese

173
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:43,429
delivery what I'm preparing for this

174
00:06:43,429 --> 00:06:45,889
slow is anything I kind of like really

175
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:47,209
got bogged down I kind of got bogged

176
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:50,360
down building the system this is me when

177
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,919
I'm making something and I stop to think

178
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:52,879
of ideas do you ever get that feeling

179
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,870
when you're when you're

180
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,390
well doing something and your your head

181
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,890
is just going off it's like if I wasn't

182
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,240
developing this these are the other

183
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,680
things that I would be developing that's

184
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,270
like me all the time I'm just like I'm

185
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,500
building this but we're gonna be cool if

186
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,700
I wasn't doing this and I could do

187
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,470
something else and I just want to start

188
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,340
something start something start

189
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,020
something something start something so

190
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,610
when I made this I started to make this

191
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,650
presentation to talk about a fun with

192
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,030
CSS and I spent most of the time

193
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,770
building the framework which is which is

194
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,350
now what I'm talking about I kind of

195
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,610
have like this nervousness when I'm

196
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,750
developing I don't know where I came

197
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,060
from to be honest probably like

198
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,890
untrustworthy Australian Internet where

199
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,540
I just like saved everything I'm just

200
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,950
like safe safe safe safe safe safe safe

201
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,020
three times I press the Save button at

202
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,000
least three times on every file that I

203
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,190
want to save I built this into here so

204
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,490
like every slide I can kind of save my

205
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,880
there we go

206
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,760
I can save me I save my status save

207
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,890
where I'm at keep going it's a nice you

208
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,300
know it's a nice little fullback here's

209
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,030
me clapping applauding myself like clean

210
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,380
girl free so this was like my list of

211
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,330
fears when when I was giving a

212
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,040
conference talk like everybody kind of

213
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,410
has like a few little fears obviously

214
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,550
the first one was that I wasn't feeling

215
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,700
the time which which I can defeat by

216
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,320
slowing the transition slowing the

217
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,850
slides down a lot I might do it you know

218
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,560
I've got a clock here if I'm if I'm not

219
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,460
feeling in time

220
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,690
that's definitely what's gonna happen

221
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,370
everything's gonna break down you know I

222
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,900
can't really do that much about that but

223
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,490
I can definitely like save my position

224
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,380
on every single slide every single time

225
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,330
and the next one was like that I'm gonna

226
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,090
forget what I'm gonna say which is you

227
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,350
know that's a huge fear right like

228
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,790
public speaking is a huge fear you come

229
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,620
up and you're like oh what was I going

230
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,180
to say what was I gonna say so I needed

231
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,430
to build in speaking notes obviously to

232
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,580
this this presentation system so I did

233
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,530
it like this you know here here up come

234
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,810
my hand so you can actually will see it

235
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,100
you know it's kind of nice I'm like if I

236
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,630
have trouble seeing things you guys can

237
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,530
see it as well it was it was a nice

238
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,970
system that was actually that was

239
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,520
papyrus if anyone asked I actually found

240
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,630
somebody the other day

241
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,240
combined comic sans and papyrus into a

242
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,630
new super font move-over Helvetica

243
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,020
papyrus sans is here it was fantastic

244
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,730
this was the CSS that I used to make my

245
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,400
hands look less ugly in there a little

246
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,050
bit of blur you know Photoshop is dead

247
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,490
we already learned it today a little bit

248
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,140
of brightness a little bit of grayscale

249
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,000
take some color out of these

250
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,280
bad boys maybe I'm born with it maybe

251
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:17,560
it's mabeline all right

252
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,580
really I should just like blow them

253
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,930
completely and you wouldn't you wouldn't

254
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,370
have to deal with you wouldn't have to

255
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,810
deal with those hands are really weird

256
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,070
when you look at them up close and

257
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,390
especially when you're developing

258
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,000
looking at hands I kind of had this

259
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,950
problem when I built the system to to

260
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,680
give me to give me notes where I was

261
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,790
kind of like rehearsing and practicing

262
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,160
the speech as a practicing the talk as

263
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,620
you do and I kind of found that I wasn't

264
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,570
actually learning it like I was you know

265
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,890
I was kind of falling back into those

266
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,690
lazy ways and I was cheating again

267
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,310
so like every slide I'd be like what's

268
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,720
that like this you know this doesn't

269
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,860
really make sense I'm like what was I

270
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,230
trying to do there and and of course I

271
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,370
would like get out the hands and it's

272
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,950
like oh why why can't I stop cheating so

273
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,150
I kind of had to build it this thing

274
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,150
where after i after I try to cheat for a

275
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,620
few times it starts messing with the

276
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,390
text you know it gets gets worse it gets

277
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,020
worse

278
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,690
we're like checking you know that would

279
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,260
be bad

280
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,670
and then eventually it's like you're

281
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,010
over you're done Tim you're you're in

282
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,160
big trouble I kind of like this concept

283
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,020
I kind of liken it to Bilbo in the ring

284
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,670
like he kind of relies on this thing and

285
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,490
it just just kind of goes a little bit

286
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,860
crazy in the end and the concept of like

287
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,990
computers getting mad at us and kind of

288
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,060
like intentionally building something to

289
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,770
to hurt people and to ruin people's

290
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,450
experience I kind of really like that

291
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,400
idea I think it's like a weird way of

292
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,170
thinking when you're when you're trying

293
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,970
to make an experience negative on you're

294
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,200
trying to make something a little bit

295
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,310
worse so trying to make something a

296
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,200
little bit weird and a little bit more

297
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,690
wrong because nobody really does that

298
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,120
that much and passwords are a big one

299
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,190
possible is just like well it's kind of

300
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,780
like a pet peeve of mine where you put

301
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,520
in a password and it's like oh your

302
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,500
password is too it's too simple like

303
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,089
that's kind of an insult it's like Tim

304
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,430
your simple person you can't you can't

305
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,680
remember anything else and I kind of

306
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,000
like feel a little bit hurt by that

307
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,410
every single time I get her I feel like

308
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,540
my password 10 years ago if I use it

309
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,400
again now it's like the technology's

310
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,570
changed we understand that right the

311
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,130
technology has changed you can crack

312
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,740
passwords faster so I kind of my

313
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,950
Possible's got weaker over time and and

314
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,000
I kind of wanted to play around with

315
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,150
that this is a website that I built with

316
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,560
friend is called the passive-aggressive

317
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,100
password machine my my my path to world

318
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,350
dominance of course of all's around

319
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,990
having my own password algorithm to

320
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,610
detect strengths so when you're kind of

321
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,470
talking that the idea was like you're

322
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,120
kind of being talking down to like

323
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,860
really you called that a password do you

324
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,630
even know what a password is that's what

325
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,280
I feel when I says my possible speak I'm

326
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,630
not angry I'm just disappointed

327
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,760
my mom's used that one on me before and

328
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,860
it stings the most right to your core

329
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,240
you never you never really forget though

330
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,040
and try hard I like blah blah you know

331
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,280
it gets I got some numbers in there in

332
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,240
the end it's like you're not even gonna

333
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,300
remember this part that's okay because

334
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,900
at least you're proud of me now yeah I

335
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,880
kind of get like a little bit yeah I

336
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,440
kind of get a little bit down when I see

337
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,820
these things and and it's kind of nice

338
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,290
to to kind of explore them and you know

339
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,730
sometimes you get a little bit sad maybe

340
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,780
I'm making some jokes in the

341
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,310
presentation and the not quite going

342
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,340
over as well so I kind of built in

343
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,900
motivational notes so like if I press em

344
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,420
it's like Tim you can do it amazing like

345
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,580
you're doing great thank you Oh God oh

346
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,220
it's so nice isn't it I feel really good

347
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,570
now and then I was like maybe Tim you're

348
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,860
gonna get you're gonna get a little bit

349
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,420
over you're gonna get a little bit too

350
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,010
on top so I have some demotivational

351
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:40,870
ones as well all right let's keep it

352
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,950
happy let's keep it happy I kind of got

353
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,570
a lot I got pretty distracted building

354
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,960
this whole thing you know that's that's

355
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,030
kind of the crux of it I built in x-ray

356
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,220
mode oops so it goes all kind of x-ray

357
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,360
if you try to get speaking those in

358
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,040
x-ray mode you get skeleton hands that's

359
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,560
nice that's a must in anything really

360
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,740
it's on x-ray off I can like I know if

361
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,940
you can see it here I can like beach

362
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,760
ball beach ball my mouth you know just

363
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,310
in case I need to have some unenforced

364
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,960
technical difficulties and get out of

365
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,290
here

366
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,590
it's a weird thing when you just kind of

367
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,880
go down the rabbit hole and there's

368
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,170
nothing really stopping you you just

369
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,730
kind of get deeper and deeper and deeper

370
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,780
and deeper strange yeah so that's that's

371
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,100
star wipe

372
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,050
the the presentation system of the

373
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,120
future but I should I should move on

374
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,260
from there

375
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,030
but is this fun is this the kind of fun

376
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,260
thing this is the stuff that I enjoy

377
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,450
making the most like I I know there's

378
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,860
nothing really holding you back there's

379
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,300
no one telling me there's no one telling

380
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,710
anyone here really like this is the

381
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,350
wrong way to to kind of enjoy yourself

382
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,790
and to make weird things and kind of

383
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,920
like surprise and delight everybody that

384
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,000
you're that you're going through I this

385
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,180
is a good slide isn't it

386
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:03,480
no notes there I was a bit of a

387
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,390
prankster in school and and kind of as

388
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,810
as I've grown up you know the pranks

389
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,490
kind of evolved and they use like in

390
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,140
school you have like a pencil or a glue

391
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,640
stick and you put on someone's chair and

392
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,950
it's the funniest thing

393
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,630
and as you know as you kind of grow into

394
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,030
a new set of tools your your pranks

395
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,370
evolve a little bit and there's a lot of

396
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,510
cool stuff that you can do with CSS

397
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,090
that's the equivalent of chucking a

398
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,820
slice of cheese on someone's bass

399
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,870
there's this file I don't know if

400
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,170
anyone's seen it custom CSS and it lives

401
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,380
in the chrome lives in like the chrome

402
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:41,040
like root of your of your laptop and any

403
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,410
CSS that you put in this file will run

404
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,700
on every single page that person goes to

405
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,540
it's it's fantastic it's really really

406
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,310
when I found this like I ran straight to

407
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,900
the bathroom and giggled for like five

408
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,320
minutes

409
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,760
I hadn't even done anything I was like

410
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,390
oh we are gonna have so much fun here so

411
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,890
he wrote like a little bash script that

412
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,020
that would inject whatever I wanted into

413
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,700
this into this and when somebody leaves

414
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,470
that laptop open I would kind of go onto

415
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,360
that computer and you know get it out of

416
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,620
github and I just paste it into a

417
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,780
terminal close the terminal delete the

418
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,800
history of the browser and it's

419
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,240
completely gone and this is so good so

420
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,190
custom CSS it is God's gift to man

421
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,080
so this is a good one this was the the

422
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:31,750
hue rotation put it on everything forget

423
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,160
it throw out the rulebook there is no

424
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,340
rulebook you know we understand this

425
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,630
thing we could probably look at it and

426
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,550
go oh something strange is happening

427
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,320
here but I don't quite tell what it is

428
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,360
but you know if you do that to your

429
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,910
sister or your workmates

430
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,580
no idea here's like I mean I include

431
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,640
that little effect or if it loads this

432
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,200
is it you've got to do it really subtle

433
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,090
like you have to have like this is ten

434
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,070
seconds this is too fast you don't want

435
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,150
to do it in ten seconds you want to do

436
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,340
it over 100 seconds you want somebody on

437
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,620
Google to just be like a little bit

438
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,230
questioning if they're going crazy

439
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:15,090
just a little bit

440
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,870
I mean it doesn't end there it doesn't

441
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,040
end there

442
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,690
this is a good one a lot of things use

443
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,090
the class an ID logo you can rotate them

444
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,860
and this is kind of a broad this is what

445
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,540
I call like a broad spectrum prank

446
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,710
really because this is good this is kind

447
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,820
of it doesn't ruin your experience

448
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,290
you're gonna see it and you're gonna be

449
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,700
on google and you're gonna see the logo

450
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,520
kind of rotating like Oh Google's doing

451
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,850
one of those things today yeah it must

452
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,100
be it must be like the invention of the

453
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,520
merry-go-round or something Netflix it

454
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,170
does I just kind of like put this on for

455
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,960
a while tried it out and you kind of

456
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,220
forget when you've done this to somebody

457
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,710
because it's not that harmful but every

458
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,120
now and then like I've had this like

459
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,770
passing like I've kind of overheard it

460
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,090
in the office was like have you noticed

461
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,320
that all the websites online are

462
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,260
spinning it's been happening for the

463
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,180
past few weeks I'm like oh I left

464
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,440
it on this guy's okay I left it there

465
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,820
Google's the same logo no it's a nice

466
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,400
it's a nice subtle subtle messing

467
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,449
sometimes you can just make everything

468
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:18,339
grayscale there's suddenly everyone

469
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,060
thinks that they're a little bit

470
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,180
colorblind this is cruel and it's kind

471
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,350
of especially strange to have you open

472
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,360
Firefox everything's fine go back to

473
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,589
Chrome me like oh my chrome is just

474
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:29,040
screwed everything's black and white

475
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,450
doesn't doesn't make any sense this is

476
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,070
what I actually tried to do first I

477
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:36,610
tried to yeah took Oh Tim you've gone

478
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:40,270
too far you've gone too far it doesn't

479
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:44,260
work it doesn't work I was I was so

480
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,520
excited I particularly like this because

481
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,260
it refuses to recognize papyrus as a

482
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,810
font in the first place it's just gonna

483
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,280
sit there in the white why would that

484
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:54,730
happen

485
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,180
I mean papyrus sans is fine just make

486
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,400
all the links hot pink you know just a

487
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,750
subtle thing that's harmless do what you

488
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,490
want I kind of like this idea again of

489
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,240
like making experiences worse for people

490
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,040
you know sometimes sometimes you can

491
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,930
kind of unlock some new ideas there and

492
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,460
you can kind of like find these new

493
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,280
treasure troves of weirdness and and you

494
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,660
get a little bit of perspective as well

495
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,130
you're kind of going down this rabbit

496
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,230
hole of making something worse and you

497
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,940
can kind of get a good perspective and

498
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,860
thing like oh you know everything's not

499
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,419
that bad really

500
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:32,679
this is a great image of a pop up you

501
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,179
know everyone has seen these on the web

502
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,619
Google is kind of penalizing for

503
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:37,749
penalizing your your search ranking for

504
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,039
hitting a web page with these pop-ups

505
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,989
this is like demonic spawn of a pop up

506
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:43,179
you know that because it's got sound one

507
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:45,669
that's like checkbox amazing it's kind

508
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:47,739
of selling itself it like consumes the

509
00:18:47,739 --> 00:18:49,359
whole screen I've had to build pop-ups

510
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,409
like this before I've worked in

511
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:53,799
advertising I I don't fully believe in

512
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,989
like the the self-righteous web

513
00:18:55,989 --> 00:18:57,549
developer where you're like I absolutely

514
00:18:57,549 --> 00:18:59,080
refuse to build this because it's your

515
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,460
job sometimes you have to do these

516
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,960
things and I kind of like this

517
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,710
experience of making things worse again

518
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,909
I just keep saying and I'm a bad person

519
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:11,649
social media is kind of spamming is is a

520
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:13,210
good example of that and this is this is

521
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,129
a website that I built trying to think

522
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:16,509
like you know the pop up will come up

523
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:18,159
and say like tweet this page we need you

524
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:19,539
to share this like thousand Facebook

525
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:21,789
Likes we need likes and I kind of built

526
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:23,049
this library it's got like a little bit

527
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:24,940
of subliminal messaging in the

528
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,739
background and wherever you move your

529
00:19:26,739 --> 00:19:28,960
mouse on the webpage the tweet button

530
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,460
actually sticks to it that's fifty four

531
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,100
thousand tweets right there I actually

532
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,049
have to filter it out of my feed because

533
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:40,179
it's annoying as it's really

534
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,639
frustrating I haven't seen this in the

535
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,100
wild but I actually am convinced that is

536
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,340
a very effective mechanism I should go

537
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,470
to the next like spam Kampf and be you

538
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,649
know report my findings it's weird like

539
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:55,149
that it's making things worse it makes

540
00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:57,009
you kind of understand that you know

541
00:19:57,009 --> 00:19:59,080
everything is okay interactions a big

542
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,289
one this is a website that I built for a

543
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:04,869
friend who who has this app called

544
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:06,369
authentic weather and it's kind of like

545
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:08,289
a weather app that is it's a little bit

546
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:09,909
brutally honest it's like it's

547
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,249
rainy right now look outside you don't

548
00:20:12,249 --> 00:20:15,249
need to know the weather and that's kind

549
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:16,509
of like a simple site you know it's not

550
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:18,009
it's not too crazy it's got some like

551
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,320
Instagram things get your sunglasses

552
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,619
it's very cozy and and this is this was

553
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:25,269
kind of a nice web site to build it

554
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:27,220
didn't look particularly bad it wasn't

555
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,749
all that sweet bones in the wrong place

556
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:31,929
whoever built that is terrible yeah it

557
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:34,929
doesn't really like represent a big

558
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:36,879
challenge but it's kind of nice to build

559
00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:39,039
and and I kind of like to ask myself

560
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,239
whenever I'm building something like

561
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,020
what can I get out of this

562
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,280
whether I'm gonna go in a weird

563
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,600
direction and make something worse or

564
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,030
I'm gonna make something better what

565
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,550
what small amount can I gain where can I

566
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,170
inject some creativity where can I have

567
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:54,470
some fun and this was the button I'll

568
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,330
let me zoom you know this was like the

569
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,010
blue buttons on that on that on the side

570
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,240
that said like click this and you can

571
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,530
download the app and click this and you

572
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,770
can get the Android app and and I kind

573
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,150
of wanted to like put something fun in

574
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,290
there so I kind of injected like a

575
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,820
little bit of a story into this button

576
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,470
so when you hover it's like how are you

577
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,010
today

578
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,920
I'm doing well thanks for asking just

579
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,350
keep hovering it's a good life being a

580
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:19,100
button the work is hard but enjoyable

581
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:29,370
yeah it's great save me

582
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,880
it's nice right it doesn't do it doesn't

583
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,610
do any harm like it's it's you know some

584
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,110
people can kind of breeze by this it's

585
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,400
like that little bit of surprise and

586
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,440
delight and a little bit of fun and I

587
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,850
could take this out of the website and I

588
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,590
could put it on like code pen or I could

589
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,360
put it kind of in an isolated place and

590
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,190
I feel happy that it exists and I feel

591
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,870
like a little bit proud that it's you

592
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:48,770
know that it's there and then it's

593
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:51,530
around and this is the nice way again a

594
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,850
kind of looking at things and looking at

595
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,010
interaction of course there is the bad

596
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,480
way again that I keep saying that's like

597
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,190
always two sides this is what funny gif

598
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,540
isn't it there's two sides of a coin

599
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,550
this was this was a library that had

600
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,490
built gift links this was this was again

601
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,050
like playing with hover interactions and

602
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,140
the kind of thought was was like how can

603
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,230
a computer kind of punch you in the face

604
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,940
so so when your hobby is like you know

605
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,680
there's orange orange like since the

606
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,850
dawn of the internet the world has been

607
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,590
asking why a hover interaction so boring

608
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,300
only recently has a new paradigm arisen

609
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,730
to solve these emotionally crippling

610
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,120
problems designers call them gift links

611
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,500
this is my favorite gift on the internet

612
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,190
actually it's like a toy from the 70s

613
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:36,560
60s maybe before toys were fun before

614
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,920
the game boy and he's getting brain

615
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,800
damage I'm sure of it trying to look

616
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,710
like I'm having a good time it's a

617
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,330
little-known fact but 9 out of 10 UX

618
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,170
specialists

619
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:51,350
I agree the gift length right a richer

620
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,480
more enhanced user experience which can

621
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,740
be tailored specifically for the

622
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,730
enjoyment of your audience and and this

623
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,140
is kind of like a library that I that I

624
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,060
kind of created just to just to do this

625
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,920
effect it's nothing really crazy it's

626
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,170
nothing really big it's on github with

627
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,120
the rest of the stuff and this is kind

628
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,470
of a weird one like I got some emails

629
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,120
like Tim you are actually ruining the

630
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,280
internet you're making the world a worse

631
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,770
place I kind of want to print that and

632
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,710
just stick it on my wall and I've seen

633
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,450
that one kind of out in the wild it's a

634
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,700
bit of a funny thing sometimes I kind of

635
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,620
like exploring like the borders and and

636
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,480
kind of finding like weird little

637
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,350
browser quirks and things that you can

638
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,400
what did I say then that was funny I

639
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,950
don't know yeah it can kind of like jump

640
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,440
over these little spaces and and so this

641
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,210
wasn't this was one this is a website

642
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,380
that I built with the with the same

643
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,990
friend oh nice well it's all red and we

644
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,500
that's okay so this was like a website

645
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,870
for like a beard oil and when I kind of

646
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,190
go in it was like well I can put like a

647
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,530
little animation in the console there he

648
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,750
is like he's it's a nice beard and he's

649
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,320
winking

650
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,510
I spent 90% of the dev time on that

651
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:00,950
project building that instead of instead

652
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,360
of the rest of it and when he was kind

653
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,010
of like Tim just play around like do

654
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,380
something fun do something weird you

655
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,490
know that's kind of what I did I also

656
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,720
made the mistake of naming all my

657
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,809
classes off the types of beards soul

658
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:14,450
patch like old Dutch that was the

659
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,340
biggest mistake I've ever made it made

660
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,780
everything way more confusing you should

661
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,480
compile it into that after there's some

662
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,850
good research though oh yeah so this is

663
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,710
kind of like reaching over into into

664
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,059
another space and kind of playing around

665
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:29,000
this is another one it only works on Mac

666
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,160
now like when I released this it's like

667
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,929
Chrome patched the bug in like three

668
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:35,330
days and it's like you're cruel people I

669
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,100
was around four weeks before that but

670
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,360
when you when you when you kind of

671
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,309
scroll up and down on a Mac or an iOS

672
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:41,750
device you kind of noticed that little

673
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,210
spring effect that it has at the top and

674
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,620
when you're looking in JavaScript you

675
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,030
kind of get a negative number back

676
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,860
coming from the scroll position so I

677
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,330
could kind of use that too when you

678
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:56,090
scroll too far on either side I could

679
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,320
have something a little pop-up like a

680
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,309
little bit of a little bit of grumpy cat

681
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:03,559
I was upset at Chrome I filed a bug I

682
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:08,990
was like guys you're ruining my fun and

683
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,480
they were way more serious than I was in

684
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,770
that conversation so it didn't really

685
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:17,780
work out that we need to create this not

686
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,880
really right there's no there's no real

687
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,280
reason for us to do anything but we can

688
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,840
kind of come in and we can explore a

689
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,040
little bit and we can have a good time

690
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,380
this is a website that I built ages ago

691
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,540
months years two years ago the useless

692
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,730
web and this was kind of like the

693
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,000
website that got me into weird stuff I'd

694
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,860
say like you know when someone's like

695
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,240
how long have you been a developer I'm

696
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,530
like I've been like an unprofessional

697
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,620
web developer three years that's kind of

698
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,970
my answer when you press this button it

699
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,640
kind of takes you to these weird weird

700
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,530
websites this is a this is I don't know

701
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,540
that's a weird that's not a fun one

702
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,760
I'm just get something else this is just

703
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,440
a purple screen I think the URL is like

704
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,929
random color there we go let's see well

705
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:05,860
they're not lying there not lying there

706
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:10,679
that had noise this was just a domain

707
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:12,779
people kind of buy these buy these URLs

708
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,100
and kind of put something weird on their

709
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,990
cat bounce this is gonna be fun you know

710
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:22,889
it it's that like 49,000 tweets I mean I

711
00:26:22,889 --> 00:26:24,960
could just tweet that every single day

712
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,789
for the rest of my life and die a happy

713
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:32,669
person anyway I could stay on here

714
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:34,769
forever it's like a huge time-suck it's

715
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:36,149
got it gets like millions of visitors

716
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:37,889
and everyone stays for about ten minutes

717
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:40,289
and I kind of like calculate it and it's

718
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:42,539
like over one month that consumes us

719
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,940
like years and years of man-hours I feel

720
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,200
like I've made a negative dent on the

721
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,750
whole economy of the world which is

722
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,330
something I'm very proud of personally

723
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,470
this was a funny little library that I

724
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,779
built elevated yes it's kind of weird

725
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,860
now because everyone's like oh you're

726
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,960
the guy that did this like really simple

727
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,000
thing but when you kind of scroll down

728
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,500
to the to the bottom and this I cut oh

729
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,759
this is going to take you back to the

730
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:06,969
top of the website

731
00:27:06,979 --> 00:27:16,950
elevator music some nice thing about

732
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,210
I'm convinced this javascript library as

733
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,299
the key to world peace kind of weird

734
00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:23,320
this is something that I was playing

735
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,750
around with recently nobody likes this

736
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,100
some it's always hit and miss you know

737
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,270
you'll spend a couple of weekends and

738
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,429
make something and people like oh this

739
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:32,110
was really great like that elevated yes

740
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,159
and sometimes you make something

741
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:36,940
anyone's like Tim go away and this was

742
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,590
one I'm kind of scared to go to his blue

743
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,679
screen of death ojs and there's a whole

744
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,240
seven tweets there because it's really

745
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,880
kind of horrific and you include this

746
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,320
when you start developing it was like

747
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,700
the dev tools have just been getting so

748
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,279
good everything's been getting so easy

749
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:53,559
and whenever any JavaScript error

750
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:55,029
happens on your page it just wipes out

751
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:56,710
the whole Dom it wipes out the whole

752
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,990
head of the page it spams your console

753
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,549
so you essentially can't find out what

754
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:04,390
the happened I mean and it just

755
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,700
looks like a blue screen though that's a

756
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,409
nice picture right there hopefully it

757
00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:09,789
doesn't crash everything no it didn't

758
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:12,610
that's nice so yeah you know this is

759
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,500
this is kind of like what I'm making

760
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,520
this stuff you don't really like

761
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,960
thinking much I'm just kind of trying to

762
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,370
make something fun I'm kind of repeating

763
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,570
this point over and over and over again

764
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:22,120
but I kind of have no strong thoughts

765
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,340
one way or the other I'm not like big on

766
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,720
kind of arguing about these things

767
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,640
because it is for our own delight and

768
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,429
it's our own platform and we can do

769
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:32,350
whatever we kind of want to do

770
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,320
I found this function this is kind of

771
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,299
coming coming towards an end I work at

772
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,850
tumblr and I found this function in the

773
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,390
code was like generate dolphins thank

774
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,970
stop the presses I literally stopped the

775
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,380
presses I was like I'm not doing

776
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:51,620
anything until I understand what this is

777
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,059
because it's intriguing and and the code

778
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:56,710
it was like in this far corner of the

779
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,330
thing I'm like kind of reading it

780
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,130
through and like it seems to be

781
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,390
generating some kind of dolphin

782
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:06,309
somewhere where are the dolphins and and

783
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:07,659
I was kind of on slack it was like God

784
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:10,330
generate dolphins function where did

785
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:10,870
this come from

786
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,549
I found it eventually in the in there

787
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:15,309
audio player in tumblr when when songs

788
00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:16,809
finished the psychic dolphins swimming

789
00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:18,010
around you can kind of see it in the

790
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:20,470
visualizer there somebody was like oh

791
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,480
that's a shark because the tail fin is

792
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,039
up and down I was like I come from

793
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:27,460
Australia it's a dolphin let me but this

794
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,840
is kind of again it's like the surprise

795
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,620
and delight you know don't be

796
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,850
to have a little fun with what you're

797
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,650
doing don't be afraid to inject some

798
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,690
dolphins into your code put some weird

799
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,940
things put music to stuff make things

800
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,049
follow the mouse it doesn't really

801
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:40,580
matter where you go there's no wrong

802
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,350
answer and there's no wrong way to have

803
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,160
fun

804
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,830
and kind of like coming to a close this

805
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,620
was the deconstruction for that for the

806
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,620
generate dolphins when dolphins cry and

807
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,420
and I'm kind of a little bit sad now

808
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,070
that everything is kind of done but

809
00:29:55,070 --> 00:30:04,640
cheers thank you
