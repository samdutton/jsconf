[Music]

2
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:16,560
my name is Shirley and I'm Noddy and I

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,820
want to thank you we want to thank you

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,650
so much for being here today we want to

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,600
thank Jess called Asia for having here

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,060
us together back together to talk to you

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,740
about our project data sketches let's

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,539
start from the very beginning naughty

9
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,540
and I actually met each other online

10
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,590
virtually in a private data

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,200
visualization / channel in the fall of

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,250
2015 we didn't actually meet each other

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,710
in real life until April the following

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,510
year open viscom 2016 in Boston where we

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,539
both had the honour of speaking

16
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:55,020
separately and in the following three

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,289
days we hit it off really really well so

18
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,590
well that a few months later back home

19
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,460
when a naughty but when naughty put up

20
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,240
her SVG tutorials from her togs I went

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,520
through them with vigor and I started up

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,530
a conversation with naughty and the

23
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,520
conversation somehow somehow ended up

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,530
with us lamenting the fact that we

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,330
hadn't completed as many data

26
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,000
visualization projects as we have wanted

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,850
in a previous year and that was when I

28
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,200
got my idea and I got together all of my

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,869
courage fully expecting to be rejected

30
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:36,240
in a snotty do you want to collaborate

31
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,680
with me and happily happily she said yes

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,130
and that's how data sketches started so

33
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,509
in the following week we figured out

34
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,250
that we both liked the idea where we

35
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,960
would create a visualization each month

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,320
around a specific topic and to see how

37
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,909
two people would create two

38
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,860
visualizations starting from the same

39
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,290
seed this topic and then diverging in

40
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,670
two different paths based on our own

41
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,310
interest in history and besides sharing

42
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,869
this end result we also want to write

43
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,030
about the creation process and we split

44
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,590
this up into the three pillars that we

45
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,349
find most important data sketching and

46
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:10,789
coding

47
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,650
and initially we thought we could pull

48
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,480
it off you know with about five to six

49
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,480
hours a week as usual real life really

50
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,590
doesn't care about plans especially

51
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,860
coding plans so since starting in July

52
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,500
of 2016 we've clocked many many hours

53
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,329
into creating our visualizations each

54
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:28,940
month and during this talk we'd like to

55
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,500
take you through some of the lessons

56
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,329
that we learned challenges faced and

57
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:35,560
insights that we gathered along the way

58
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,730
so let's start from the very beginning

59
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,420
the data gathering process the two

60
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,769
months sometimes get asked this question

61
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:45,739
do you get your data first and then come

62
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:47,030
up with the idea for your visualizations

63
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,560
or do you get your idea first and the

64
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,139
answer for us is always always idea

65
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:58,519
first for the month of October I decided

66
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:00,920
that I wanted to put emojis on the

67
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,250
former well soon in it should be okay

68
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:14,120
I decided that I wanted to put emojis on

69
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,500
their faces

70
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:23,240
[Music]

71
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:39,010
okay oh it's the cat now okay thank you

72
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,530
[Music]

73
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,650
yeah

74
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,720
so for those two months we decided that

75
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,709
I wanted to put emojis on former

76
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,269
president mr. Obama and mrs. Obama's

77
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:52,420
faces ah there we go now you see their

78
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,489
faces

79
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:56,620
and so for this project I went and

80
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,209
gathered all of their late-night talk

81
00:03:58,209 --> 00:03:59,830
show appearances and their corresponding

82
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,100
YouTube videos took a screenshot every

83
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,400
single time that they talked so that I

84
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,880
can put emojis on their faces and

85
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,450
there's some really fun ones in here but

86
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,840
this this project started because I was

87
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,609
trying to figure out what to do with the

88
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:23,770
data set of all the late night talk

89
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,020
shows and I was talking to my art friend

90
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,960
Eric and he said to me wouldn't it be

91
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,180
cool if you could run facial detection

92
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,610
on the video and correlate their

93
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,250
emotions with what they're saying and I

94
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,470
was like hey Eric you realize I only

95
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,550
have one month to do this and I was like

96
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:47,080
Eric challenge accepted so I started by

97
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,820
manually gathering all of the late-night

98
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,800
talk show appearances of mr. and mrs.

99
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,090
Obama off of IMDB I use the youtube

100
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,890
search API to get all the videos from

101
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,600
the corresponding host YouTube channels

102
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,640
use the new package call youtube-dl to

103
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,710
download all of the videos and their

104
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,229
captions wrote a script to get the

105
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:10,890
timestamps from each of those captions

106
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,990
yeah then took all of those timestamps

107
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,080
and use flint FM MPEG to take a

108
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,580
screenshot for every one of those

109
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,729
timestamps a full hit each of the

110
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:23,560
screenshots to Google vision API which

111
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,850
is the super fun API that detects for

112
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,490
every picture how many faces there are

113
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,020
on the screen and where

114
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,060
and whether they're happy mad sad or

115
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:41,020
wearing a hat and I took the aggregated

116
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,230
annotate I can get sorry and then I

117
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,690
grouped the annotated image data with

118
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,670
the caption data to get the final

119
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:54,460
dataset and that I learned quite a fun

120
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,130
lesson here and there's two parts to it

121
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,950
the first being being curious find

122
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,630
something that you're really excited and

123
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,720
interested in and let that excitement

124
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,700
and curiosity guides you through the

125
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,940
project and motivate you and second that

126
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,890
once you've found that topic that you're

127
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,320
interested in get creative with your

128
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,810
data gathering process because there are

129
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,630
so much data out there and you can get

130
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,880
your data set by either manual entry or

131
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,800
with automated scripts which I have

132
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,100
learned there is a nude or R package out

133
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,440
there for practically every single thing

134
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,140
I want to do Under the Sun as long as I

135
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,430
play responsibly and legally so once

136
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,930
you've gathered the data and the next

137
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,610
big thing is actually preparing the data

138
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,450
and for August of last year maybe a year

139
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,570
and a half ago the obvious theme is the

140
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,190
Olympics especially since we're both big

141
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,790
fans and I ended up visualizing all

142
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,290
5,000 gold medal winners since the very

143
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,110
first games in 1896 so each of these

144
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,460
circles here is a group of similar

145
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,250
sports such as water sports for ball

146
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,620
sports and within that each slice or

147
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,260
feather is its own unique sports such as

148
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,900
athletics then we have the first version

149
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,440
on the inside going out to 2016 the

150
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,180
reddish background has their female

151
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,890
events and the blue background has the

152
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,710
male events and finally each medal

153
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,540
itself is colored according to the

154
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,400
continent in which the country lies that

155
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,580
one so Europe is blue Americas is red

156
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,730
Africa is black and so on and you can

157
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,290
see for example that in the very first

158
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,110
editions of the Olympic Games tug of war

159
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,410
was an official Olympic sport too bad

160
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,990
they took that out so I found the data

161
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,610
for this piece from two articles

162
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,590
published by the Guardian for the 2012

163
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,600
Games in London and after getting a

164
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,270
rough shape

165
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,130
my screen I noticed that some very

166
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,140
obvious metals were missing from 2012

167
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,170
like hockey so suddenly my confidence in

168
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,940
his dataset dropped drastically even

169
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,260
coming from such a respectable source

170
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,420
and therefore I had to get a sense of

171
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,850
the overall accuracy but I didn't want

172
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,100
to have to manually check 5,000 medals

173
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,520
so I found a proxy instead on Wikipedia

174
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,470
I could find lists that contain the

175
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,730
number of events that occurred during

176
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,070
each Edition which I then compared to

177
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,900
the number of gold medals I had in my

178
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,120
dataset and if there was a discrepancy

179
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,010
I would investigate further to figure

180
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,320
out where and why and that's how I found

181
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,630
out that for some of the editions the

182
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,940
horses were also in the dataset which

183
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,860
made for an interesting read to suddenly

184
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,530
see princess and sissy and lady mirka as

185
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,370
women winning gold in the Olympics

186
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,390
eventually I managed to figure out each

187
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,650
of these discrepancies and made

188
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,570
adjustments to my data so get it to the

189
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,850
point where I trusted it again so my

190
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,800
lesson here was that I really need to

191
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,150
get a feeling of accuracy and

192
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,550
completeness of my data missing data can

193
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,920
be hard to find I'm wrong data and you

194
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,600
don't have to check every value but

195
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,610
think about taking sums and counts and

196
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,220
averages and comparing this to either

197
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,260
plain common sense or even better a

198
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,300
different data source so before data

199
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,760
sketches I actually used to go directly

200
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,070
from my data gathering process into my

201
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,980
code but Noddy convinced me to give

202
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,200
sketching and ideation and prototyping a

203
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,980
try and I'm so glad that she did for my

204
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,430
very first sketch lesson happened in

205
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,660
September where our topic was travel and

206
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,900
I took twenty thousand colors 5 primary

207
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,600
colors from four thousand images grouped

208
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,870
each of the colors by the trip that I

209
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,950
took the photo and Ag and then arranged

210
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,670
them by the day that I was taken on and

211
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,770
this is one of my personal favorites

212
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,380
because I learned a lot about myself

213
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,340
through this project mainly that I had

214
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,470
always known that aching photos of

215
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,870
nature so the sky and trees and

216
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,660
mountains and oceans so it made sense to

217
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,540
me that I would have a lot of

218
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,550
blues and greens in this visualization

219
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,860
but the thing that was really confused

220
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,009
about was the fact that for some reason

221
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:05,170
there were a lot of reds and oranges and

222
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,440
yellows also and I knew for sure that I

223
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,680
was not waking up for any sunrises so

224
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,959
when I took a look at the underlying

225
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:16,180
photos I found that they were actually

226
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:22,630
food pictures so this 2014 trip to Tokyo

227
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,209
and Japan you can tell apparently all I

228
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:30,550
did was eat but this one to Europe in

229
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,190
2015 this was to Iceland and there were

230
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:38,160
some absolutely gorgeous waterfalls and

231
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,420
although this is one of my favorite

232
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,850
visualizations it didn't actually start

233
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,149
out so well in fact it started out

234
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:48,459
disastrously after I had gather all of

235
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:51,009
my data my data being all of my photos

236
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:53,380
and gotten all of the colors out of them

237
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,810
I went straight into the sketching

238
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,759
without even taking a look at what my

239
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,480
data looked like and so even though I

240
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,490
had really great intentions which was

241
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,790
that I wanted to lay out my colors by

242
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,029
the x-axis being at the time of data I

243
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:12,010
took the pictures or where I took the

244
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,279
pictures and the y-axis being the year

245
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,589
that I took the pictures and given with

246
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:19,120
good intention because I wanted to see

247
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,040
if there was a pattern and when or aware

248
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,360
that I was taking my pictures but once I

249
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,000
have put the actual data into the screen

250
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,250
into my code this is what happened I

251
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,019
like to lovingly call this piece man

252
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:37,510
peeing into a puddle and although I'm

253
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,579
quite fond of it I knew that it wasn't

254
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:41,620
something I can publish as my final date

255
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,089
of sketches so I looked through the data

256
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:49,240
a lot and I went through different

257
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,939
iterations really explored it until I

258
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:54,060
got to the point that you saw earlier

259
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,300
and so I really took that to heart in

260
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,009
September and applied it to the next

261
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:02,560
month in October with the Obama

262
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,880
visualization you saw earlier

263
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,980
and after I had gathered all of my data

264
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,660
I had listed out all of my data

265
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,209
attributes I looked through and found my

266
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:16,040
min and Max and my extremes and I really

267
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,709
got a sense of my data before I sketched

268
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:22,160
out any of my ideas and designs and this

269
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,899
is one of them as you can see I was

270
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:26,060
really happy because there was almost a

271
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,069
one-to-one translation between my

272
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:31,899
sketches and my code and my final code

273
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:35,569
so my very first sketch lesson that was

274
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:38,870
so important was to always always

275
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,480
explore the data before starting to

276
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,819
sketch let's out the attributes dig into

277
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:46,819
the extremes so that I can get a good

278
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:48,829
understanding of the data that I'm

279
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:52,759
trying to visualize and my sketches are

280
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,949
often very simple only focusing on the

281
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:56,600
main abstract shape that I want to fit

282
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,550
my data into you know colors and layout

283
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,410
on details these are things I only

284
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,269
vaguely think about but don't act on

285
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:04,910
until I answer data on my screen this I

286
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,949
find that there's just no you know used

287
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:08,630
to spend any time on these things until

288
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,949
I figured out that the data actually

289
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:12,019
works once I've morphed it into my main

290
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:14,209
shape for the Olympics piece for example

291
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:16,189
I was actually inspired by the shape of

292
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:17,930
a peacock feather placing emphasis and

293
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,600
the more recent additions but I had no

294
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,009
idea of that would look all right once I

295
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,139
finally placed all 5,000 medals together

296
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:26,060
so I had to see if a general shape would

297
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,199
work before moving on

298
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:30,019
oh I laid out the feathers and of course

299
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:31,730
it took a few steps before I got that

300
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,589
right but luckily I saw that eventually

301
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:35,480
it did show potential with the actual

302
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,290
data but with networks it's really

303
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,110
tricky to create a sketch that is more

304
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,089
than just circles connected by a line

305
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,579
because with networks the best visual

306
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:48,439
form is so inherent to the actual

307
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:50,709
connections present within the data and

308
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:53,329
for the October month when surely dope

309
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:56,000
into presidents I went into royalty and

310
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,399
I've always been intrigued by how

311
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:59,540
intermarriage the Royals really are you

312
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,100
know are they old cousins twice removed

313
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,040
in some way and luckily I found this

314
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,680
giant genealogy dataset online that

315
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,240
contained the family tree of the

316
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,120
European royal houses it was from 1992

317
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,589
so it had to spend the night on

318
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:14,240
Wikipedia adding one or two more

319
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,899
generations

320
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:16,759
main line of succession doors are

321
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,230
already super happy to have this data

322
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,439
available and to show you the the end

323
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:25,369
result here we go so the main the

324
00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:26,990
curatorial leaders are the bigger stars

325
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,999
and everybody is connected to their

326
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:30,949
parents their partner and their children

327
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:33,379
and if you hover over a person slowly

328
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:36,589
the grits shows how far six degrees of

329
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:38,629
separation would reach into this web so

330
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,129
this one is connected to three current

331
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,439
Oriole leaders for example but when I

332
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:44,329
started out with this data set I had no

333
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:47,569
idea what it contained so I just sort of

334
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:49,339
placed it on the web using the most

335
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:52,579
basic network settings and then this

336
00:14:52,579 --> 00:15:01,879
happened oops that's too far you can do

337
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:05,149
it it's my computer is always not very

338
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:06,470
happy when I try and sure this right

339
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,249
this happened

340
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:09,410
it sort of blew up and that was really

341
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,819
helpful they're not showing me anything

342
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:12,980
so I thought well maybe I can sort of

343
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,079
make the gravity a little bit bigger

344
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:17,629
but then I got a useless hairball not

345
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:19,939
helpful either so I thought well I can I

346
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:21,910
can call everybody by year of birth

347
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:25,220
which still didn't help but luckily in a

348
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,170
browser you can have gravity depend on a

349
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,420
variable so I pulled this web apart by

350
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,579
year birth as well which was more

351
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:33,170
interesting but it was still a rather on

352
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,300
insightful bundle and at this point I'd

353
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,129
already invested several hours into

354
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:38,689
playing with the network settings trying

355
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:40,009
different kinds of connections and

356
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:42,319
playing with my data and I was really

357
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,819
ready to just give up and try a

358
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,379
different angle like how much of the

359
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:46,850
Royals spending these days or something

360
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,279
but I gave it one last try and that's

361
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,839
when I decided to focus on the current

362
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:53,149
royal leaders so I placed these in a

363
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:55,069
line and then I got the vertical gravity

364
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:56,540
depend on which of these royally

365
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,370
decision was closely related to and

366
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,740
that's when I finally saw it in sites

367
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,929
for example at the Queen of Denmark is

368
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:04,850
actually very central to this web but

369
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,740
that the Prince of Monaco line separated

370
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,949
more than what most 200 years ago and

371
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:11,899
only at this point did I start worrying

372
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:14,240
about more of the visual design aspects

373
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,209
of this visualization and networks often

374
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,009
reminded me of constellations and with

375
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:21,470
my astronomy background I have a virus

376
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,319
for all things space so I just had to

377
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,279
turn it into his

378
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,699
Knight and I could have never designed

379
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:30,410
this visualization beforehand in

380
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,779
Illustrator I had to go hand in hand

381
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:35,480
with the actual data and continue to

382
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,480
sort of to see how the results of my

383
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,300
actions would look on the actual data to

384
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,459
see if the results were both engaging

385
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:52,519
and insightful we've done this loads of

386
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:58,129
times so as you might expect actually

387
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:00,949
most of our hours are spent on getting

388
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:02,899
the data on the screen and then this is

389
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:05,000
Samar far perhaps less obvious coding

390
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,189
lessons so for a very first month the

391
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:09,140
topic was movies and it was pretty clear

392
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,760
to me that I wanted to do something with

393
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,240
the Lord of the Rings which is well my

394
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,250
favorite trilogy and I thought that with

395
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,539
the popularity of the movies that there

396
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:19,280
would be loads of data available but

397
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,929
that didn't turn out to be true at all

398
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:24,650
and but I did manage to find a true gem

399
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,870
so somebody had created the data set

400
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,669
that contained the number of words

401
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:31,370
spoken by each character in each scene

402
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,010
of all three extended editions of the

403
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,880
lords rings I knew I had to visualize

404
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,419
that data somehow and I wanted to focus

405
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:43,130
on the number of words spoken by these

406
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,870
characters of the fellowship at the

407
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,210
different locations of the movies but as

408
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,110
you may be able to see from the

409
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,780
screenshot or maybe not there is no

410
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,909
location information in it so together

411
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:54,110
with the scripts that are available

412
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,600
online and my own memory having seen the

413
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,470
movies way too often

414
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,299
I just manually added location

415
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:01,580
information to each of the about 800

416
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,340
rows fellowship data so a bit of

417
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,890
dedication can go a long way I started

418
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,399
sketching some ideas and then eventually

419
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:11,840
got to this where the members of the

420
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,250
fellowship would be placed in the center

421
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,679
and the location spread around them in a

422
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,419
circle and they would be connected by

423
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:18,740
these strings where the width of a

424
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,899
string on the outside would represent

425
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,399
the number of words spoken by that

426
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:24,710
character at that location but sadly

427
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,539
this chart firm doesn't actually exist

428
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,190
at least not on any tool that I was

429
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,559
aware of but it reminded me of something

430
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,830
that did exist and that's called a chord

431
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,690
diagram so I thought well maybe I can

432
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,080
swim on

433
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,970
transform this Court diagram into my

434
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:41,059
sketch so here's the most basic script

435
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:44,149
of all text Court diagram and for me it

436
00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:45,799
was fundamental to see if I could at

437
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:48,440
least get these courts as they're called

438
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,990
here flowing towards the center which

439
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,179
took less time than anticipated which is

440
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:55,549
pretty rare for me encoding but getting

441
00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:57,590
rid of that space adding in the actual

442
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,059
earth rings data and some more

443
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:01,340
appropriate colors well we have nine

444
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,260
members of the fellowship so I had to

445
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,120
make sure that the centers lined up at

446
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,100
the right vertical location but this was

447
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,320
just looking way too squished so what

448
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,019
about if I pull it to a halves apart

449
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:13,940
okay that works but now these strings

450
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,080
they were looking pretty odd especially

451
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,450
in the top and bottom so I finally

452
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,029
finally dove into learning how to write

453
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:22,279
my own SVG pads because all of our

454
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:23,990
visualizations well practically all is

455
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,480
build up out of SPG's and that took

456
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,490
quite a while there was also quite fun

457
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,010
and that's how I sort of ended up with

458
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,200
this new kind of chart that is mutated

459
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,710
from d3 score diagram and many people

460
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,330
have done amazing things that they they

461
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,299
share online and so even if you think

462
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:43,309
you are creating something new you don't

463
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:45,080
always have to start from scratch you

464
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,600
know try and pick a thing that most

465
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,519
closely resembles your idea or design

466
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:51,649
and start adjusting that remix what's

467
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:58,340
out there already sometimes sometimes we

468
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,620
dream up things and we sketch out things

469
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,169
that just don't seem to have anything

470
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:07,379
out there that we can base the author

471
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:10,730
for that same month of movies I did this

472
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,649
thing called film flowers where I

473
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:15,980
visualized the top blockbuster movies

474
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,809
the summer blockbuster movies of the

475
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:20,389
last two and a half decades reimagine as

476
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:24,049
flowers each of the petals are parental

477
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:26,240
guidance ratings each of the colors are

478
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,399
different genres and a number and the

479
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:30,529
size of the petals are their

480
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:34,549
corresponding IMDB ratings out of 10 and

481
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:37,429
so there's some really really beautiful

482
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:40,419
ones in here like The Dark Knight Rises

483
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:42,320
inception

484
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,510
and I personally always loved Harry

485
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,140
Potter but my absolute absolute favorite

486
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,050
that I love sharing with everybody is

487
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:55,220
the 1997 Batman and Robin

488
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,040
because of how teeny and tiny and cute

489
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,280
it is so when I fight and first

490
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,740
published this project I got asked oh

491
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,290
how hard was it to do how did you do it

492
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,540
did it take a long time and the answer

493
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,510
is actually that it's quite easy all you

494
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,270
need is a good understanding of SVG

495
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:17,210
paths and in particular the cubic Bezier

496
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:21,650
curve command so let's take for example

497
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:26,330
this cherry blossom so the way that we

498
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,100
want to draw it is we start out with a

499
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,070
petal and for that particular curve the

500
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,170
way that I like to think about it is we

501
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,720
start with a point in this case at zero

502
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,680
zero and we draw a straight line to the

503
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,010
ending that purple point and then we

504
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,050
take the blue and green anchor points

505
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,150
and we nudge it oh and nudge it apart

506
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:52,460
until we get the curve that we want then

507
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:57,020
drew two more lines drew of curve on the

508
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,520
other end and then we have the pedal I

509
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,830
put in a few more petals rotated at them

510
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:07,880
appropriately put any colors and that

511
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,860
was it quite simple so the code lesson

512
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,350
here is really really understand your

513
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,230
tool set in that case in our cases that

514
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:22,430
our tool sets are SVG and canvas and d3

515
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,240
and in particular my favorite is SVG

516
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,000
paths and the curve command because with

517
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,940
that under my belt I can truly truly

518
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,490
draw anything on the screen that I want

519
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:39,110
for some really unique results we also

520
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,400
had a lot of fun playing around with

521
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,530
math over the past months so here's my

522
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,570
addition to our collaboration ones with

523
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,880
a Google News lab and being a non-native

524
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,470
English speaker I wanted to focus on

525
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,020
translations so what do other languages

526
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,850
want to have translated into English by

527
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,630
using Google Translate from the most

528
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,510
translated word 4:10 chosen languages to

529
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,430
the top 10 for each of these languages

530
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,410
and finally the similarities between

531
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,660
these languages and for this final

532
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,570
visualization I actually wanted to look

533
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,400
at these these similarities and have

534
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,950
each of the words the two languages had

535
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,720
in common in their top 10 be presented

536
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,420
by a line but actually I wanted to have

537
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,980
all of these visuals to be completely

538
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,380
build up out of words and letters so

539
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,780
actually I wanted to replace these lines

540
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,190
by the words themselves that they

541
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,440
represented but after I finally coated

542
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,810
that out I immediately saw it was a big

543
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,300
mess so I had to compromise and only

544
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,790
place a word on the most central the

545
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,490
line going toward the central point but

546
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,320
then it became really important that all

547
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,580
of these words were placed in the most

548
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,170
upright manner possible for readability

549
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,180
but they gave quite some convoluted

550
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,700
calculations in terms of the tax paths

551
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,920
that I had to calculate to place these

552
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,450
words on and that became glaringly

553
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,010
obvious once you click one of these

554
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,440
outer circles and move the in word which

555
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,060
is not quite what I think a user would

556
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,150
expect to happen and that's where math

557
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:01,570
and logic solving came to the rescue

558
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,510
it took a few pages from my notebook but

559
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,520
eventually I ended up veering out a way

560
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,120
to implement a solution so now it should

561
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,880
work more as somebody might expect it to

562
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,800
and what I'm doing is really more of a

563
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,050
hack so once somebody clicks one of

564
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:20,320
these other languages I fade out the

565
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,270
words and then I immediately replace all

566
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,250
of these lines by their final state but

567
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,780
reverse engineer to look like the

568
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,070
initial state before slowly

569
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,950
transitioning them to the final state so

570
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,600
the last in here is really really simple

571
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,520
it's learn to love math and especially

572
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,310
in geometry if you don't already because

573
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,900
they are usually your best friends in

574
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,730
finding solutions to these visual

575
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:46,180
problems in the December 2016 I

576
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,220
published this visualization called an

577
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,230
interactive visualization of every line

578
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,210
in Hampton I don't know and if anybody's

579
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:54,400
heard of the musical but as the user

580
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,620
Scrolls down the screen these dots

581
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,630
follow them and each of these dots

582
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,030
represent a series of lines in the

583
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,460
musical them

584
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,640
and as they keep scrolling I show them

585
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,180
the analysis I've done as well as the

586
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,570
filters that they can play with to

587
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:16,240
follow along with my analysis until they

588
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,760
scroll to the very very end and I give

589
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,210
them that same tool where they came for

590
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,830
themselves filter by any set of

591
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:29,410
characters conversations and themes and

592
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,050
dig into the remaining lines and songs

593
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:37,450
to do their own analysis but something

594
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,100
really strange happened last September

595
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,770
which was that I noticed that when I was

596
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,430
loading up my visualization it was being

597
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,980
really really slow in fact this is a

598
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,700
video of the actual experience there it

599
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,350
was taking in between two to three

600
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,160
seconds between each repaint it's

601
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,540
excruciating and I knew that it wasn't

602
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,010
anything that I had done because I

603
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,930
hadn't touched this code in about nine

604
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,270
months and so I figured that it was

605
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,550
probably something to do with a browser

606
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:09,400
update to canvas and because I knew that

607
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,080
that was something that I didn't quite

608
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,730
understand and hadn't been keeping track

609
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:13,030
of

610
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,420
I turned to obviously Twitter for help

611
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,470
and the miraculous thing an amazing

612
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,840
thing is that within a few hours some

613
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,570
really amazing people including Jake who

614
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:28,660
may or may not be in this audience came

615
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,870
and kind of figured out what was going

616
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,510
on and help me debug both on Chrome and

617
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,780
Firefox and they helped me deduce that

618
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,850
what was happening was that because I

619
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:43,300
had used canvas to draw those dots

620
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,880
animating in the background and I had

621
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,310
done a canvas with the height of 16

622
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,100
thousand pixels the full height of the

623
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:56,110
document scaled it by 2x for 32,000 is

624
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:59,410
causing absolutely mayhem on the memory

625
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,380
and that's what was causing the bug and

626
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,420
I had originally done this because I

627
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,000
have wanted the user the reader to have

628
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,250
the experience of the dots following

629
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,760
them as they scroll down the screen and

630
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,850
it took a good week of going through my

631
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:16,659
9 month

632
00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:18,970
code which was absolutely painful but I

633
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,519
was able to refactor my canvas height

634
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,460
from 16,000 pixels down to 3,000 pixels

635
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,289
while maintaining that same thoughts

636
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:28,419
following you effect from really some

637
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:31,349
really smooth buttery buttery smooth

638
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:35,859
experience and I learned the most

639
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:39,279
important lesson that September which

640
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,799
was that up until that point I had

641
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:45,519
thought of my tool set as SVG canvas d3

642
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,179
react whatever I needed to do render the

643
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:52,239
actual visualization but up until that

644
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:54,970
point I was ignoring my most important

645
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:59,289
tool set of all the web itself and I

646
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:01,059
have learned that I need to really

647
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:03,669
really understand the entirety of my

648
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:07,119
tool set in my case being keeping track

649
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,609
of page performance browser updates and

650
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:13,479
what's coming down the pipeline so since

651
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:15,429
starting we've realized that we can find

652
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:18,070
data in the weirdest of places that data

653
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,019
preparation can reveal some really weird

654
00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:22,840
quirks and then data set that sketching

655
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,369
helps weed out thinking errors but that

656
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,830
you can also design with code that SVG

657
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,289
pants are amazing in math is - but we

658
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:30,609
already knew that of course

659
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:34,149
and that especially is data visualizer

660
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:37,479
is we should not neglect the web or a

661
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:39,099
browser as part of our toolkit and not

662
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:41,259
instead only be talking about d3 canvas

663
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:43,539
and illustrator and these things now

664
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:45,669
when we started we didn't set out to be

665
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:46,960
confronted or learn all of these things

666
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,179
we we just wanted to have fun and in

667
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:53,139
that we definitely succeeded so even

668
00:28:53,139 --> 00:28:54,609
though the years already come and gone

669
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:56,889
we still have a month or two to go and

670
00:28:56,889 --> 00:28:58,419
there's still a few empty spots there

671
00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:00,309
and that's because even though we were

672
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:03,070
having fun at the end we notice that

673
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,749
we've taken on too much on our plate and

674
00:29:04,749 --> 00:29:06,279
we decided to take things a little bit

675
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:08,440
more slowly so if you want to you can

676
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,479
still follow us in our final months of

677
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:13,629
data munging sketching and coding up our

678
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:16,720
ideas into often fun and weird and

679
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,059
overly elaborate visualizations thank

680
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:22,220
you very much for your attention
