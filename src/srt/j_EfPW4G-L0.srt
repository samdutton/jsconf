1
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,010

so I actually went to Jess Cove 2012 I

2
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,520
attended it it was my first conference

3
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,820
ever as anything and i sat there totally

4
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,860
shy never talked to a person single

5
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,840
person so if you told me that this year

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,239
I'll be up on stage presenting then I

7
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:43,590
would be very surprised I sent this

8
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,360
tweet out this morning what if Jack Cara

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,579
Jane Austen James Joyce Richard Feynman

10
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,280
F Kendall Sammy Johnson mr. Ernest

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,760
Hemingway got in common and the reason I

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,590
sent that is because I hope song would

13
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,390
have a really clever answer for me so I

14
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,060
could say on stage but I got this which

15
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,910
is pretty good because they all work

16
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,030
office group right which which actually

17
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,850
as you'll see is not as far from the

18
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,670
truth as you might think

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,990
so this talk started way back August

20
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,310
2012 I was talking to a friend on IRC

21
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,320
and he asked what I was doing and I said

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,710
oh I just wrote a piece of JavaScript in

23
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,100
the style of of of Ernest Hemingway and

24
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,990
he was like great you should write blog

25
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,850
post and it was a and I'd actually

26
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,590
hadn't written a piece of JavaScript in

27
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,850
the style of Ernest Hemingway I was just

28
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,590
thinking about how that would work I

29
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,780
hadn't done it at all I thought oh crap

30
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,580
now I have to go and write it so I did

31
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,210
and it became a blog post and it became

32
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,729
a very successful post and on the front

33
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,200
of hakkon monthly and bunch of other

34
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:05,200
stuff so from that came this talk and

35
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,590
today I'm going to present I'm going to

36
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,489
have coeliac reviews from five authors

37
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:16,410
the five authors in that talk and plus

38
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,380
especially for this talk I promised to

39
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,600
write another five doing another

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,500
exercise I got seven in the end I

41
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,510
couldn't narrow it down so hopefully we

42
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,839
have time

43
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:34,489
so here are here's the mother of all

44
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:37,580
code reviews these authors sent me back

45
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:43,159
code sent me back from history the their

46
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:45,290
answers to two problems and we're going

47
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,329
to do a code review on them so exercise

48
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:53,239
one is Fibonacci numbers return the

49
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,239
Fibonacci sequence for the argument

50
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,430
given argument which is the number the

51
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,349
size of the sequence first up is Ernest

52
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,940
Hemmingway these are all quotes these

53
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,140
are all actual actual quotes actually

54
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,090
they really are I just changed

55
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,590
Ingle word each time sometimes they

56
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,129
didn't even change anything anything and

57
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:20,720
I think these quotes go a little bit

58
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,150
what a little bit of the way towards

59
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,150
explaining their approach to solving the

60
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,239
problem so let's look at Ernest attempt

61
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,030
that's a solving Fibonacci so those of

62
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:37,130
you know Hemingway he's very spare he he

63
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,579
he is very economical he only tells you

64
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:42,680
what you have to know there were no

65
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,500
comments because he was a proponent of

66
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,730
the iceburg theory which is that the

67
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,430
minimum possible amount is on the

68
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,400
surface the rest is for the reader to

69
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,940
discover hidden beneath the surface very

70
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,599
straightforward he names his variables

71
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,940
exactly as you would expect first second

72
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,579
not trying to be clever not trying to

73
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:13,099
use any terminology any technical

74
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:16,039
terminology it's a really nice solution

75
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:20,049
if the size is less than to Fibonacci

76
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:21,919
you know he could give you the answer

77
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,919
but he feels you were an idiot for

78
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:27,110
asking so that's what you're going to

79
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,000
get back next up is Shakespeare that is

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,460
an actual that's an actual quote from

81
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,100
Shakespeare

82
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,120
so he kind of drags this this one out as

83
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,230
only Shakespeare can calculation into

84
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,810
acts employing the humorous logic of

85
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,840
JavaScript and he introduces the

86
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,480
characters he has the dramatis personae

87
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,240
the main protagonists are the result

88
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,520
which is an array which is going to

89
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,700
return to you and a counter as he can so

90
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,430
we can count through the for loop and as

91
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,140
only Shakespeare would well not actually

92
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,520
as only Shakespeare but as Shakespeare

93
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,860
did he divided this into interact so I

94
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,450
want to see if this magic scrolling

95
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,110
works yes

96
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,380
so that one in which the zero is added

97
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:23,870
for initiation was just a long way of

98
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,480
saying he's assigning zero to the result

99
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,050
and by the way almost all of his comic

100
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,860
comments are in iambic pentameter which

101
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,810
is the way Shakespeare wrote thank you

102
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,880
which is ten syllables basically per

103
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,630
line stress every other syllable

104
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,110
hence pentameter five syllable stressed

105
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,510
he didn't always stick exactly to that

106
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,070
and he hasn't in the comments the point

107
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,270
is to emphasize certain words by by

108
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,570
switching the stress to those words so

109
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:05,260
let's go right on to Act two in which

110
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,030
every iteration the loop two numbers are

111
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,380
queried and summed and by divination he

112
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,110
sets a killing members as as he says and

113
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,390
it's it's pretty nice code I guess

114
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,760
there's a bit of of obvious Gatien going

115
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,000
on the reason he's doing result and math

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,550
max zero down there is that he doesn't

117
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,710
want zero or will want to be counted

118
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,390
there so that that's what he's doing

119
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:43,790
there and then finally he returns the

120
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,530
result to you and then the players exit

121
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:54,170
and that's the end now

122
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,770
who's heard of Andre Breton he was a mid

123
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:05,200
century French surrealist one of the

124
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,000
family members of the surrealist

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,910
movement and he believed dreams were

126
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:16,600
more interesting than he was reality so

127
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,580
all his prose have a very dreamlike

128
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,030
quality to them and he actually switches

129
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,430
nouns for any other word you can think

130
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:32,830
of so this is what we get so factorial

131
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,250
he renamed factorial took Colette which

132
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,260
I presume you first saw an old flame of

133
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,260
his but the amazing thing is and why I

134
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,090
really like his writing is there's a

135
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,700
certain elegance to it I mean he chooses

136
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,790
his nouns carefully and there's a

137
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,700
certain project logic to it you'll see

138
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,860
here staircase for the iterator the

139
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,260
thing that you do you think meant and I

140
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,270
think all in all he's done pretty nice

141
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,970
to hear it's a very nice answer next

142
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:15,190
onto the Chilean also Roberto bolaño

143
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:19,500
who's one of my personal favorites and

144
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,450
Bolano has a wonderful style he's

145
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,979
charming lean naive incredibly honest

146
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:30,820
and every aspect of human frailty is

147
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,409
included he'll tell you what he's

148
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:34,419
thinking the whole - the whole time the

149
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:37,479
most personal seemingly uninteresting

150
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,120
two thoughts he'll he'll he'll share

151
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,950
with you so you see his comments are

152
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,690
very much in that in that kind of stuff

153
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,470
also he loved the old poets and the old

154
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,950
rule writers any historical figure so

155
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,230
he's actually named his factorial after

156
00:08:53,230 --> 00:09:02,040
a certain Leonardo Pisano

157
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,330
piccolo who was actually the person who

158
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,990
credited with identifying the Fibonacci

159
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:14,600
series so if L is less than zero L being

160
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,020
the size here if L is less than zero he

161
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,790
doesn't want to answer that because he

162
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,410
doesn't know how to answer although he

163
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,550
admits that several responses probably

164
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,530
not very nice responses occur to him and

165
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,330
then he just writes the code he doesn't

166
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,620
really care about the code if you meet

167
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,230
his books like the plot is almost a

168
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,400
sideline so he just he just writes the

169
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,110
code in short order and then says he

170
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,220
doesn't really understand what's going

171
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,730
on and then he looked he he lists a lot

172
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,860
of mathematicians which really interests

173
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,820
him and this is his kind of deal this is

174
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:58,040
how he works in it in his books he pays

175
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,700
homage to to these people and then he

176
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,220
returns the answer he said I didn't

177
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,540
really know what how many of this thing

178
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,040
worked but anyway here's the answer in

179
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,230
case you're interested and he's so damn

180
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,210
honest he's like he can't help looking a

181
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,550
bit further down the page even though

182
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,040
actually nothing happens and he just

183
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,780
points out that there was nothing

184
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,370
happening and he would rather not talk

185
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,830
about it even if it was this is a very

186
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:26,690
personal style of his so on - Charles

187
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,930
Child Dickens Charles Dickens I don't

188
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,880
really like his work that much he's very

189
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,070
superficial Henry James called him the

190
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,790
greatest of superficial novelists I

191
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,470
think he has a lack of substance at

192
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,410
heart he's very good at building

193
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,850
characters his great great characters

194
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,490
but he doesn't do anything with them to

195
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:50,300
my mind and there's a lack of honesty

196
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,620
and a lack of understanding I think

197
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,560
somewhere there so we can see what he

198
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,680
does here he is he ignores the principle

199
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,770
of the webinar series in fact adventure

200
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,530
that he doesn't really understand it but

201
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,070
he did notice that every number in the

202
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,010
series is almost exactly one point six

203
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,390
one eight zero three times the pre

204
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,000
his number in the series so again they

205
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,740
superficially he just used that to build

206
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,290
the series and there we have it so that

207
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,540
is that and now exercise two so those

208
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,220
are all those of all the five posts from

209
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,160
the previous blog that I wrote these now

210
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,940
are seven code reviews that have just

211
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,030
been sent to me for the next exercise so

212
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,250
I've no idea what's on these so I'll be

213
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,100
seeing it for the first first time to

214
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,670
exercise two is factorial so the given

215
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:49,460
argument n return the factorial and

216
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:58,370
let's start with Kerouac Jack Kerouac

217
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:04,640
now Kerouac had a very spontaneous

218
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,810
stream of conscious style and he didn't

219
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,570
think ahead so there isn't a function

220
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:22,889
here like he thank you so

221
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:25,029
it looks like he hasn't actually

222
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:27,490
prepared any other examples it would

223
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:35,440
only work for N equals 43 and he's put a

224
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,149
whole lot of comments in here too and

225
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:39,339
it's really hard to figure out what is

226
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:42,190
code and what is common but it actually

227
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,610
sort of works there's a kind of stream

228
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,160
there and then he's answering he

229
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,980
actually tells you the answer before he

230
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,820
gives it you so there we are that's Jack

231
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,980
correct so yeah I mean it's okay so here

232
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,089
is James Joyce this is a particularly

233
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:08,500
nice probably actually of his I don't

234
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,420
know how many you familiar with him with

235
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,000
those blighters of James Joyce but one

236
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,190
thing he liked to do a lot was make up

237
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,800
these portmanteau words which is like

238
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,350
two words combined and it looks like

239
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,089
he's actually taken that into his code

240
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:23,589
and he's using that in a lot of places

241
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:27,070
so this is a hack on the factorial

242
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,620
utility so he's calling it a hack toriel

243
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,220
and he wants you to pass a small integer

244
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,899
as the argument cuz the big integer it's

245
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:36,250
not it's just gonna blow the whole thing

246
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,720
up so that's why it's calling it an in

247
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,209
jet to hint strongly the small integers

248
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:45,970
should be passed he's returning a list

249
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,149
of holes he's here assigning it's not

250
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:50,500
sure why he's doing that actually

251
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,940
because it doesn't really help but

252
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,040
whatever that's that's the way he thinks

253
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,850
I guess he's got the resolution which is

254
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,230
like the the amalgam of resultant

255
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:06,880
computation now if you pass zero in no

256
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,250
one really understands to be honest the

257
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,959
way the factorial of zero is equal to

258
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,890
one it's just one of those things so

259
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,709
this is Behold the stranger asturian

260
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:21,339
it's like the strange and dangerous zero

261
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:22,990
that no one really understands and I'm

262
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,290
just going to hard-code that and then

263
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,970
calculate by multi capables I don't even

264
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,209
know way saying there

265
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:32,829
but I guess what he's doing is he's just

266
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:35,670
doing um straightforward for loop

267
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,290
counting down and multiplying up

268
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,639
everything that he finds and that's the

269
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,709
answer really but it looks like he's

270
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:46,690
done something else here what's he doing

271
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:53,550
oh okay he's yeah he's converting it to

272
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,620
shillings and pence which is the the

273
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,000
currency that was around at the time

274
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,510
Hewitt was actually writing now actually

275
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,649
when you think about this this makes

276
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:04,360
some sense because every factorial over

277
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,480
4 I think is divisible by 12 and there

278
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,850
are 12 shillings in 12 pennies in a

279
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,639
shilling so he realizes that shillings

280
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,010
is a pretty good way to express results

281
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:20,260
for factorial he's doing a lot of crazy

282
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,209
 you see he doesn't actually use

283
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:25,089
you see he doesn't actually use
functions in as functions declaration

284
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:27,339
uses a constructor he uses a function

285
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:34,120
constructor here god only knows why but

286
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,910
it seems it seems to work and and then

287
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:41,079
he and then he he passes all the non

288
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:43,180
alpha characters out of there and then

289
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,440
he gets the answer oh and he always

290
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,470
likes to throw in these super

291
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,370
portmanteaus right at the end which is

292
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,380
like whole bunch of stuff combined all

293
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,160
that Hickock lack of stuff that's just

294
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,600
heavy weights you know so there we have

295
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,449
some some examples there and it's

296
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:04,720
actually yeah it's ok it's ok and now we

297
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,570
have Richard Feynman who's not a

298
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:14,050
novelist or poet but a very interesting

299
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,610
guy I have a great respect for him

300
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,130
especially the way and this quote sums

301
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,649
it up and the things he's going to sum

302
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:22,660
up his approach the answer is he never

303
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,560
pays attention to anything by experts

304
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,720
programs everything himself and to that

305
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,180
end he used this approximation to

306
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,160
calculate factorial and hence he's

307
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,740
called it factorial or actually factor

308
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,730
whale because it doesn't just work for

309
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,449
in

310
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:47,769
teachers it works for fractions - I

311
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:50,769
think it's pretty damn clever very

312
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:53,829
scientific approach and so there we can

313
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:55,660
see we can see and that the only problem

314
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,929
is it's only an approximation so I'm

315
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:00,819
sure we've all kind of familiar with

316
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,639
this three is six point zero zero zero

317
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:06,089
five but now he can cleverly do

318
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:10,659
factorials of non integers - which is

319
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:15,100
really great now we have Arthur Conan

320
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,630
Doyle who the author of the Sherlock

321
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:24,579
Holmes stories and I think he's done

322
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:27,100
something a little bit odd here he's he

323
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,130
likes to solve problems he likes to work

324
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,570
backwards through the problems so

325
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,519
factorial doesn't interest him he once

326
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,919
give me the answers to factorial and I

327
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,539
will give you the unfucked oriole I will

328
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:41,019
work backwards to determine what was the

329
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,240
number that actually seeded this

330
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,679
factorial he uses a couple of things at

331
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,510
the beginning he just says well you

332
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,950
won't understand these first two so I'm

333
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,019
just gonna put them in a hard-coded hash

334
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:55,779
and then he gets to the real

335
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:58,779
I'm factorial function and he was a

336
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:02,380
humble guy basically well he like he was

337
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:08,019
humble here and and if the number one is

338
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:10,240
the argument then he doesn't know what

339
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,480
it could be because it could be 0 it

340
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,659
could be 1 so he says to Watson he's at

341
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:24,220
a loss and then second his second parts

342
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,029
whose methodology was to look for

343
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:29,289
logical president so we have had a case

344
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:31,029
like this go back through the case

345
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:33,519
history we ever had one like this before

346
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,409
because he's caching all of the old

347
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:36,909
answers he straightaway looks in the in

348
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:38,980
the case history and finds the old

349
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,399
solutions though and then he eliminates

350
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:43,360
the impossible

351
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,529
so actually any factorial over 4 which

352
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:49,149
is all we're left with now is divisible

353
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:53,470
by 24 so and this is if it if it's 0 or

354
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,110
not divisible by 24 then he says

355
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,140
charlatans

356
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,490
this is not the answer to of factorial

357
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,610
finally he knows it's a real factorial

358
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,490
and he will work backwards and deduce

359
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:12,080
the answer but even then if it doesn't

360
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,400
come up to a whole number or so if the

361
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,800
denominator numerator and denominators

362
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,600
do not match by continually dividing the

363
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,370
numerator by denominator then he knows

364
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,980
you're an impostor too and that wasn't a

365
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,930
real factorial and then he adds it to

366
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,640
the case history and then he returns the

367
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,650
answer that's very good okay now and

368
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:39,400
here's some examples for you now

369
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,070
cameo Johnson Samuel Johnson was a 17th

370
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,470
century writer if some of you may have

371
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,410
heard of him he composed a dictionary he

372
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,820
wrote the first diction or one of the

373
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,430
first first dictionaries back in 1700s

374
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,770
and he had a very famous quote when one

375
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,470
is tired of JavaScript one is tired of

376
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:02,360
life and the thing about Samuel Johnson

377
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,180
is he hung around in coffee shops a lot

378
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,620
he did always work in coffee shops and

379
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,000
also he he really did not like the

380
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,040
elaborate language his contemporaries

381
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,860
were using they tended to use elaborate

382
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,360
somewhat historical language and he

383
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,380
liked very clean very clipped kind of

384
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,360
language so coffee spirit was perfect

385
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,850
for him so he's used coffee spirit to

386
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,280
solve the problem the irony is he liked

387
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,720
very simple language when we look back

388
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,430
now on how he used to write it looks

389
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,500
kind of old-fashioned and and

390
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,210
interesting he's a bit sarcastic

391
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,290
ingenious sophistry to prove the

392
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:48,140
palpably of PS if the number is if one

393
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,820
is the argument then that's the answer

394
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,650
he also took her an entry from his

395
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,110
dictionary in the put in the comments so

396
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,740
recursion he defined that from his

397
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:02,000
dictionary and and you can see a little

398
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,930
bit of like slightly scathing wit there

399
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,270
towards recursion he's not totally sold

400
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,140
on it but

401
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:18,510
it's salsas problem so now Jane Austen

402
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,750
and the thing about Jane Austen was

403
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:29,690
because she was in a male-dominated

404
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,730
world

405
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,710
she felt she had to hide her cleverness

406
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,950
from the world but she she did it in a

407
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:42,720
very like this is almost a recursive

408
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,180
statement here because program is

409
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,160
perceived she has most misfortunate of

410
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,570
knowing anything should conceal it as

411
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,490
well as she can which is not really

412
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,660
saying that she's concealing the fact

413
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,240
that that she knows you shouldn't do

414
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,300
that and we can see it a lot in examples

415
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,440
and she parodies a lot she parodies the

416
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,780
conventions of the time and so you'll

417
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:10,220
see she parodies the pedantry of the

418
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,060
JavaScript community the fact that you

419
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,100
some people say you should use triple

420
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,530
equals for everything she's pretending

421
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,540
she thinks that's actually true she

422
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,830
knows perfectly well it's not and she

423
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:26,070
doesn't have to do that she even checks

424
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,870
to see where the argument is and that is

425
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:31,260
an actual number or not knowing that it

426
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:39,650
could not be a number yeah and so

427
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:43,039
there's a certain mr. Crockford who says

428
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,409
whenever we have a we have an ear for a

429
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:47,900
foreign look we should check for in case

430
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,150
it was inherited from the prototype so

431
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,710
she's pretending that she thinks she

432
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,750
should that's what you should do here

433
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,029
and then she carries on the cursing

434
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:03,049
until the answer comes up and it's a

435
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,350
very nice we just go back one as with

436
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,059
her writing it's very well it's very

437
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:11,179
well crafted she's used the self

438
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:12,950
invoking function took as a kind of

439
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:20,240
closure so even the caching and

440
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,380
everything is completely enclosed within

441
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:29,690
this it's a very tidy function and then

442
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:34,669
finally back to earnest can't keep him

443
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:36,380
out he wanted to send it again I didn't

444
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,909
actually ask him but he sent sent me

445
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:41,169
another response to this one so and

446
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:44,870
again Ernest Hemingway's very spare a

447
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,820
very economical that's how he did it

448
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:54,289
none of your other extra stuff he

449
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:55,549
doesn't care that it might be slightly

450
00:23:55,549 --> 00:23:57,679
slower the because of solution he wants

451
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,049
it to be clean he wants it to be spare

452
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:04,909
and that's what we have and that's it

453
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:07,159
and here's some resources you might want

454
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:22,060
to look
