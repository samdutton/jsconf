if I'm just could basically interest the

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,900
speakers that come out a few any

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,980

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,150

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,010
this guy has really excellent German but

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,179
no I'm actually I'm from New York I

11
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,009
don't actually speak German so I didn't

12
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,239
know what to do the intro and shy like

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:34,620
doing English but then that's kind of

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,300
douchey cuz like here's this American

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,040

going to try i'm going to try giving you

18
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,559
the intro to today's conference entirely

19
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,200
in CSS this is the challenge I'm a

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,149
little bit nervous about it I studied

21
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:50,820
all of the html5 element names I studied

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,260
all the css3 property names and so here

23
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,020
we go intro dot CSS or if you're German

24
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,189
intrusive set 396 anyway ok cool so

25
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:10,830
first of all hi um hi you all uh hi

26
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,080
everybody here is your intro I'm

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,189
basically just want to give you a

28
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,150
background about CSS com I'm sorry that

29
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,670
is that's not bad the numbers but then

30
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,090
the n.o and season let's see you soon

31
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,439
okay cool it's a nice orange uh so yeah

32
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,930
CSS come I think you'll love it it hurts

33
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,450
me too don't worry but before we start

34
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,930
just going to some filler content here

35
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,159
and you might find it a little bit

36
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,159
off-color you might find it the jokes

37
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,290
are somewhat opaque maybe some of the

38
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,310
jokes are a little bit of a stretch

39
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,290
speaking of the jokes I'm just going to

40
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,590
list them up you know stretch trying to

41
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,990
lighten the mood some of them might make

42
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,070
you a little bit embarrassed you know

43
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,829
make your face red or make you blush

44
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:08,129
better known as FFF Oh f5 but I am a

45
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:11,489
bottomless trove of bad CSS jokes so I

46
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:12,540
don't think of any trouble there they're

47
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,800
all funny but like

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,380
every tenth joke will float just right

49
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,220
and will be comic gold so just bear with

50
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,550
me if it seems slow gold also obviously

51
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,640
FF d700 so it's going to give you

52
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,320
background of the area here we are in

53
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,900
Berlin it's a conference about style in

54
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,020
a city that has style Berlin has so much

55
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,150
style if styles have style and that just

56
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,060
keeps repeating forever yeah it's like

57
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,260
just walking out on the street just

58
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,540
seeing people on the street a man it is

59
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,210
so stylish even here at berghain people

60
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,920
waiting in line have style you would say

61
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:57,480
they have inline style and because it's

62
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,880
Germany the line height is about to 2x

63
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,140
what it usually is where I'm where I'm

64
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,030
from but you don't want to use inline

65
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,560
styles is right that's bad you wanna use

66
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,410
his class and you know this is city

67
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,120
obviously a lot history it has a lot of

68
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,180
class I haven't seen this much class

69
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,070
it's almost too much class like villains

70
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,380
almost too classy I haven't seen this

71
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,209
much excessive class since I last used

72
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:25,230
modernizer about the area also we are

73
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,640
right next to the Berlin Wall if you

74
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,970
might know it's about two million pixels

75
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:38,250
to your left it is this solid border

76
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,910
that used to divide Germany until

77
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,550
nineteen eighty nine when it collapsed

78
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:48,390
so it's a it's actually kind of hard to

79
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,070
find you actually can't find the berlin

80
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,690
wall with CSS you're going to need to

81
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,700
use javascript using jquery i'm sure you

82
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,530
guys all know how to do this Jake where

83
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,090
you put in a selector so you just find

84
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,690
an area that has sold off and you can

85
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,940
find the Berlin Wall it's he's wearing a

86
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,100
jacket you'll see it shouldn't be hard

87
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,430
fun so about this address where we are

88
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,239
right now we are on in bleedin straße

89
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:13,650
and again I don't know german i'm pretty

90
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,540
sure that in bleedin straße in english

91
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,340
would just be a street address that is

92
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,769
disabled

93
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:23,470
it's my guess I was to breed I have and

94
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,870
about this particular section of this

95
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,950
area it's villas Beth it is a sim back

96
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,030
or another but the position of this

97
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,110
place it is right in the center of

98
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,860
Berlin you can see these beautiful white

99
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,680
walls the background here is white

100
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,630
better known as ffffff but it's actually

101
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,070
the building's little bit old so it's

102
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,810
faded a little bit is actually more like

103
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,180
a fa e bd7 better nose antique white

104
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,170
apparently fading is perfectly natural

105
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,780
this in a white space perfectly normal

106
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,360
if that happens I don't worry about it

107
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,060
this is actually like a parish you can't

108
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,710
really tell it's not on display but this

109
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,660
is actually you know a religious

110
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,880
institution so it's not on display but

111
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,440
if you were here like maybe 50 years ago

112
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,260
it would be more of a display none kind

113
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,950
of thing anyway so let's talk about this

114
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,150
conference it is an import from the

115
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,880
state's CSS com started we're gonna hear

116
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,490
more about that later from Nicole let's

117
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,810
talk about CSS cough actually hold I'm

118
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,730
gonna get a little bit more specific

119
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,700
let's talk about CSS comfy you it's the

120
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,200
first of its type its i think is far

121
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,030
neither the only of its type it is for

122
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,350
the organizers is their first conference

123
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,790
and i'm sure you know what that means it

124
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,570
is aunt child index one so of all the

125
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,580
children's like the index is one or as

126
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:42,530
some of you would say the index is one

127
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,850
so yeah sees economy you it's a it's not

128
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,950
for profit right so there's no margin

129
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,930
gonna make any margin on this hopefully

130
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,800
when they're done there will be nothing

131
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,490
left i assume what I hope is not the

132
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,620
case that they actually have extra money

133
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,230
and they just hide it so let's hope that

134
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,940
that is not happening let's talk about

135
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,560
the list of the speakers we have

136
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,150
excellent speakers there in the top 1%

137
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,450
of their field they are the backgrounds

138
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,580
are really really badass you would all

139
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,290
say absolutely badass so if during while

140
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,460
you're listening these speakers if you

141
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,840
are unable to focus next we have a

142
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:27,040
selection of delicious black coffee but

143
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,300
I've heard unfortunately we have is your

144
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,390
decaf which you know if you're not a

145
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,849
caffeine person is bad

146
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:33,959
add but let me give you some background

147
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,929
on that apparently the organizers asked

148
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:41,119
them to do decaf and all they said was a

149
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:45,199
999 999 and then just no decaf so I

150
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,889
realized that's a lot of background

151
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:48,509
jokes in a row so I'm just going to turn

152
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,399
off repeat on the background jokes sorry

153
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,580
about that its last one also mention the

154
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,179
toilet if you need directions ask me

155
00:06:57,179 --> 00:07:02,189
later and once you so if you have to

156
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,770
drink less coffee gift p after you visit

157
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,230
the toilet and your empty if p

158
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,619
everything for your will be fixed

159
00:07:10,619 --> 00:07:13,080
everything will be all right so

160
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,240
definitely give that a visit I want to

161
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,559
talk we have this policy they mentioned

162
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:19,439
it's the anti-drug policy so I just want

163
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,119
to give you in the in the context of CSS

164
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:23,490
what that entails so take this pretty

165
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,279
seriously don't disable user selection

166
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,740
on all elements that's kind of douchey

167
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,439
don't ever every seven images don't

168
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,119
rotate them 180 degrees like that's

169
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,379
pretty douchey don't fade all the

170
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:39,569
paragraphs 20 like I can't see them

171
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:40,949
after 500 seconds like don't do that

172
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:42,269
that that would be a jerky thing to do

173
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:44,819
and finally don't blink all of your H

174
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,529
ones all right so just doesn't God just

175
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:47,309
don't do that so that would be a

176
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:49,879
definitely fall under the jerk policy

177
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,769
one more point I want to make it's a I'm

178
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:54,360
sorry one point I guess it would be a

179
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,659
pretty important point I want to talk

180
00:07:57,659 --> 00:07:59,639
about if you guys take photos or of
