[Music]

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,840
say yes that's me Rachel Andrew this is

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,080
my second time at CSS comps EU I've done

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,210
a few CSS comps around around the world

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,699
now really great to be here Berlin is

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,100
very much my favorite city so I take any

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,500
chance to come here so I'm going to talk

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,180
it's a non technical talk which is

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,730
unusual for me my sort of comfort zone

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,180
is to have 150 slides of code so I've

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,770
had to write a non-technical talk I'm

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,590
going to talk about where CFS comes from

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,020
and if we wanted to be literal about

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,000
this it comes from 1996 because that's

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,820
when the CSS 1 specification was

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,789
published and in the same year

17
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,980
we got ie 3 and that was the first

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,350
browser which had some CSS support and

19
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,199
very neatly my career as a web developer

20
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,970
started in 1996 I am one of those people

21
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,280
who had to install her web browsers from

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,369
CDs that were sent by the ISP so if

23
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:15,600
anybody else could remember doing that

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,820
anyone else anyone I was old was a few

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,799
of you we can all get together remember

26
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,920
the good old days later so I've been

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,240
working on the web for a long time and

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,720
so my history as a web developer sort of

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,110
has gone along with CSS I started to

30
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,329
build websites without CSS because it

31
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,009
wasn't a reality that I had version 2

32
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:35,790
browsers

33
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,340
there was no option other than font tags

34
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,110
and nested tables that was just how

35
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,280
things were done and the really amazing

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,680
thing about CSS other that we talked

37
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,420
about this enough is the fact that all

38
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,549
of those early things we built and as we

39
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,829
started to use CSS as we started to use

40
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,500
CSS for layout all that stuff really

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,700
still works

42
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,610
CSS remains backwards compatible and

43
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,549
that's really important and therein lies

44
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,140
a lot of the problems that we actually

45
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,299
have with CSS in terms of creating CSS

46
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,330
and using CSS is this you know we can't

47
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,040
go around breaking the web

48
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,939
so I'm not really going to talk about

49
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:16,700
the history of CSS today that's just

50
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,549
pretty well-documented what I really

51
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:21,920
want to talk about is where does CSS

52
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,969
come from today where does new CSS come

53
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:28,549
from what's the process how do we go

54
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,859
from an idea to something that ends up

55
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,250
in a browser because I hear all kinds of

56
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,890
strange theories and kind of like weird

57
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,900
conspiracy theories about where CSS

58
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,000
comes from and I think some of that

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,040
actually does have its roots back in in

60
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,959
the olden days back in the days when I

61
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,069
became a member of the web standards

62
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:49,220
project because browser vendors were

63
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,439
competing at one point on platform

64
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,840
features so they were bringing out new

65
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,849
CSS features and saying well we've got

66
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:58,040
this I we've got this and Netscape

67
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,989
hasn't got it and ultimately we were

68
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:01,639
building if you wanted to do cool new

69
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,040
stuff you'd build two websites you'd

70
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,840
build one for Internet Explorer one for

71
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,060
Netscape you detect which browser the

72
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,620
user hadn't you'd send them to the right

73
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,579
website and this was terrible and people

74
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:14,989
didn't want to do that would put best

75
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:16,970
viewed with buttons on their web pages

76
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,699
that's horrible and people kind of

77
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,099
expect that browser vendors are locked

78
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:25,220
in some battle about CSS and actually

79
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,470
what really happens looks a bit like

80
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,319
this this certificate the CSS working

81
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,090
group meeting in Tokyo a couple of weeks

82
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,549
ago we were all locked in that room no

83
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:36,319
one was allowed to go for coffee and so

84
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,180
we decided what happens to line-height

85
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,889
when you've got two founds of different

86
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:41,949
character sets next to each other

87
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:44,750
now just in that photo there are people

88
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,489
from Microsoft Google Mozilla and

89
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:48,440
several other companies and they're all

90
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,109
working together on a particular CSS

91
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:55,010
issue and you can have a look at the

92
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,169
current members of the CSS working group

93
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:00,400
it's a whole bunch of people making CSS

94
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,540
representing lots of different browser

95
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,819
vendors and other people there's lots of

96
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,409
people there who work who work on things

97
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:09,470
like ebooks epub and outputting CSS to

98
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,840
print so you can have a look at their

99
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,810
affiliations the people who are there so

100
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,269
any CSS specification passes through

101
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,029
this group we get the opportunity to

102
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:22,099
debate parts of the spec and vote on

103
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:24,580
changing or adding features and that we

104
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,099
stops one vendor a one-party dragging a

105
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:29,199
specification away from what would

106
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,669
benefit the web as a whole and the specs

107
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:35,379
have to start somewhere so they come

108
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:37,629
from all sorts of places they often do

109
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:39,490
come from a particular browser vendor in

110
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,830
order to solve problems that that vendor

111
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,569
thinks are important they may be kind of

112
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:46,180
problems they see in their business but

113
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,430
it's not just browser vendors the CSS

114
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,449
shapes spec started life with Adobe and

115
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,949
others come directly from the working

116
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:55,150
group because they're going to solve

117
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,879
some problem that we see or we know we

118
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,740
need a way to do a certain type of thing

119
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,690
to enable something else and so those

120
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,159
specs might come directly from the

121
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:08,590
working group so I wanted to take a look

122
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,419
at this process and I thought I'd do

123
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:13,539
that via CSS grids because if you know

124
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:15,099
me you'll know that I'm a bit of a grid

125
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:17,259
superfan and I've been working with the

126
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:19,300
spec for quite a long time and so I kind

127
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,590
of know the history of this

128
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,650
specification so let's talk about CSS

129
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,740
specs via grid and what happened to that

130
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,389
and how it became something that we

131
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:31,870
could use in browsers so how did that

132
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,400
start out quite a long time ago it's

133
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,449
2011 we got a first public working draft

134
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:41,740
now if you go and have a look at that

135
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,020
document you'll find that a lot of the

136
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,120
concepts there seem pretty familiar if

137
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,190
you've used modern grid layout so north

138
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,479
a lot of the features that you use a

139
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:52,060
kind of outlined in that spec there

140
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,680
might have different names or look a bit

141
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,509
different and things are a little bit

142
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:57,460
vague around the edges but it's kind of

143
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,680
all there so it's six years before it

144
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,569
made into our browsers we have this

145
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:06,009
first draft and in fact it goes back a

146
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,879
long way the ideas in grid go back to

147
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:12,669
around 2005 this is the CSS advanced

148
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:16,000
layout module it looks very like some of

149
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,860
the stuff that's in the grid spec the

150
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,199
grid template areas ASCII art syntax

151
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:23,229
pretty much describes in this spec and

152
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:25,539
that's often the case of working group

153
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:27,340
things you get these notes these

154
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,400
collections of ideas that may well

155
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,379
become something that we have in CSS but

156
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:34,210
might just kind of float around just

157
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,740
like when you're developing any products

158
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,630
you kind of have these ideas and you

159
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,689
think oh yeah that would be

160
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,889
cool maybe we should think about

161
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:41,659
implementing that and it gets kind of

162
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:43,399
put on the back burner that happens in

163
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:49,309
CSS as well so a working draft now a

164
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:52,129
working draft is essentially a snapshot

165
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:54,409
of the state of the spec at a particular

166
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:56,419
date and it means we can reference it it

167
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:58,219
means I can write about it and say oh

168
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:00,049
you know on this date this working draft

169
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:02,779
this is the names of the properties it's

170
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:05,179
useful to have a reference of the state

171
00:07:05,179 --> 00:07:06,019
of respect

172
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:07,759
now publication of a working draft

173
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,439
doesn't mean a lot in terms of

174
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,689
implementation it doesn't mean the specs

175
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:13,489
mature it might not be finished it might

176
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:15,769
have great big holes in it it's just the

177
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,679
snapshot of where the work was on that

178
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:21,469
day if you want to see where the work

179
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:24,319
actually is today you want to look for

180
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,969
the editors drafts and they're always

181
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:28,009
linked from the working draft now that's

182
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:30,139
what the spec editors are actually

183
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:31,819
working on right now so that would be

184
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,889
the most up-to-date thing but could be

185
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:35,300
completely different to the working

186
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,860
draft and any experimental

187
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,079
implementations it's you know where all

188
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:43,639
the bug fixes are going and if you take

189
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,110
a look at that first public working

190
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,379
draft you'll see the editors listed and

191
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:51,110
those spec editors were from Microsoft

192
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,809
so the initial grid spec came from

193
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:55,669
Microsoft you have them plank for the

194
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:58,429
fact we have grid at all in addition to

195
00:07:58,429 --> 00:08:00,199
drafting this first version of the spec

196
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:02,050
they created an experiment

197
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,249
implementation in ie10

198
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:08,300
so grid is in ie10 and up its ms prefix

199
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,039
because that's how experiments were

200
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:14,209
released in those days so in general as

201
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:16,459
specs are developed if they've come from

202
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:18,199
a browser event there's going to be some

203
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,749
experimental implementation that they've

204
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:22,459
done back in the day it was a vendor

205
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,079
prefixes now they tend to be behind

206
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,899
flags and these give you the chance to

207
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:29,959
play around with new CSS which is really

208
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,789
important and I'll come back to that in

209
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:35,059
a bit so the experimental invitations

210
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,800
let the vendors the browser vendor and

211
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,329
also the working group know whether this

212
00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:39,529
is something that people are interested

213
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:41,839
in and to start to look at the problems

214
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,930
that might be in that spec and it was

215
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,670
where my journey with gridlayout began

216
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,170
with this experimental ie implementation

217
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:54,310
I tend implemented quite a lot of the

218
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,560
features in the spec not everything but

219
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,210
it was enough to make me realize that

220
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,000
this was something that we wanted and

221
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,090
what I also knew through having followed

222
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,760
CFS for such a long time was that new

223
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,400
stuff often needs someone to promote it

224
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,920
it needs superfans it needs someone to

225
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,240
go out there and talk to other web

226
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,590
developers and say look at this cool

227
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,020
thing because it through that that

228
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,690
interest is gauged and that we can have

229
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,370
actually get this stuff into all of our

230
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,750
browsers so I thought well I'm going to

231
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,910
start talking about this I want to start

232
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,830
telling people about this spec and use

233
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,530
what I knew about teaching CSS so I've

234
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,420
been teaching basic CSS and it's about

235
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,420
2001 sort of take what I knew about that

236
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,280
and apply it to this thing that was

237
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,320
experimental and start talking about it

238
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,460
and while I was doing this the spec

239
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,860
moved on and for quite a while I was

240
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,690
talking I was standing on stage talking

241
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,860
about something which didn't have a

242
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,810
browser implementation because the spec

243
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,030
was different to what was in i8n but we

244
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,340
didn't have any news any new

245
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,950
implementations thankfully that didn't

246
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,360
last too long because it was kind of

247
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,190
hard making up how this stuff might work

248
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,800
and we started to get an implementation

249
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,710
in blink and WebKit which is done by a

250
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,110
company called agalya and actually

251
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,690
sponsored by Bloomberg and here's a

252
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,990
little bit of CSS history because the

253
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,180
first time I met the people from a Galia

254
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,430
doing that implementation and also some

255
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,980
from Bloomberg was here at CSS comps in

256
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,710
2014 where I was talking about CSS grid

257
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,780
layout and I was actually pretty nervous

258
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,430
once I realized they were all here

259
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,990
because I was going to be talking about

260
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,790
the work that they were doing and they

261
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,740
were going to be in the room so that was

262
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,300
very scary but it was very night it was

263
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,070
great to meet them and we we sort of

264
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,260
chat back and saw us on Twitter now and

265
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,880
things and I've been in touch than ever

266
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,400
since I think it's also interesting that

267
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,320
Bloomberg sponsored the development of

268
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,490
CSS grid in blink and WebKit so they

269
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,350
wanted the feature they wanted it for

270
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,850
the embedded chromium that's inside

271
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,070
their terminal product so they wanted

272
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,170
that platform feature and by sponsoring

273
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,720
it as an open web feature we all get it

274
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,520
and they get what they need for their

275
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:03,940
business

276
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,710
that's very interesting and Bloomberg

277
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,120
about responded quite a lot of features

278
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,940
and CSS and JavaScript to be implemented

279
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,290
into browsers so by this point we had

280
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,140
some implementations and we were

281
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,110
starting to work with those and I was

282
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,240
presenting about grid and talking to web

283
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,740
developers that you know people like at

284
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,620
CSS conf and something came up over and

285
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:32,380
over again and it was this there was no

286
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,230
way to create a gap between tracks in

287
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,080
the grid and people immediately looked

288
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,430
at grid and said well it's a bit like

289
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,500
mode two column layout why don't we have

290
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,670
something like column gap in grid now in

291
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,890
the IE implementation it was kind of a

292
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,390
bit annoying but it didn't really matter

293
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,280
too much he didn't have gutters what you

294
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,410
could do is define little skinny tracks

295
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,330
in your grid and use those as gutters

296
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,620
because you had to place everything

297
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,260
explicitly on the grid but the new

298
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,480
specification had this idea of also

299
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,760
placement so you could define a grid and

300
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,190
then throw a bunch of content asset and

301
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,530
grid will just Auto place it's a bit

302
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,510
like with Flex box where things you know

303
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,870
place one after the other with no

304
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,810
gutters you couldn't use auto placement

305
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,940
because grid would try and place items

306
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,580
into those skinny tracks so that was an

307
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,330
idea so I was talking about this on

308
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,310
stage and saying you know this isn't

309
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,870
great web developers are talking about

310
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,430
this and saying we need to have some

311
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,000
kind of gap between our tracks which led

312
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,740
me to discussing the issue with their

313
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,750
people from the working group and one of

314
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,400
the spec offers she wrote the feature

315
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,410
into the spec where it was implemented

316
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,810
and became part of the level 1 spec

317
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,730
which means that a bit of code like this

318
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,270
with those 10 pixel gutter tracks could

319
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,670
be simplified and would end up looking

320
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,480
like this and the thing about this is I

321
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,830
mean that was just one thing that kind

322
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,750
of went into the spec that I you know

323
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,720
remember and I was kind of part of but

324
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,430
the important thing about that is that

325
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,590
that was feedback from the web community

326
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,280
making its way into a CSS specification

327
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,420
because we were playing with an

328
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,580
experimental spec we were able to make

329
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,380
changes to that spec and

330
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,540
time I wasn't a working boot member I've

331
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,850
only been a working group member and for

332
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,280
for about a year so what are the working

333
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,780
group member and I was just talking to

334
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,340
other web developers but we were able to

335
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,480
make a change the level one spec we can

336
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,730
do this with any new bit to the platform

337
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:37,570
that were interested in so we've got a

338
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,310
spec that's kind of in this state and

339
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,260
it's changing and it's becoming

340
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,760
different as it's moving along and

341
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,530
browsers are implementing at the same

342
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,990
time so we've kind of got a spec and

343
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,460
we've got browser development and things

344
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,780
are changing in the spec and the

345
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,460
browsers are having to make changes

346
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,500
because of that and that's kind of how a

347
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,000
lot of things happen in this kind of

348
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,760
circular way where we get an

349
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,410
implementation and we get the specs

350
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,420
developing alongside each other it's

351
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,040
certainly not a case that the working

352
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,200
group sort of hide in a room and develop

353
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,150
a specification throw it at browser

354
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,620
vendors and say well they go you know

355
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,280
good luck with that

356
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:16,900
this thing happens in a circular way and

357
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,220
this iterative development has happened

358
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,460
for a very long time with specifications

359
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,820
but as many people know this is bit

360
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,280
nerves in the past if you try to use

361
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,800
early flexbox for example in a

362
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,780
production site it was vendor prefixed

363
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,160
you could use it in a production site

364
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,580
and you might have a site working and

365
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,160
then a new browser came out with a

366
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,620
different implementation of flexbox at

367
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,880
one point there were kind of three

368
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,650
different implementations of flexbox out

369
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,920
there in the wild now grid has changed

370
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,110
even more than the flexbox spec did but

371
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,540
it did so behind a feature flag in

372
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,950
browsers which meant that no one could

373
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,050
use it for production code so we didn't

374
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,700
have this issue if it kind of been out

375
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,770
there and biting people as the spec

376
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,830
changed it so that's really the

377
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,480
difference between developing with

378
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,770
vendor prefixes which has really gone

379
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,730
away and developing with feature flags

380
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:12,100
it's enabled respect to change and to

381
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,630
have this issue ative process of browser

382
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,210
development and spec development without

383
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,730
that then sort of getting into our sites

384
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:23,869
and causing us problems

385
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:27,910
so it took till 2016 for the SPECT for

386
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,350
the working group to essentially say we

387
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,720
think this is probably done that's quite

388
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,410
a long time it's a very very big spec

389
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,490
when the working group thinks something

390
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,800
is pretty much done how its voted to

391
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,329
become a candidate recommendation and

392
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:45,129
what that means is the spec has moved on

393
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:47,860
from being a working draft and the way

394
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,420
think of things this is time it needs to

395
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,910
have implementation experience we think

396
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,800
this spec can be implemented we think

397
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,180
it's useful we think it does the things

398
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,579
it's set out to do you know do we have

399
00:15:57,579 --> 00:15:59,199
implementation experience

400
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,600
so how vendors implemented everything

401
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,540
and the next step will be a proposed

402
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,040
recommendation so this is like saying

403
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,300
well this is what we think is going to

404
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,420
be the spec and we need to have two

405
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,089
independent interoperable implementation

406
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:15,939
of all of the features so that means

407
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:18,040
that we need to have two browsers really

408
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,839
that have implemented the features and

409
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,980
not only do you need to have two

410
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,019
browsers the work needs to have been

411
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:25,240
done by two different people or groups

412
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,019
of people so the work done by a Galia

413
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:31,420
say in web WebKit and blink that

414
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,589
wouldn't really count as two

415
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:33,819
implementations they're different

416
00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:35,589
browsers actually pretty much the same

417
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:37,569
code because I think Graham was broken

418
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:39,550
on that before the the projects Forks

419
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,410
but it's the same company doing that

420
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,300
work but we've also got the work in

421
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:43,930
Firefox

422
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,550
so because you've got the work in

423
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,439
Firefox done by a different team we've

424
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,579
got two implementations and so hopefully

425
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,930
grid will be able to progress you know

426
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,160
once all the little pubs have been

427
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,170
worked out and all of the features are

428
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,259
implemented gradually as progress on and

429
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:01,300
the reason we have this requirements

430
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,250
that make sure that we don't have things

431
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,980
that are you know WC recommendations

432
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,020
with only implemented in one browser or

433
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,880
perhaps could only be implemented in one

434
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,350
browser because of the way that browser

435
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:17,020
works something you might see in the

436
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,909
spec if you in fact you look at the

437
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:20,860
current working draft you'll see that

438
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,380
something called sub-grid is marked as

439
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,399
at-risk in the spec and what this means

440
00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:29,110
actually in the current editors draft

441
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,760
subgrid has been removed it's been

442
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,240
pushed to level 2 and this at-risk flag

443
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,740
what it means really is this is a

444
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,150
feature that we think

445
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,490
might not be able to be implemented by

446
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,760
two implementations it might not be in a

447
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,410
state that we can actually get that and

448
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,690
move the speck on in a timely manner so

449
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,570
we flag it is at risk that doesn't mean

450
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,220
that the thing will never be implemented

451
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,470
and in fact sub-grid was discussed at

452
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,910
the last working group meeting we had a

453
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,680
breakout session on it it's still very

454
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,690
much on the cards but it's been moved

455
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,270
into level 2 of the spec rather than

456
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,130
dropped so it essentially moved into a

457
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,560
different release of that bit of CFS I

458
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,810
just like you might decide that a

459
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,910
certain feature of your product is going

460
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,560
to get bumped into another release so

461
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,850
that you can ship the stuff you've been

462
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,190
working on your CSS works pretty much in

463
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:21,550
the same way so March 2017 we got grid

464
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,490
in all of these browsers and edge of

465
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,920
also announced that they're going to be

466
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,640
updating too so it took a very long time

467
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,280
it took almost six years to get grid

468
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,910
into browsers so wide earth to CSS take

469
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,460
so long it's partly because there's a

470
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,910
lot of stakeholders it needs to be

471
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,460
implemented in browsers in a way that's

472
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,600
not going to cause problems or

473
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,010
performance problems accessibility

474
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:51,370
issues and behind every browser is a

475
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,080
business and they're going to have

476
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,300
different priorities they need to be

477
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,800
able to schedule a team to work on

478
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,200
something to get that implementation in

479
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,870
the browser so we got grid because

480
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,400
Microsoft thought it was interesting to

481
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,230
start with and then Bloomberg we're

482
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:09,120
willing to fund it into other browsers

483
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,310
there's also us authors the people who

484
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,850
write CSS CSS has to make as much sense

485
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,460
as possible to web developers because if

486
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,200
something is just too complicated or

487
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,700
crazy-looking what people might not

488
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,440
implement it they might not use it and

489
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,000
then there's no point having that CSS

490
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,550
tool introducing this talk I mentioned

491
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,500
how amazing it was that CSS doesn't

492
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,810
break things it's backwards compatible

493
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,140
this is really really important and it

494
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,730
will come as no surprise to people in

495
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,130
this room that some of CSS is a bit

496
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,650
suboptimal

497
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,300
so behold the list of things that we're

498
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,540
going to fix in CSS just as soon as

499
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,840
someone has invented a time

500
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,090
machine so if it seems that some CSS is

501
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,760
really really weird at doing a bit of

502
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,760
digging might just turn up why it's so

503
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,310
weird which at least will confirm that

504
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,080
the CSS working group aren't just trying

505
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,150
to make your life hard but also if I

506
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,740
understanding why things seem really

507
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,770
weird it can help you understand and

508
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,540
remember that you know it may be because

509
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,250
it was added a long time ago we didn't

510
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,510
know the web was going to be like this

511
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,700
and it may be because they're new but

512
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,320
they have to cope with something added a

513
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,670
long time ago when we didn't know the

514
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,890
web was going to be like this and

515
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,270
sometimes they're weird because they're

516
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,650
dealing with stuff that you don't run

517
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,330
into there's some stuff that's weird

518
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,430
because it has to cope with languages

519
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,630
that were in right-to-left on top to

520
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,100
bottom as well as left-to-right there's

521
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,840
lots and lots of stuff in CSS which is

522
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,090
dealing with that kind of issue so

523
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,610
trying to figure out why things seem odd

524
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:46,940
can just help you remember them but what

525
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,090
is really important is that you can help

526
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,850
to influence the direction of CSS far

527
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,830
more than you imagine that you can and

528
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,590
you can do this in a whole bunch of ways

529
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,270
that I'm going to cover it now because I

530
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,310
really as someone who is just a web

531
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,690
developer you know running a tiny

532
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,070
company I'm not from a big browser

533
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,650
vendor and I'm on the working group and

534
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,780
the thing that I like to do is take

535
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,430
people's feedback to the working group

536
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,350
take other web developers feedback and

537
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,180
bring it to the working group so here's

538
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,320
way everyone can be doing that one of

539
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,150
the simplest ways to get involved is to

540
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,370
go to browsers and ask for features to

541
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,650
be implemented a lot of browsers have

542
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,080
got official ways of doing this go and

543
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,450
use it both the stuff post stuff up tell

544
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:33,590
browsers that you want stuff but even

545
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,870
more important is to start using things

546
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,330
especially if that stuff only exists in

547
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,360
one browser at the moment browser

548
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,210
vendors are tracking usage of features

549
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,280
to see what the demand is for the

550
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,800
feature so here you can see the usage of

551
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,380
flex this is on Chrome status they're

552
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,270
tracking see how often this stuff is

553
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,210
used Microsoft has got a similar data

554
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,610
gathering effort if you use a feature in

555
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,960
production even if it's just on your

556
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,090
personal site and even if you have to do

557
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,140
a fallback for other browsers that

558
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,510
is noted and it's like oh well people

559
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,010
are wanting this because they're using

560
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,790
it for things that are tucked away

561
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,800
behind browser flag using them in

562
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,170
production is impossible but another way

563
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,570
to show interest is if you write or talk

564
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,910
about this stuff write posts on your

565
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,330
blogs you talk about the thing do

566
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,320
presentations at meetups or whatever

567
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,440
this photo is a screenshot from event

568
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,060
part in Seattle which is when edge

569
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,410
announced they were going to update

570
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,200
their grid implementation they responded

571
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,230
on stage to an email I sent them in 2014

572
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,600
chasing them up about updating that ie

573
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,570
10 implementation browser vendors are

574
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,210
listening they want to know what we want

575
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:51,030
make sure that they get that message and

576
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,790
it's not just about speaking to browser

577
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,040
vendors you can actually take part in

578
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,880
developing CSS itself here you don't

579
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,920
need to be a special person you don't

580
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,630
need to be an advice expert the CSS

581
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,060
working group to get involved as we need

582
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,890
designers and developers to take a look

583
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,140
at new stuff to make suggestions about

584
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,950
things that we haven't solved yet in CSS

585
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,460
everything that happens at the CSS

586
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,860
working group happens in the open so you

587
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,510
can follow along with what's happening

588
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,400
and you can you know make your own

589
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,460
comments these specifications and issues

590
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,530
raised against them are held in github

591
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,300
in the Citiz working group drafts

592
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,370
repositories you can go and you can have

593
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,840
a look at that and you can see what

594
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,160
issues have already been raised you can

595
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,540
comment on them you can raise some of

596
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,180
your own there the series written people

597
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,620
on Twitter and things are posted there

598
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,300
that we're working on and also sometimes

599
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,250
direct questions are posted there quite

600
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,290
often about naming what should we call

601
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,330
this property because we don't know and

602
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:51,390
we're asking for feedback you can also

603
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,370
see all of the current work of the CSS

604
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,630
working group so you can see if there's

605
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,980
something that you think you'd like to

606
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:03,480
comment on feature request to CSS you

607
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,130
can request those in very much the same

608
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,080
way you'd ask for any feature of a

609
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,720
product and the best way to do that is

610
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,550
to come up with us or the use case as

611
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,010
opposed to proposing syntax actually the

612
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,720
syntax or sense is very very hard to

613
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,130
kind of work out because it has to cope

614
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:17,460
with all

615
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,039
old stuff and legacy stuff and quite

616
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:21,600
often we go round and round on names

617
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,490
quite a few times before it's decided

618
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,220
what it's going to be but the use case

619
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,620
is the important thing now what problem

620
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,480
are you trying to solve with this CSS

621
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,419
and our authors already working around

622
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:35,190
this in some way a lot of the time

623
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,770
people are doing things in JavaScript

624
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,909
that would make a lot of sense to be

625
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:41,039
able to do in CSS what if we've got that

626
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,710
JavaScript implementation then that's a

627
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,659
really good test case for well hey know

628
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,549
how do we actually do this in native CSS

629
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:50,340
so that's really useful and if using you

630
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,899
know using javascript to do things isn't

631
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:54,570
a bad thing and but are there problems

632
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,220
because of that use of JavaScript you

633
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,570
know is it creating a performance issue

634
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,250
that perhaps we could solve that it was

635
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,010
part of CSS so that sort of stuff if you

636
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,929
can bring that into an issue on github

637
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:05,610
if people are going to look at that and

638
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,350
then they talk about it you know we

639
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,970
bring up these things in working group

640
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,980
meetings and talk about them and try and

641
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,120
see if there is a way that they could be

642
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:17,309
solved so as an example you can go and

643
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:19,080
have a look at one of the things that

644
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,029
happens people start to look at CSS grid

645
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:23,399
and they say oh you know can I just

646
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:26,309
style the backgrounds of grid areas can

647
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:28,230
i style column tracks can i add borders

648
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,640
to them and the answer the moment is no

649
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,049
you have to put an element in there to

650
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:32,789
style them and it's kind of creating

651
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:35,039
containers for elements so we need some

652
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,440
kind of grid cell pseudo element in

653
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,419
order that you can style the backgrounds

654
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,399
and borders absolutely a lot of people

655
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:42,899
have asked for so it's something that

656
00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:44,970
has been put in as an issue and quite a

657
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:45,960
lot of people have commented on that

658
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,850
thread this thing you're interested in

659
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,080
you can always go and read and see if

660
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,450
you've got anything else to share so

661
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,940
this is how new CSS is happening if

662
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,250
people are asking for things and we're

663
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,539
talking about them and trying to work

664
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:59,909
out the best way of doing that so that

665
00:25:59,909 --> 00:26:01,230
would probably that'd be a level two

666
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,299
feature now you can see it's got a CSS

667
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:06,000
grid to a flight tag on it so that we

668
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,010
can sort of keep track on it as we start

669
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,169
to look at the level to a CSS grid

670
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:14,309
layout now it's not just about new

671
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:15,929
features there are bugs in

672
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:18,809
specifications and you know the CSS

673
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:20,100
effects so it can be very long and

674
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,480
complex and they can end up with bugs

675
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,070
then if you spot something that's an

676
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,470
issue come and raise it if it turns out

677
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,820
it's not an issue it might just be that

678
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,340
we need to clarify that bit of respect

679
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,990
there because someone thinks that what's

680
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,730
said in the spec is actually wrong so

681
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,110
that's actually a bug as well to what

682
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,909
the specs to be clear so common log

683
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:41,909
issues against respects and web browsers

684
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:43,200
they'll be very happy to hear about your

685
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,779
interrupts issues too you can go and you

686
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,909
can log bugs and any browser if you find

687
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:49,409
saying that it's not working in a

688
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:51,570
browser go and tell them about it

689
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,029
because quite often it's when people get

690
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,950
their hands on new CSS they start using

691
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,600
it with some other CSS they start using

692
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,340
it with some JavaScript or in

693
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,779
conjunction with a framework and that

694
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,490
shows that bugs that no one spotted

695
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,649
before if you find them go and log them

696
00:27:04,649 --> 00:27:07,980
that helps everybody and you learn this

697
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,769
great thing when you log bugs you learn

698
00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:13,259
how to make reduce test cases which I

699
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:15,690
believe is a web development superpower

700
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,279
and not enough people are good enough at

701
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,529
doing this it makes your life a lot

702
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:21,869
easier if you learn how to make a reduce

703
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:23,879
test case not just for logging bugs but

704
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:26,129
also fixing problems in your own work

705
00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:28,499
getting good at stripping down problems

706
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:30,450
the simplest case really makes

707
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,610
everything that you do an awful lot

708
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,080
easier and it will help other people to

709
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:42,249
reproduce your bug and to fix it quickly

710
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:44,869
the thing is what I found is that

711
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:48,690
contributing to CSS has been an amazing

712
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,899
way to learn about CSS what I've learned

713
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:54,029
in the last few years following the grid

714
00:27:54,029 --> 00:27:56,159
spec and ultimately becoming part of the

715
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,009
CSS working group has been absolutely

716
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:00,749
amazing and I've been doing this for

717
00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:02,759
twenty years and I feel like I have

718
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:06,869
learned so much yeah I contribute to CSS

719
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:08,340
I spend a lot of time doing free work

720
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,309
essentially for the web platform but I

721
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:13,889
think we're pretty much even because it

722
00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:15,869
gives me so much back in terms of what

723
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:18,240
I've learned as I've done that you know

724
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,559
what I've learned by raising an issue

725
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:21,179
and then having all of the implications

726
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:23,039
of that explained to me you know I

727
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,749
couldn't have got that anywhere else so

728
00:28:24,749 --> 00:28:27,210
I've learned so much by contribution to

729
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:31,009
