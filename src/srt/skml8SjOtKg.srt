[Music]

2
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,869
hi Singapore thank you so I know it's

3
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:21,029
the evening I know you guys saw that at

4
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,130
4:30 the bar opens and I know you guys

5
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,380
are like ready like one more talk later

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,260
that I will have that cocktail but I

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,720
hope you find this useful and I'm pretty

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,239
sure you will if you work on the web how

9
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,940
many people here use the web give me a

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,050
show of hands right everybody does and

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,010
that's why we're here

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,370
because no matter what JavaScript PHP

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,370
Ruby whatever you use even if you use

14
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,980
like cobalt oh right right you everybody

15
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,829
uses Internet and I'm gonna tell you a

16
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,230
little bit about me and I'll tell you

17
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,420
about my use case which might surprise

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,050
you

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,960
so I work for Baker Hughes now you see

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,000
GE over there and we'll be surprised

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,280
Baker uses the oil and gas division of

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,510
GE oil and gas so that that little

23
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,549
gasoline that you put into your Waker

24
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,729
right it's extracted from the earth and

25
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:16,380
do you know what I do on a day-to-day

26
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,530
basis I write code to make sure that oil

27
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,350
is extracted from the earth efficiently

28
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,659
now you might be terrified to think oh

29
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,689
 javascript controls oil extraction

30
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:30,780
javascript controls oil extraction
don't worry it does not it only manages

31
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,329
the visualization of data we made sure

32
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,310
you know we have quality control come on

33
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,060
people so but my point is the web is

34
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,840
everywhere think of any use case any

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,000
single part of your life

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,189
the web is there and somebody has a

37
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,979
website about it somewhere right so

38
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:53,430
let's talk about our users where do your

39
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,340
users come from so if you use the

40
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,290
Internet and I'm hoping everybody here

41
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,299
has some part in creating the Internet

42
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,000
you write it or you create content on

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,770
the internet because you want people to

44
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,840
consume it right am i right yes

45
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,450
so if you want users to consume it where

46
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,830
your users come from

47
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,710
so I was breaking it down and these are

48
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,140
the three highest users around the world

49
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,290
and now we are China and I tried to find

50
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,660
statistics but none of that is valid

51
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,030
because of reason so I'm gonna skip that

52
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,640
and I'm gonna focus on India where I'm

53
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,590
from where I get access to easier

54
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,660
statistics and I'm gonna compare that

55
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,870
with the next largest country per users

56
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,910
which is the USA and I'm going to show

57
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,900
you a gap right so in India we have 1300

58
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,110
million that's 1.3 billion people and

59
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,680
out of that only 45% of India is

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,390
connected to the Internet

61
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,920
right so 45% of 1.3 billion people is

62
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,590
nearly 627 million users and that's

63
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,880
considering the people who use internet

64
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,670
right now let's say look at the USA the

65
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,090
USA has almost 85% connected oh I think

66
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,790
the mic started working only now my bad

67
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,650
and so by the initial the start of how

68
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,660
many users are there we start to see the

69
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,380
gap now this is just a rough draft of

70
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,630
how many the percentage of Internet

71
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,760
penetration so when we say Internet

72
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,830
penetration that's like how many people

73
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,989
use the internet frequently enough to

74
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:33,390
make a dent on the user percentages and

75
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,850
you can see the the places with the

76
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,860
largest number of people when they come

77
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,950
to South Asia or southern Africa right

78
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,500
that's the places with the lowest

79
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,459
penetration of Internet

80
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,950
and let me say lower penetration the

81
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,570
Internet is not going away

82
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,870
that means the lower that number is the

83
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,480
higher is the opportunity for you and

84
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,030
your product to go into those markets

85
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,400
right so if you see that's the

86
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,100
opportunity of people who are I've never

87
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,690
used the internet before and have an

88
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,820
idea or an interest in using the

89
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,700
Internet that's where in the future your

90
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,739
product will be used so how can we make

91
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,959
products that are targeted to those

92
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,620
people right and you see the higher

93
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,720
demographic so you see Canada at 87%

94
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,640
that means a lot of people have seen

95
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,370
what the Internet is like right if they

96
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,750
have any idea of the Internet and

97
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,400
they're happy with the tools that they

98
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,320
already use

99
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,720
but the products they already use what

100
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,830
is the chance that they lose your

101
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,020
product unless yours is a very

102
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,300
well-established product right so you

103
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,790
have competition which is more available

104
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:42,920
so let's look at these markets so the

105
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,810
market saturation of technical products

106
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,340
and this is what I was talking about in

107
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,140
the first world and when I say the first

108
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,210
world I want you to think of places like

109
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,970
Silicon Valley right that's where the

110
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,860
first Google came out of the first

111
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,540
Facebook came out of you know that's

112
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,880
where you think that technology started

113
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,670
from there right and when you come to

114
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,890
India or when you come to South Asia

115
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,110
right Facebook started in the Silicon

116
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,420
Valley and now the highest user base

117
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,450
oopsy-daisy don't mind me

118
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,450
the largest user base is now India so I

119
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,440
read a very interesting statistic that

120
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,460
Facebook right now has in 2016 I believe

121
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,900
it had about 200 million users in the US

122
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,160
and India overtook it in 2016 with 400

123
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,600
million and that was still only when

124
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,730
there was 35 percent of India

125
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,040
connected to the Internet imagine what

126
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,800
that number would be like if 70 percent

127
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,840
of India connected you know can you

128
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,670
imagine that amount of data that

129
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,560
Facebook can collect because that's what

130
00:05:48,560 --> 00:06:00,800
Facebook is thinking about I think so my

131
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,620
goal is to help you think about the

132
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,750
larger picture you know to find out a

133
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,780
great balance in between performance

134
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,370
accessibility and user experience the

135
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,260
big three when it comes to how a person

136
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,020
decides to use your product now first

137
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,420
come will be performance but I'll show

138
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,830
you how performance can actually be it

139
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,020
actually can be helped with

140
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,610
accessibility and user experience you

141
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,470
don't have to compromise between the

142
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,590
three so the first and the easiest

143
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,720
barrier sometimes I feel is

144
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,550
internationalization and I'd like to

145
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,580
bring an example where I checked and I

146
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,800
can't really find that example here but

147
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,969
a very

148
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:44,689
an example internationally this is a

149
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:46,879
very common company right

150
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:49,399
uber is dominant across the world and

151
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,409
you would think that uber would care a

152
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:53,149
little bit more about one of their

153
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:55,759
largest consumer bases because the last

154
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,279
time I checked we were still there is

155
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,349
local grown competition against uber but

156
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:03,110
India is one of the largest markets for

157
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,379
uber now can you tell me if something

158
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:10,039
looks wrong in this picture and I and I

159
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:12,099
highlighted it for your ease

160
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,449
unfortunately my my laser pointer was

161
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:17,119
not working so what I'd like to point

162
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:18,919
out over here is that if you see

163
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:22,099
Lithuania right and I'm not dumping on

164
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:23,779
the thwe near here but I think India is

165
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:26,389
slightly larger number of people and a

166
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:28,969
lot more languages are supported in

167
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:32,749
Lithuania than in India or in countries

168
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:36,079
in in southern Africa which is not good

169
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,449
you know those are large countries with

170
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:40,249
a diverse population with a lot of

171
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:42,949
people who don't speak English right so

172
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:47,149
you want those companies who have large

173
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:49,879
user groups in those areas to cater to

174
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,829
communities in their own language

175
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:55,009
imagine you're somebody who's not

176
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:57,979
technically abled in your family in my

177
00:07:57,979 --> 00:07:59,360
case that's my grandfather

178
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,119
you know the first time my grandfather

179
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:05,059
heard about uber he's like what is this

180
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:07,489
mover why should I trust some guy to

181
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:09,919
pick me up because he has never seen the

182
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,649
internet before you know so when when my

183
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:15,379
brother went to a different city and he

184
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:17,239
my grandfather wanted to go there

185
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:18,979
I'm sure you've all heard of Bangalore

186
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:21,169
so / is very strong in Bangalore my

187
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:22,999
grandfather wanted to go visit my

188
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:25,099
brother in Bangalore and my brother said

189
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:28,129
it's very easy you just opened a bird

190
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:30,439
and then you can you'll be dropped right

191
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:33,110
in front of my apartment and what do you

192
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,939
know my grandfather could not figure out

193
00:08:34,939 --> 00:08:37,250
over in the end he just waited in the

194
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,110
airport for to us and my brother had to

195
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,089
make the trip and if you know Bangalore

196
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:43,849
traffic you know he hated that truth so

197
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:45,829
if we were had worked they would have

198
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:50,740
got to market this is my key point so

199
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,809
for non-native speakers for non-native

200
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:54,680
English speaker

201
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,839
because if you have a larger market or

202
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:00,020
if you have users you know who if you

203
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,270
can change a slight tweak in your

204
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,390
product can help users I don't know why

205
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,310
it's not done so far but this is this

206
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,770
the latest statistic I took maybe three

207
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,770
months back from the uber blog so

208
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,830
enabling native languages it is very

209
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:20,270
important to improve access and it's not

210
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,830
just there are other parts of

211
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,230
accessibility of course but for having

212
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,839
the languages is a different kind of

213
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:28,339
accessibility that maybe you don't think

214
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:30,380
about as much and when it comes to Asia

215
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,630
we know there are different languages at

216
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,000
play and different people at play so I

217
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,190
feel like internationalization is just a

218
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,920
very easy barrier that you can cross to

219
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,480
make your products that much more

220
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,820
interesting for your users and this is

221
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,580
just adding it if you're curious about

222
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,950
how internationalization work it's very

223
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,020
easy you can just add the language code

224
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,200
and most of the time if you have those

225
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,420
characters in Unicode if they should

226
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,770
work and there might be cases where in

227
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,150
specific where a particular language

228
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,160
does not work that's outside of the

229
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,959
scope of my talk it's just this is just

230
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,790
a starting point for you if you are

231
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,830
interested in this so the next story is

232
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,110
is where I really want to focus on going

233
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,140
beyond an iPhone or handling real world

234
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,690
devices now I'm hoping this crowd will

235
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,550
be a bit different but I'm going to ask

236
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,830
how many people here does not have an

237
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,570
iPhone you know your phone is not an

238
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:36,260
iPhone nice nice so I did a version of

239
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,390
this talk in the USA and I was very

240
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,950
disappointed there were maybe two hands

241
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,140
because everybody else had an iPhone but

242
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,029
moving to India you know this is not the

243
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:48,950
case you know a at least the people in

244
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,810
and around Asia would know that the

245
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,730
Chinese manufacturing companies have

246
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,310
pretty much a great market over here you

247
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,589
know if you have a price range and in

248
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,750
India we're kind of price conscious if

249
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,089
you heard about us and if you can get

250
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:04,339
all the features of an iPhone one-tenth

251
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:06,320
the price of an iPhone from a Chinese

252
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,579
company like away you're gonna get

253
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,110
you are a phone and we are going to put

254
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,670
a sticker on top that has an Apple logo

255
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,470
in it and claim it's knife one that's

256
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,189
how we do it honestly I've seen that so

257
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:20,249
many times so three little devices now

258
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:24,420
this is just the phones in my family so

259
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,179
if my phone is not listed because I used

260
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:31,199
my phone to take a photograph but but I

261
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,199
own and oneplus which is again a Chinese

262
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:36,179
manufactured company my mother

263
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:38,999
she is a proud owner of an iPhone my

264
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:41,369
grandfather could not care less like he

265
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:44,699
was he was he has the second phone which

266
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:46,889
is a touchscreen simply because he

267
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:48,839
thought touchscreen was in but he

268
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:50,220
figured out that he could not handle

269
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,689
that screen and he went back to his old

270
00:11:51,689 --> 00:11:54,899
phone anyway and my father again he

271
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:56,489
could not care less about his phone so

272
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:58,019
that so long as it works

273
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:02,220
you know the calling bug so basically

274
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,920
when you when you have the such kind of

275
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,079
devices and more and more people are

276
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:10,170
moving to a sort of standardization when

277
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,089
it comes to such devices you know there

278
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:14,639
are more people moving to an iPhone but

279
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,389
that the quantity of people or the

280
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:20,639
market of an iPhone is still very very

281
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,019
very small in Asia so but if you've ever

282
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:29,189
seen the kind of checks for the sizes of

283
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:32,040
screens that comes up right mostly there

284
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,959
is like a standard list which has a

285
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,629
bunch of Apple devices and maybe if

286
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:39,929
you're lucky a few Nexus or Google

287
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:42,959
pixels are supported but a long list of

288
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,799
other popular devices are not in the

289
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,429
list so you can create a kind of

290
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:53,040
experience on mobile but maybe it's not

291
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,869
supported for the device which is one of

292
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:57,389
the most frequent ones and I think

293
00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:01,949
Xiaomi has one of the largest selling

294
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,959
phones was the company that sells the

295
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,149
most phones in India and I've never seen

296
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:09,779
a Xiaomi aspect ratio ever in Google

297
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:10,439
Chrome

298
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:13,199
in Google Chrome and you check how much

299
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:15,509
your screen can be adjusted so that is a

300
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:19,139
big part and if you have you know if you

301
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,149
are creating a product to be used in

302
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:22,140
phones

303
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,030
have to stress this enough you know

304
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,700
hardware is created on equal you know

305
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,550
forget the screen sizes you can also

306
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,550
have really bad RAM you know you have

307
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,460
really bad expectations of what a device

308
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,620
can do you know how much speed in which

309
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,440
your device can load how much the size

310
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,760
the width and all that is is so hardware

311
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,740
in general if you only gonna create it

312
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,030
for a few specific devices that again

313
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,460
creates a block for your uses you know

314
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,350
please don't do that please think of at

315
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,960
least the top five devices in the market

316
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,370
that you're going into which are being

317
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:03,060
sold and just test for them okay and the

318
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,410
best thing that you can do is to get a

319
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,390
bunch of bang up phones you know with

320
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,310
the screen cracked I'm sure a few of you

321
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,770
here have few screen cracked phones you

322
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,080
know check with those check and see how

323
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,750
well your website does in those and see

324
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,770
what are the results

325
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,750
you know performance wise and

326
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,540
accessibility wise check with unequal

327
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:28,170
devices yeah so if you have seen the

328
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,490
previous slide you've seen what my

329
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,150
grandfather's phone looks like now my

330
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,010
grandfather he owns a bunch of property

331
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,510
because he's the head of the household

332
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,000
and very very recently one of his

333
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,470
friends told him about this website

334
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:45,450
called Airbnb yeah and he wanted me to

335
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,840
load Airbnb in that second phone that

336
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,380
was a task yeah I I thought I could do

337
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,900
it but I found out I couldn't sir and

338
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,450
you would think that a company has well

339
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,630
established a unicorn like a B&B would

340
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,670
care a little bit more and I tried to

341
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,530
take a photo of that but it came up

342
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,780
really bad and I did not want to scar

343
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,190
your eyes with that that's why I did not

344
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,100
put that photo to it but let me tell you

345
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,290
it's just it's so surprising the way

346
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:17,250
things turn out you know so if you are

347
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,680
creating a product for mobile just check

348
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,450
it for the mobiles that are very popular

349
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,960
you know your your average best-selling

350
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,180
Xiaomi and oppa phones should be enough

351
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,340
they would do the trick but go the extra

352
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,760
mile right and

353
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,430
one more thing is I'd like to talk about

354
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,090
using JavaScript frameworks now all of

355
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,370
us know some cool JavaScript framework

356
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,430
or the other I'm pretty sure a lot of

357
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,110
you know about a JavaScript framework

358
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,870
that I've never heard of before I've

359
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,430
recently heard is roguelike there are

360
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,680
some JavaScript frameworks that last

361
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,350
less than a milk product it's probably

362
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:59,340
true so if you have a latest and the

363
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,990
greatest JavaScript framework that you

364
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,060
have to try out I again would like you

365
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,400
to go to the same rule build your

366
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,380
website in that JavaScript framework and

367
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,660
then see how much time it takes to load

368
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,480
on a crappy phone maybe it works well on

369
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,580
an iPhone but please do not let the

370
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,520
iPhone be your benchmark please run it

371
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,470
on something with less than 2 GB of RAM

372
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,890
and see how well your mobile website

373
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,320
performs on that phone because the

374
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,840
majority of users who use the Internet

375
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,600
are coming in from mobile this is

376
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,970
especially true if you run a website

377
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,300
that has video in it now from my

378
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,390
understanding and my research most users

379
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,280
who connect through mobile internet

380
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,140
especially in local languages

381
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,300
non-english languages they try to access

382
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,330
video so if you have a video loading

383
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,810
element try to make it as performant as

384
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,770
possible for the lower ram mobile phones

385
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,320
because that is where your demographic

386
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,600
is what would your demographic is trying

387
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,640
to access that's what they want the most

388
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,949
speed for and that is where you're

389
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:07,980
letting them down solo now if you have

390
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,949
great performance on mobile for video

391
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:13,980
excellent and I'm at the risk of

392
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,170
violating the code of conduct I tell you

393
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,910
a model that you should definitely be

394
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,220
following that spawn hub if you have

395
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,579
ever tried to use that in mobile in

396
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:25,949
Indians mobile data you would know what

397
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:27,209
I am talking about and some people are

398
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:28,290
laughing because I know you have tried

399
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,440
it you know because if you have ever

400
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,560
used that mobile website they know who

401
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,600
their audience is and that's a very

402
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,660
performant website on a really crappy 2g

403
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,790
data you should

404
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,190
and that leads into oh no the Wi-Fi the

405
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,720
third story that I would like to tell

406
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,890
you so if the definition of Wi-Fi in

407
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:58,630
India is 10 Mbps to 30 300 Mbps that's

408
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,790
the actual so you see that this slightly

409
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:05,050
a bit of a variation and this I actually

410
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,420
I was surprised that there was three in

411
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,130
my mind I thought book that would be one

412
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,570
but surprisingly it's three so I

413
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,030
instinctively I knew that no matter what

414
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,460
the definition for Wi-Fi was was still

415
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,730
pretty bad and you think about it we

416
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,100
have 1.3 billion people crammed into one

417
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,470
small location on the map you know so

418
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,809
definitely if you have Wi-Fi connection

419
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:31,000
your family is taking it your neighbors

420
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,650
are probably taking it and then the

421
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,390
neighbors below you are also taking it

422
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,850
so that's the reason why it's so slow

423
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,290
because so many people are trying to

424
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:42,370
access your 13.5 Mbps connection that's

425
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,190
the fact now add this with the previous

426
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,980
point about how again the phones are

427
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,990
small they don't have RAM and they can't

428
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,780
use your website now you realize why

429
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,880
your website performance is so important

430
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,980
you know because that's the kind of

431
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,980
scenario you are in so not only is the

432
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,850
device playing against you but

433
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,650
infrastructure in general right the

434
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,290
amount of network poles around your

435
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,870
location the amount of bandwidth

436
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,929
available for your users to use because

437
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:15,880
at the end of the day if your website

438
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,850
does not load you know then it's not

439
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,030
good now I've not already included it

440
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:26,740
here but I do have a very and I did not

441
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,850
include it here because I don't want

442
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,150
Microsoft suing me but if you ever try

443
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,590
to load LinkedIn in India in 2g you

444
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,660
should try it it's an experience where

445
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,220
after 30 seconds you give up and you're

446
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,020
like I don't need a resume I don't need

447
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,800
a job anymore

448
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,500
I'm not opening LinkedIn that's that's

449
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,179
what happens so so how does your website

450
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:54,130
perform in 3g 2g or in those h+ i don't

451
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,809
know if anybody here has gotten an h+

452
00:19:55,809 --> 00:19:58,160
ever i get it time to time

453
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,350
these days less frequently thankfully

454
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,299
I'm from a part of India that's blessed

455
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:04,640
with more network connections but the

456
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,500
more you go to a rural area you're going

457
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,710
to see your s + and - geez so how does

458
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,260
your website perform in those lower

459
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,549
bandwidth so again if you use one of the

460
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,039
major browsers there's probably a

461
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,110
network throttling option for you to

462
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,850
check this I'm sure most of you do this

463
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,370
but I advise you to do that again

464
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,500
you know just cover your bases and make

465
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,890
sure that your product has a fallback so

466
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,799
uber which I mentioned earlier even

467
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,120
though the internationalisation is

468
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,400
pretty bad they have a an app called

469
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,950
uber light in India and that actually

470
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,780
works what they did is they took out the

471
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,480
map which actually choked down most of

472
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,490
the data in over so you can't see the

473
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,110
map where the little car goes around

474
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:52,039
Hulu you know you have to guess whether

475
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:55,730
car is divine it oh it's probably there

476
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,690
but it works you know it actually loads

477
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,450
in real time so what if the map does not

478
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,760
exist you know whoever works that's good

479
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,520
at h+ that's pretty good

480
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,429
you know so so test your website on

481
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:16,039
crappy phones with slow speeds if you if

482
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,690
you forget everything else from this

483
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,870
talk this is the most important sentence

484
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,909
for you today please test your website

485
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:25,940
on really crappy phones with really slow

486
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,679
speeds that's the only thing you have to

487
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,780
do to make sure that your product works

488
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,350
in Asia you know if that happens then

489
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,090
your product at least from a technical

490
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:39,480
standpoint you have covered your grounds

491
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,039
so how can I simplify my website now I

492
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,419
know what the problem is how do I fix it

493
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:48,620
minimum number of downloads on the first

494
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,760
click now this is basic performance

495
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,610
stuff you know the amount of libraries

496
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,309
videos images all that you download in

497
00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:57,620
the first click that is a huge drag on

498
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,130
what the first paint or the what user

499
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,100
sees first so if you can minimize the

500
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,919
number of downloads excellent if you

501
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:09,110
know that click is coming up and you can

502
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,570
preload parts of it again excellent

503
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,019
the biggest garbage of video that comes

504
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:17,479
in you know what chokes in your data the

505
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:20,509
most in any website or in any

506
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:23,690
application is video if you can optimize

507
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,269
your video and images you know it's

508
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:28,580
nothing like it it's the best way to

509
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,840
make your product faster now if I don't

510
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,909
know if somebody has covered SVG again

511
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:36,619
over here but I'm pretty sure there's a

512
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:39,200
great talk by una Kravitz and the last

513
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,570
J's conversation about SVG which I

514
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,729
suggest everybody check out because if

515
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:46,159
you can use SVG's instead of your images

516
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,039
again a great part in optimizing your

517
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:54,289
websites and a little bit more about

518
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,749
user experience because I feel that's

519
00:22:56,749 --> 00:22:58,759
one of the most important parts you know

520
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:01,159
at the end of the day no matter how well

521
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:03,349
built your product is you know how much

522
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,330
the engineering team likes it if your

523
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,460
user does not like your product and what

524
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,320
good is it you know at the end of the

525
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,320
day the product comes as what the user

526
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,840
likes it to be know how well we build it

527
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,149
is based on what marketing tells us that

528
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:19,639
what the users like right so let's make

529
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:22,279
marketing happy with a little bit bonus

530
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:25,789
point so this is something I like to add

531
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:28,460
and this is something of some from my

532
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,830
personal experience like I said my

533
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,690
grandfather was very adventurous and it

534
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,849
comes technology and this happened the

535
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:37,879
first time that he opened up his gmail

536
00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:40,070
account now he was very worried that he

537
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,690
would not understand what Gmail is and

538
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:42,590
how to navigate it

539
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,570
but thankfully the gods of Google have

540
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,519
decided that a lot of people don't know

541
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:48,590
what Gmail is so they have a little bit

542
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,489
of a demo happening and there are a few

543
00:23:51,489 --> 00:23:54,109
great applications which has this kind

544
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:56,179
of a demo feature and I really like it

545
00:23:56,179 --> 00:23:58,820
and I'd like to stress that if you're

546
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,830
creating a product for the Asian market

547
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,229
you know for people who have never used

548
00:24:03,229 --> 00:24:05,840
the internet before the demo is a pretty

549
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,779
good way to go you know because if you

550
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:11,419
are looking for an a group of people who

551
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:14,809
have never seen the Internet right so

552
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:18,229
imagine this there are people who'd see

553
00:24:18,229 --> 00:24:20,210
the Save button we've never seen a

554
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,220
floppy disk before and they and they

555
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,679
identify a floppy disk as oh this is the

556
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:25,040
3d

557
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,960
another image of a save button you know

558
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,270
it's pretty much the same thing for for

559
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,100
our elders when they see the Internet

560
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,310
right so they have no reference point to

561
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,990
this they've never seen anything like

562
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,120
the internet before so when they see a

563
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,370
hamburger button for the first time for

564
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,080
example they don't know what to do with

565
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,910
it they don't know that just clicking it

566
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,250
would open up the menu right so if you

567
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,590
have a like a a small arrow pointing to

568
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,530
it telling you hey click this it opens

569
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,710
up the menu that's good for you users so

570
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:58,220
based on what the target demographic is

571
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,590
I would suggest that you at least have

572
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,450
at least from the first load or the

573
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,490
first time a user signs in you have like

574
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,500
a little demo mode showing them what

575
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,960
each of the things does and that really

576
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:17,090
helps and it helps to explain the major

577
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,660
moving parts of and one more thing I'd

578
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,880
like to add probably again a bonus point

579
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,520
is that there are people at least in

580
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,500
India where I come from there are people

581
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,930
who are illiterate right so they're

582
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,400
people even if you write it in their

583
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,080
native language they're not good at

584
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,240
reading right so if you can have icons

585
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,060
explain sorry if you can have icons or

586
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,010
some kind of drawings that explain what

587
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,680
it does without having to read it now

588
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,050
text is important in some cases but

589
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,400
having a good eye can makes its

590
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,620
difference too so I'd like to stress

591
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,440
that having that a little bit of a bonus

592
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,570
user experience wise showing people

593
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,220
where things are done it really helps

594
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,690
for the older generation or people who

595
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,480
are just not used to technology

596
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:08,180
so in summary or yes only five more

597
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,640
minutes left so in summary what are the

598
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,170
things that you have to do to make your

599
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:15,350
websites better for a new user group is

600
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,120
nationalisation of your website which

601
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,640
means supporting different languages

602
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,550
maybe the major languages of any market

603
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,950
or any demographic that you hoping to

604
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,610
attract optimize it for like

605
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,960
non-standard aspect non-standard

606
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,360
aspect ratios I'd like to stress upon

607
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,820
that eloquently in the resid test your

608
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,830
website on crappy phones with slow

609
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,240
speeds that's

610
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,290
and for slow speeds have fallbacks when

611
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,940
you have slow internet make sure your

612
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,250
app does something instead of breaking

613
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,130
into a small broken image you know I

614
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,800
could and that's it

615
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,380
that is me on the interwebs you can

616
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,150
probably find me somewhere around for

617
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,130
the next two days and I hope this has
