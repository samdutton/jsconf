trust me I'm a professional so look uh

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,099
sadly I don't have any any code to show

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,049
you which honestly like makes me cry a

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,550
little bit on the inside there's nothing

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,949
more nothing I like more than then live

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,840
coding but I do have an interesting talk

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,460
that I hope you're all going to like but

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,990
I want to start it off with a magic

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,510
trick and actually need your

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,310
participation I need everybody here to

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,070
pull out their mobile phone and

14
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,149
presumably if you're using something

15
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,040
other than a motorola razr there will be

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,050
a calculator application on your mobile

17
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,420
phone so just go ahead and pull that out

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,460
and all we're going to do is I'm going

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,500
to ask you a bunch of questions that are

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,030
going to generate unique numbers for you

21
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,469
and I want we're going to add those

22
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,000
numbers together on the calculator and

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,200
I'm going to participate it right so I'm

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,340

with you on this journey so the first

26
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,969
thing I want you to do is think of a

27
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:56,760
very important moment in your life it

28
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,469
can be any kind of moment but something

29
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,690
that is incredibly and deeply meaningful

30
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,680
for you for me I became a father in 2010

31
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,630

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,060
before the end of the year it's however

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,530
old you're going to be before the end of

43
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,119
the year so go ahead and type that in

44
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,869
and press + now I want you to type in

45
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,579
the integer value of the current month

46
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,790
so October is 10 November's 11 type in

47
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,710
the integer value for December and hit

48
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,149
plus now whatever the number of your

49
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,799
mobile phone is I want you to think of

50
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,869
the last four digits of that number and

51
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,579
i want you to enter it in i have to kind

52
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,890
of think it think it through but ok yes

the year you were born I was born a

55
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,630
really long time ago i'm not going to

56
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,469
say it out loud I'm and hit plus and

57
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:09,479
lastly that really meaningful event in

58
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,400
your life whatever year it took place

59
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,599
just think how many years it's been

60
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,489
since that really important moment and

61
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:19,120
type it in and hit plus so I've got a

62
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,849
number hopefully you all have numbers I

63
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:24,849
would wager that they are all unique and

64
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:27,220
now I would like you to simply compose a

65
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,870
text message to the number that you see

66
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,250
on the screen I'll go ahead and read it

67
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:36,879
out 97 95 89 55 55 and ask the question

68
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,069
the very pertinent question what is my

69
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:41,560
number and I will go ahead and play

70
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,819
along myself what is my number okay cool

71
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:49,569
and hit Send now hopefully if everything

72
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,190
is working you'll get a response back

73
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,889
and you know compare that response to

74
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:54,879
the number that's in your calculator

75
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,859
okay now look if you know how this trick

76
00:02:56,859 --> 00:02:59,319
works keep it to yourself you know for

77
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,750
at least the next 20 minutes but if you

78
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,450
don't know how it works you know how do

79
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,040
you feel right now do you feel surprised

80
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,049
do you feel a little bit of are you

81
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:09,909
astonished you know do you have a

82
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:12,250
feeling of wonder well I want you to

83
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,530
hold on to those feelings because that's

84
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,440
exactly how I feel that open source I

85
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,720
love this I love that I love that so

86
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,480
much open source is magic or at least it

87
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,879
evokes the same feelings to me for me

88
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:30,340
that magic does every time I go to the

89
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,419
console and I type in NPM install I take

90
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:36,010
a moment to think about the fact that

91
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,989
I've got over a hundred thousand things

92
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:40,690
that I could install and that's because

93
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,349
of open source we are all building

94
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:48,129
amazing things on the shoulders of other

95
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:50,049
people and frankly they in turn are

96
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:52,299
building their things on top of yet

97
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,030
other people and this is a this is a

98
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,299
remarkable world that we live in I'm not

99
00:03:58,299 --> 00:03:59,470
entirely sure everyone in the node

100
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,840
community is sufficiently appreciative

101
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,569
or grateful of the remarkable ecosystem

102
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:08,470
that we operate in but I know I am this

103
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,739
past October a wonderful woman by the

104
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:13,540
name of Lena Reinhart gave a talk on

105
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,479
open source at jas confi you it was

106
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,130
about the future of open source if you

107
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,620
haven't seen this talk go to the JSP you

108
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,050
website all the videos are posted feel

109
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,190
free to watch it I thought it was

110
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,510
wonderful

111
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,250
and you know she reminded me that you

112
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,990
know virtually every transformative

113
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,120
technology that we all take for granted

114
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,730
at least in the past 10 to 20 years is

115
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,210
built on top of open source so you know

116
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,850
open source really is magical now I'm

117
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,710
going to kind of take a left turn I'm

118
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,850
going to get away from software i'm

119
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,020
going to talk about community and

120
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,810
community and that the IRL sense right

121
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,760
the in real life like right here like

122
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,210
we're all in the same room I got my

123
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,940
start in community back in January of

124
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,920
2012 that's when i joined twilio as a

125
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,680
developer evangelist i had never been a

126
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,020
developer evangelist before i had really

127
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,490
hadn't the foggiest notion what the job

128
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,330
entails it sounded pretty cool so I dove

129
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,200
in and for me I discovered very rapidly

130
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,890
that a massive component of my job was

131
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,330
going to be to support my local

132
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,950
developer community now I don't know if

133
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,710
I mentioned it but I live in Seattle but

134
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,050
I had a lot of agency in defining what

135
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,670
those words actually meant like what was

136
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,890
local like for me local wasn't just

137
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,630
Seattle like I wanted to make a

138
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,970
difference in Seattle and other

139
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,160
communities in the Pacific Northwest so

140
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,660
that includes obviously portland oregon

141
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,660
and vancouver british columbia and like

142
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,580
support right like I don't there are

143
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,230
many many ways you can support a

144
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,910
community and I had to kind of decide

145
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,920
for myself or figure out for myself what

146
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,410
that was going to be and by the end of

147
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,150
the year me and some really remarkable

148
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,580
people in that community put on a

149
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,800
conference called Cascadia jess and you

150
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,420
saw some hands go up and you've seen

151
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,770
some pretty awesome hoodies around the

152
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,670
room and yeah the Cascadia jess is a

153
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,830
conference for web developers that takes

154
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,410
place in the Pacific Northwest and we

155
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,380
put this on in November of 2012 and it's

156
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,850
just I love looking at this photo

157
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,570
because I have a lot of special memories

158
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,520
that came out of this event but also i'd

159
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,630
love to see the people right i mean

160
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,090
there's there's what Rick Waldron you

161
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,680
know minus the beard this is what I used

162
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,740
to look like there's a Dominic denticola

163
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,230
looking actually exactly the same after

164
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:31,180
three years ago oh wait there's a here

165
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,710
the guy that you didn't see today

166
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,540
there's Dominic tar he's right there

167
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,940
he's not here right now he's I guess he

168
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,620
got tear-gassed or something

169
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,930
anyway but you know this event was

170
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,520
special for me for a lot of reasons but

171
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,040
mostly because it made very tangible and

172
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,800
real my ability to make a difference in

173
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,570
a community it took something that was

174
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,720
abstract and made it real but the last

175
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,610
couple years I've had this nagging

176
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,020
question in my head like why aren't more

177
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:00,250
people doing this and it's been it's

178
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,320
very perplexing for me right because you

179
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,290
know I I get so much joy and pleasure

180
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,040
and satisfaction out of contributing to

181
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,970
the community and working on these

182
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,010
things but at the same time I go to all

183
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,050
these events and I just see a lot of the

184
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,580
same faces and a lot of the same people

185
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,530
it's almost like a click and it's

186
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,479
bizarre I don't understand why more

187
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:21,520
developers and more people aren't

188
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,289
getting more involved in the community

189
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:25,419
like the developer community in general

190
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:27,789
is growing you know like an exponential

191
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:29,680
rate right but i don't i don't believe

192
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,030
that the community of organizers is

193
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,470
growing as fast so this is very

194
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,870
perplexing for me and i think it's

195
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,130
actually like it's not just perplexing

196
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,880
it's incredibly problematic so i did you

197
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,500
know what any person does who sort of

198
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,210
cares about you know being data-driven i

199
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,060
sent out a survey to a lot of developers

200
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,580
that either i knew personally or whose

201
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,039
work I respected and it's very simple

202
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,990
survey it's like you know tell me about

203
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,130
how you involved you are in the

204
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,570
community tell me some things that you

205
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,070
like about being involved tell me some

206
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,120
things that you don't like about being

207
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,650
involved I wanted and I made sure I

208
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,880
didn't I didn't send the survey to

209
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,740
anybody who is an evangelist I just

210
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,930
wanted to talk to developers whose

211
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,360
community activities are not their

212
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,520
primary job and I got a lot of really

213
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,930
interesting responses and I asked for

214
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,150
permission to share some of them so

215
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,880
Justin Meyer I think you can read this

216
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,560
and you'll probably not your heads right

217
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,660
i mean this is this is something that's

218
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,210
unfortunate about both online community

219
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,539
and offline community but it's really

220
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:28,000
it's really it's really sad for me how

221
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,120
many people repeated that kind of a

222
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,589
comment because I feel like we've made a

223
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:34,419
lot of progress I think things are there

224
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,159
are I thought I thought there were fewer

225
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,229
assholes out there but maybe I'm maybe

226
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:40,120
there aren't maybe there aren't fewer

227
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,419
enough and I think I myself have

228
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:46,420
underestimated how how how much of a

229
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,130
barrier this can be for people wanting

230
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,779
to get involved

231
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,490
another comment which is actually really

232
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,439
interesting for me was from brenna

233
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:58,029
O'Brien is she here which is this was

234
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:00,839
really interesting for me because

235
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,399
because I don't consider myself to be an

236
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:05,439
intimidating person and I don't consider

237
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:07,480
the Cascadia Jazz community to be an

238
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,430
intimidating community but I have to

239
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,999
deal with the fact that I don't I may

240
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:15,189
not be I mean clearly not have any idea

241
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:17,259
like what is intimidating to other

242
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:20,199
people and this and this is this is this

243
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:21,430
was I'm really glad she shared this

244
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,709
because I think it's entirely possible

245
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:26,620
that despite my desire and my

246
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,240
community's desire to be approachable

247
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,579
we're not working hard enough so it's

248
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:32,199
really really good to hear that but

249
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:33,160
there was still a problem that I

250
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,720
couldn't figure out like why did I feel

251
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,430
so removed from this so those barriers

252
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,129
were like in or you know difficult

253
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:41,709
dispute but nonetheless like I myself

254
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:43,509
had overcome them like I do all this

255
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:47,230
stuff and so why did I feel so

256
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,209
personally removed from these problems

257
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:50,920
that other people were voicing it is not

258
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,720
because I'm special i promise you i'm

259
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,269
the least special person here so it's

260
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:56,889
all right so i had a real real sort of

261
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:58,990
you know a question about like why you

262
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,250
know why you know why i was having such

263
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,199
a different experience than others so in

264
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:03,129
order to answer that question let's

265
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:04,660
let's take that a right turn right back

266
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,120
into open source and let's talk about

267
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,009
something called a community of practice

268
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,079
so this is something that came up in

269
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:13,569
Lena's talk and there's a wonderful

270
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:16,750
ebook called the open-source way that

271
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,439
was written by the community

272
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:19,959
architecture team at Red Hat and they

273
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:22,269
talk about communities of practice so

274
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:24,189
this was popularized by a theorist and

275
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:27,189
attend winger and essentially a

276
00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:29,050
community of practice you can read what

277
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,759
it is but the people at Red Hat feel

278
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:33,129
that the open-source way is just sort of

279
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:34,929
in an instance or an instantiation of

280
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:37,120
this larger idea of a community of

281
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,240
practice and in fact all professions are

282
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,399
ultimately can be thought of as a

283
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,589
community of practice and the ideas and

284
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:46,360
the communities of practice are just a

285
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,829
theory of social learning so you can

286
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:50,800
even go back to hunter-gatherers and you

287
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,769
can talk about how they learned to hunt

288
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:56,410
and gather among each other as a

289
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,750
community of practice and the reason I

290
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,490
bring this up to you is that if every

291
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,170
profession is a community of power can

292
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,800
be thought of as a community of

293
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,779
this then my profession can be thought

294
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:07,310
of as a community of practice like

295
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,709
evangelism or advocacy or develop

296
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:11,720
developer relations I apologize for the

297
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,660
word its kind of polarizing but I really

298
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,950
thought back like about what I've been

299
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,750
doing over the last three years and when

300
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,920
I really took stock of what I've been

301
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,990
doing it's kind of remarkable I've

302
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,820
probably been to over a hundred events

303
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,370
in the past three years I've met some of

304
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,529
the brightest and best event organizers

305
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:29,870
in the world I've met some of the worst

306
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,320
event organizers in the world I've seen

307
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,930
what works and I've seen what doesn't

308
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,910
work and I think I take for granted like

309
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,700
how what the insane amount of learning

310
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,290
that that I've experienced over this

311
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,510
time in addition I'm not alone I'm on a

312
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,420
team of a dozen other evangelists at

313
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,579
twilio who are having the same kinds of

314
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:52,550
experiences at the same pace and our

315
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,560
team has this culture of writing

316
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,350
everything down we write down everything

317
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,600
and we share it amongst the team either

318
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,850
in the form of email or updating a wiki

319
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,500
or what-have-you right there's this

320
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,360
culture of learning and sharing and I

321
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,829
you know it was sort of staggering to

322
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,170
really think about it and you know I

323
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,149
don't know how many of you read Michaels

324
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:15,770
blog post on creating a better note

325
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,390
community but this this part really

326
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:20,149
stuck out for me right you know because

327
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:21,740
when you make it clear and obvious what

328
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,390
people can do they'll do it well the

329
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,070
inverse is that when you don't make it

330
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,120
clear and you don't make it obvious

331
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,790
people won't do it like you are when you

332
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,010
don't write things down you are creating

333
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,130
either explicit or implicit barriers for

334
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,760
people to contribute to your community

335
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,500
which it's so obvious when you when you

336
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,270
when you think about it but you know

337
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,459
it's shocking how resistant people are

338
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:44,750
to writing things down this comes up

339
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,640
with codes of conduct I can't tell you

340
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,410
how many people have told me that they

341
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,000
don't need a code of conduct because

342
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,980
they're cool and they're organizers are

343
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,480
cool and everybody's cool and why do we

344
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,100
have to write it down happens all the

345
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,800
time super frustrating so we have a lot

346
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,899
of work to do and that's exactly what i

347
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:02,779
want to do you know with the spare time

348
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:05,480
that I have moving forward like I want

349
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,510
to you know i'm not the best developer

350
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,329
or engineer you know in this room but i

351
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:13,370
have i've learned a lot about community

352
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,199
over the last few years and i want to

353
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:16,430
start writing it down and that's what I

354
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,180
mean

355
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,060
open sourcing community publishing the

356
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,570
processes procedures and policies around

357
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,460
community events and this has already

358
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,750
started to happen I mean I'm certainly

359
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,550
not getting up here and you know

360
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,230
pounding my fist about we need to start

361
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,000
from scratch like it's not true chris

362
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,160
williams i'm the founder of JS comp you

363
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,720
know he wrote a blog post years ago i

364
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,600
think about how to run a jay s comp so

365
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,060
people have started to do this and in

366
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,580
bits and pieces but i think we need to

367
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,940
grossly accelerate the process for

368
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,900
Cascadia jess i started working on a

369
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,880
document about how to run an event

370
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,670
exactly like cascade ajs it's you know

371
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,500
it's up on our github repo it's very

372
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,450
incomplete it needs so much more work

373
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,730
but it's an order of magnitude more

374
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,770
detailed than Chris's blog post I mean

375
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,200
it gets into like really you know tough

376
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,570
questions like finances and sponsors and

377
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,250
speaker wrangling and stuff like that

378
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,500
like this is just stuff that this is

379
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,540
stuff that that is not written down

380
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,800
anywhere because I had to learn it

381
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,920
myself usually through incredibly you

382
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,230
know long tedious conversations too used

383
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,960
to other people you know like with

384
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,340
people like Michael and Chris you know

385
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,840
just sort of begging them to teach me

386
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,640
but I think we need to document more of

387
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,090
the stuff I was thrilled to discover a

388
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:35,960
node school a few months ago and I can't

389
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,050
believe how far they've come since sort

390
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,090
of creating this concept and I have to

391
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,770
believe that part of the reason that

392
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,110
it's grown as fast as it has is because

393
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,610
should you go to the website and click

394
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,170
on that little host button on the right

395
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,960
there is an incredibly thoughtful right

396
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,600
up on exactly how you can create a

397
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,870
chapter right like that like tweet me at

398
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,150
max Ogden and I'll like we'll talk on

399
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,940
the phone like no like serious and if

400
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,250
you've ever helped do a node school

401
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,500
meeting you've either attended or you've

402
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:12,639
helped host we stand up

403
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:18,690
give yourself a round of applause and I

404
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,220
but I think like once again like it

405
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,319
there are other things that are that I

406
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:23,699
think are actually just as cool as notes

407
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:25,560
cool but they they weren't as thoughtful

408
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,139
about making it clear how people can

409
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:29,670
participate and because of that they

410
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,470
they have their nichy and they haven't

411
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,720
grown so this is it's obvious but not

412
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,610
enough people do it and I'm glad that

413
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,579
that note school is doing it and you

414
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:41,100
know the last thing and this is

415
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,769
something I'm I'm sad about like how to

416
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:45,449
contribute right like this is

417
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:48,329
open-source 101 right like if you have

418
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:49,680
an open source project and you don't and

419
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,880
you don't have a contributing dot

420
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,800
markdown file you know shame on you

421
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,990
write like that is that's just so basic

422
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,360
but i think i think events need

423
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,829
something like this and i'm not going to

424
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:00,720
pretend to be super prescriptive or have

425
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,120
the answers but I'm we're starting to

426
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,100
think about this for Cascadia j/s right

427
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,569
like if you want to contribute to

428
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:08,279
cascade ajs I don't want you to feel

429
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,100
like you have to be friends with me or

430
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,269
you have to have a relationship with me

431
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:13,740
or one of the other organizers like

432
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,899
there should be a more transparent path

433
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,209
to contributing to an event that is not

434
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:20,459
my event it's it's the community's event

435
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,290
so we've started to write some of these

436
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,230
things down and you know I hope to get

437
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,880
feedback on what we're doing but I'll

438
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,889
walk you through some of them the first

439
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:30,449
thing is just be super explicit about

440
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:32,100
setting expectations like in written

441
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,319
form tell people clearly like what are

442
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:35,850
the amazing things about contributing to

443
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,709
a conference but be honest about the

444
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:39,750
things that are tough and aren't super

445
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,360
great be explicit about what you need

446
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,550
help with this was taught to me by Alex

447
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,980
Sexton you know he said like it is so

448
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,620
stupid when in this this applies to all

449
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,120
kinds of events but like if you run a

450
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,819
meet-up if you just sort of put your you

451
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:55,649
put sent an email out and say hey I need

452
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,389
help with the meetup like don't be

453
00:16:57,389 --> 00:16:59,759
surprised if nobody responds to you but

454
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,290
if you do send an email out saying I

455
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,240
need help and specifically I need

456
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,429
someone to help videotape the meetups

457
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:08,490
like you'd be amazed at the people who

458
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,630
will be able to who will think to

459
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,760
themselves oh I know how to do that I

460
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,860
will now help you have to be explicit

461
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,400
about what you need help with facilitate

462
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,959
conversation as much as possible this is

463
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,270
tough like I literally just discovered

464
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,280
get er like a month ago kind of

465
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,920
late adopter but you know I think it's

466
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,000
important i think more conversation and

467
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,090
communication needs to be done in places

468
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,100
that are sort of publicly accessible so

469
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,470
that maybe even before someone is sure

470
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,670
whether or not they want to contribute

471
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,680
to your event they can kind of lurk and

472
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,720
just sort of get a feel for what kind of

473
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,130
community you are and what kind of

474
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,520
people you are and what you care about

475
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,660
encourage people as much as possible to

476
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,340
document and share their experiences I

477
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,100
was very happy when I went to the node

478
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,300
school page that on that host page is a

479
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,150
link of tons of write-ups from other

480
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:03,230
organizers about their experiences right

481
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,220
people sometimes people make the mistake

482
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,810
of thinking that everything has to be

483
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,520
canonical like this is not true like

484
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,260
everyone has their own reasons for

485
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,300
wanting to do a node school or their

486
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,040
their own experiences doing it they're

487
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,780
all different right and it's useful for

488
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,400
someone thinking about getting involved

489
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,080
to be able to read through all of those

490
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,670
things and create a fuller picture of

491
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,820
what's going on you know and lastly you

492
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,920
know a clear code of conduct code of

493
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,690
conduct aren't just for events at least

494
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,730
I don't think they are I think as we

495
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,740
start to as Cascadia gist or to

496
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,680
incorporate more people that we that we

497
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,210
don't have personal relationships with I

498
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,980
think we need to be super clear about

499
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,530
like what kind of conduct is expected

500
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,780
not just at the conference but you know

501
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,420
leading up to it and the last door I

502
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,770
want to share with you on so this is

503
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,380
Doug McKenzie he's a magician he did not

504
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,730
teach me the magic trick I showed you

505
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,580
figured it out all by myself but he has

506
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,260
a magician I met him about a month ago

507
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,880
he's an incredibly thoughtful person

508
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,620
he's also a developer so he's like a

509
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,960
magician / developer and he might be

510
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,360
like literally the only one in the world

511
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,440
he's also an incredibly thoughtful guy

512
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,410
and I was talking to Doug about open

513
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:13,590
source and he he had this to share he he

514
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,260
believed he knows that he couldn't have

515
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,570
become a magician without the generosity

516
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,050
of many other magicians kind of sharing

517
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,640
them some tips and some tricks and some

518
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,990
methods right but in that community

519
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,040
there's also the realization that

520
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,380
oftentimes like your secrets are your

521
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,210
livelihood there how you earn a living

522
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,240
so there's this tension between

523
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,490
wanting to share more but also wanting

524
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,950
to you know to pay the mortgage and i

525
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,720
think that you know i think that i think

526
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,480
india in the community event space

527
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,700
there's a similar dynamic there are

528
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,850
event organizers myself included who

529
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,440
feel like there's a little bit of magic

530
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,020
in the experiences that we create and

531
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,600
there's a little bit of reticence you

532
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,400
know to share the secrets because we

533
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,170
feel that's that's what makes our event

534
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,360
magical but uh but i think that we have

535
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,429
to we all have to reserve resist that

536
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:06,900
urge and share as much as we possibly

537
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,809
can because you know ultimately you know

538
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,150
community is magic right like i could

539
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,130
not have created cascade ejs if not for

540
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,600
the generosity of people like Michael

541
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,929
and chris williams and you know magical

542
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:20,910
things happen at these events this is a

543
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,220
picture of my daughter Catherine hanging

544
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,260
out to Rebecca Murphy and like I don't

545
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,030
know if she remembers this Ted of

546
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,500
experience or not but maybe she does

547
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,480
maybe that's why she grows up to be a

548
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,160
computer scientist someday like I don't

549
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,990
know right but I know that we need to

550
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,510
enable more people more kinds of people

551
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,490
to create and contribute to community

552
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,140
events because that's the only way that

553
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,490
we can sure that our ensure that our

554
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,340
community has a vibrant future right not

555
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,710
just for me and not just for you but for

556
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,110
the people who are coming later so I

557
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,900
hope you all will help me with this and

558
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,550
