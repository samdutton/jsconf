10
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:28,570
morning everyone and welcome I hope

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,219
everyone had a good first day of talks

12
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:32,920
and an even better day yesterday so just

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,750
on unwind relax my name is Bernie and

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,980
we're both software developers at a

15
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,899
company called geotab which is based out

16
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:43,450
of Toronto the side of our talk today is

17
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,110
called the loader is a lie and whether

18
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,210
you hate them or whether you love them

19
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,810
we see loaders every day in web pages on

20
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,300
our mobile devices you know even when I

21
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,280
was at the airport printing off my

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,899
boarding pass the little machine had a

23
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:01,350
little you know spinning airplane there

24
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,149
everywhere

25
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:06,970
anyways the main problem with with

26
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,100
loaders is that they're just transparent

27
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,979
liars and that's the that's the basis of

28
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:17,200
our talk today so just a quick outline

29
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,979
we're gonna go through an introduction

30
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,510
the history of loading spinners if you

31
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,430
will

32
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,420
programs associated the problems

33
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,799
associated with them and some

34
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,110
improvements that we can make on loading

35
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,270
spinners and finally we'll run through a

36
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:38,140
couple demos so before we get into the

37
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,240
heart of this talk I just want explain

38
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,240
who geotab is and what we do geotab is a

39
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,229
telematics or jus top is a global leader

40
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:50,020
in the telematics space for those of you

41
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,420
who don't know what telematics is it's

42
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,970
the connecting of vehicles so your cars

43
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:58,150
trucks semis etc and reporting where

44
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,119
they are and what they're doing we

45
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,500
currently have more than 1.2 million

46
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,140
vehicles driving around the world every

47
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,220
day and those 1.2 million vehicles are

48
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,549
generating more than 3 billion raw data

49
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,989
records on a on a day to day basis so as

50
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:20,739
you can see from the map we have no

51
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:24,130
shortage of GPS points and I think it's

52
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:24,760
suffice to say

53
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,459
we collect a lot of data we also have

54
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:29,560
the richest telematics data set in the

55
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,680
world and in addition to GPS we also

56
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,959
collect stuff you know such as weather

57
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,549
your wipers are going on off weather

58
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:39,069
your seatbelts plugged in whether you're

59
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:43,569
speeding taking corners too sharply or

60
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:44,909
you know breaking through too harshly

61
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:47,110
pretty much anything that the car spits

62
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,120
out we are we're ingesting and

63
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,190
collecting you can kind of think of us

64
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,720
as like big brother for fleets and

65
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,420
vehicles but you know in a good way so

66
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,430
besides the obvious shameless plug

67
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,500
the reason why I mentioning all this is

68
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,329
because one of the challenges that we

69
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:07,120
have with all this data is you know

70
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,280
taking it in and showing it into a

71
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,019
format that people can understand so

72
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:13,060
this could be you know dashboards charts

73
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,540
reports etc you know so for instance if

74
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,359
we have a chart that's looking at you

75
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:22,239
know several months of data it's a lot

76
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,639
of data and the load times can be fairly

77
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,909
substantial and you know to alleviate

78
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:30,129
this problem we are guilty of using a

79
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:34,720
loading spinner as well so by show of

80
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,819
hands who knows what a throbber is it's

81
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,329
the robber okay not many of you as

82
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:45,790
that's kind of I was in the same boat I

83
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,560
don't know what if the robber was until

84
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,419
I researched or until I did some

85
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:51,849
research on loading spinners and all

86
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:55,720
their counterparts so a throbber is any

87
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,340
animation that a computer program uses

88
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,459
to display to the user that work is

89
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:01,660
being done in the background so this

90
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,669
would be like downloading or loading a

91
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:05,709
web page or doing some kind of you know

92
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:10,989
some kind of crazy calculation and if

93
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:13,269
you're as old as I am you will recognize

94
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:17,049
these two infamous robbers for those of

95
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,849
you don't know the one on the left is

96
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:22,090
Internet Explorer version three and the

97
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,330
one on the right is Netscape Navigator

98
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,930
both of which are long dead so let's

99
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,099
fast forward a few years into the

100
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:34,180
mid-2000s Ajax or when Hejaz was

101
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,219
introduced I mean the during a time when

102
00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:38,259
most web pages were

103
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:40,610
where most web pages required a full

104
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,039
page reload whenever the user did some

105
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,800
kind of interaction you know Ajax came

106
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,419
in and it wasn't quite the game changer

107
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:49,639
you know it allowed portions of the web

108
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,979
page to change dynamically and because

109
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:54,439
of this the robbers kind of came back

110
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,139
but were needed more embedded in the

111
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:59,740
site rather than in the browser

112
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,729
thankfully the names robbers didn't

113
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:06,069
stick sounds sounds kind of gross I

114
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:09,169
think they're better now known as

115
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:12,770
loading spinners or spinning loaders or

116
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,849
progress spinners or what have you

117
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,020
but the problem with them was that they

118
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,479
were used in judiciously and by that I

119
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,120
mean they were used without you know

120
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,580
really much any thought whatsoever now

121
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,960
pretty much if there was an ajax call

122
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,939
you know you could be pretty sure that

123
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:31,279
there was a loading spinner that a

124
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,620
company did and i think it's because of

125
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,020
this that we've now become quite

126
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,819
accustomed to seeing loading spinners

127
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:39,710
you know whatever we're waiting for

128
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:43,529
something over anything to happen right

129
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:47,449
okay let's see how loading spinners look

130
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:53,419
today as you okay this is this is taking

131
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:57,939
longer okay whatever I'll just continue

132
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:00,080
so as you heard from Bernie we are

133
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,999
dealing with a lot of data on daily

134
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:05,300
basis a billion strikers per day we are

135
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,949
getting data from different data sources

136
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,999
like our API or bigquery and it's really

137
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:12,319
challenging to work with those data

138
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,199
since we are getting we are having so

139
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,559
many so many number of Records of course

140
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:20,870
we are guilty for using loading spinners

141
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:28,279
for fetching those data so sorry for all

142
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,939
experience to us those data so we are

143
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:38,300
having so many different I'm sorry of

144
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:38,809
course

145
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:40,159
we are getting for using all the

146
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,319
spinners when fashion those data which

147
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,629
is unfortunate because some of those

148
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:47,990
queries take so much time they take so

149
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,469
long

150
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:49,630
so you

151
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,060
are not sure what's happening whether or

152
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,370
not it's still loading whether or not

153
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,340
they are its deal fetching whether or

154
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,990
not they're just staring at some

155
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,050
animated gif which is exactly what are

156
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,190
you doing now so slides are not broken

157
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,560
we are very much connected and online

158
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,640
and if I pull at least one of you don't

159
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,710
feel bad because this brings us to a

160
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,240
first problem with loading spinners

161
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,000
which is that they don't show any sign

162
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,790
of progress the main problem with

163
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,290
loading spinners is that they don't show

164
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,590
either completed or remaining progress

165
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,260
let's go back to the previous loading

166
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,190
spinner the 1i tries to fold you it

167
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:42,220
so besides questioning Wi-Fi

168
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,830
connectivity here I'm sure at least some

169
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,410
of you we're thinking what's happening

170
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,950
or how much longer we'll have to wait

171
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,420
well the answer on both of those

172
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:56,320
questions is I don't know so you you

173
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,600
just accepted the fact that something

174
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,090
was happening and that something was

175
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,220
going through a lot right so if we

176
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,600
replace this loading spinner with some

177
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,580
cool animation the user experience might

178
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,150
be better but we are still we're still

179
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,550
waiting like you are still wondering

180
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,740
what's happening and how much longer

181
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,130
we'll have to wait the next issue with

182
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,620
loading spinners speeders is perception

183
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,200
of longer loading time time flies when

184
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,289
you are having fun right when you're

185
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,479
been watching your favorite TV show on

186
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,110
Netflix hours just go by it's kind of

187
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,090
like what happened to me when I watched

188
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,250
the whole season of stranger things in

189
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,440
in a day yeah yeah that was me too hey I

190
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,790
see some of you as well unfortunately

191
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,350
waiting is the opposite of having fun

192
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,780
just imagine yourself being in a traffic

193
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,750
jam for hours and you will know exactly

194
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,179
what I'm talking about

195
00:09:05,189 --> 00:09:10,829
sorry so the same can be said about

196
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:14,730
loading spinners they make loading

197
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,429
appear long they make loading appear

198
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:21,579
slower so even if you use some animation

199
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:24,970
we are still waiting right and we are

200
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,129
just watching it something that makes

201
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:30,519
loading that makes loading appear longer

202
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,899
than it actually is so the last problem

203
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:36,970
with loading spinners is that there is

204
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,189
there is no sign of what's coming next

205
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:42,879
in one second you are watching at on the

206
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:45,399
blank page with loading spinner and then

207
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:47,919
BAM all content just magically appears

208
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,369
on the screen right unless it's your

209
00:09:51,369 --> 00:09:54,189
birthday or you want a Jack what these

210
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:57,249
surprises may not have a good impact on

211
00:09:57,249 --> 00:10:00,489
the user the surprise effect can be

212
00:10:00,489 --> 00:10:05,529
reduced with with skeleton screams if

213
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:09,029
you take a look at those two screenshots

214
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:12,970
one of them is more surprising than than

215
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,009
the other one on the Left we have a

216
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:20,439
loading spinner that where data is

217
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:23,589
loaded all at once and on the right we

218
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,040
have skeletal screen this this is less

219
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,389
surprising because data is content is

220
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:33,929
loaded a little bit at a time so

221
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:38,639
skeletal screens give users give users

222
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,579
idea of what's what's coming next

223
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:44,819
next a heads-up of what's coming next

224
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:48,549
but today really tell us how much longer

225
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:49,989
we will have to wait some content to

226
00:10:49,989 --> 00:10:54,399
load or do they make the deme clothing

227
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,639
appears for unsurprisingly the answer is

228
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:01,209
no so what are some of the best

229
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:03,579
practices for loading spinners for

230
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:07,149
starters don't use them well that's a

231
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:09,160
bit extreme right because they are

232
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,799
useful and we should use them but I

233
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,399
would say use them in moderation which

234
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,269
means

235
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:19,240
if pro if process is less than one

236
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,879
second we really don't need a loading

237
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,929
spinner right

238
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:25,720
but if process takes between two and

239
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,240
that's ten seconds at most I would

240
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,679
recommend using loading spinner

241
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,220
ten seconds might be too much but I will

242
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,319
leave it up to you like it's really

243
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:40,389
depends on on the on each case okay

244
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:42,939
Brittany let's let's improve those

245
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:46,149
loading spinners okay so we cover a lot

246
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:48,160
of ground with the the loading spinners

247
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,170
let's see how we can become better so

248
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,360
the first way to improve them is to give

249
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,850
some feedback to the user from the

250
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,769
moment a user clicks on something or has

251
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:01,959
some kind of user interaction they're

252
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:04,689
basically waiting you know and if you

253
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:06,249
can give them some kind of context as to

254
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:08,170
why they're waiting they might be more

255
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,240
inclined to wait for the entire process

256
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,149
to finish this could also include what's

257
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,670
currently happening as part of the the

258
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,089
feedback loop I would say for even

259
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:20,110
longer operations

260
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,720
Safa it's also helpful to break down the

261
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,869
the process into kind of distinct parts

262
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:28,480
so for example if your if your process

263
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,470
is the backing up of data for a month

264
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,480
each day could be considered a step in a

265
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,939
series of you know 30 or 31 steps and

266
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:40,389
this this pretty much resembles a

267
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:46,029
progress bar which kind of goes into

268
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:49,480
this so the next way to improve the

269
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,179
loading spinners to display some kind of

270
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:54,220
some indication of process progress

271
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,610
sorry the most obvious way is with a

272
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,970
percentage where zero is no work and 100

273
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,069
is all work you've done it's pretty

274
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:05,379
obvious but of course the most obvious

275
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:07,209
way is not the prettiest way so you know

276
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:09,759
let's introduce progress bars every

277
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,279
knows these things or progress wheels

278
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,879
and these things are good for to

279
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,619
visualize progress because you know

280
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:19,449
everyone understands them and their

281
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:23,740
behavior is is pretty expected and

282
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,720
finally finally the last way is to

283
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,900
provide some kind of time estimate

284
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,620
time progress can I guess it's useful

285
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,540
but I find could be detrimental you know

286
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,910
if your time progresses like an hour and

287
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,170
34 minutes you might be kind of

288
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,110
disappointing the better way would be to

289
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,160
show the time remaining and you know

290
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,540
depending on the circumstances this can

291
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,940
be kind of tricky to do but I think an

292
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,060
approximation of that time is is is is

293
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,100
enough to keep the user satisfied and

294
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,460
kind of engaged not sure if you can see

295
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,320
that but it says the little picture

296
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,000
there says about 60 seconds remaining so

297
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,030
they're pretty vague all right so enough

298
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,390
talk you know let's let's test Murphy's

299
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:17,770
Law and do some demos in the first demo

300
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,140
today I'll show you how we are loading a

301
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,900
thousands of records and what we did to

302
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,700
improve those who holding spinners and

303
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,550
the waiting time I'll load the same data

304
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,150
on the bar chart and we load them in

305
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,140
three different ways

306
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,690
the data represents all trips trips

307
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,300
happened in periods of four months which

308
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,610
is approximately about two 120 20

309
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:49,390
thousand trips first let's take a look

310
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,850
at libraries that we used so we are

311
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,090
using geotab API to get those data then

312
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,840
we are using material for user interface

313
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,610
for chart rendering we are using charts

314
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,060
is chess and at the end we are using

315
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:10,030
rxjs to handle a synchronous events in

316
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,760
the first iteration I have one single

317
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,770
API request that returns all data and

318
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,520
I'm using I'm using a simple loading

319
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:38,610
spinner so let's go to the dough

320
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:57,850
No

321
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:06,290
so here we go

322
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:13,650
so let's start the demo does this

323
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,750
loading spinner sounds familiar from the

324
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,340
beginning this is not give I promise

325
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:23,550
so this was something we tried first if

326
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,230
you remember the problems with loading

327
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,030
spinners I was talking about

328
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,490
so this attempt had all of those

329
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,480
problems so there is no sign of progress

330
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,010
loading time appears longer than it

331
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,730
actually is there is not like surprise

332
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,510
effect is still present and like

333
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,420
everything went pretty pretty wrong I

334
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,000
would say so this is still loading I

335
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,140
wasn't questioning Wi-Fi connectivity

336
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:57,800
before but now I'm kinda kinda is I can

337
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,210
okay this should be soon I promise

338
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,420
I hope no one is streaming Netflix

339
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,350
record right now and if someone is I

340
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:12,160
hope it's in the other room at least

341
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:28,049
okay usually fix it's not that long

342
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:31,850
of course I would be shorter I would be

343
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,620
faster when you're doing a live demo

344
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:46,520
let's make it as longer as possible and

345
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,280
as as I said before now we are really

346
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,590
wondering what's happening we have no

347
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:56,960
idea will this ever end or what's going

348
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:06,080
so so be at the end let's wait a little

349
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,450
bit more if not I will just move on

350
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,980
because it's really shouldn't take this

351
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:18,430
long

352
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,780
looks like we are not lucky with demos

353
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:28,770
today yeah yeah that's fine yeah I don't

354
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,720
know just keep over I'll just keep going

355
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,080
to the other demo hopefully oh actually

356
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:43,740
here we go she's finally okay I'm so

357
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:52,140
happy I was already sweating okay before

358
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,900
we see the code for this I wanna I want

359
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,580
to take a look at this chart because it

360
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,220
shows some pretty interesting some

361
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,380
pretty pretty interesting data as I said

362
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,740
the data on this chart represent data

363
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,410
all three for four months period and

364
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:11,160
each bar represents each day we have

365
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,890
five bars in a row that are pretty

366
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,410
consistent followed by two lower ones

367
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:20,130
and those two longer ones are represent

368
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,200
the weekends so you can see that people

369
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,240
are driving less for the weekends which

370
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,140
is I would say expected the week with

371
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,740
the spike is March break in Canada so

372
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,900
you think you can see how number of

373
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,750
trips increased except especially on

374
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,240
Monday I guess we can't have kids at

375
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,470
home we just have to take them somewhere

376
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,740
so okay let's see the code the code for

377
00:19:46,740 --> 00:20:00,620
I switch to the slides

378
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:10,960
no okay

379
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,140
sorry about that the code for this

380
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,809
iteration is very simple so here we are

381
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:20,590
just making just making an API call and

382
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,679
only thing that he said is just start it

383
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,120
pretty simple after API call is done we

384
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,159
are generating labels and syria's that

385
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,029
are used to render charts using Chartist

386
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:38,260
library in the second iteration we are

387
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,990
splitting up API calls into sequences

388
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,990
and rendering the parts as we receive

389
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:50,470
them again we are still using simple

390
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,929
loading spinner so let's go to the other

391
00:20:55,929 --> 00:21:01,910
demo

392
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,270
I hope this one is one take that long is

393
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:10,620
previous one so this was this was our

394
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,230
second attempt and I would say first

395
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,750
improvement this time we are showing

396
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,540
some progress right that we didn't have

397
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,960
before it's more user-friendly because

398
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,870
it gives users an idea of content that

399
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,030
will be displayed and there is no

400
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,970
surprise effect the waiting time feels

401
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,290
shorter because users are distracted by

402
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,170
progress that is happening in background

403
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:40,140
so as you can see we are rendering how

404
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,140
we receive data we are rendering we are

405
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,470
rendering them in the same time so I

406
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,520
would say with it is really improvement

407
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,490
comparing to the previous example it's

408
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,730
really at least for me for us it was and

409
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,610
for our users it was it was a better

410
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:03,210
user experience so you can see here you

411
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,000
can see a number of records that are

412
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,480
loaded we are still we are coming to the

413
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,730
end very soon okay here we go the same

414
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,490
chart as I promised the same data just

415
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:21,090
in a different ways just in different

416
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:28,320
way ok let's go back to slides let's see

417
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,190
the code here we has some simple rxjs

418
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,830
code so how many of you is using our

419
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:40,920
access Wow not many to be honest I also

420
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,250
started using it recently and I would

421
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,990
highly recommend for you guys to try

422
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,700
because I really found it useful for

423
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,610
things I'm working on and I think it's

424
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,350
it's really good especially especially

425
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:58,380
new new new versions of of rxjs even if

426
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,190
you're not familiar with our FJs I can

427
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,290
see a lot of people isn't it's really a

428
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,360
simple code and you should be able to

429
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,210
fall to fall so here we are just

430
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,270
creating a simple observable for the

431
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:15,110
start buttons click it calls a start

432
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,960
following function that fetches the data

433
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,840
and repeats until some condition is

434
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,559
satisfied this call here should look

435
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,490
familiar

436
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,529
the only difference is that we are now

437
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:31,610
loading 10,000 records at a time the

438
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,640
version is used to keep track of where

439
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,919
we left off from the from the past API

440
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:43,730
call and here we are just subscribing to

441
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,760
the observable and creating a chart

442
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,630
until a condition is met one once we

443
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:54,320
reach the end date we just stop fetching

444
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,490
the data finally in the iteration three

445
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:01,970
and final iteration I'm I'm splitting up

446
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,100
the API call again calls again in

447
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,450
sequences and rendering rendering parts

448
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,240
how we receive them but this time I have

449
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,669
a brand-new fancy progress spinner so

450
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:20,980
let's see let's see this fancy spinner I

451
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:25,340
hope it's not fancy on this movie ok

452
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:30,019
let's start so this is the final

453
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:33,139
solution that solves all the problems we

454
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:36,350
had before so we finally have the full

455
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,159
progress Pinner

456
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:40,760
i was looking for all this time users

457
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,490
know what kind of content is coming how

458
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,769
much progress has been completed and how

459
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:50,240
much is is remaining and of course this

460
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,429
only works if you have a definition of

461
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:55,789
what's considered complete in our case

462
00:24:55,789 --> 00:25:00,070
we are done when we reach our end date

463
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:10,850
which will happen very soon in about 40%

464
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:15,520
so you can also see here how many it's

465
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,130
very smile yeah you can see in the left

466
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:22,180
top corner how many days is loaded so we

467
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:27,880
are waiting for April to load and as I

468
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,590
said before again the same data just in

469
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:37,930
some new way and I hope this way is much

470
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:41,590
better for for you for you because it's

471
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,570
definitely much better for us and for

472
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:51,720
our users let's let's cool slides again

473
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,480
to take a quick look at code without

474
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,970
going into much details the purpose of

475
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,100
this code is to make a counter that

476
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,380
gives you the illusion that is

477
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,130
increasing smoothly I won't explain this

478
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,670
code in details you can find it in our

479
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:13,330
slides later and here we are just

480
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,670
calculating the percentage and I'm

481
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:21,910
animating the recipe let's go to - thank

482
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:26,110
you so that's pretty neat I mean a lot

483
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,780
of loading but it's kind of neat now we

484
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,400
wouldn't be at all telematics company if

485
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,320
we didn't show you guys something

486
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,000
related to the map right so let's load

487
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,610
him up so at the beginning of the talk I

488
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,510
showed you guys a map of North America

489
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:43,810
and all the GPS points plotted on that

490
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,030
map and it looks pretty extensive you

491
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,070
could see you know the major freeways

492
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:52,150
the roads or major roads and you could

493
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:55,000
really make out all the major cities and

494
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,190
all of that or that map pretty much

495
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,790
amounted to about 12 million trips but

496
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,740
that's not necessarily 12 million GPS

497
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,850
points I guess I should explain that

498
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,680
there's many GPS points for one trip so

499
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,270
maybe there was close to a hundred

500
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:15,400
million GPS points but you know as the

501
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,200
title of our talk says and you know for

502
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,690
the sake of time at bandwidth we're just

503
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,610
going to go to million data points or

504
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,480
trips

505
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,290
just like just so some of the tech we

506
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:29,700
used the data store is a Google bigquery

507
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,460
the table schema is pretty simple it's

508
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,410
just a long lab you know a time

509
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:38,049
associated with that with that that

510
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:39,760
point and we have a couple measurements

511
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,530
of driving duration in mac speed we're

512
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,290
using nodejs client library from Google

513
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,919
to query bigquery from JavaScript we're

514
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,400
also using deck GL which is a kind of

515
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,130
like a layer on top of map box that uses

516
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:00,790
WebGL I guess for for handling you know

517
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,370
many data points millions of data points

518
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:07,169
if you will and again we're using RS yes

519
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:15,590
so let's take a look at the demo right

520
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,740
so we have a map in North America I'm

521
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,130
just gonna click play and you know

522
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,049
fairly shortly we should be seeing some

523
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:26,830
points in than that not shipping so we

524
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,570
have a progress bar instead of the

525
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,309
spinner this time just to spice things

526
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:34,450
up so I'm not sure if you notice but at

527
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,400
the beginning I only loaded say like a

528
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,020
small number of records only a thousand

529
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,270
and then I kind of like gradually

530
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,799
increase it maybe a thousand two

531
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:43,360
thousand five thousand ten thousand and

532
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,730
so on and this is just to give the user

533
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,530
something to look at from the very GetGo

534
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,470
I think about a couple normally it takes

535
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:53,080
about a couple seconds for the first

536
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,970
thousand or so records to come in so it

537
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,950
gives the the user something to play

538
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,570
with right off the bat and they don't

539
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,549
have to wait for you know all 1 million

540
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:05,200
to the load so we're at 150 thousand

541
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,809
records right now which is a little

542
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:10,059
behind what I'm used to but let's assume

543
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:11,770
in here we're from Toronto so let's take

544
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,230
a look at Toronto you know it's the

545
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,559
downtown cores is little point nicely

546
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,570
you can see there and you know some of

547
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:22,330
the surrounding areas are also lit up if

548
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,400
we zoom in all the way you know we get

549
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,470
our we going to get a coverage of our

550
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,210
good indication of the coverage in

551
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,160
Toronto you'll see that some of the

552
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,529
circles are different sizes

553
00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:35,539
and it really is because we made the the

554
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:37,220
size of the size of the circle a

555
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,220
function of speed so the larger the

556
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,309
circle the larger the match speed was

557
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:44,929
for that trip and then vice versa for

558
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:50,059
the small ones and then as the as the

559
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:51,890
circle is going to overlap each other it

560
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,659
kind of creates this this highlighting

561
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:55,720
effect which I thought was pretty neat

562
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,360
we can zoom out here yes we can see we

563
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,039
can start to make out a lot of the major

564
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,200
cities in on the East Coast here like

565
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,159
New York Detroit Chicago let's take a

566
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:11,760
look at you know Manhattan for example

567
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,500
so I mean there's a lot of activity in

568
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,210
Manhattan and it's pretty hustle bustle

569
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,799
right the one thing I want to notice

570
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,730
here there is a pretty high point right

571
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:25,899
here you know it's pretty bright and

572
00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:28,850
believe it or not that's Riker Island so

573
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,100
I'm not sure if you guys know what that

574
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:36,049
is but that is a prison so it's from

575
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:37,370
from this we can tell that you know

576
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,169
there's a lot of activity going on in

577
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:40,610
the prison you know a lot of trips

578
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,980
coming in and out whether it's inmates

579
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,289
or food or whatever we don't know but

580
00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:48,080
there are a lot of trips I just a word

581
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,679
of advice

582
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:50,270
stay out of there and don't be part of

583
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:55,399
that statistic so let's zoom out a bit

584
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:59,539
more we're almost reaching the 3/4 mile

585
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:05,419
way there or 3/4 way there you know we

586
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:06,770
got Florida lit up quite nicely on the

587
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:10,340
East Coast again all the major cities we

588
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,960
come to the west coast we can we can see

589
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,110
a lot of the you can actually make out

590
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,409
some of the major major freeways now

591
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:19,880
even some of the roads san francisco's

592
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,730
is is pretty busy looks better when the

593
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,549
zoom there and LA of course is just you

594
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:27,919
know insane it looks like the traffic

595
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,880
there the traffic map is just it's crazy

596
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,570
so I mean I'm not gonna wait for the

597
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,679
rest of it to load it's taking a bit

598
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:38,779
longer than usual but you guys get the

599
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:41,419
idea right and it's pretty mean when you

600
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:43,610
zoom out or Mexico City is just insane

601
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,120
too but

602
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:49,400
whatever all right so let's take a look

603
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,700
at some of the the code I'm just going

604
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,510
to go through this pretty quickly

605
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,850
because you know it's not nothing -

606
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:59,660
nothing too crazy we're loading a table

607
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,130
I called trip to North America which

608
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,050
completely makes sense and it comes from

609
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,330
a some kind of data set we had called or

610
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:08,420
for this bill for this conference of J's

611
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,720
cough demo the rest of is just kind of

612
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,370
for authentication purposes really so we

613
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,870
take our table and then we're calling

614
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,940
get rose and get rose takes in two

615
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,440
parameters that are the first is options

616
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,710
and the good thing about options that

617
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,100
it's if resembles our API pretty clear

618
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,140
pretty pretty closely in that it takes

619
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,710
in a match results which is say like 50

620
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,540
thousand records and then with that 50

621
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,460
thousand and we also get a kind of got

622
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,250
pointer to the to the very last record

623
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,470
which we use in our subsequent calls to

624
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:46,610
get the next 50 thousand and so on and

625
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,320
then finally a callback just sends back

626
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,060
the data and the the pointer that I

627
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:56,000
talked about just now so this is just

628
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,460
some initialization code for map box

629
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,620
nothing crazy here I guess the only

630
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,460
thing I want to point out is that Dec GL

631
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,110
handles all the interactions instead of

632
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,810
map box so that's why we have this

633
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:13,610
interactive flag set to false so with

634
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:17,720
deck GL we start by creating a deck this

635
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,250
is all pretty pretty simple stuff again

636
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,550
and as mentioned previously whenever the

637
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:25,250
state changes it's handled by this

638
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,220
function and it keeps both deck GL and

639
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:34,670
the map in sync some of our X J's code

640
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:38,000
so we get back data from the Google

641
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,860
bigquery API and it's it's putting it to

642
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,290
an observer or observable

643
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,820
our observer here we subscribe to it and

644
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,940
then we're creating a layer that we put

645
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,510
on to deck GL for our purposes we're

646
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,730
using a scatter plot layer and we're

647
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:56,980
just using the

648
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,340
we got from bigquery now the data looks

649
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,400
like this that's pretty simple again

650
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,320
there's a position which is an array of

651
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,460
long and lats there's a radius I think

652
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,740
it's I think it's in pixel but I'm not

653
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,720
really sure you can also use it you can

654
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,570
also use a function instead of a number

655
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,940
and of course we have a color some RGB

656
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:24,550
value so that's that's the end of our

657
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:29,200
demos and in summary so by no means are

658
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,970
these what we talked about

659
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:33,639
hardened rules for using loading

660
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,909
spinners or progress spinners but it's

661
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:41,500
more it's more for you to consider you

662
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,700
know that's something to think about the

663
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:46,240
next time you're making an async all if

664
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,280
you're using a loading spinner

665
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,340
you know just use some good judgment

666
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,429
for anything else that takes longer if

667
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:57,340
you can use a progress spinner or or

668
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,570
something that at least gives the user

669
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:02,050
some kind of feedback right you know if

670
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,150
you do so your users will probably

671
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:07,420
appreciate the the improved loading user

672
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,460
experience but I think more importantly

673
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,900
they're going to thank you for not lying

674
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,619
boldly to your face so that concludes

675
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:27,850
our talk thank you guys for listening

676
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,210
thank you both for that wonderful

677
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,580
wonderful talk can we get another round

678
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:39,420
of applause for both so the next talk is

679
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,610
going to start at 10:15 unfortunately we

680
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,290
don't have a spinning loader for the

681
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,910
next couple minutes so you're just gonna

682
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,590
have to use the forward progress of time

683
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:50,070
as your loader but yeah 10:15 is going

684
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,540
to be the next talk so have a good

685
00:35:51,540 --> 00:36:01,590
conversation while you're waiting
