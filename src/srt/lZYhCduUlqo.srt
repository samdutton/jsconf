1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,240

you

2
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,090
so I named my top government j/s but it

3
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,830
won't be political so don't fall asleep

4
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,349
or leave you can fall asleep because

5
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:26,380
it's super comfy in here but that being

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,800
said hopefully I can challenge your

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,020
perceptions of what a political party

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,470
can look like and if you want to there's

9
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,809
a lot of links in this talk so the

10
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:39,940
slides are online for clicky stuff

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,640
because I might move past the slide

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,809
before you have time to click on things

13
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:45,610
so you can go to the github to see the

14
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,510
slides so last year I are about two

15
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,520
years ago I quit my job I was working at

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,890
a market research company and it was

17
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,500
kind of how you would expect working in

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,879
a market research company would be not

19
00:00:57,879 --> 00:00:59,410
the most exciting place in the world and

20
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,960
I got offered to go and move to the bay

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,550
area and work for this place called Code

22
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,520
for America I'm from America my

23
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,310
affiliation with that country is that i

24
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,680
was born in it and it's it's an okay

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,690
place however i was given the

26
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,000
opportunity to go work with the city of

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,340
Boston through this program and Code for

28
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,600
America basically the way it works it's

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,270
like Peace Corps but for nerds and you

30
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,780
work with cities so the idea is you put

31
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,610
these people who would never be hired by

32
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,320
a city government into city government

33
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,390
somehow and they do crazy things for a

34
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,070
year and it's a fellowship so you get to

35
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,600
kind of dink around and try to do

36
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,170
something interesting and so uh this is

37
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,299
one of my favorite photos of me because

38
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:42,189
the entire time I was there as told I

39
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:43,509
supposed to wear a tie but nobody really

40
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,909
knew that I wasn't because I could hide

41
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:47,920
it pretty well and the mayor of Boston

42
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,229
he's in his fifth term now Thomas M

43
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:53,439
Menino he's such an awesome guy he he is

44
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,270
just a really funny character and this

45
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,040
is less in City Hall and it was a great

46
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,570
time I heard later that people would

47
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,829
like there was like this murmur

48
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:04,630
throughout city hall that have you guys

49
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,040
seen the bearded guy in the elevator yet

50
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,530
this is crazy so like within the first

51
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,869
couple days the idea of culture change

52
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:12,610
like the whole point of Code for America

53
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,230
is to introduce culture change stay

54
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,519
introduce modern technology but also

55
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:17,260
culture change into a city and i think

56
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,730
it was working like through my beard

57
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,549
virus or whatever we also got featured

58
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:23,349
in governing and magazine a prestigious

59
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:25,780
publication and two of the guys that

60
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,849
work in Boston City Hall Chris and Nigel

61
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:28,930
they

62
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,689
do an amazing job of kind of there like

63
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:34,750
an innovation department inside of the

64
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,219
mayor's office it's a two-man department

65
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:38,530
and they basically just try to do the

66
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,000
coolest things that they could possibly

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,920
do to make the modern modern government

68
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,219
of reality so there they got quite a lot

69
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:46,420
of recognition and their departments

70
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,680
growing now so what I was basically

71
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,849
doing is trying to go inside the

72
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:53,680
government and work with it and fix it

73
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,689
and that's one class of strategies that

74
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:58,060
I want to talk about and I have a lot of

75
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,150
examples so where I worked it's now I

76
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,849
mean almost two years old I think it's

77
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:07,389
like one year eight months old they have

78
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:09,970
275 github repos everything that the

79
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,680
organization does is open source there's

80
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,510
too many projects to keep track of

81
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,549
frankly so what I've done is curated a

82
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:17,169
list of the the ones that have worked

83
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:19,180
particularly well but if you want to

84
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,900
check out what Code for America produces

85
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,909
you can go to their github but let me

86
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:27,489
just go through and as fast process as I

87
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:29,739
can some of the examples so you can get

88
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:31,090
a better idea of what I'm talking about

89
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,989
and I their motto is all open all the

90
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:38,319
time so you can totally talk to the

91
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,760
people who write the projects for kit

92
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,709
get involved what they really really

93
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:44,169
really want is if you live in a city to

94
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:46,299
take one of their projects and set it up

95
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:48,729
in your city and implement a solution

96
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,310
that somebody else built but get it into

97
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,879
your civic context wherever you live so

98
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:58,599
this is called route view let me refresh

99
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:01,389
and refuse in Honolulu it's a smartphone

100
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:03,790
app that you put in routing like in

101
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,099
Honolulu if you go from Honolulu to

102
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:08,739
waipahu it shows you a route and then

103
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:10,659
along the way it shows any government

104
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:12,400
owned cameras and it can give you

105
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,599
traffic conditions from your smartphone

106
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,790
instead of having to go to some horrible

107
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,099
government website flight status is in

108
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:20,949
New Orleans you put in a property that's

109
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:22,300
blighted which basically just means

110
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,729
abandoned or old or dirty there's a lot

111
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:25,630
of that in New Orleans after the

112
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,110
hurricane and you can have this

113
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,599
beautiful you I that shows you the

114
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:34,210
status of that property instead of

115
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,830
having to go and search through records

116
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,419
in a basement of City building somewhere

117
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:40,120
and this makes it really easy to figure

118
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,350
out like hey this

119
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,510
this is kind of like the timeline of

120
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,010
this property and here's when it's going

121
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,090
to get fixed or it's not going to get

122
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,540
fixed or was too cost-prohibitive we

123
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,800
have Honolulu answers which is basically

124
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,040
like ask jeeves remember ask jeeves like

125
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,080
it was the dream of the 90s and you

126
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,240
could like simplify computers by doing

127
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,400
like human style question asking turns

128
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,540
out doing that for the whole internet is

129
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,280
kind of crazy but doing it just for one

130
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,080
city government website is super awesome

131
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,900
and a huge UX win so Honolulu answers

132
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,300
you do things like you type in a box how

133
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,680
do i renew my driver's license and you

134
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,480
get back kind of stack overflow style a

135
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,880
bunch of other people that have asked

136
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,550
the same question and then an actual

137
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,650
workflow for how to figure out who do I

138
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,330
call what do i do what form do i fill

139
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,520
out so it simplifies interactions with

140
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,230
government I should also mention that

141
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,050
everything in this particular set of

142
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,970
demos were all Code for America projects

143
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,610
in the last year or two prepared Lee is

144
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,620
for disaster prevention you can

145
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,630
basically sign up it's I think it's in

146
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,310
Austin Texas you can sign up your

147
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,220
property and anytime that there's like a

148
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,400
fire in the property or maybe a

149
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,800
hurricane or tornado you get a text

150
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,300
message alert and other things you get

151
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,160
emails that help you prepare for a

152
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,800
natural disasters it's super important

153
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,870
we have neighbor how which is like a

154
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,860
wiki for doing things in your

155
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,290
neighborhood and kind of a citizen

156
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,440
driven like tactical urban activism it's

157
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,150
kind of crazy it's like a wiki for how

158
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,100
to go crazy and put a bunch of bike

159
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,440
racks inside of parking spaces and it's

160
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,640
a min a bunch of different communities

161
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,460
now local data is like a mapping tool

162
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,200
kit so that you can allow people to

163
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,730
crowdsource data really easily because

164
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,590
every app that crowdsources data right

165
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,850
so everything from scratch and it

166
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,260
doesn't work on certain phones or makes

167
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,790
a bunch of trade-offs local data is

168
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,840
trying to make it really easy to have

169
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,080
like a toolkit for just having citizens

170
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,970
report problems on their phone about a

171
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,950
place which is a ubiquitous problem in

172
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,500
government hacking texts in is cool it's

173
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,450
like you put up banners on bus stops or

174
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,870
anywhere that people can can see a phone

175
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,690
number in a city and you can give them

176
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,520
like a question like what would you

177
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,620
think of a new subway line coming along

178
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,690
this road text your answer here so it's

179
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,919
like a lightweight text message the

180
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,150
right tool that's easy enough for city

181
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,610
officials to use this is one that I

182
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,210
worked on last

183
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,240
discover bps it's like I like to think

184
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,520
of it as like Airbnb but for parents to

185
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,270
find schools for their kids so Boston

186
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,460
has this insane list of requirements

187
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,520
it's like a 27-page PDF and it basically

188
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,970
is way too much information for all

189
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,340
parents in Boston to read it talks about

190
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,180
you have to live in this neighborhood

191
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,949
within a certain radius of this school

192
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:20,300
to go to this one and if you went to

193
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,500
this school last year you can't go to

194
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,449
the school over here and did this school

195
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:24,680
has this after-school programs what you

196
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,970
have to qualify with blah blah blah blah

197
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,380
blah blah blah blah blah so we made it

198
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,820
into like a web app that's really easy

199
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,460
to use and it's being used by the school

200
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,410
district now this is another one that I

201
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:38,360
worked on which is real-time bus data I

202
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,620
will fight the nature God's they're

203
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,690
trying to they're trying to stop they're

204
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,250
trying to stop these ideas from being

205
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,820
spread um it's basically like there was

206
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,860
a big snowstorm in Boston the week that

207
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,389
I got there februari 2010 for 2011 and

208
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:59,270
some of the school buses got to the

209
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,240
schools that like 11 p.m. at night they

210
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,639
left at four pm and they got home at

211
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,330
11pm because there was so much snow on

212
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,630
the freeways get that the school buses

213
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,280
were just stuck in traffic for like six

214
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,599
hours and parents were calling like

215
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:17,449
crazy where are my kids and it was 11pm

216
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:18,919
when they finally got home so we made

217
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:20,930
this app so that parents could log in

218
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,110
with their school account and actually

219
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,750
see where the bus is on a smartphone who

220
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,349
cannot hear me everybody can hear me all

221
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:32,029
right I can put the mic closer to my

222
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:36,409
mouth it was awesome we're going to

223
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:40,010
bring it down um there are new this is

224
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,419
actually powered by JavaScript there's

225
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:43,669
this company matte box that does tile

226
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:47,230
rendering in a streaming fashion and so

227
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,180
my girlfriend Jessica actually works at

228
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,410
Code for America this year and she made

229
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,930
this map of the city of Macon Georgia is

230
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,839
transit infrastructure and she styled it

231
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:58,190
made it modern made it work on mobile

232
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,589
smartphone browsers and then this the

233
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:01,970
city actually up streamed it and

234
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,649
embedded it in their website and

235
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:05,420
previously they had a flash applet that

236
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,089
lets you zoom into a PDF Oh God

237
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:19,079
let me save the venue really quick

238
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:22,029
here's I'm just going to keep rolling

239
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:25,240
with it here's a budget visualization

240
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,879
tool kit called see penny work and it's

241
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,410
the cool thing about this is that it's

242
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,529
super simple so city employees are

243
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:34,480
overworked and they don't have time to

244
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,470
learn web frameworks so what you do is

245
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,970
you sign up for a free wordpress account

246
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,069
and a Google Doc you put your budget

247
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:43,809
spreadsheet into the google doc and plug

248
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:45,220
the google doc ID into the wordpress

249
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,709
site and you get this it's like a budget

250
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:52,779
toolkit so it's being used in the city

251
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:54,819
of Macon Georgia to visualize to the

252
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:56,620
public a bond referendum basically

253
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,629
people take another penny off of every

254
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:00,699
purchase and get a fun parks and they

255
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:02,980
fund new rail lines going in but people

256
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,629
never actually understand how the

257
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:06,579
government uses their money so this is a

258
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:09,009
way that's super lightweight that city

259
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,420
employees can sign up for in like ten

260
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,339
minutes and start having open budgeting

261
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:17,199
and here's a the penny tax in Georgia

262
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,480
implementation site and then this is

263
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,389
awesome in Honolulu you can adopt a fire

264
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:26,110
sorry a siren for tsunamis because

265
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,339
there's all these sirens but there are

266
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:29,170
things like I think they had iguanas

267
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,550
that would start living in the sirens

268
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,679
and the sirens would malfunction so

269
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,179
neighbors that lived around the sirens

270
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:35,589
can adopt the sirens and it's their job

271
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:37,540
they get to anthropomorphize them so

272
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,939
this guy named his siren Vernon Kay

273
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,389
bedoya after his own name Vernon Bedoya

274
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:45,009
he named the siren after himself some

275
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:46,600
folk sirens have different names but now

276
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,550
he'll get text messages that say hey

277
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,660
have you checked the siren this month

278
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,790
like it might be screwed up and this app

279
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,740
was actually adopted in Boston we built

280
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,879
the thing called adopt a fire hydrant

281
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,910
and adopt a fire hydrant was the same

282
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,170
exact idea but you're supposed to shovel

283
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,569
the fire hydrant out after a snowstorm

284
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:03,939
but this guy in our Lulu set it up see

285
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:05,499
quick fixes ubiquitous thing now they

286
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,059
sent a lot of cities it's not a Code for

287
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:08,410
America project but it inspired some

288
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,639
Code for America projects it lets you

289
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,809
report like potholes from your

290
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:12,610
smartphone in the city when they fix

291
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,959
them you get a push notification that

292
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,670
says hey they fix that pothole you

293
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,160
reported last month so based on that we

294
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,329
made a dashboard of all open three on 13

295
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:24,309
11 requests across many cities so you

296
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,749
can see which cities are fixing more

297
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:27,699
requests there's like text message

298
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:29,829
interfaces for cities to use to report

299
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:30,939
new things this one's kind of like a

300
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:32,860
video game mayor Emanuel

301
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,260
in Chicago this is a like a video game

302
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,910
version of the mayor running around the

303
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,490
city fixing potholes and it shows like

304
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,140
how the city's actually responded to

305
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,970
triaging the civic infrastructure issues

306
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,420
and 311 labs which is like kind of like

307
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,800
starting to convene a community of

308
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,570
people trying to make cities more

309
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,890
efficient in the way that they spend

310
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,920
money on fixing infrastructure so that's

311
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,180
fixing government from the inside

312
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,710
there's also groups fixing government

313
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,240
from the outside such as here hi Malta

314
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,640
shorten interruption when the talk is

315
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,270
over you all have to stay here oh if we

316
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,520
if we're stuck or else the place will

317
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,440
blow away so don't get up yeah I have a

318
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,610
captive audience is that what you're

319
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,390
selling me maja let's talk about anarchy

320
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,180
um i already am you just don't realize

321
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,880
it so this is actually a group in

322
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,250
Germany in Berlin they don't have the

323
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,920
word Civic in German so they're using

324
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,180
Scotland which i think is city and state

325
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,450
and it's basically like civic coding and

326
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,940
what they're trying to do is without

327
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,260
working directly with the government's

328
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,520
just from a community activism

329
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,500
standpoint do the same exact kind of

330
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,380
things so they have this app wheel map

331
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,090
which is for a crowdsourcing wheelchair

332
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,160
accessible places there's this one which

333
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,640
is awesome which if I google translate

334
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,770
made me understand it's basically if you

335
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,040
have a bunch of bottles and cans you can

336
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,960
find people that come by and collect

337
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,570
bottles and cans in carts shopping carts

338
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,070
are however and you get their text

339
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,330
message number and you can tell them hey

340
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,320
I'm going to leave my bottles and cans

341
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,030
out next Tuesday come by my house on the

342
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,150
curve they'll be there super awesome

343
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,160
this one is basically if you request

344
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,420
information from the government instead

345
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,950
of just taking it you can post it here

346
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,210
and then everybody else can get it so

347
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,110
you don't have to have two people

348
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,190
requesting the same thing from the

349
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,410
government and then they also have open

350
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,640
three-on-one style system that was in

351
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,250
the UK for like the last ten years this

352
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,750
fix my street has been like it was like

353
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,950
the original three on one implementation

354
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,770
and this is like favorite project this

355
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,980
guy stefan put all of Germany's laws on

356
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,010
github and mark down amazing so for

357
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,410
instance this is the actual law of the

358
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,210
German government and then now the

359
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,190
pirate party in Germany has been sending

360
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,310
pull requests and so they're they're

361
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,820
changing the law and imagine how my in

362
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,690
vilonia it would be

363
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,050
if any city employee merged it's just

364
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,770
like ah it gets me so excited so uh the

365
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,930
third strategy is kind of a hybrid of

366
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,160
the first two you have inside and

367
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,040
outside government and then Tim O'Reilly

368
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,650
who I worked in directly through him

369
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,840
he's behind Code for America here I

370
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,550
wrote this awesome SI there's a link in

371
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,750
the presentation called government as a

372
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,730
platform so that's the hybrid strategy I

373
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,860
think it's the most promising one and

374
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,630
it's this idea of a civic startup and

375
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,420
the word startup could have positive or

376
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,800
negative connotations but in this case

377
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,370
it means fixing something so what is the

378
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,780
civic startup here's an example from

379
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,110
Vancouver Canada this guy Luke made this

380
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,400
thing that was originally called van

381
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,410
trash but he changed it recollect net

382
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,110
and it's a funny pun if you think about

383
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,240
it so in Vancouver every time there's a

384
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,610
holiday the garbage day switches to the

385
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,290
next day so it might be Tuesday Tuesday

386
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,730
Tuesday and then there's a holiday and

387
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,720
now the garbage is on Wednesday

388
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,710
Wednesday Wednesday and then there's a

389
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,320
holiday so you can't recollect the time

390
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,570
of the trash pickup so he just made a

391
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,590
thing where you put in where you live

392
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,820
and you put in your number and it text

393
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,530
messages you every time trash day

394
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,850
changes so you don't forget to take out

395
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,950
your trash super simple also something

396
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,720
that's super simple to a web developer

397
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,640
but something that cities are not going

398
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,230
to be able to have time to implement so

399
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,940
what he did is he figured out he could

400
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,340
sell that service to the government City

401
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,990
Vancouver and the City Vancouver would

402
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,430
pay him for every citizen that signed up

403
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,580
cover his costs allow him to the to make

404
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,200
some money and also allow the government

405
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,610
to me you know it's a win-win-win

406
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,000
situation so this is a lot of software

407
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,990
that still runs in government this is

408
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,760
the Assessor real estate system in New

409
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,790
Orleans I actually personally like this

410
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,620
aesthetic I think it's rad that they're

411
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,720
rolling with it but it's sad that a lot

412
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,130
of government software is still looking

413
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,339
like this today so I want to propose

414
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:32,110
there's many ways to hack the system

415
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,390
here's one that I've kind of gone deep

416
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,600
with so um right now the way government

417
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,060
by software is you have sales people

418
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,470
that go into City Hall I witnessed this

419
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,670
when I worked in Boston City how I was

420
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,740
kind of disgusting there's these

421
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,210
salespeople to get real chummy and they

422
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,680
say you know our enterprise platform

423
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,839
added a new let's say like a student

424
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,300
information system to its product lineup

425
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,240
this year and so the school district is

426
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,530
like okay we'll spend a million dollars

427
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,420
on that and it takes three years to

428
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,980
install and then it's there for ten

429
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,490
years

430
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,800
for 20 years and they're stuck with it

431
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,420
and they go through this process where

432
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,709
they have all the sales people from all

433
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:07,209
the big enterprise companies come in and

434
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:09,100
say are we going to give you a million

435
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,330
dollars are you a million dollars like

436
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,529
we'll have you battle for three years

437
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:13,570
and they finally pick one it's horrible

438
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,290
they are making the biggest like

439
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,450
vertical stack purchase as possible and

440
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,040
then they're running our entire

441
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,450
government infrastructure and using our

442
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:27,220
tax dollars to like it's crazy so what

443
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,200
if we had low cost for Kermit what if

444
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,350
governments could like try something out

445
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,480
and then turn it off just like how we

446
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,550
buy I don't know service as a software

447
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,190
on the web today and because it's such

448
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,510
low amounts of money you don't need a

449
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,820
competitive process because cities can

450
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,220
like any city employee like a CIO or a

451
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,230
CTO or whatever they can bust out like

452
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,330
50 grand on something without it without

453
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,709
having to go through a competitive

454
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,300
bidding process so there's a pretty high

455
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,580
margin for in terms of money like a

456
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,130
window that we can start inserting these

457
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:01,750
more like tech based solutions into

458
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,770
government and getting them to adopt

459
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:06,880
them so to get even more idealistic what

460
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,439
if this is a crazy idea I've been

461
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:09,850
dreaming about for a while what if we

462
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:13,059
had a government as an OAuth provider so

463
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:15,490
identity platforms inside of government

464
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:19,000
you go to a website maybe Mary here

465
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,370
right so an app called register a new

466
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,740
business calm and i go there and it's

467
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,420
like sign in with your city of berlin

468
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,740
account and it oh ops you through the

469
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,510
city of berlin site and now i can

470
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,610
interact with mary site and click a

471
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,320
button that makes me fill out a form

472
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,809
about how to do a new business and then

473
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:35,950
i click a button and it submits it to

474
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,679
the city's API that way a web developer

475
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:40,720
who knows what she's doing can make the

476
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,390
UI citizens can use it and the

477
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,330
government gets a better new business

478
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,800
applications and there's a ton of use

479
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,390
cases where this would be a more optimal

480
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,190
system it also sounds a lot like

481
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,900
developer ecosystems and what has made

482
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,820
these companies really successful but

483
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,700
nobody's done it for government yet um

484
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,650
so it's kind of like I wish procurement

485
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,570
officers had Heroku add-ons basically

486
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,179
this is a dream of mine so you can go

487
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:05,320
and you can click a button you can get

488
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,960
Redis on your Heroku thing and money

489
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,550
will start coming out of your account

490
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,929
but if three months down the road you're

491
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:13,030
like oh and switch to that other one you

492
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,169
can switch and money

493
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:15,999
stops coming and going to read us to go

494
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:17,320
it'll go to the other guys or whatever

495
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,879
and there's all these add-ons and

496
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:20,710
there's different levels and their plug

497
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,029
and play and they can form to like a

498
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:24,759
third-party ecosystem standard but again

499
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:26,830
nobody is doing in a government because

500
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,119
government is dominated by these big

501
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:30,580
enterprise companies here's an example

502
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,289
of an actual place that is doing this

503
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:36,159
right freakin Estonia is awesome so why

504
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,580
Estonia I went to this crazy meeting uh

505
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,320
with the president of Estonia don't ask

506
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,359
me how I got there that's me and that's

507
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:45,070
the president of Estonia he's an amazing

508
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,450
person he told me that you learned a

509
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,340
program on a PDP 8 when he was in middle

510
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,259
school and that has formed and he's

511
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:53,619
basically a hacker and so he is like he

512
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:56,200
writes assembler and he is now a head of

513
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,970
state like how many heads of state can

514
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,789
write assembler I I think like one and

515
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:02,259
what it's done is it's informed like he

516
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:04,059
has a native understanding of data and

517
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,980
privacy and all these important issues

518
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,359
that governments have to tackle and

519
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:09,580
Estonia actually has these really cool

520
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,499
things so each department in the

521
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:13,289
government has its own a

522
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:16,330
compartmentalized data storage mechanism

523
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,889
for doing whatever digital innovation

524
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:20,109
they have to do and only that department

525
00:19:20,109 --> 00:19:21,639
can access it and the citizens are in

526
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:23,350
charge of allowing picking which

527
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,759
departments get access to which parts of

528
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:26,259
their data it's not one creepy big

529
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:27,789
government data set and it wouldn't work

530
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:29,700
it's a the United States federal level

531
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,710
but they have ribs and spine so we have

532
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,419
the backbone the spine the standards and

533
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:35,830
each department as a rib that connects

534
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,529
to the spine in a standardized way but

535
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:40,960
the cool thing is that they just bought

536
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,149
that software because they said here's

537
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:44,559
what we need what company is going to

538
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,080
make it and they bought this platform

539
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,090
and integrated it but they don't run

540
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,559
their company like a software or they're

541
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,480
they're not a software company Estonia

542
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,909
is a small government that has made

543
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:56,739
smart purchases and innovated because

544
00:19:56,739 --> 00:19:58,749
they have the right platform in place so

545
00:19:58,749 --> 00:19:59,950
you can do things like when you park

546
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,139
your car you text message what

547
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:03,999
neighborhood you parked in and when the

548
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:05,529
person who comes by and checks your

549
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:07,539
license plate they see that you're

550
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,519
currently paying for parking it's and

551
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:11,350
you could you can pay a you can vote

552
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,450
online you can vote in any election in

553
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,889
Estonia online they're the only country

554
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:16,600
where every election you can vote online

555
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,489
they rank really highly in a lot of

556
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:22,950
different areas but they're not it's

557
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,609
better to think of them as a

558
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:26,289
medium-sized city when we're talking

559
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:27,549
about a

560
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:28,720
opting our ideas for other places

561
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,940
they're only about a million people in

562
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,340
Estonia but there's a million people in

563
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,450
a lot of cities that have some very

564
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,989
similar issues so another problem who's

565
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:39,340
going to advocate for this good software

566
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,450
we know that there's better ways of

567
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,409
doing it than what government is doing

568
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:45,220
and bureaucrats are evil right so who's

569
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,149
gonna be our champion MC Hammer that's

570
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:51,399
who you guys remember MC Hammer he's

571
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:53,769
kind of a big deal he is actually from

572
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,149
the neighborhood that I know now living

573
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:57,519
in Oakland and this is that code for

574
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,259
america last week we're actually like

575
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,059
three days ago Ron Conway is a

576
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,619
well-known investor and Tim O'Reilly

577
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:04,539
brought MC Hammer an to talk about

578
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:06,309
laying it down government getting them

579
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:08,950
to be more efficient um this is kind of

580
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,330
a joke slide but this is basically

581
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,369
representing that this issue is getting

582
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:13,779
bigger and bigger people like MC Hammer

583
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:15,519
are starting to pay attention to it so

584
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:18,850
you know it's a big deal um and we all

585
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,409
know that government is going to always

586
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:24,070
change slowly but government technology

587
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,109
is actually moving really fast for

588
00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:27,730
instance in boston they have this cio it

589
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,669
came in 07 and he was able to acquire

590
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:32,830
quintuple the tech budget they went from

591
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,049
using five million dollars every year to

592
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:36,730
run their technology to 25 million

593
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,249
dollars so he made technology a bigger

594
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:40,869
deal they spent more money on technology

595
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:43,210
but what they did was it made it the

596
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,830
internal systems operations more

597
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,559
efficient and they actually saved about

598
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,879
250 million dollars overall in the

599
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:50,519
budget by better leveraging technology

600
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,629
the federal government the United States

601
00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:55,749
spent something like 200 times the

602
00:21:55,749 --> 00:22:00,039
entire like net amount of iphone apps

603
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,539
that are purchased the government bought

604
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:03,669
200 times that last year in just big

605
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:06,639
enterprise software but technology is

606
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:07,929
making big leaps and bounds even in

607
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:09,820
government and why am I talking to Jas

608
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,690
comp Jas is everywhere and it's the

609
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,100
fastest growing thing right now it's

610
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,080
ubiquitous and if you're going to build

611
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,730
an app that fixes government all the

612
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,190
examples examples that I showed earlier

613
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,909
they're going to have a jazz component

614
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:24,730
and our community has this history in

615
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,489
the last few years of kind of moving

616
00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:29,109
forward at the most efficient route

617
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:31,570
possible and not worrying about legacy

618
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,690
compatibility so there's no way that we

619
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,119
can change all governments overnight but

620
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:39,700
we can define how it looks to fix

621
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,260
government in the future and then

622
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,700
most important thing is there are cities

623
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,620
that are interested in this at that

624
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,180
meeting with the president of Estonia we

625
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,190
were supposed to come up with policy

626
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:51,520
ideas on how to actually like hack the

627
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,260
system and fix government and I proposed

628
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,910
this procurement lightweight procurement

629
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,850
idea and I had 15 cities express

630
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,890
interest and say hey we're super

631
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,390
interested in this code for america has

632
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,060
worked with like 30 cities so far in the

633
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,470
last couple of years they just announced

634
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,730
the cities for next year and they

635
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,220
include San Francisco and Oakland and

636
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,950
they worked with like Chicago and some

637
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,050
of the other bigger cities that have are

638
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,310
doing a lot of interesting stuff there

639
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,840
are people that are being hired as chief

640
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,210
data officers now so Philadelphia just I

641
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,980
hired a guy who used to work at Code for

642
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,680
America to be in the cabinet in city as

643
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,320
C do and it's a totally awesome new role

644
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,820
because it's his job to just make sure

645
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,260
that all the data the government's

646
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,060
collecting can be interacted with with

647
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:35,970
citizens um so my pitch to everybody is

648
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,080
whatever government you live in find a

649
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,630
bug figure out how to fix it fix that in

650
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,690
in a way that does it better than how

651
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,910
the government is attempting to fix it

652
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,850
now turn it into a product and there's

653
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,130
now this interesting like early adopter

654
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,900
network of cities who are going to adopt

655
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,140
it and potentially pay you to fix the

656
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,370
problems that they're not capable of

657
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,840
fixing because government shouldn't run

658
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,230
like software companies so I think of

659
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,270
the node community as a political party

660
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,420
in a way it's very self-directed people

661
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,040
do what's fun or people do what's

662
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,710
interesting and we have these

663
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,270
lightweight rules around the core of the

664
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,860
community they're very small but people

665
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,020
are moving forward very fast and what

666
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,690
I'd like to see like with government

667
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,430
hacking and the JavaScript community is

668
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,650
people pick different parts that are a

669
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:26,710
little bit tarnished and they they find

670
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,500
a way to polish them and they're

671
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,250
implementing small things incrementally

672
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,370
and that's kind of like how JavaScript

673
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,840
has evolved over the last few years we

674
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,790
have a completely horribly ugly system

675
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,740
but we've been able to make a lot of

676
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,270
beautiful abstractions inside of it or

677
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,980
just see it for what it really is as a

678
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,810
kind of a beautiful core so like

679
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,540
government the good parts so thank you

680
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,659
everybody

681
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:57,649
uh this is a Isaac's looters cat

682
00:24:57,649 --> 00:25:00,179
Aristotle from the node project just so

683
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,909
you wanted to know I have a four minutes

684
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:05,269
for questions if anybody has questions

685
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:09,239
I'm glad we didn't die also do we have a

686
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:11,330
mic for questions I don't even know

687
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:25,889
maybe well I'll just repeat it I'll

688
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:28,830
restate it so first there's many

689
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,479
projects so it's hard to find them but

690
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:32,340
you're trying to get governments to to

691
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,499
adopt them and to be able to switch

692
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,269
easily between them and it seems like

693
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:39,029
discovery is a real issue here what how

694
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:40,499
can we fix that how can we make it

695
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:42,539
easier to find what the government needs

696
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:44,789
or have them find it for themselves I

697
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:46,379
think one of the things I learned in

698
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,359
working for one city and then going into

699
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:50,399
another city and trying to adapt the

700
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:51,960
same solutions was every city's

701
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,999
different and it's hard to write a virus

702
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:55,739
that infects multiple cities like you

703
00:25:55,739 --> 00:25:58,440
come up with one cool thing but one city

704
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,970
might think it's cool and another city

705
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,369
might not so you kind of have to it's

706
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:03,599
all about more people in more cities

707
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,639
getting involved in telling the story of

708
00:26:05,639 --> 00:26:07,320
their individual city and what they need

709
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,779
and what I'd like to see is more like

710
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,489
local developers working in the cities

711
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:12,749
they live in with the cities themselves

712
00:26:12,749 --> 00:26:14,519
I think right now it's only a couple

713
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:15,869
years of people really tinkering with

714
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:18,570
this stuff and more and more solutions

715
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,820
like the adopt system adopt a Hydran

716
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,950
adoptive ha siren that's been adopted

717
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,529
like 15 cities now and that's one of the

718
00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:27,599
cooler success stories of like in the

719
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:29,700
last 12 months since it started but it's

720
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,200
still the early days and I think that

721
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,509
it's hard to find universal solutions

722
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,789
it's more like you have one like the van

723
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:37,109
trash thing how many cities have weird

724
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:38,519
trash schedules a lot of cities don't

725
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:41,849
have that problem so it's it's

726
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:43,049
complicated but I think it's getting

727
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:50,320
better Mary oh yeah

728
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:54,930
um I'm interested in why the things

729
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,940
you've described of predicated on the

730
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,170
involvement of government so the

731
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:04,080
overarching theme seems to be making the

732
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,620
world run better but why is the

733
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,060
government the sort of Nexus of all of

734
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,480
those solutions I think that government

735
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,310
is so hard to understand right now that

736
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,370
it on one hand I appreciate the idea of

737
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,520
building a completely new system that's

738
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,580
not connected and maybe like rage

739
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,290
quitting on government and and you can

740
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,360
do a lot if you if you're not trying to

741
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,350
back forward everything but I guess that

742
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,730
that's a really good question i think

743
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,280
that maybe like the core debate is do

744
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,320
you try to fix something that's hard to

745
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,440
understand because what if we could like

746
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,800
no oops sorry what if we could know what

747
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,570
our government's doing at all times in a

748
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,070
way that's not creepy transparency but

749
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,470
positive understandability like if we

750
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,030
could truly understand the system and

751
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,130
all collaborate and actually do it

752
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,270
together which is the dream of

753
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,380
government is everybody doing everything

754
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,960
together then that would be great so I

755
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,060
guess I guess at a meta-level I would be

756
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,860
happy with these systems working in

757
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,150
society without the government's

758
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,500
involvement but if you did build a

759
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,600
system that did work it might turn into

760
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,400
a government eventually anyway so it

761
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,540
might be inevitable it's it's a

762
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,990
difficult question and with that I am

763
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:16,950
totes out of time and apparently don't
