1
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,600
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,539
I have tried to fit in with the pink team.

3
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:31,450
I wouldn't find a hairdresser to get by hair
the right color.

4
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:38,780
I'll talk about how to design for displays
that don't exist yet.

5
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,710
I'm at the Bbc R&D department.

6
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,589
It is the Public broadcaster.

7
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:47,660
It has an R&D department.

8
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:57,860
It is thet part of the organisation for investigating
new technology that might be of interest.

9
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,720
Camera's, novel distribution methods.

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,899
And I work at the user experience section.

11
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:13,310
Towards the end of the chain.

12
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,250
Industry standards or services..

13
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,310
Also mid term projects.

14
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,330
To the blue sky thinking.

15
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,640
The kind of thing I'm talking about today.

16
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:36,320
The stuff I'll talk fbsout is what we expect
to reach the consumer in 20 years time.

17
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,430
A project unconventional screens.

18
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:45,890
Emerging, unusual display technology and experiences
them.

19
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:51,670
It doesn't exist yet.

20
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,399
How we approach this problem.

21
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,190
Let me remind you how the screens have developed.

22
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,310
And this sounds pretty familiar.

23
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,820
Going back to early 2000s.

24
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,009
There was a lot of content on the web.

25
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:08,890
Everyone was using the same device.

26
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,310
A laptop or desktop.

27
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,750
That sounds straightforward.

28
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:23,360
It meant it was impossible to get your website
looking consistent across all browsers.

29
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,330
It was a problem of cross browser compatibility.

30
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,330
Browsers got more sensible about it.

31
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,540
Unfortunately, it wasn't so easy.

32
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,180
As desktop browsers was getting their act
together, there came new devices.

33
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,660
Developers were having to deal with mobiles,
tv's, tablets.

34
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,233
No one is to look at a giant monitor designed.

35
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:39,233
It wasn't the same.

36
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:40,233
But how to get optimized for the type of device.

37
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:41,233
That was the design.

38
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,530
I'll talk about it later and explain how Javascript
can push it further.

39
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,630
So, i don't want to be the bringer of bad
news.

40
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,019
This is getting worse.

41
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:50,100
Smart watches, Google Glass, Fashionable displays.

42
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,100
Smart fridges.

43
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,519
I don't know what it is, but it is cool.

44
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:53,519
Screens are getting weirder.

45
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,519
So, the screens are getting weirder.

46
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:57,250
So, not only are we going to have our content
make look beautiful.

47
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,640
We also need to think about the kind of content
that is appropriate for each device.

48
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,820
You don't want the same content on your watch
as on your smart wallpaper.

49
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,820
That might sound daunting.

50
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,470
How can we be expected to prepare cool stuff
for these devices when they don't exist.

51
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,470
Don't panic.

52
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,470
There are a few things you can do.

53
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,500
That make the process not only little less
daunting.

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,220
This is the future and it is cool.

55
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,350
I will talk you through a casestudy.

56
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,780
We went from blank sheet of paper to a working
prototype and what we are going to do with

57
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,780
it.

58
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,160
I'm hoping by sharing the approach, you might
go away with an inspiration.

59
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,739
How to make your ideas a reality.

60
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,071
This will start with a question.

61
00:03:28,071 --> 00:03:29,071
What if you could paper the walls of your
home with flexible electronic wallpaper?

62
00:03:29,071 --> 00:03:30,071
That sounds like sciencefiction.

63
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:31,071
If you look at current trends.

64
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:32,071
It is something that could be likely within
20 years time.

65
00:03:32,071 --> 00:03:34,419
Just to be clear.

66
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:35,419
The Bbc aren't going to make the wallpaper.

67
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:36,510
What we do is anticipate, and test the user
experiences.

68
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,950
And then we can be ready for the technology
when it emerges zozer I'm lucky at the Bbc.

69
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,320
Unlike other companies you have to be concerned
with profit.

70
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,090
We can provide the best user experience.

71
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,580
Focusing on openness and innovation.

72
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,670
My first view is, to take a user experience
led design approach.

73
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,260
We let the user experience drive the ideas
not the technology.

74
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,709
Certain companies have done well in the past.

75
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:57,639
There is additional approach, the other way
around.

76
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,190
They'll put loads of time in developing hardware.

77
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,190
That's great.

78
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,269
What are we going to do with it?

79
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:03,639
A good example is tv internet browsers.

80
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,639
Everyone excited.

81
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,600
But they completely overlooked the user experience.

82
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,820
There is no additional value.

83
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,030
It just didn't take off.

84
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,449
We are advocating an approach the role of
science fiction.

85
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:17,810
Demonstrating what you can do if it existed.

86
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,950
In the case of smart wallpaper we want to
show the prototype.

87
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,510
That it will create an appetite.

88
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,260
So that manufacturers will create it.

89
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,010
What does it mean in practice?

90
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,979
You need to have an open discussion.

91
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:29,220
No matter how rediculous.

92
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,020
And it is really important not to sense yourself.

93
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,490
You want to be divert.

94
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,139
No idea is too silly.

95
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:39,920
After we have done it, we converged our ideas
to the ones that seem to be plausible and

96
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
engaging.

97
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
And turn into mockups.

98
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,470
I'll show you some of them now.

99
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:50,510
This is what your livingroom might look like
after you papered it with your plain small

100
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,510
wallpaper.

101
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,710
Then you switch on the tv and start looking.

102
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,470
Here we experiment with the concept of augmenting
broadcasts.

103
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,120
At the moment it will clog up the screen.

104
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,190
We are not just looking at the livingroom.

105
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,990
How it might apply to a teenager's bedroom.

106
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,990
The Bbc provides educational services.

107
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,310
How those might be presented on small wallpaper.

108
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,930
They can see infographics.

109
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,540
They can scrible notes on the device and send
them to the wall.

110
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,150
They can turn on their favourite channel.

111
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,300
Virtual window and instagram feed.

112
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,450
Whatever they are listening to.

113
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,290
A lot of people check weather and travel.

114
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,620
The best place for that is your kitchen where
you have breakfast.

115
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,870
When you get back from work you display steps
for the recipes and you can cook along with

116
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,870
tv chefs.

117
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,870
Back in the livingroom.

118
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,960
Somebody is watching a daytime magazine show.

119
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,890
And picture frames with interesting things
you can discuss with family and friends.

120
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,680
Another idea was to build up anticipation.

121
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,950
The 50th anniversary of Dr. Who.

122
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:41,500
You could get your whole room to transform
to get you into the mood.

123
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,210
In this slide we have a virtual window.

124
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,370
Then the dr.

125
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,370
Starts appearing.

126
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,440
You get a nice spacy wall.

127
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,140
And you get scary characters creeping up.

128
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,600
Finally you are in the world of Dr. Who.

129
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,460
Some of the ideas we had when we concentrated
on creating exciting user experiences.

130
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,410
That brings me to the second principle we
tried to stick to.

131
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,890
That is: Stay agnostig to underlying hardware.

132
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,640
In the case of small wallpaper we don't know
if it is touchscreen, video screen, made of

133
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,640
tiles of displays.

134
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
Or something more.

135
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,210
The e-ink option is more likely.

136
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,330
It is less intrusive.

137
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,820
It makes it more challenging.

138
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,090
We have to think about the type of content.

139
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,270
We found that having restrictions, makes you
think more creatively.

140
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,310
We have more novel use cases than a giant
video on the wall.

141
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,030
How to go about prototyping experiences.

142
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,120
When you don't know the capabilities of the
technology.

143
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,450
We recommend using standard web technologies.

144
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,390
Any new devices will use internet protocols
and web contecned in some way.

145
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,390
That's helpful.

146
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,270
Not only that we know how to know how it will
evolve.

147
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,260
It will help with every step.

148
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,920
It is a gradual thing.

149
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,240
We are not going to leap from nothing to covering
your whole room.

150
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,690
Bigger screens in the house, in the kitchen.

151
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:58,060
As long they have a browser, there is no reason
it can't be adapted for those in the meantime.

152
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,060
So we won't.

153
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,060
Javascript.

154
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,060
With Api and backend.

155
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,530
We spent a lot of time designing the architecture
of the system to make it flexible.

156
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,310
I can't go into it now.

157
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,870
Ask me if you are interested.

158
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,600
It means that anything with a browser can
pretend to be a wall.

159
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,220
It doesn't exist yet.

160
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,550
We have to fake it as best as we could.

161
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,460
We used 2 giant projector screens.

162
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,920
We connected it.

163
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,350
And display a fullscreen browser.

164
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:32,700
To interact with the wall and change some
display.

165
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,460
By that point we had something that approximates
a smart wallpaper.

166
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,510
I will show you the film.

167
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,080
And turned them into an interactive experience.

168
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
(applause)

169
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,760
i tried to embed it in Reveal, ignore it.

170
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,120
The reason I wanted to show it.

171
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,850
You can start with an idea that is abstract.

172
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,220
By being resourceful, you can make something
that approximates it.

173
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,210
We have been doing it for a few months.

174
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,550
We chose to use web technologies, we moved
to prototype quickly.

175
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,210
What's next for us?

176
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,980
We have a lot of experimenting to do.

177
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,320
It is unusual that we use JavaScript for experiments.

178
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,130
It is for using for user products.

179
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,240
Unlike a compiled language, code changes are
instantly reflected.

180
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,610
There are so many Api's that connect with
novel hardware.

181
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,360
You can start experimenting when it is available.

182
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:33,310
Earlier I mentioned the difficulty to

183
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:50,339
get 
a content to display across devices.

184
00:08:50,339 --> 00:09:02,950
That is getting trickier.

185
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:11,050
The next major research area is how we can
use Javascript to push concepts of responsive

186
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,220
design for screens.

187
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,560
To remind you of what we mean by responsive
design.

188
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:27,290
It provides continuity between different viewing
contexts, remaining completely agnostic to

189
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:52,120
the type of device used and the size of 
the screen it has.

190
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:58,210
We don't want manually position what they
want.

191
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:02,510
We want the content flow and fit around their
furniture, taken into account people have

192
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,029
different shapes and sizes of walls.

193
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:06,330
It is not just dealing with rectangles anymore.

194
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,660
So, we can do a lot of responsive design.

195
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,380
They do a good job of dynamically packing
rectangular elements.

196
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,740
Unfortunately, rectangles are not enough.

197
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,740
Zt crrkt

198
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,240
It can be in all sizes.

199
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:31,260
We need to be experimenting with new elements.

200
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,950
And more novel Js libraries.

201
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,529
We are building a webbased tool for testing
layouts.

202
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:40,930
One is Binpacking.

203
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,020
An algorithm that is widely used.

204
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,290
For those who don't know.

205
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:49,430
It is finding the most efficient way of packing
in different shapes in bounding area.

206
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:56,510
That means that, there is no straightforward
algorithm to solve it.

207
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,600
It is a brute force approach.

208
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,550
The size of your problem increases the complexity,
the brute force approach is unsustainable.

209
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:17,850
There are heuristics that you can use that
help.

210
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:26,270
Try to place the larger shape first and the
little ones around it.

211
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:34,130
We are not primarily concerned with many things
on the wall.

212
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:42,790
We are concerned about to place in a pleasing
way.

213
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:52,120
As aspiration how to do it, we looked at currently
how it is arranged at the home zozer Using

214
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,200
algorithms in data visualisation.

215
00:11:55,200 --> 00:15:25,209
I'm wondering if they can be

216
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:44,720
a good approach with Binpacking to replicate
that human design input.

217
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:59,480
It is going to be interesting to

218
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:23,880
find out what principles we

219
00:16:23,880 --> 00:17:03,709
can take from algorithms and apply them in
the context of visual design.

220
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:17,010
I hope you will have 
a blog page.

221
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:46,980
In the meantime if you want to 
have a go and writing responsive design for

222
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:53,379
those algorithms, that will be helpful.

223
00:17:53,379 --> 00:18:09,679
Where does this leave you?

224
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:19,460
Screens are changing.

225
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:35,450
You are going to

226
00:18:35,450 --> 00:19:05,350
have to deal with it.

227
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:18,639
Start thinking how we can create extreme responsive
design.

228
00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:21,440
Don't panic.

229
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:36,389
Javascript is awesome.

230
00:19:36,389 --> 00:20:05,480
It 
is a

231
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,780
flexible tool for prototyping.

232
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:16,940
Be playful, try to prototype ideas and experiment.

233
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,139
If you want to be ahead of the curve, think
of the user experience.

234
00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:26,879
Most importantly, watch a load of scifi.

235
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:27,879
Thank you.
