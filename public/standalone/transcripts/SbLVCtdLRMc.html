<p><span data-start="2.76" data-end="3.76"><span class="speaker">Pariss</span>: All right. So, before we welcome our next speaker on stage, I want to give you</span> <span data-start="3.76" data-end="4.76">a few mind blowing fun facts about her. So, she owns three spinning wheels. She thought</span> <span data-start="4.76" data-end="6.064">the movie Hackers was about her. Why, you may ask? Before modems and AOL, she used to</span> <span data-start="6.064" data-end="7.86">hack into the telnet system at the University of Utah so she could message a college student</span> <span data-start="7.86" data-end="9.77">in Sydney, Australia, that she befriended through exploring the system. After the university</span> <span data-start="9.77" data-end="12.13">figured out that changing the password wasn't going to stop her from hacking it, they give</span> <span data-start="12.13" data-end="14.32">her her own log in, which was pretty boss. All right. So, weaving tapestries of code,</span> <span data-start="14.32" data-end="15.32">let's welcome Jen Luker. [ Applause ]</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="15.32" data-end="16.32"><span class="speaker">Jen</span>: Hey, everyone so\h this is getting to the end of the last day. How has your conference</span> <span data-start="16.32" data-end="19.34">been? Nice? Awesome. Okay. So, weaving tapestries of code. Now, this is gonna be a fun little</span> <span data-start="19.34" data-end="24.77">history lesson. Going on a bit of an adventure. Before we get started, some of you are probably</span> <span data-start="24.77" data-end="34.18">asking, you know, textiles? Why textiles of all the industries in all the world, why textiles?</span> <span data-start="34.18" data-end="38.25">I want to set up a little bit of a history lesson before we get to the history lesson.</span> <span data-start="38.25" data-end="45.69">When we are looking at textiles. I want to explain that it takes time to develop the</span> <span data-start="45.69" data-end="55.35">clothes that we all wear. Back in the mid 17th century, it actually cost about ten daysâ€™</span> <span data-start="55.35" data-end="65.46">worth of work, worth of pay, to pay for a single shirt. So, if you were to take that</span> <span data-start="65.46" data-end="70.75">money and translate it to what we do today, there are some calculations that essentially</span> <span data-start="70.75" data-end="80.95">say that this shirt would cost us between 3 and $5,000. So, we need a few updates that</span> <span data-start="80.95" data-end="84.53">actually did progress things quite a lot. We came up with the spinning wheel. Which</span> <span data-start="84.53" data-end="89.63">like one tenth of the time that it took to spin yarn, which was one of the largest chunks.</span> <span data-start="89.63" data-end="95.86">It dropped the time from 2300 hours to spin the yarn for this shirt down to about 400</span> <span data-start="95.86" data-end="101.98">hours. The other portion was weaving this. Because you're weaving ultra fine threads</span> <span data-start="101.98" data-end="108.23">in order to make something durable enough to survive. Most people only bought an outfit</span> <span data-start="108.23" data-end="116.25">a year, maybe two. That's it. So, when we're trying to consider the fact that that's how</span> <span data-start="116.25" data-end="126.03">expensive this shirt was.. let's look at these. So, mid 18th century. This was the</span> <span data-start="126.03" data-end="132.939">height of fashion in France. This is a ridiculous amount of fabric in that even shows you some</span> <span data-start="132.939" data-end="139.28">of the undergarments\h not all\h but some of the undergarments that the women wore.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="139.28" data-end="146.129">These are highly textured, patterned, beautiful pieces of work. Looking at this, this is the</span> <span data-start="146.129" data-end="158.019">most basic thing. 3 $5,000. This is unreal as far as how much this cost. So, if you look</span> <span data-start="158.019" data-end="167.579">at how much time it took to develop 18th century French silk brocade, this would take between</span> <span data-start="167.579" data-end="179.169">15 and 27 days of 12 hours a day of weaving. Because a weaver could only do about 2 inches</span> <span data-start="179.169" data-end="186.11">per day. These patterns were highly complex. It took two weavers. You had one person that</span> <span data-start="186.11" data-end="192.26">actually wove the thread and then you had the other person who stood on top of the spinning\h</span> <span data-start="192.26" data-end="200.2">or the loom itself and actually picked up the threads individually. So, this was absolutely</span> <span data-start="200.2" data-end="207.219">a bare minimum of a two person job. Taking 15 27 days. Just to make the fabric for the</span> <span data-start="207.219" data-end="220.9">outside garment. So, then we get to this picture which is one of the most famous early computing</span> <span data-start="220.9" data-end="226.93">pictures ever. This hung on the wall of Charles Babbage amongst others at the time. There</span> <span data-start="226.93" data-end="233.569">were not that many made. They were commissioned. But they were highly incredible. Charles Babbage</span> <span data-start="233.569" data-end="239.519">used to have these really big parties. And he'd invite all of the great names of the</span> <span data-start="239.519" data-end="246.18">day. Including the Duke of Wellington who was known to be extremely, extremely smart.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="246.18" data-end="251.76">And Charles Babbage kind of leaned on him and would look at him and say, so, how do</span> <span data-start="251.76" data-end="260.91">you think this picture was made? And the Duke of Wellington would look at this and he would</span> <span data-start="260.91" data-end="266.57">say, well, it looks a lot like a wood cut. And if you look at this wood cut, it actually</span> <span data-start="266.57" data-end="271.42">does look a fair amount like that wood cut. Except when you look deeper, it looks more</span> <span data-start="271.42" data-end="276.62">like your suit jacket than it does a wood cut. And that's because everything from the</span> <span data-start="276.62" data-end="283.69">words on the bottom to the image itself to the background is all woven using a Jacquard</span> <span data-start="283.69" data-end="295.88">loom. This took 24,000 cards to program. When the average French silk brocade took about</span> <span data-start="295.88" data-end="306.84">4,000. It would take months to lay this out. We got the French Jacquard loom starting in</span> <span data-start="306.84" data-end="313.13">December of 1800 was when the patent was given. It was put into production in about 1801.</span> <span data-start="313.13" data-end="316.48">And it's a little bit misleading because it's not just the loom that we're talking about.</span> <span data-start="316.48" data-end="326.34">It's basically that top box was the real innovation. But there's really nothing on this loom that</span> <span data-start="326.34" data-end="338.93">was unique to Jacquard. In 1725, Bouchon had developed his loom that used a piece of paper</span> <span data-start="338.93" data-end="345.65">that had punched holes in it to essentially line up and set the process versus the drawlooms</span> <span data-start="345.65" data-end="353.46">in the day with warp threads that allowed him to pick them up programmatically using</span> <span data-start="353.46" data-end="364.061">rods. And in 1728, three years later, his protege, Falcon, developed this one. Those</span> <span data-start="364.061" data-end="372.89">pieces of paper are really difficult, because if one rips\h and they ripped all the time\h</span> <span data-start="372.89" data-end="378.71">if you misplaced is ever so slightly, it would tear. You would have to re create the entire</span> <span data-start="378.71" data-end="385.3">piece of paper. By dividing them in two cards and having the large holes on the side so</span> <span data-start="385.3" data-end="391.58">you can mount them in the places they need to be. The positioning was much more accurate.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="391.58" data-end="396.65">Much less likely to tear and if one did tear, you could just replace one and sew it back</span> <span data-start="396.65" data-end="404.59">together. So, this was much more user friendly. However, this still required two people because</span> <span data-start="404.59" data-end="413.78">you still needed someone to lift up the cords. So, then we have the flying shuttle developed.</span> <span data-start="413.78" data-end="420.58">And I don't necessarily mean this shuttle. However, I do mean this shuttle. The reason</span> <span data-start="420.58" data-end="429.31">I had the previous image is because this is how it works. It shot the flying shuttle across</span> <span data-start="429.31" data-end="437.25">a room at 60 miles an hour. Preventing a user from having to lift up each thread and moving</span> <span data-start="437.25" data-end="445.63">it back and forth. By being able to have those things lifted, it did it for you. 20 years</span> <span data-start="445.63" data-end="457.75">later, almost, we have Vaucanson's loom. His loom was the first automatic loom. Vaucanson</span> <span data-start="457.75" data-end="469.781">was actually an automaton, he made the tambourine player and this is the digesting duck. This</span> <span data-start="469.781" data-end="476.62">is where we get, if it walks like a duck, if it talks like a duck. In fact, some people</span> <span data-start="476.62" data-end="488.67">jokingly name this the defecating duck. Because this duck would poop. So, if none of these</span> <span data-start="488.67" data-end="496.28">ideas are truly unique to Jacquard, why did he get all the credit? The answer to that</span> <span data-start="496.28" data-end="502.79">is that he brought all of these pieces to the. From Bouchon's system to lifting threads,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="502.79" data-end="512.029">Falcon's card in a loop, Kay's flying shuttle and the control system for switching cards,</span> <span data-start="512.029" data-end="518.19">that was the first time it was put together in one piece. It was maybe not the first automated</span> <span data-start="518.19" data-end="530.92">one, but it was the very first user friendly automated machine. Now, unfortunately, right</span> <span data-start="530.92" data-end="535.7">about this time, just shy of when this was developed, we had the French Revolution. And</span> <span data-start="535.7" data-end="541.37">more specifically, we had the reign of terror. It took 10 months to kill off one fifth of</span> <span data-start="541.37" data-end="549.87">the French population. 400,000 people died. Now, though that hit most of the demographics</span> <span data-start="549.87" data-end="558.13">in France, it was towards the clergy and the aristocracy. Which means that by the time</span> <span data-start="558.13" data-end="565.12">the Jacquard loom came out, nobody wanted French silk brocade. So, what happened to</span> <span data-start="565.12" data-end="573.68">our Jacquard loom? Richard Roberts, who developed every single one of the things on this list,</span> <span data-start="573.68" data-end="579.66">a wet gas meter, improved lathe, planing machine, power loom, self acting spinning mule, we</span> <span data-start="579.66" data-end="587.3">could go from four threads\h what we could do then\h up to 80 threads per machine. Dropping</span> <span data-start="587.3" data-end="594.23">what used to be 400 hoursâ€™ worth of work into 9 minutes. The gear cutting machine,</span> <span data-start="594.23" data-end="602.26">the\helectro magnet and the punching machine. He took Jacquard's loom, specifically the</span> <span data-start="602.26" data-end="612.5">head, and attached it to something that we now know as a riveter. And because of Richard</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="612.5" data-end="619.42">Roberts, we not only have the first automatic powered loom that no longer needs people to</span> <span data-start="619.42" data-end="630.23">sit there and weave. We also have industrial, military ships. And bridges. And that's where</span> <span data-start="630.23" data-end="643.33">it went. All right. So, it only took a few years, really, to get to a great majority</span> <span data-start="643.33" data-end="647.52">of the innovation. It took another 50 years for that to really come into play. But once</span> <span data-start="647.52" data-end="656.66">it did, it very quickly jumped from an automated loom into a powered loom. So, back to Charles</span> <span data-start="656.66" data-end="662.55">Babbage. One of the reasons why he was so amazed by the Jacquard loom was because he</span> <span data-start="662.55" data-end="669.4">loved the punch cards. He wanted to develop his machines to use these punch cards in order</span> <span data-start="669.4" data-end="677.27">to calculate numbers. His difference engine number one was to calculate polynomial functions</span> <span data-start="677.27" data-end="686.41">to 16 digits. And it would also print out those results for you as a test and then press</span> <span data-start="686.41" data-end="693.22">into a plate so that you could then print those out later using a printing machine.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="693.22" data-end="697.7">His analytical engine was supposed to be more general purpose. It was supposed to be that</span> <span data-start="697.7" data-end="703.589">you could program this machine to perform a calculation for you. And it didn't necessarily</span> <span data-start="703.589" data-end="710.49">matter which calculation. And after the development of this engine kind of stalled. The difference</span> <span data-start="710.49" data-end="714.36">engine number one stalled, he only developed the portion that you see on the left hand</span> <span data-start="714.36" data-end="721.779">side here. He really dug deep into the analytical machine. And after the analytical machine,</span> <span data-start="721.779" data-end="730.03">he improved his difference engine to be accurate to 31 digits. None of these were actually</span> <span data-start="730.03" data-end="737.5">built until 150 years later. For a while, you could have seen this in San Francisco.</span> <span data-start="737.5" data-end="742.56">It's now in a private collection. However, you can go online and see videos of how this</span> <span data-start="742.56" data-end="750.12">functions to this day. The machine weighs 5 tons. It's huge. And highly impractical.</span> <span data-start="750.12" data-end="756.36">There are 180,000 moving parts. But imagine if this had actually come into fruition when</span> <span data-start="756.36" data-end="768.85">it was created. What if it had been 150 years earlier? Someone else who attended his lectures</span> <span data-start="768.85" data-end="778">was Menabrea. He was a brilliant, brilliant mathematician. Babbage gave a lecture at the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="778" data-end="785.51">University of Turin on his analytical machine. And Menabrea was the one who transcripted</span> <span data-start="785.51" data-end="796.55">that lecture. The lecture itself was in French. So, he ended up hiring Ada Lovelace to translate</span> <span data-start="796.55" data-end="801.79">it back into English. Ada Lovelace, as many of you probably know, is actually the daughter</span> <span data-start="801.79" data-end="808.27">of Lord Byron, and had a volatile relationship with her mother. To the point that her mother</span> <span data-start="808.27" data-end="815.31">didn't let her learn art or poetry. She didn't want her daughter to be like Lord Byron who</span> <span data-start="815.31" data-end="825.96">had a mental insufficiency or mental instability streak. The problem, though, as strictly mathematical</span> <span data-start="825.96" data-end="833.75">as she was, she saw the world in a poetic fashion. When she looked at the machine, she</span> <span data-start="833.75" data-end="839.95">looked at the drawings for that analytical machine and saw what it could do, she realized</span> <span data-start="839.95" data-end="850.54">that machines are not meant just for calculating numbers. That they could do so much more.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="850.54" data-end="857.88">And that is her genius. That is her contribution. She ended up publishing the work with enough</span> <span data-start="857.88" data-end="864.7">footnotes to be much longer than the actual work that she transcribed in the first place.</span> <span data-start="864.7" data-end="868.39">She did have some help from Charles Babbage regarding some of the details of the machine.</span> <span data-start="868.39" data-end="875.94">The algorithm that she developed was based on a logic structure that previously existed.</span> <span data-start="875.94" data-end="889.75">So, again, she got a lot of credit because she put it all together. So, quite a few years</span> <span data-start="889.75" data-end="898.93">later, another 50 or 60 years, we have Herman Hollerith who at his doctorate thesis was</span> <span data-start="898.93" data-end="906.58">an electronic tabulating machine. The next year, the very first census used punch cards</span> <span data-start="906.58" data-end="912.55">from his company to mark off each dot for each person. And at that time it wasn't more</span> <span data-start="912.55" data-end="918.21">of a combination of dots equaled something as much as this dot meant your gender. This</span> <span data-start="918.21" data-end="923.37">to the meant your demographic. This dot meant where you lived. It was a little bit more</span> <span data-start="923.37" data-end="930.97">specific. All right. By 1911 his company, combined with three other companies to make</span> <span data-start="930.97" data-end="936.88">a fifth company called computing tabulating reporting company. Which a few years later</span> <span data-start="936.88" data-end="946.9">we now know as IBM. In 1928, IBM introduced rectangular hole, 80 column format punch cards.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="946.9" data-end="958.399">Which is why to this day our IDEs default to 88 columns. All based on Jacquard loom</span> <span data-start="958.399" data-end="967.959">punch cards. So, from 1800 to 1924, something that could have technically been developed</span> <span data-start="967.959" data-end="974.589">by 1840. We very well could have had the industrial Revolution and the computing age much earlier</span> <span data-start="974.589" data-end="984.64">than we did. So, let's talk a little bit about wartime efforts and knitting. This beautiful</span> <span data-start="984.64" data-end="989.47">quote I found says, during wartime, where there were knitters, there were often spies.</span> <span data-start="989.47" data-end="995.779">A pair of eyes watching between the click of two needles. And this was less because</span> <span data-start="995.779" data-end="1003.149">knitting was used for code and more because people didn't pay attention to knitters. Knitter</span> <span data-start="1003.149" data-end="1012.95">is grandma sitting in the corner. She's just a woman, as they'd say. But those women were</span> <span data-start="1012.95" data-end="1022.58">kind of incredible. So, the very first reference to using knitting in code, or code in knitting,</span> <span data-start="1022.58" data-end="1028.569">was Madame Defarge from the Tale of Two Cities written by Charles Dickens in 1859. He referred</span> <span data-start="1028.569" data-end="1034.36">to her\h she was just a blood thirsty woman who would sit in the meetings where they were</span> <span data-start="1034.36" data-end="1039.78">arguing about who should be the ones to be hauled off to the guillotine and she would</span> <span data-start="1039.78" data-end="1048.78">knit the names and stories of those people into her projects. In all reality, though,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1048.78" data-end="1056.059">I have to say, Belgium had some of the coolest knitters. There's one woman who parachuted</span> <span data-start="1056.059" data-end="1064.75">out of a plane, took her knitting with her, biked around France and\h not just Belgium,</span> <span data-start="1064.75" data-end="1070.17">but France and Germany\h and would talk to soldiers trying to be helpful and get information</span> <span data-start="1070.17" data-end="1075.98">from them. And then turn around and take that information back. She was one of the few that</span> <span data-start="1075.98" data-end="1080.2">actually knit some of her information into her work. All right. There's another Belgium</span> <span data-start="1080.2" data-end="1088.84">woman whose house and whose window sat over train stations. And so, while she was sitting</span> <span data-start="1088.84" data-end="1095.47">there knitting, she would be tapping her foot. And the foot tapping was in Morse code. And</span> <span data-start="1095.47" data-end="1100.99">she would be telling her children in the floor below her what she was seeing out the window.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1100.99" data-end="1105.22">Which trains were going where, where they were coming from, what they had in them, what</span> <span data-start="1105.22" data-end="1117.39">time it was, all while a German sergeant was living in their house? Another woman based</span> <span data-start="1117.39" data-end="1123.1">on the speed at which she knit was able to do the same thing except as opposed to using</span> <span data-start="1123.1" data-end="1129.91">her foot in Morse code, she would do a purl stitch if it was a passenger train and she</span> <span data-start="1129.91" data-end="1135.96">would do a yarn over if it was a supply train so they could record how often they came and</span> <span data-start="1135.96" data-end="1146.79">when they came based on her rate of knitting. In World War II, the British Office of Censorship</span> <span data-start="1146.79" data-end="1151.4">banned people from posting knitting patterns abroad because they were afraid that these</span> <span data-start="1151.4" data-end="1158.15">knitting patterns very well could have code in them. And here's one of the reasons they</span> <span data-start="1158.15" data-end="1167.09">might have thought that. The sweater I'm wearing today has two messages written into it. I</span> <span data-start="1167.09" data-end="1173.95">took the message, converted it to binary, converted binary to knitting stitches and</span> <span data-start="1173.95" data-end="1182.37">knitted them into my sweater. So, in this case, ones are knit stitches, zeros are purl</span> <span data-start="1182.37" data-end="1189.39">stitches. And yarn overs are the spaces in between the eight characters it takes to make</span> <span data-start="1189.39" data-end="1200.11">a letter. So, knitting and crocheting and weaving and stitching and embroidery goes</span> <span data-start="1200.11" data-end="1207.38">much farther than just messages and punch cards. There's some beautiful mathematical</span> <span data-start="1207.38" data-end="1215.02">things that we can do with crocheting, for instance. So, look at the middle picture.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1215.02" data-end="1222.521">The top one has two parallel lines. This is what we know as parallel lines. They are two</span> <span data-start="1222.521" data-end="1229.98">straight lines that will never cross. But in hyperbolic knitting, all three of those</span> <span data-start="1229.98" data-end="1237.93">intersecting lines on the top are parallel to the line below it. And when this woman,</span> <span data-start="1237.93" data-end="1248.46">Daina , asked, how? Why? Her teacher said, imagine it. Because we can't show you. And</span> <span data-start="1248.46" data-end="1255.9">it wasn't until 20 years later when she had to teach hyperbolic physics and geometry that</span> <span data-start="1255.9" data-end="1261.5">she really looked deeply and discovered that it was a crocheting pattern she was looking</span> <span data-start="1261.5" data-end="1268.49">at. So, she started crocheting and playing with it a bit and this is what we came up</span> <span data-start="1268.49" data-end="1272.62">with. This is one of the first versions and this is what she took to her students and</span> <span data-start="1272.62" data-end="1278.84">said, look, if you fold along these lines. They never intersect. It's not that these</span> <span data-start="1278.84" data-end="1283.72">are straight lines. It's that they are straight on the plane themselves. If you fold it into</span> <span data-start="1283.72" data-end="1288.28">a straight line, that's what they are. But if you look at them in comparison to the line</span> <span data-start="1288.28" data-end="1299.11">below it, they suffer so that they never touch. They curve into each other and out. It wasn't</span> <span data-start="1299.11" data-end="1307.76">until 1990s that we were able to actually visualize hyperbolic geometry. Because crocheting</span> <span data-start="1307.76" data-end="1315.66">is the only form of fabric that actually allows us to play with it and interact with it and</span> <span data-start="1315.66" data-end="1326.1">see it for the first time. Another version of this is the Lorenz Manifold. Though the</span> <span data-start="1326.1" data-end="1333.7">hyperbolic geometry was the first time a crocheting pattern was printed in a scientific journal,</span> <span data-start="1333.7" data-end="1339.94">this was the second only a few years later. All right. So, this is a simplified model</span> <span data-start="1339.94" data-end="1345.82">of equations describing the rising and cooling of hot air. Otherwise known as thermal convection</span> <span data-start="1345.82" data-end="1354.98">in the atmosphere. But this is the only way that we have been able to determine that we</span> <span data-start="1354.98" data-end="1360.799">can visualize these things. That we can play with them and move them and swirl them and</span> <span data-start="1360.799" data-end="1372.419">see them in a way that's stable. And in this sense, these fiber arts, these things that</span> <span data-start="1372.419" data-end="1384.46">old women knit while nobody paid attention to them, were the ways to discover mathematics.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1384.46" data-end="1387.2">Something that a lot of people are really familiar with because we wear them a lot these</span> <span data-start="1387.2" data-end="1394.26">days is infinity columns. They're Moebius strips. But something we have a lot of difficulty</span> <span data-start="1394.26" data-end="1403.871">interacting with it w is a Klein bottle, which is a three dimensional Moebius strip. Every</span> <span data-start="1403.871" data-end="1409.34">side is the outside. Every side is the inside. You can put your finger on one spot and wrap</span> <span data-start="1409.34" data-end="1419.38">all the way around and touch every surface without lifting. Without folding into an inside.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1419.38" data-end="1429.27">And beyond mathematics, we also have data visualization. There's something impactful</span> <span data-start="1429.27" data-end="1437.03">about having color and texture in front of you like this. This scarf is not actually</span> <span data-start="1437.03" data-end="1445.039">every day and one year. It's one day for a hundred years. This is defining what global</span> <span data-start="1445.039" data-end="1453.55">warming looks like over time. In another one, they decided to map their sleep patterns of</span> <span data-start="1453.55" data-end="1459.809">their children. When they were babies. Their first year. And they can see how they went</span> <span data-start="1459.809" data-end="1468.309">from very erratic and who knows when to something much more stable. And in the third one, a</span> <span data-start="1468.309" data-end="1473.02">woman who really, really hated her commute some days and was loving it on others would</span> <span data-start="1473.02" data-end="1479.84">knit different colors based on what the delay was that day. And that ended up selling on</span> <span data-start="1479.84" data-end="1495.049">eBay for $8600. Right? And sometimes the art itself can be the technology. All right? This</span> <span data-start="1495.049" data-end="1506.25">is actually functioning pianos. Functioning keys. Functions sensor. And just touch and</span> <span data-start="1506.25" data-end="1511.72">gesture motion sensors. Or sometimes it's just a QR code to allow you to connect to</span> <span data-start="1511.72" data-end="1528.67">the Wi Fi. But my question at this point is, is knitting a programming language? How far</span> <span data-start="1528.67" data-end="1534.38">have we really come with this? And if you look at knitting, there's really only these</span> <span data-start="1534.38" data-end="1540.47">three stitches. Unlike crocheting there's hundreds, thousands. Same thing with embroidery.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1540.47" data-end="1545.74">Knitting only has these three. May do them in different orders, may knit three together.</span> <span data-start="1545.74" data-end="1553.62">But in the end, it's just a knit stitch. And the purl is an opposite side of a knit stitch</span> <span data-start="1553.62" data-end="1561.169">so you're just doing it backwards. And a warn over is just a way to make space. Which is</span> <span data-start="1561.169" data-end="1576.56">how I made this sweater. Knowing that, how many of you can read this? Okay. This is a</span> <span data-start="1576.56" data-end="1590.15">full knitting language. This is\h this is the\h this is in fact us programming. We have</span> <span data-start="1590.15" data-end="1595.22">to figure out so many things in our heads. Like, how many multiples and then how many</span> <span data-start="1595.22" data-end="1601.8">we have to add. We have asterisks, we have parentheses, we have two last stitches. And</span> <span data-start="1601.8" data-end="1610.84">if you really, really look at this, you'll recognize that this is what it is. All we're</span> <span data-start="1610.84" data-end="1614.53">doing is we're saying, we have a couple\h we have some stitches that we have to do before</span> <span data-start="1614.53" data-end="1623.63">the loop starts. And then we have our loop. Or a do while in this case. Do purl one knit</span> <span data-start="1623.63" data-end="1633.76">three where we have more than three stitches left. And then we purl one and two. So, though</span> <span data-start="1633.76" data-end="1643.64">this pattern actually shows how we knit every row, the entire project, including the entire</span> <span data-start="1643.64" data-end="1670.82">brocade stitch, is on my GitHub repo. Let's see if this will let me do it. Nope. So, this</span> <span data-start="1670.82" data-end="1679.4">is essentially how it works. So, if you take those stitches and we say we want 18 inches.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1679.4" data-end="1687.299">And we knit 6 stitches per inch and we want our diamond brocade stitch, it prints out</span> <span data-start="1687.299" data-end="1691.941">not only how many cast on stitches that fit within those eight stitches, plus one. But</span> <span data-start="1691.941" data-end="1700.559">also every knit and purl that's in those repeats. So, we could either do this..</span> <span data-start="1700.559" data-end="1724.59">Or we could do that. So, I have one last quote for you. From a lovely woman named Linda Liukas.</span> <span data-start="1724.59" data-end="1730.75">She has a really energetic TED Talk that's just magical. I highly recommend you watch</span> <span data-start="1730.75" data-end="1735.41">it. There's a link on the slides. And near the middle, she said and that's why no one</span> <span data-start="1735.41" data-end="1739.74">recognized that when I was conjugating French or irregular verbs, I was actually practicing</span> <span data-start="1739.74" data-end="1744.049">my pattern recognition skills. And when I was excited about knitting, I was actually</span> <span data-start="1744.049" data-end="1749.831">following a sequence of symbolic commands that included loops inside of them. And that</span> <span data-start="1749.831" data-end="1755.19">Bernard Russell's lifelong quest to find an exact language between English and mathematics</span> <span data-start="1755.19" data-end="1767.309">found its home inside a computer. I was a computer programmer. But nobody knew it. We</span> <span data-start="1767.309" data-end="1778.09">went from an 18th century fashion fad in France all the way to mathematics and science and</span> <span data-start="1778.09" data-end="1786.52">is knitting a programming language? I have two points that I wanted to make. One, is</span> <span data-start="1786.52" data-end="1791.12">we all stand on the shoulders of giants. And just because your idea may not be absolutely</span> <span data-start="1791.12" data-end="1795.58">unique in every fashion, doesn't change the fact that it's yours and it's important and</span> <span data-start="1795.58" data-end="1803.6">it should be heard. And the other is that sometimes you have to step away from the computer</span> <span data-start="1803.6" data-end="1813.97">and play with something to truly discover something unique. I'm Jen Luker. You can find</span> <span data-start="1813.97" data-end="1820.27">me on Twitter. And if you want to know more information, I have quite a few. Please come</span> <span data-start="1820.27" data-end="1821.96">talk to me. Thank you. [ Applause ]</span> </p>
