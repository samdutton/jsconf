<p><span data-start="95.369" data-end="97.409">I have this awesome website so you type</span> <span data-start="97.409" data-end="102.63">like HTTP colon slash slash and like the</span> <span data-start="102.63" data-end="104.1">browser's were dumb they would not fill</span> <span data-start="104.1" data-end="108.21">this in for you and and then uh Oprah</span> <span data-start="108.21" data-end="109.829">like every day on her show would get up</span> <span data-start="109.829" data-end="111.149">there and Oprah would be like yes</span> <span data-start="111.149" data-end="114.72">keyword Oprah look it up on AOL and then</span> <span data-start="114.72" data-end="116.79">you get all this content from Oprah on</span> <span data-start="116.79" data-end="118.92">AOL like of course this is gonna win</span> <span data-start="118.92" data-end="121.7">Oprah is gonna win we're not gonna win</span> <span data-start="121.7" data-end="125.04">and just like I'm generally better</span> <span data-start="125.04" data-end="127.229">experience but the thing that ended up</span> <span data-start="127.229" data-end="129.479">happening is that the web had this thing</span> <span data-start="129.479" data-end="132.06">called URLs and then people who publish</span> <span data-start="132.06" data-end="132.56">them</span> <span data-start="132.56" data-end="135.11">would link to other people's URLs and</span> <span data-start="135.11" data-end="136.94">that seems like a really simple thing</span> <span data-start="136.94" data-end="138.08">and it's like this primitive that we</span> <span data-start="138.08" data-end="140.93">really take for granted but like the if</span> <span data-start="140.93" data-end="142.569">you wanted to publish something on AOL</span> <span data-start="142.569" data-end="145.37">your first step was like be Oprah and</span> <span data-start="145.37" data-end="149">then step two was like pay people to put</span> <span data-start="149" data-end="151.61">up content on the web like anybody can</span> <span data-start="151.61" data-end="153.26">get an earl and you can put up stuff and</span> <span data-start="153.26" data-end="154.459">then you can link to other people's</span> <span data-start="154.459" data-end="157.04">stuff and even though worlds were much</span> <span data-start="157.04" data-end="160.37">worse to stay than keywords they allow</span> <span data-start="160.37" data-end="162.23">these kinds of network effects to happen</span> <span data-start="162.23" data-end="163.31">because you can link to other people's</span> <span data-start="163.31" data-end="165.83">stuff so like I make my Oprah blog we</span> <span data-start="165.83" data-end="167.18">didn't have blogs in the 90s but you get</span> <span data-start="167.18" data-end="167.95">my point</span> <span data-start="167.95" data-end="170.269">and then like somebody like publishes</span> <span data-start="170.269" data-end="171.92">their list of favorite Oprah sites and</span> <span data-start="171.92" data-end="173.45">somebody makes an Oprah web ring and</span> <span data-start="173.45" data-end="175.7">this all kind of piles on together and</span> <span data-start="175.7" data-end="177.68">eventually what you end up with is this</span> <span data-start="177.68" data-end="180.019">big network graph of different people</span> <span data-start="180.019" data-end="183.62">providing different content and so Oprah</span> <span data-start="183.62" data-end="187.31">is content on a o L was a lot better</span> <span data-start="187.31" data-end="189.08">than like any one person's favorite</span> <span data-start="189.08" data-end="191.6">blogs or anything like that but when you</span> <span data-start="191.6" data-end="193.64">take the entire value of this big</span> <span data-start="193.64" data-end="195.319">network and all this activity that's</span> <span data-start="195.319" data-end="196.489">happening and all this exponential</span> <span data-start="196.489" data-end="197.959">growth of this network around all that</span> <span data-start="197.959" data-end="199.67">content it just doesn't even compare</span> <span data-start="199.67" data-end="201.35">anymore to the content that you had</span> <span data-start="201.35" data-end="203.329">inside of these portals and so these</span> <span data-start="203.329" data-end="205.4">network effects are effectively why the</span> <span data-start="205.4" data-end="208.13">web one and when we when we go to</span> <span data-start="208.13" data-end="210.41">compare the value of AOL and all just</span> <span data-start="210.41" data-end="212.209">like really high end well published</span> <span data-start="212.209" data-end="214.31">content we're comparing it to this the</span> <span data-start="214.31" data-end="217.01">value of the web which is like this huge</span> <span data-start="217.01" data-end="219.14">exponentially growing graph of data and</span> <span data-start="219.14" data-end="222.92">value that's why the web one and I think</span> <span data-start="222.92" data-end="225.29">that is really easy today to forget</span> <span data-start="225.29" data-end="226.79">about these primitives and why they were</span> <span data-start="226.79" data-end="228.82">so important we really need to unwind</span> <span data-start="228.82" data-end="231.38">our view of the web today when we think</span> <span data-start="231.38" data-end="232.91">about the web we think about standards</span> <span data-start="232.91" data-end="234.95">and browsers and web frameworks and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="234.95" data-end="236.87">JavaScript and like that is all very</span> <span data-start="236.87" data-end="239.6">important and like I you know I did no</span> <span data-start="239.6" data-end="241.489">js' stuff for nine years I think that</span> <span data-start="241.489" data-end="243.68">like javascript is very important I</span> <span data-start="243.68" data-end="245.63">serve on the node foundation it is a</span> <span data-start="245.63" data-end="249.019">very important thing but if we're</span> <span data-start="249.019" data-end="250.549">thinking about what are the current</span> <span data-start="250.549" data-end="253.1">limitations of the web and what are the</span> <span data-start="253.1" data-end="254.63">primitives that we need in order to move</span> <span data-start="254.63" data-end="256.609">forward we really need to come back to</span> <span data-start="256.609" data-end="258.44">the basics and unwind and think about</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="258.44" data-end="262.06">URLs and links so this is an earl and</span> <span data-start="262.06" data-end="264.47">there's basically three distinct parts</span> <span data-start="264.47" data-end="265.81">there's a transport</span> <span data-start="265.81" data-end="268.09">and authority and then a reference to</span> <span data-start="268.09" data-end="270.19">the content they're getting and you can</span> <span data-start="270.19" data-end="272.59">sort of think about this backwards right</span> <span data-start="272.59" data-end="274.96">first you name content that you're going</span> <span data-start="274.96" data-end="276.4">to publish so you create some kind of</span> <span data-start="276.4" data-end="278.95">name for it or like an index then</span> <span data-start="278.95" data-end="281.74">there's the who who do I ask for on the</span> <span data-start="281.74" data-end="284.11">internet for this content right and then</span> <span data-start="284.11" data-end="286.36">the transport says like how I ask this</span> <span data-start="286.36" data-end="288.73">person for that content and so when I</span> <span data-start="288.73" data-end="290.53">link to somebody else's site I'm</span> <span data-start="290.53" data-end="292.09">actually giving them a central location</span> <span data-start="292.09" data-end="293.889">to go and look this up I'm saying go to</span> <span data-start="293.889" data-end="295.96">this authority and ask somebody for this</span> <span data-start="295.96" data-end="298.36">content right and that's that's the base</span> <span data-start="298.36" data-end="300.37">primitive that we built everything for</span> <span data-start="300.37" data-end="303.46">the last 20 years on centralization is</span> <span data-start="303.46" data-end="305.35">baked into that primitive right</span> <span data-start="305.35" data-end="308.05">it's federated in in a general sense but</span> <span data-start="308.05" data-end="310.36">like the whole web is federated but</span> <span data-start="310.36" data-end="312.22">every individual actor is actually</span> <span data-start="312.22" data-end="315.22">centralized so web locations are more</span> <span data-start="315.22" data-end="316.54">than just static assets in the browser</span> <span data-start="316.54" data-end="319.75">right static assets in the browser I can</span> <span data-start="319.75" data-end="321.4">manipulate they're part of the open web</span> <span data-start="321.4" data-end="323.62">like I can and do change like everything</span> <span data-start="323.62" data-end="324.75">in facebook</span> <span data-start="324.75" data-end="326.74">sorry I don't really go to Facebook but</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="326.74" data-end="329.979">Twitter like I remove all the ads I</span> <span data-start="329.979" data-end="331.69">change words that make me stressed out</span> <span

experience the problem though</span> <span data-start="340.63" data-end="342.7">is that like Twitter and and modern web</span> <span data-start="342.7" data-end="344.02">applications in general aren't just</span> <span data-start="344.02" data-end="345.7">these static assets they pull</span> <span data-start="345.7" data-end="349.99">information out of AP eyes and those AP</span> <span

data-end="359.74">so this means that data centralization</span> <span data-start="359.74" data-end="362.47">is baked in to multi-user applications</span> <span data-start="362.47" data-end="364.78">on the web today there just isn't a good</span> <span data-start="364.78" data-end="367.18">way for me to go and build an</span> <span data-start="367.18" data-end="369.16">application that multiple

data-start="373.6" data-end="375.46">centralizing in an entire content silo</span> <span data-start="375.46" data-end="377.83">and putting an API in front of it so</span> <span data-start="377.83" data-end="379.93">this is one of the largest cost drivers</span> <span data-start="379.93" data-end="381.37">of modern applications it makes them</span> <span data-start="381.37" data-end="383.95">expensive like Brian's talking at the</span> <span data-start="383.95" data-end="385.479">beginning of the day was brilliant</span> <span data-start="385.479" data-end="387.34">because you know it really is pennies</span> <span data-start="387.34" data-end="389.169">now to just run thousands of function</span> <span data-start="389.169" data-end="391.15">executions in the cloud but if you log</span> <span data-start="391.15" data-end="392.83">like a little bit of data from all of</span> <span data-start="392.83" data-end="395.4">those calls the storage cost of the</span> <span data-start="395.4" data-end="398.04">is more expensive than the processing of</span> <span data-start="398.04" data-end="400.08">the actual cloud functions storage</span> <span data-start="400.08" data-end="401.639">actually still does cost money and</span> <span data-start="401.639" data-end="404.19">unlike lot functions that like

data-start="408.3" data-end="410.4">it's why it's such a good business to be</span> <span data-start="410.4" data-end="416.28">in like we're here so but the the</span> <span data-start="416.28" data-end="418.47">biggest problem that we really have with</span> <span data-start="418.47" data-end="421.05">with these data silos isn't just it like</span> <span data-start="421.05" data-end="422.52">we can't get our data out of them or</span> <span data-start="422.52" data-end="424.38">that they're opaque which they are it's</span> <span data-start="424.38" data-end="427.08">that they you have to basically build an</span> <span data-start="427.08" data-end="429.63">ad model to support most large websites</span> <span data-start="429.63" data-end="432.419">and that again comes back to URLs and</span> <span data-start="432.419" data-end="435.36">links if I want to benefit from the</span> <span data-start="435.36" data-end="437.19">network effects of the web I have to be</span> <span data-start="437.19" data-end="439.44">a link you to my content which means</span> <span data-start="439.44" data-end="440.669">that my content has to be publicly</span> <span data-start="440.669" data-end="442.86">accessible it can't be behind a paywall</span> <span data-start="442.86" data-end="445.44">so like any application that gets</span> <span data-start="445.44" data-end="447.03">popular enough through these network</span> <span data-start="447.03" data-end="448.979">effects is gonna have to be

data-start="454.77" data-end="456.18">started to get smarter and smarter they</span> <span data-start="456.18" data-end="457.349">started to adopt a lot of really good</span> <span data-start="457.349" data-end="458.88">machine learning and new algorithms and</span> <span data-start="458.88" data-end="460.68">eventually what they figured out is that</span> <span data-start="460.68" data-end="462.3">the best way to capture your attention</span> <span data-start="462.3" data-end="464.4">for the longest amount of time is to</span> <span data-start="464.4"

radicalizing people like on</span> <span data-start="470.699" data-end="472.44">purpose because it's a very good way to</span> <span data-start="472.44" data-end="474.44">keep you watching YouTube like forever</span> <span data-start="474.44" data-end="477.72">and our current like we don't we just</span> <span data-start="477.72" data-end="480.27">have no recourse right like the people</span> <span data-start="480.27" data-end="481.62">in this room are developers like me</span> <span data-start="481.62" data-end="483.389">we're going to build the next version of</span> <span data-start="483.389" data-end="485.94">one of these applications and we have no</span> <span data-start="485.94" data-end="487.83">other tool than to build it the same way</span> <span data-start="487.83" data-end="489.419">that we've always built it and end up</span> <span data-start="489.419" data-end="491.37">with all the exact same problems again</span> <span data-start="491.37" data-end="493.169">our only other resources literally to</span> <span data-start="493.169" data-end="494.729">yell at billionaires and try to ask them</span> <span data-start="494.729" data-end="496.289">to change their algorithms to make less</span> <span data-start="496.289" data-end="497.849">money like they didn't become</span> <span data-start="497.849"

data-end="507.75">happen so anyway let's like so like how</span> <span data-start="507.75" data-end="509.4">do we even start to address this problem</span> <span data-start="509.4" data-end="511.68">it seems like very very like huge and it</span> <span data-start="511.68" data-end="512.94">is I've spent like 10 years trying to</span> <span data-start="512.94" data-end="515.19">think about it and here's the real issue</span> <span data-start="515.19" data-end="516.9">right so we have a web application it</span> <span data-start="516.9" data-end="519.39">talks to like multiple api's those api</span> <span data-start="519.39" data-end="521.31">is end up talking to databases and other</span> <span data-start="521.31" data-end="523.32">storage solutions and like I've written</span> <span data-start="523.32" data-end="525">databases like a bunch of them from</span> <span data-start="525" data-end="527.37">quite a while now and what a database</span> <span data-start="527.37" data-end="528.69">does really is that it take</span> <span data-start="528.69" data-end="530.7">the serialization of like your data</span> <span data-start="530.7" data-end="532.82">structure and then it stores it on disk</span> <span data-start="532.82" data-end="535.47">and it stores it on disk with a bunch of</span> <span data-start="535.47" data-end="537.24">other computers usually in a network and</span> <span data-start="537.24" data-end="538.98">it makes guarantees about the state of</span> <span data-start="538.98" data-end="541.35">that data the thing that you you</span> <span data-start="541.35" data-end="542.34">probably don't even realize as a</span> <span data-start="542.34" data-end="543.57">developer because you kind of take it</span> <span data-start="543.57" data-end="545.76">for granted is that there are state</span> <span data-start="545.76" data-end="547.8">guarantees and consistency guarantees in</span> <span data-start="547.8" data-end="550.65">that serialization to disk that bubble</span> <span data-start="550.65" data-end="553.08">all the way up to the API and the state</span> <span data-start="553.08" data-end="554.64">that comes out then and then all the</span> <span data-start="554.64" data-end="555.9">caching layers that we build on those</span> <span data-start="555.9" data-end="558.48">api is to make them fast and so if we</span> <span data-start="558.48" data-end="560.64">want to like remove this API layer that</span> <span data-start="560.64" data-end="562.14">is so problematic and figure out how to</span> <span data-start="562.14" data-end="563.85">distribute it and decentralize that and</span> <span data-start="563.85" data-end="565.77">make it part of the open web we actually</span> <span data-start="565.77" data-end="568.29">have to go and dig all the way into</span> <span data-start="568.29" data-end="570.09">where that data gets serialized and</span> <span data-start="570.09" data-end="573.21">bring that into like into the browser</span> <span data-start="573.21" data-end="575.7">into the open web into a space that we</span> <span data-start="575.7" data-end="577.71">can actually work with so this will</span> <span data-start="577.71" data-end="579.36">become a little bit clearer as as I as I</span> <span data-start="579.36" data-end="582.24">move along but that's why we have to dig</span> <span data-start="582.24" data-end="584.04">so deep into this problem is because you</span> <span data-start="584.04" data-end="586.29">all of these layers in between have</span> <span data-start="586.29" data-end="587.82">consistency guarantees that bubble level</span> <span data-start="587.82" data-end="589.59">all the way from how you store data we</span> <span data-start="589.59" data-end="592.02">have to literally start to rethink what</span> <span data-start="592.02" data-end="593.73">happened when we have a data structure</span> <span data-start="593.73" data-end="596.94">in memory and we need to share it or to</span> <span data-start="596.94" data-end="598.71">serialize it long term like what happens</span> <span data-start="598.71" data-end="600.3">when it leaves the space of the memory</span> <span data-start="600.3" data-end="602.22">of our programs that's the problem we</span> <span data-start="602.22" data-end="604.02">need to solve so we come back to the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="604.02" data-end="606.21">Earle like we did the Earle has a</span> <span data-start="606.21" data-end="607.62">central authority in it we're gonna have</span> <span data-start="607.62" data-end="609.39">all the same problems so like to get rid</span> <span data-start="609.39" data-end="612.39">of the transport and the authority also</span> <span data-start="612.39" data-end="614.94">because we don't have an authority we</span> <span data-start="614.94" data-end="617.04">don't have like like the authority also</span> <span data-start="617.04" data-end="619.05">provides a namespace so we can't have</span> <span data-start="619.05" data-end="621.63">like these human names we go and create</span> <span data-start="621.63" data-end="628.41">the things we can do so eventually</span> <span data-start="628.41" data-end="629.67">people figure it out that you can do</span> <span data-start="629.67" data-end="631.4">this thing where you hash the content</span> <span data-start="631.4" data-end="634.29">and people have been using hashes for</span> <span data-start="634.29" data-end="637.62">very long time but every five years or</span> <span data-start="637.62" data-end="639.72">so we look at hashing and we realized</span> <span data-start="639.72" data-end="641.25">that there's like another problem that</span> <span data-start="641.25" data-end="643.17">we can solve with this and another whole</span> <span data-start="643.17" data-end="644.64">scope of issues that we can solve with</span> <span data-start="644.64" data-end="646.17">it and so our view of what we can do</span> <span data-start="646.17" data-end="647.339">with Cooper graphic hashing keeps</span> <span data-start="647.339" data-end="648.33">getting bigger and bigger and bigger</span> <span data-start="648.33" data-end="650.13">right and promise I'm not going to talk</span> <span data-start="650.13" data-end="654.72">about block chains so we we have so what</span> <span data-start="654.72" data-end="656.67">we have this primitive now called</span> <span data-start="656.67" data-end="658.81">content address ability or content</span> <span data-start="658.81" data-end="662.32">dressing right and the interesting thing</span> <span data-start="662.32" data-end="665.5">about content addressability is that we</span> <span data-start="665.5" data-end="669.22">get a way to address data without an</span> <span data-start="669.22" data-end="671.38">authority without a location without a</span> <span data-start="671.38" data-end="672.79">transport we can get the data from</span> <span data-start="672.79" data-end="674.74">anywhere from anybody and we have a</span> <span data-start="674.74" data-end="676.18">cryptographic guarantee that like you</span> <span data-start="676.18" data-end="678.13">told me about this hash and I got it</span> <span data-start="678.13" data-end="682.51">from like some Rando and I looked at the</span> <span data-start="682.51" data-end="684.31">data and said Oh ad does match this hash</span> <span data-start="684.31" data-end="687.1">it's kind of brilliant and then if that</span> <span data-start="687.1" data-end="688.75">data has inside of it</span> <span data-start="688.75" data-end="692.2">other hashes then changing any of those</span> <span data-start="692.2" data-end="694">links inside of that data changes the</span> <span data-start="694" data-end="695.11">hash and so we have another</span> <span data-start="695.11" data-end="696.52">cryptographic guarantee if the day ever</span> <span data-start="696.52" data-end="702.7">changes I'm just gonna move along and</span> <span data-start="702.7" data-end="704.02">start to show some of this in practice</span> <span data-start="704.02" data-end="706.69">at this point because either you're</span> <span data-start="706.69" data-end="708.07">following along or you're not and you're</span> <span data-start="708.07" data-end="709.38">not gonna get it if I keep just talking</span> <span data-start="709.38" data-end="714.52">okay so a protocol out we created this</span> <span data-start="714.52" data-end="716.5">thing called a CID or content identifier</span> <span data-start="716.5" data-end="718.96">so CID is just a very very flexible way</span> <span data-start="718.96" data-end="721.06">to say okay we have we have a hash and</span> <span data-start="721.06" data-end="722.65">then we need to know how to interpret</span> <span data-start="722.65" data-end="724.54">that hash to get links out of it because</span> <span data-start="724.54" data-end="725.77">we're not all going to use the exact</span> <span data-start="725.77" data-end="728.17">same data format so that's all it is so</span> <span data-start="728.17" data-end="729.64">you can think of it as like sort of like</span> <span data-start="729.64" data-end="732.1">a replacement for the earldom to graphic</span> <span data-start="732.1" data-end="735.64">hashing okay so if I want to like you</span> <span data-start="735.64" data-end="737.77">know publish my blog data and you want</span> <span data-start="737.77" data-end="739.57">to go read it you would say oh go get</span> <span data-start="739.57" data-end="741.97">this this content hash and then you</span> <span data-start="741.97" data-end="743.589">would get back this object it has my</span> <span data-start="743.589" data-end="746.38">posts in it okay and here's here's the</span> <span data-start="746.38" data-end="748.36">fun thing it just doesn't matter how you</span> <span data-start="748.36" data-end="750.82">get this hash right like I'm not gonna</span> <span data-start="750.82" data-end="751.9">talk about a bunch of peer-to-peer</span> <span data-start="751.9" data-end="754.06">technologies and dhts and ways to get it</span> <span data-start="754.06" data-end="756.28">data because it literally doesn't matter</span> <span data-start="756.28" data-end="757.6">you could pull it out of a centralized</span> <span data-start="757.6" data-end="758.86">store you could pull it out of a local</span> <span data-start="758.86" data-end="762.25">storage cache like anyway the nobody</span> <span data-start="762.25" data-end="765.16">cares like it's all you know the same</span> <span data-start="765.16" data-end="766.6">for together guarantees so this is how</span> <span data-start="766.6" data-end="768.28">we can create truly decentralized data</span> <span data-start="768.28" data-end="769.63">structures without worrying about like</span> <span data-start="769.63" data-end="771.64">oh well did I authenticate with the</span> <span data-start="771.64" data-end="772.839">right peer-to-peer network and things</span> <span data-start="772.839" data-end="775.69">like that anyway inside of this data</span> <span data-start="775.69" data-end="777.279">structure I have a list of posts and</span> <span data-start="777.279" data-end="779.56">then one of those posts just points to</span> <span

data-end="881.63">where we have content address data and</span> <span data-start="881.63" data-end="883.43">that you actually put all of that</span> <span data-start="883.43"
