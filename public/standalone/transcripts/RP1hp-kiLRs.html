listened to it I realized that my</span> <span data-start="1370.2" data-end="1374.31">stack was integration you know the</span> <span data-start="1374.31" data-end="1376.23">people that were in that were on this</span> <span data-start="1376.23" data-end="1379.08">panel were all talking about unit tests</span> <span data-start="1379.08" data-end="1382.59">and it was apples to oranges and I was</span> <span data-start="1382.59" data-end="1387.06">like wow so we're not talking the same</span> <span data-start="1387.06" data-end="1391.05">thing right they can unit test I need to</span>

data-end="1427.98">have been a part of I can't think of a</span> <span data-start="1427.98" data-end="1430.71">single time where we didn't come away</span> <span data-start="1430.71" data-end="1431.79">with something that the other person</span> <span data-start="1431.79" data-end="1434.25">learned and it i like to call it</span> <span data-start="1434.25"

data-end="1444.15">unrelated to what we're doing but if we</span> <span data-start="1444.15" data-end="1447.6">never had that that interaction I I</span> <span data-start="1447.6"
