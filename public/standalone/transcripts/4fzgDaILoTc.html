<p><span data-start="51.18" data-end="52.829">Li and they've basically be haunting me</span> <span data-start="52.829" data-end="55.5">my entire life because people my friends</span> <span data-start="55.5" data-end="57.629">come up to me who are also in the</span> <span data-start="57.629" data-end="60.48">industry sometimes and they're like do</span> <span data-start="60.48" data-end="62.34">you know of this company that's named</span> <span data-start="62.34" data-end="65.339">Lian Li so like this is a friend of mine</span> <span data-start="65.339" data-end="68.07">most recently was like haha I was a</span> <span data-start="68.07" data-end="70.5">computer and like I was like okay I'm</span> <span data-start="70.5" data-end="72.15">gonna be super polite and just like it</span> <span data-start="72.15" data-end="74.82">and he liked it himself again like he</span> <span data-start="74.82" data-end="76.32">liked his own post that he posted to my</span> <span data-start="76.32" data-end="78.509">timeline and he was so happy with his</span> <span data-start="78.509" data-end="81.24">post that he commented on it again with</span> <span data-start="81.24" data-end="83.909">a smiley face so this is basically my</span> <span data-start="83.909" data-end="85.53">relationship with the company Lee and</span> <span data-start="85.53" data-end="87.72">Lee so they've been haunting their whole</span> <span data-start="87.72" data-end="89.97">life like I said and I want to asked you</span> <span data-start="89.97" data-end="92.49">to help me with something this is the</span> <span data-start="92.49" data-end="95.13">situation on Twitter right now I have</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="95.13" data-end="96.96">I'm shy of a hundred and ninety</span> <span data-start="96.96" data-end="101.79">followers 191 as soon as I hit 892 I'm</span> <span data-start="101.79" data-end="103.02">gonna ask Twitter to give me the</span> <span data-start="103.02" data-end="106.77">checkmark and that will be the first</span> <span data-start="106.77" data-end="109.71">step when people start asking them like</span> <span data-start="109.71" data-end="111.99">do you know the speaker Lee Anne Lee and</span> <span data-start="111.99" data-end="113.369">they're like oh of course we do like</span> <span data-start="113.369" data-end="114.659">we've been in this business for thirty</span> <span data-start="114.659" data-end="117.57">years now so yeah please follow me on</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="117.57" data-end="121.74">Twitter or on github or on mass I have</span> <span data-start="121.74" data-end="123.36">three followers of macedon so if you</span> <span data-start="123.36" data-end="124.89">could like follow me there that would be</span> <span data-start="124.89" data-end="125.549">great</span> <span data-start="125.549" data-end="127.71">I don't think Lee Anne Lee is on there</span> <span data-start="127.71" data-end="129.959">so I might get like a checkmark there</span> <span data-start="129.959" data-end="133.59">just like that so yes that was the joke</span> <span data-start="133.59" data-end="137.129">the introduction joke something else I</span> <span data-start="137.129" data-end="139.56">do I'm a software engineer at pnina</span> <span data-start="139.56" data-end="142.59">solutions it's a company doing cloud</span> <span data-start="142.59" data-end="145.22">native consultancy based in Amsterdam</span> <span data-start="145.22" data-end="147.39">it's really not that interesting I'm not</span> <span data-start="147.39" data-end="148.67">gonna talk about my company because</span> <span data-start="148.67" data-end="152.459">that's my day job during the night or</span> <span data-start="152.459" data-end="155.19">any other time of day I am a machine</span> <span data-start="155.19" data-end="157.68">learning enthusiast and by that I mean I</span> <span data-start="157.68" data-end="159.9">have no education actually on machine</span> <span data-start="159.9" data-end="163.29">learning I just did a course on Coursera</span> <span data-start="163.29" data-end="165.36">which I highly recommend is like a</span> <span data-start="165.36" data-end="168.239">12-week sucking out your soul kind of</span> <span data-start="168.239" data-end="170.31">like super math intense course but it's</span> <span data-start="170.31" data-end="172.62">like at the others end you're like okay</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="172.62" data-end="174.48">I did something with my life</span> <span data-start="174.48" data-end="179.25">so highly recommend this course I'm</span> <span data-start="179.25" data-end="181.29">gonna show you I think I have a link on</span> <span data-start="181.29" data-end="184.05">the slide later so okay let's talk about</span> <span data-start="184.05" data-end="186.12">machine learning why do we want to do</span> <span data-start="186.12" data-end="188.34">machine learning I think who hasn't</span> <span data-start="188.34" data-end="192.06">heard of machine learning yet okay well</span> <span data-start="192.06" data-end="193.62">maybe other way around who has heard of</span> <span data-start="193.62" data-end="194.37">machine learning</span> <span data-start="194.37" data-end="199.379">okay that's most okay so for this to be</span> <span data-start="199.379" data-end="201.51">makes sense I have to take we have to</span> <span data-start="201.51" data-end="203.58">take a look at how s expert system words</span> <span data-start="203.58" data-end="205.95">so expert systems is what you built when</span> <span data-start="205.95" data-end="208.47">you do conventional coding and the idea</span> <span data-start="208.47" data-end="210.9">is kind of that you have a solution and</span> <span data-start="210.9" data-end="212.4">the solution is your code you have a</span> <span data-start="212.4" data-end="215.01">problem trying to find a solution you</span> <span data-start="215.01" data-end="218.129">write this code as a solution and for</span> <span data-start="218.129" data-end="220.2">that you kind of need like a person it</span> <span data-start="220.2" data-end="222.06">was usually a developer and the</span> <span data-start="222.06" data-end="224.4">developer has to maintain the code write</span> <span data-start="224.4" data-end="226.26">the code expand the code so everything</span> <span data-start="226.26" data-end="228.93">kind of funnels to him and for him to do</span> <span data-start="228.93" data-end="231.569">a good job he has to do things like read</span> <span data-start="231.569" data-end="234.06">documentation like use third-party</span> <span data-start="234.06" data-end="236.519">libraries maybe or maybe has to talk to</span> <span data-start="236.519" data-end="238.53">the main expert</span> <span data-start="238.53" data-end="240.959">but the important thing here to take</span> <span data-start="240.959" data-end="242.819">away from the slide basically is that</span> <span data-start="242.819" data-end="245.069">everything goes to this one person and</span> <span data-start="245.069" data-end="246.239">he has to have a perfect understanding</span> <span data-start="246.239" data-end="250.65">of the system now if we look at machine</span> <span data-start="250.65" data-end="252.84">learning it's kind of different</span> <span data-start="252.84" data-end="255.03">so the solution in machine learning is a</span> <span data-start="255.03" data-end="257.4">model the model it's a statistical model</span> <span data-start="257.4" data-end="259.739">so everything's kind of represented in</span> <span data-start="259.739" data-end="262.139">numbers and there are no like if you</span> <span data-start="262.139" data-end="264.03">didn't implement this edge case where</span> <span data-start="264.03" data-end="265.2">there's no really implementing of</span> <span data-start="265.2" data-end="267.09">educators it still works it doesn't</span> <span data-start="267.09" data-end="268.47">break it just gives you maybe like a</span> <span data-start="268.47" data-end="273.36">weird number and the model is not built</span> <span data-start="273.36" data-end="277.35">by hand by a developer it's just spit</span> <span data-start="277.35" data-end="279.479">out by code by a machine learning</span> <span data-start="279.479" data-end="282.389">algorithm so you run an algorithm and it</span> <span data-start="282.389" data-end="284.639">gives you a model in the end explained</span> <span data-start="284.639" data-end="288.479">to you and for this to work basically</span> <span data-start="288.479" data-end="291.3">for this code to run efficiently or to</span> <span data-start="291.3" data-end="293.13">do what it's supposed to do you need</span> <span data-start="293.13" data-end="296.31">some data and you may need some kind of</span> <span data-start="296.31" data-end="298.74">like data or machine learning experts so</span> <span data-start="298.74" data-end="301.26">these data ml experts do not necessarily</span> <span data-start="301.26" data-end="304.2">need to be domain experts although it</span> <span data-start="304.2" data-end="305.82">does make sense for them to understand</span> <span data-start="305.82" data-end="308.669">the domain but mainly they need to</span> <span data-start="308.669" data-end="310.74">understand the statistical basically</span> <span data-start="310.74" data-end="312.75">behavior of this pattern that they're</span> <span data-start="312.75" data-end="315.87">trying to learn and adapt to so</span> <span data-start="315.87" data-end="318.03">everything in the end kind of hinges on</span> <span data-start="318.03" data-end="320.13">the data the data has to be the right</span> <span data-start="320.13" data-end="323.58">amount the right format and yeah that's</span> <span data-start="323.58" data-end="325.74">kind of the our job here in machine</span> <span data-start="325.74" data-end="329.19">learning um so machine learning</span> <span data-start="329.19" data-end="331.5">basically the kind of the way it works</span> <span data-start="331.5" data-end="333.39">is pretty simple it's like how we learn</span> <span data-start="333.39" data-end="336.6">as well for one there's experience you</span> <span data-start="336.6" data-end="338.64">need experience that's the number of</span> <span data-start="338.64" data-end="341.13">data points so like you have like</span> <span data-start="341.13" data-end="344.88">different kinds of data points that</span> <span data-start="344.88" data-end="347.25">represent different you know instances</span> <span data-start="347.25" data-end="351.06">of the behavior you want to basically</span> <span data-start="351.06" data-end="353.729">adapt to and then the other thing the</span> <span data-start="353.729" data-end="355.86">same thing how we learn is repetition</span> <span data-start="355.86" data-end="358.95">that's basically our number of training</span> <span data-start="358.95" data-end="362.99">iterations so you were gonna have to</span> <span data-start="362.99" data-end="366.51">take the same data points and then just</span> <span data-start="366.51" data-end="369.06">train them a lot of times and by</span> <span data-start="369.06" data-end="370.4">repeating you kind</span> <span data-start="370.4" data-end="372.83">learn pattern behind it so pretty much</span> <span data-start="372.83" data-end="375.65">this is kind of how we imagine people to</span> <span data-start="375.65" data-end="376.57">learn as well</span> <span data-start="376.57" data-end="379.669">right then the other thing that people</span> <span data-start="379.669" data-end="381.29">have already asked me about like why</span> <span data-start="381.29" data-end="383.3">does everything have to be JavaScript</span> <span data-start="383.3" data-end="385.07">like can't you just not do that in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="385.07" data-end="389.54">JavaScript yes good point you could also</span> <span data-start="389.54" data-end="394.43">not do it in JavaScript no well there</span> <span data-start="394.43" data-end="396.71">are some arguments that I could make for</span> <span data-start="396.71" data-end="398.389">client-side machine learning and I think</span> <span data-start="398.389" data-end="401.12">you could think of some as well for one</span> <span data-start="401.12" data-end="404.449">like speed not everyone lives in like a</span> <span data-start="404.449" data-end="406.58">first world country some of us live in</span> <span data-start="406.58" data-end="408.53">Germany where the internet speed is not</span> <span data-start="408.53" data-end="412.34">always that great and then maybe you</span> <span data-start="412.34" data-end="414.889">don't want to wait like two minutes for</span> <span data-start="414.889" data-end="416.24">the server to answer you with the</span> <span data-start="416.24" data-end="417.88">prediction or</span> <span data-start="417.88" data-end="421.07">get from it then the other thing is</span> <span data-start="421.07" data-end="423.47">availability again if you live in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="423.47" data-end="426.8">Germany you don't always have internet</span> <span data-start="426.8" data-end="428.9">so maybe you just can't connect to the</span> <span data-start="428.9" data-end="431.09">server and so that maybe you want to do</span> <span data-start="431.09" data-end="432.71">the prediction on your client on your</span> <span data-start="432.71" data-end="436.88">website or on your phone and then the</span> <span data-start="436.88" data-end="439.7">third argument that I could bring this</span> <span data-start="439.7" data-end="444.08">security so maybe you don't want to send</span> <span data-start="444.08" data-end="447.53">your images to a third-party server to</span> <span data-start="447.53" data-end="449.24">train on it and then predict something</span> <span data-start="449.24" data-end="451.46">maybe you just want to do everything on</span> <span data-start="451.46" data-end="454.639">your phone or on your own client should</span> <span data-start="454.639" data-end="457.639">have more control over your data so all</span> <span data-start="457.639" data-end="459.919">these arguments I think are valid enough</span> <span data-start="459.919" data-end="462.05">to see effect you could build something</span> <span data-start="462.05" data-end="463.88">with JavaScript so it runs a new browser</span> <span data-start="463.88" data-end="470.09">right all right I want to try to explain</span> <span data-start="470.09" data-end="471.62">the basic principles of machine learning</span> <span data-start="471.62" data-end="473.9">to you and for that I think the best way</span> <span data-start="473.9" data-end="476.24">is to think of an example that makes</span> <span data-start="476.24" data-end="478.669">sense and then try it should translate</span> <span data-start="478.669" data-end="482.599">like those really mad C terms to things</span> <span data-start="482.599" data-end="486.74">that you know we all can understand all</span> <span data-start="486.74" data-end="490">right and the example that I picked is</span> <span data-start="490" data-end="492.62">complementary colors so the idea here is</span> <span data-start="492.62" data-end="495.11">to input a specific color which is RGB</span> <span data-start="495.11" data-end="497.389">channels so we're inputting three values</span> <span data-start="497.389" data-end="500.09">which is the value for red green and</span> <span data-start="500.09" data-end="502.55">blue and then we're outputting we're</span> <span data-start="502.55" data-end="504.41">trying to predict the</span> <span data-start="504.41" data-end="506.93">complementary color complementary color</span> <span data-start="506.93" data-end="508.1">in case you don't know it's basically</span> <span data-start="508.1" data-end="511.33">the opposite color of the color spectrum</span> <span data-start="511.33" data-end="514.73">yeah you are like no one's totally lost</span> <span data-start="514.73" data-end="519.05">here good alright so let's talk about</span> <span data-start="519.05" data-end="521.09">terminology for a while because I'm</span> <span data-start="521.09" data-end="522.5">gonna probably switch back and forth</span> <span data-start="522.5" data-end="524.93">between the machine learning words and</span> <span data-start="524.93" data-end="532.73">normal words so I'm gonna like do some</span> <span data-start="532.73" data-end="535.16">like simple diagrams so we can all be on</span> <span data-start="535.16" data-end="537.44">the same page when I expert explained</span> <span data-start="537.44" data-end="541.1">later on so first we have our input an</span> <span data-start="541.1" data-end="544.73">input it B or color the color we want to</span> <span data-start="544.73" data-end="547.39">do the complementary color prediction on</span> <span data-start="547.39" data-end="550.73">we pass that input into like a function</span> <span data-start="550.73" data-end="553.19">something like a function and then we</span> <span data-start="553.19" data-end="555.89">get an output that is the basic idea of</span> <span data-start="555.89" data-end="560.15">any system right if we were to do it not</span> <span data-start="560.15" data-end="562.1">with machine learning but with expert</span> <span data-start="562.1" data-end="563.72">system we would also have something like</span> <span data-start="563.72" data-end="567.08">that now if you look at like how we do</span> <span data-start="567.08" data-end="569.15">it in machine learning the inputs become</span> <span data-start="569.15" data-end="572.09">our features and in this case we have</span> <span data-start="572.09" data-end="573.89">three features because we have like</span> <span data-start="573.89" data-end="575.84">value for read a value for a green and a</span> <span data-start="575.84" data-end="579.2">value blue then the function would be a</span> <span data-start="579.2" data-end="582.26">network and like the network like it's a</span> <span data-start="582.26" data-end="584.57">network of nodes right and each net node</span> <span data-start="584.57" data-end="587.06">is already a function but like the</span> <span data-start="587.06" data-end="588.95">entire network would be like like a</span> <span data-start="588.95" data-end="590.57">total like a function of functions if</span> <span data-start="590.57" data-end="593.36">you know what I'm getting here but we</span> <span data-start="593.36" data-end="595.25">can look at it for now is like one</span> <span data-start="595.25" data-end="596.9">function we pass something in and then</span> <span data-start="596.9" data-end="599">we get something out and the output</span> <span data-start="599" data-end="603.41">would be our prediction now M network</span> <span data-start="603.41" data-end="604.64">and prediction have the same color here</span> <span data-start="604.64" data-end="605.78">because the prediction is always</span> <span data-start="605.78" data-end="607.64">dependent on a specific network if you</span> <span data-start="607.64" data-end="610.64">in if we put in the same values in the</span> <span data-start="610.64" data-end="612.2">exact same network you would always get</span> <span data-start="612.2" data-end="616.46">the exact same prediction now if you</span> <span data-start="616.46" data-end="618.23">want to like if you're starting with</span> <span data-start="618.23" data-end="620.06">machine learning and starting with a new</span> <span data-start="620.06" data-end="622.25">network usually your prediction is</span> <span data-start="622.25" data-end="625.64">pretty crummy and in the beginning so</span> <span data-start="625.64" data-end="629.03">what we kind of need to train is to also</span> <span data-start="629.03" data-end="631.43">know in this case what our desired</span> <span data-start="631.43" data-end="633.86">output would be what is the color that</span> <span data-start="633.86" data-end="636.86">we do want it to predict and this is</span> <span data-start="636.86" data-end="639.29">called the target this is what we want</span> <span data-start="639.29" data-end="644.54">to predict right and so in this diagram</span> <span data-start="644.54" data-end="647.35">what I wanted to show kind of is that</span> <span data-start="647.35" data-end="650.33">the blue and the green ones this is the</span> <span data-start="650.33" data-end="652.67">data that we actually need to do the</span> <span data-start="652.67" data-end="654.74">training because then the network and</span> <span data-start="654.74" data-end="655.88">the prediction is something that we're</span> <span data-start="655.88" data-end="658.16">going to come up but we're gonna train</span> <span data-start="658.16" data-end="660.32">by ourselves but we need to have like a</span> <span data-start="660.32" data-end="664.34">good data set that's the input and the</span> <span data-start="664.34" data-end="665.77">target or the features in the target</span> <span data-start="665.77" data-end="667.73">this is just important for you to</span> <span data-start="667.73" data-end="670.22">understand so a complementary Carlos is</span> <span data-start="670.22" data-end="671.83">actually a really good example because</span> <span data-start="671.83" data-end="674.18">we don't have to do a lot of data mining</span> <span data-start="674.18" data-end="676.04">we don't have to go out and you know try</span> <span data-start="676.04" data-end="678.17">to find like labeled data it's pretty</span> <span data-start="678.17" data-end="680.3">easy to just generate data on the fly</span> <span data-start="680.3" data-end="684.62">when you just want to try stuff out so</span> <span data-start="684.62" data-end="687.05">this is kind of how our input generation</span> <span data-start="687.05" data-end="688.97">could look like we just basically have</span> <span data-start="688.97" data-end="691.55">to generate a random value between 0 and</span> <span data-start="691.55" data-end="694.61">255 and then you know do that three</span> <span data-start="694.61" data-end="696.86">times put in an array that's basically</span> <span data-start="696.86" data-end="700.4">one random color and we just do that</span> <span data-start="700.4" data-end="703.07">like 10,000 times for 10,000 data points</span> <span data-start="703.07" data-end="704.93">and then there's a function for the</span> <span data-start="704.93" data-end="707.45">output which is the so this is our</span> <span data-start="707.45" data-end="710.39">desired output right I didn't put the</span> <span data-start="710.39" data-end="711.89">full function there but there's a link</span> <span data-start="711.89" data-end="713.18">to Stack Overflow if you want to check</span> <span data-start="713.18" data-end="715.61">it out how to compute our complimentary</span> <span data-start="715.61" data-end="718.07">colors just know that in the end you</span> <span data-start="718.07" data-end="721.28">again have an array with values between</span> <span data-start="721.28" data-end="726.11">0 and 255 all right to make it kind of</span> <span data-start="726.11" data-end="727.55">easier to understand what we're getting</span> <span data-start="727.55" data-end="729.23">at here how we're trying to build this</span> <span data-start="729.23" data-end="731.39">thing I'd created this nice handy</span> <span data-start="731.39" data-end="734.32">checklist so first thing we need data</span> <span data-start="734.32" data-end="738.23">got that next thing kind of need a</span> <span data-start="738.23" data-end="739.55">network thingy</span> <span data-start="739.55" data-end="742.4">to make a prediction right when we have</span> <span data-start="742.4" data-end="746.15">that doing something awesome in the end</span> <span data-start="746.15" data-end="747.23">it's gonna be awesome</span> <span data-start="747.23" data-end="749.12">that's all we need to know for now in</span> <span data-start="749.12" data-end="750.68">your network then do something awesome</span> <span data-start="750.68" data-end="754.61">gonna be awesome right the nice thing is</span> <span data-start="754.61" data-end="756.56">that we don't have to implement every</span> <span data-start="756.56" data-end="758.69">network by itself there's like Google</span> <span data-start="758.69" data-end="761.21">doing stuff like deep lunges and</span> <span data-start="761.21" data-end="763.27">different yes</span> <span data-start="763.27" data-end="766.36">it is based on tensile flow I don't know</span> <span data-start="766.36" data-end="768.64">if any of you have ever heard of tensile</span> <span data-start="768.64" data-end="771.16">flow yes I see some heads nodding and</span> <span data-start="771.16" data-end="774.13">fingers going up yes cool so deep learn</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="774.13" data-end="776.26">Jess or as it's called now actually I</span> <span data-start="776.26" data-end="778.57">think they released it like last week</span> <span data-start="778.57" data-end="779.85">thank you google</span> <span data-start="779.85" data-end="782.59">it's called tensorflow jess now it's</span> <span data-start="782.59" data-end="785.05">like I said before they changed the API</span> <span data-start="785.05" data-end="786.85">so the code I'm showing you might not be</span> <span data-start="786.85" data-end="789.82">a 100% accurate but you can still like</span> <span data-start="789.82" data-end="792.46">if you can get the NPM package of deep</span> <span data-start="792.46" data-end="796.57">learn version 0.4 I think then you can</span> <span data-start="796.57" data-end="799.51">check out the repository then you get</span> <span data-start="799.51" data-end="802.15">the right version anyways</span> <span data-start="802.15" data-end="804.7">so deep lunges provides us with a way to</span> <span data-start="804.7" data-end="806.86">build neural networks and it's actually</span> <span data-start="806.86" data-end="808.51">kind of sort of really straightforward</span> <span data-start="808.51" data-end="810.31">so I'm hoping that you know I can show</span> <span data-start="810.31" data-end="812.05">you this and you can like do it for</span> <span data-start="812.05" data-end="815.08">yourself even though you know it's not</span> <span data-start="815.08" data-end="818.68">exactly like this anymore but so a</span> <span data-start="818.68" data-end="820.99">neural network like I said before it's</span> <span data-start="820.99" data-end="824.11">the network made of notes and we don't</span> <span data-start="824.11" data-end="825.7">look at each single node we look at</span> <span data-start="825.7" data-end="830.19">these columns of nodes and I said before</span> <span data-start="830.19" data-end="832.9">each one little note and we have like</span> <span data-start="832.9" data-end="834.64">different columns and they can have a</span> <span data-start="834.64" data-end="836.71">different number of nodes doesn't really</span> <span data-start="836.71" data-end="838.21">matter just matters that it's a single</span> <span data-start="838.21" data-end="838.99">column</span> <span data-start="838.99" data-end="841.87">they can't have like weird other shapes</span> <span data-start="841.87" data-end="845.02">it's just has to be comes and then you</span> <span data-start="845.02" data-end="848.38">have this blue input basically in the</span> <span data-start="848.38" data-end="850.36">green output so the input is our</span> <span data-start="850.36" data-end="853.42">features the output is our prediction in</span> <span data-start="853.42" data-end="855.67">this case we only have two output notes</span> <span data-start="855.67" data-end="857.29">but that's just because I've do it this</span> <span data-start="857.29" data-end="859.42">way and the important thing to</span> <span data-start="859.42" data-end="861.19">understand is that each node is</span> <span data-start="861.19" data-end="864.04">connected to all the other nodes in the</span> <span data-start="864.04" data-end="867.16">next layer and the ligands that each</span> <span data-start="867.16" data-end="869.56">node connected to all the other nodes</span> <span data-start="869.56" data-end="871.6">they're not connected like in the same</span> <span data-start="871.6" data-end="877.19">layer always to the next one</span> <span data-start="877.2" data-end="881.55">right so let's look at one single note</span> <span data-start="881.55" data-end="883.32">to try to understand what's happening</span> <span data-start="883.32" data-end="885.93">there so in this case the snow like the</span> <span data-start="885.93" data-end="887.43">layer before has three notes the layer</span> <span data-start="887.43" data-end="888.87">after it has to be notes and we're just</span> <span data-start="888.87" data-end="890.73">looking at one node in this layer and</span> <span data-start="890.73" data-end="893.49">we're getting our inputs from the layer</span> <span data-start="893.49" data-end="895.079">before and those are like three</span> <span data-start="895.079" data-end="897.389">different values and kind of like doing</span> <span data-start="897.389" data-end="898.769">something with them like adding them</span> <span data-start="898.769" data-end="901.74">together to create one output and we</span> <span data-start="901.74" data-end="904.47">output this same value to all the other</span> <span data-start="904.47" data-end="906.54">notes so we receiving three different</span> <span data-start="906.54" data-end="909.269">inputs but we're outputting the same</span> <span data-start="909.269" data-end="912.42">value and now you will think for</span> <span data-start="912.42" data-end="914.37">yourself like okay we're just adding all</span> <span data-start="914.37" data-end="916.529">the inputs then all the nodes in this</span> <span data-start="916.529" data-end="919.649">layer will output the same value this is</span> <span data-start="919.649" data-end="921.48">kind of how the magic of machine</span> <span data-start="921.48" data-end="923.04">learning works is that each node has</span> <span data-start="923.04" data-end="924.42">these weights</span> <span data-start="924.42" data-end="927.209">it has like a parameters for each of</span> <span data-start="927.209" data-end="929.55">those inputs to define how important</span> <span data-start="929.55" data-end="931.92">this input is to understand this pattern</span> <span data-start="931.92" data-end="934.829">so maybe if we have come to the</span> <span data-start="934.829" data-end="936.69">complementary color prediction one of</span> <span data-start="936.69" data-end="939.029">the inputs is let's say the weather</span> <span data-start="939.029" data-end="942.42">today then hopefully the system will</span> <span data-start="942.42" data-end="944.22">kind of learn that this is a very like</span> <span data-start="944.22" data-end="946.35">doesn't really matter this input and</span> <span data-start="946.35" data-end="948.57">like will give it a very very small</span> <span data-start="948.57" data-end="950.91">weight so once you multiply it it</span> <span data-start="950.91" data-end="954.149">becomes like almost you know it doesn't</span> <span data-start="954.149" data-end="956.57">matter in your in your sum in the end</span> <span data-start="956.57" data-end="960.51">that's kind of the idea so by that</span> <span data-start="960.51" data-end="962.82">that's the magic basically of neural</span> <span data-start="962.82" data-end="965.519">networks so the weights are property of</span> <span data-start="965.519" data-end="967.98">the node so they're not property of the</span> <span data-start="967.98" data-end="970.709">input they're like that the node has the</span> <span data-start="970.709" data-end="973.62">weights and you have one weight for each</span> <span data-start="973.62" data-end="975.899">input to define how important that input</span> <span data-start="975.899" data-end="978.66">is and all the weights in one network</span> <span data-start="978.66" data-end="980.64">that those basically represent your</span> <span data-start="980.64" data-end="982.529">model because that's basically what your</span> <span data-start="982.529" data-end="986.459">model is it tells you like of all the</span> <span data-start="986.459" data-end="988.529">inputs those are the how important are</span> <span data-start="988.529" data-end="989.64">the inputs and then I'm going to</span> <span data-start="989.64" data-end="992.04">calculate them and then I can give you</span> <span data-start="992.04" data-end="993.69">like a value in the end that kind of</span> <span data-start="993.69" data-end="996.36">tells you the probability of what you</span> <span data-start="996.36" data-end="998.25">want to predict what's going to happen</span> <span data-start="998.25" data-end="1000.8">or complimentary colors or whatever you</span> <span data-start="1000.8" data-end="1003.829">want to predict so we need a weight</span> <span data-start="1003.829" data-end="1007.13">those are the most important things all</span> <span data-start="1007.13" data-end="1010.94">right in deep lunges or tens of logic</span> <span data-start="1010.94" data-end="1013.82">the columns of a network are represented</span> <span data-start="1013.82" data-end="1018.23">by a thing that's called tensor so a</span> <span data-start="1018.23" data-end="1020.78">tensor is a layer it's just one column</span> <span data-start="1020.78" data-end="1023.42">and the reason why it has to be columns</span> <span data-start="1023.42" data-end="1025.01">as because we're doing a lot of vector</span> <span data-start="1025.01" data-end="1026.66">and matrix multiplication and that is</span> <span data-start="1026.66" data-end="1028.49">also why machine learning is so powerful</span> <span data-start="1028.49" data-end="1030.34">because we can do a lot of calculations</span> <span data-start="1030.34" data-end="1035.66">in parallel with that and can do like</span> <span data-start="1035.66" data-end="1038.21">can go over a lot of data in pretty</span> <span data-start="1038.21" data-end="1041.63">short amount of time so yeah that's why</span> <span data-start="1041.63" data-end="1044.12">we need columns and rows where each</span> <span data-start="1044.12" data-end="1048.08">column represents basically a layer and</span> <span data-start="1048.08" data-end="1051.41">a row represents the data set I'm going</span> <span data-start="1051.41" data-end="1053.11">to explain that later don't yeah</span> <span data-start="1053.11" data-end="1055.28">everything's gonna come together in the</span> <span data-start="1055.28" data-end="1055.85">end I promise</span> <span data-start="1055.85" data-end="1058.97">all right tutors we have do two</span> <span data-start="1058.97" data-end="1061.01">different kinds of tensors the one kind</span> <span data-start="1061.01" data-end="1063.59">as a placeholder where okay we need a</span> <span data-start="1063.59" data-end="1066.2">name for that which is just like to find</span> <span data-start="1066.2" data-end="1068.15">it basically and then we need a size so</span> <span data-start="1068.15" data-end="1070.43">we have to know how many nodes have to</span> <span data-start="1070.43" data-end="1072.59">be in this placeholder and we need a</span> <span data-start="1072.59" data-end="1075.08">placeholder to input static values or</span> <span data-start="1075.08" data-end="1078.41">output like static values basically for</span> <span data-start="1078.41" data-end="1082.88">example for our input and target tensor</span> <span data-start="1082.88" data-end="1086.45">so this is how the code looks we as deep</span> <span data-start="1086.45" data-end="1088.82">learn the the library to give us a graph</span> <span data-start="1088.82" data-end="1090.5">because the graph is where we get all</span> <span data-start="1090.5" data-end="1092.3">our fancy tensors and everything from</span> <span data-start="1092.3" data-end="1095.51">and then we have like this placeholder</span> <span data-start="1095.51" data-end="1097.61">that is input tensor so that's where we</span> <span data-start="1097.61" data-end="1100.4">put in our features and the target</span> <span data-start="1100.4" data-end="1102.59">tensor this is where we put in our</span> <span data-start="1102.59" data-end="1106.01">desired output what we want it to and</span> <span data-start="1106.01" data-end="1108.2">since those are fixed values we know</span> <span data-start="1108.2" data-end="1109.97">them from the data set that

data-end="1307.86">already forgotten what I was talking</span> <span data-start="1307.86" data-end="1313.35">about so we have our data we now build a</span> <span data-start="1313.35" data-end="1315.78">network now we have to do something</span> <span data-start="1315.78" data-end="1318.059">awesome and then we're gonna have</span> <span data-start="1318.059" data-end="1320.909">something awesome right so let's talk</span> <span data-start="1320.909" data-end="1322.62">about this awesome thing we have to do</span> <span data-start="1322.62" data-end="1325.14">what like do you have an idea what we</span> <span data-start="1325.14" data-end="1327.179">have to do now we have our network we</span> <span data-start="1327.179" data-end="1329.73">have our data what do we think anyone</span> <span data-start="1329.73" data-end="1336.51">have an idea yes yes very good yes we</span> <span data-start="1336.51" data-end="1338.429">have to train our network because it has</span> <span data-start="1338.429" data-end="1341.179">to become better so how do we do this</span> <span data-start="1341.179" data-end="1344.1">let's just think about it like very high</span> <span data-start="1344.1" data-end="1346.53">level e very abstract we need to kind of</span> <span data-start="1346.53" data-end="1349.77">find a metric that tells us how good it</span> <span data-start="1349.77" data-end="1353.309">is how good our machine is predicting</span> <span data-start="1353.309" data-end="1353.88">right now</span> <span data-start="1353.88" data-end="1356.37">then we're gonna change something and</span> <span data-start="1356.37" data-end="1357.99">then we're gonna check the metric again</span> <span data-start="1357.99" data-end="1360.99">that's how how we kind of be better</span> <span data-start="1360.99" data-end="1363.78">that's kind of how I learned things you</span> <span data-start="1363.78" data-end="1365.669">know I was like I got like feedback</span> <span data-start="1365.669" data-end="1368.37">changed something like I'm on the right</span> <span data-start="1368.37" data-end="1372.15">track so let's talk about this metric</span> <span data-start="1372.15" data-end="1378.21">thing so we I call it cost loss or cost</span> <span data-start="1378.21" data-end="1381.45">or loss and I'm trying to explain this</span> <span data-start="1381.45" data-end="1385.86">graph to you so this is the x-axis which</span> <span data-start="1385.86" data-end="1388.169">is our input there's just a measure</span> <span data-start="1388.169" data-end="1390.15">which only have one input value right</span> <span data-start="1390.15" data-end="1392.7">now and this is the output value that we</span> <span data-start="1392.7" data-end="1395.49">have so I'm showing you this it</span> <span data-start="1395.49" data-end="1398.25">basically means this is a model or like</span> <span data-start="1398.25" data-end="1400.77">a system a pattern where when we input a</span> <span data-start="1400.77" data-end="1402.87">hundred we're gonna get an output of</span> <span data-start="1402.87" data-end="1405.27">like let's say a hundred</span> <span data-start="1405.27" data-end="1407.67">not seeing that really well we input</span> <span data-start="1407.67" data-end="1409.98">like 40 we're gonna get like I don't</span> <span data-start="1409.98" data-end="1413.31">know 40 something and then if we input</span> <span data-start="1413.31" data-end="1415.56">like 200 we're gonna get like a hundred</span> <span data-start="1415.56" data-end="1420.96">and twenty maybe so this is our reality</span> <span data-start="1420.96" data-end="1423.56">that we're trying to approximate and</span> <span data-start="1423.56" data-end="1426.63">this is our prediction this is what our</span> <span data-start="1426.63" data-end="1429.9">network is predicting right now so what</span> <span data-start="1429.9" data-end="1432.12">that means is that the distance between</span> <span data-start="1432.12" data-end="1434.76">the actual target value and what we</span> <span data-start="1434.76" data-end="1438.33">predicted for this X that distance is</span> <span data-start="1438.33" data-end="1441.33">our costs for our loss that's like how</span> <span data-start="1441.33" data-end="1443.61">far we are away from the actual correct</span> <span data-start="1443.61" data-end="1446.58">prediction or correct result or Target</span> <span data-start="1446.58" data-end="1450.99">and so because we're not like doing all</span> <span data-start="1450.99" data-end="1453.18">the calculations sequentially but like</span> <span data-start="1453.18" data-end="1456.51">parallel the cost function is all the</span> <span data-start="1456.51"

<p><span data-start="1527.97" data-end="1529.68">I'm calling and then we passing in the</span> <span data-start="1529.68" data-end="1531.54">target tensor and the prediction ten-ton</span> <span

the next thing was</span> <span data-start="1541.97" data-end="1543.73">the we need to change something to</span> <span data-start="1543.73" data-end="1546.59">change something on our network we

data-start="1558.29" data-end="1560.54">means that when the weight for our one</span> <span data-start="1560.54" data-end="1565.34">input is like 60 the loss is about like</span> <span

data-start="1577.16" data-end="1579.62">smallest loss we can have so this might</span> <span data-start="1579.62" data-end="1582.8">be the point where a weight should be</span> <span data-start="1582.8" data-end="1587.51">because like one small loss right right</span> <span data-start="1587.51" data-end="1591.08">so when we start up a network the weight</span> <span

data-end="1618.89">but the way that we can imagine is that</span> <span data-start="1618.89" data-end="1621.2">we're just taking steps towards</span> <span data-start="1621.2" data-end="1627.77">hopefully the minimum and the the closer</span> <span data-start="1627.77" data-end="1629.93">we get to the minimum the smaller the</span> <span data-start="1629.93" data-end="1633.32">steps become as well so this is kind of</span> <span data-start="1633.32" data-end="1636.08">what we're doing when we're machine</span> <span data-start="1636.08" data-end="1639.95">learning with DJs so for the optimizer</span> <span data-start="1639.95" data-end="1643.27">to implement that we need an algorithm</span> <span data-start="1643.27"

data-end="1654.89">again I will like suggest to you that</span> <span data-start="1654.89" data-end="1657.83">you just look into it yourself and then</span> <span data-start="1657.83" data-end="1659.84">we need a learning rate the learning</span> <span data-start="1659.84" data-end="1661.82">rate is just the parameter it's a number</span> <span data-start="1661.82" data-end="1664.55">that determines how big these steps are</span> <span data-start="1664.55" data-end="1666.47">so this is a small learning rate and</span> <span data-start="1666.47" data-end="1668.42">this is a big learning rate in this</span> <span data-start="1668.42" data-end="1670.19">example it kind of looks like the bigger</span> <span data-start="1670.19" data-end="1672.06">learning rate is a problem because we</span> <span data-start="1672.06" data-end="1675">move away from the minimum could be a</span> <span data-start="1675" data-end="1677.25">problem it's just something that you</span> <span data-start="1677.25" data-end="1680.13">kind of have to try out for yourself to</span> <span data-start="1680.13" data-end="1682.2">see which learning rate is best suited</span> <span data-start="1682.2" data-end="1684.69">for your problem</span> <span data-start="1684.69" data-end="1688.14">and again the implementation is or was</span> <span data-start="1688.14" data-end="1690.21">actually super simple we just had to</span> <span data-start="1690.21" data-end="1692.52">call deep learn and just say give me the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1692.52" data-end="1694.53">I don't know what the essence for but</span> <span data-start="1694.53" data-end="1696">give me the gradient descent optimizer</span> <span data-start="1696" data-end="1700.01">and then just pass in a learning rate</span> <span data-start="1700.01" data-end="1703.35">that is basically it so we already have</span> <span data-start="1703.35" data-end="1705.3">our data or network and now we set up</span> <span data-start="1705.3" data-end="1706.86">the training and all we need to do is</span> <span data-start="1706.86" data-end="1710.85">run now all of you I kind of look at me</span> <span data-start="1710.85" data-end="1712.71">like well so how does it work</span> <span data-start="1712.71" data-end="1714.72">actually I just yeah I understood what</span> <span data-start="1714.72" data-end="1715.74">you said but I still don't understand</span> <span data-start="1715.74" data-end="1718.05">how it works so I'm gonna try to show</span> <span data-start="1718.05" data-end="1720.39">you how it actually works in a super</span> <span data-start="1720.39" data-end="1723.6">nice diagram so we start out with this</span> <span data-start="1723.6" data-end="1727.91">this is our network and we have our data</span> <span data-start="1727.91" data-end="1732.57">all right we're feeding in our data into</span> <span data-start="1732.57" data-end="1734.28">our network so this is we're feeding it</span> <span data-start="1734.28" data-end="1737.22">into the input and then you know a</span> <span data-start="1737.22" data-end="1739.65">compute staff blah blah blah and then it</span> <span data-start="1739.65" data-end="1742.05">outputs three that's our prediction then</span> <span data-start="1742.05" data-end="1744.3">we look into our data again and be fine</span> <span data-start="1744.3" data-end="1747.66">out the target was actually two so what</span> <span data-start="1747.66" data-end="1749.7">we had I have to do is calculate the</span> <span data-start="1749.7" data-end="1751.7">distance in this case I'm just using</span> <span data-start="1751.7" data-end="1754.29">subtraction I mean it's not what I used</span> <span data-start="1754.29" data-end="1755.7">before like I said it was another</span> <span data-start="1755.7" data-end="1757.56">algorithm was in this case to make it</span> <span data-start="1757.56" data-end="1760.68">simple the cost is just one it's just a</span> <span data-start="1760.68" data-end="1762.99">difference then we're feeding this one</span> <span data-start="1762.99" data-end="1766.05">into our optimizer what's the optimizer</span> <span data-start="1766.05" data-end="1770.06">does is take the one and then magically</span> <span data-start="1770.06" data-end="1773.85">goes back through the and network and</span> <span data-start="1773.85" data-end="1776.01">changes all the weights so when we go</span> <span data-start="1776.01" data-end="1778.83">from the input to the back it's called</span> <span data-start="1778.83" data-end="1780.99">forward propagation because we propagate</span> <span data-start="1780.99" data-end="1783.27">all the data forward and then what the</span> <span data-start="1783.27" data-end="1785.58">optimizer does is called backwards</span> <span data-start="1785.58" data-end="1788.07">propagation because it propagates values</span> <span data-start="1788.07" data-end="1791.25">backwards the difference is when we do</span> <span data-start="1791.25" data-end="1793.38">forward propagation we take like actual</span> <span data-start="1793.38" data-end="1795.78">inputs like the feature inputs</span> <span data-start="1795.78" data-end="1797.31">pass it through to make a prediction</span> <span data-start="1797.31" data-end="1799.74">when we do backwards propagation we're</span> <span data-start="1799.74" data-end="1802.32">not actually caring about input values</span> <span data-start="1802.32" data-end="1804.63">using the cost to try to change the</span> <span data-start="1804.63" data-end="1806.85">weights so we're not actually doing</span> <span data-start="1806.85" data-end="1808.26">anything with the prediction we just</span> <span data-start="1808.26" data-end="1809.94">like we just need the prediction to know</span> <span data-start="1809.94" data-end="1812.85">how good are our network is performing</span> <span data-start="1812.85" data-end="1814.77">and then taking that information and</span> <span data-start="1814.77" data-end="1816.42">trying to change the weight in a way</span> <span data-start="1816.42" data-end="1818.4">that it's going to perform better next</span> <span data-start="1818.4" data-end="1823.05">round so this is basically the entire</span> <span data-start="1823.05" data-end="1825.42">magic which I hope is not that</span> <span data-start="1825.42" data-end="1827.34">complicated anymore I hope it makes</span> <span data-start="1827.34" data-end="1831.63">sense to you now there's like like I'm</span> <span data-start="1831.63" data-end="1834.36">going to show some code on how to</span> <span data-start="1834.36" data-end="1836.85">generate the training data but it's the</span> <span data-start="1836.85" data-end="1839.52">important thing here so I'm like</span> <span data-start="1839.52" data-end="1842.46">generating a bunch of training data here</span> <span data-start="1842.46" data-end="1845.1">is that the input data and the target</span> <span data-start="1845.1" data-end="1848.43">data data are in two separate arrays and</span> <span data-start="1848.43" data-end="1852.84">the way that they're reference is just</span> <span data-start="1852.84" data-end="1856.74">by the index and they're like two</span> <span data-start="1856.74" data-end="1859.44">separate areas at the point and also we</span> <span data-start="1859.44" data-end="1861.21">don't push just like normal arrays</span> <span data-start="1861.21" data-end="1862.77">inside there we have to pull it like</span> <span data-start="1862.77" data-end="1865.44">these deep learn areas but like I said I</span> <span data-start="1865.44" data-end="1867.39">don't know I actually haven't looked</span> <span data-start="1867.39" data-end="1869.49">into how it works in tenza flow right</span> <span data-start="1869.49" data-end="1871.71">not like what you would have to call but</span> <span data-start="1871.71" data-end="1873.69">they actually have good examples for</span> <span data-start="1873.69" data-end="1878.09">that you can just check it out anyway so</span> <span data-start="1878.09" data-end="1880.65">it's not that important what's happening</span> <span data-start="1880.65" data-end="1882.6">here it's kind of just that we have to</span> <span data-start="1882.6" data-end="1885.72">put the training data that we generated</span> <span data-start="1885.72" data-end="1888.03">have to put it in this like shuffled</span> <span data-start="1888.03" data-end="1889.95">input provider so it would shuffle the</span> <span data-start="1889.95" data-end="1891.96">data for us but the reference is still</span> <span data-start="1891.96" data-end="1894.21">intact from the input to the target</span> <span data-start="1894.21" data-end="1896.88">that's basically all like this slide</span> <span data-start="1896.88" data-end="1900.93">shows all right so when we train it when</span> <span data-start="1900.93" data-end="1902.91">we run everything now that we have</span> <span data-start="1902.91" data-end="1905.19">everything it actually it doesn't look</span> <span data-start="1905.19" data-end="1907.14">that complicated anymore we have to</span> <span data-start="1907.14" data-end="1910.89">start a session and we passed this math</span> <span data-start="1910.89" data-end="1913.98">environment and math basically tells you</span> <span data-start="1913.98" data-end="1916.35">if you are in the browser you can</span> <span data-start="1916.35" data-end="1918.99">utilize the GPU if you're not in the</span> <span data-start="1918.99" data-end="1921.63">browser you have to use the CPU and you</span> <span data-start="1921.63" data-end="1923.43">know it's nice to have things need to be</span> <span data-start="1923.43" data-end="1926.03">you because the leg runs much faster and</span> <span data-start="1926.03" data-end="1930.3">then then you work with the CPU and then</span> <span data-start="1930.3" data-end="1934.26">on this math environment you call I'm</span> <span data-start="1934.26" data-end="1935.79">going to train this</span> <span data-start="1935.79" data-end="1939.21">okay on the session call train pass it</span> <span data-start="1939.21" data-end="1941.85">okay you need the cost tensor and you</span> <span data-start="1941.85" data-end="1943.58">need the feed entries which is the data</span> <span data-start="1943.58" data-end="1945.87">the batch size basically just</span> <span data-start="1945.87" data-end="1948.39">determining how many data points are we</span> <span data-start="1948.39" data-end="1951.84">going to iterate through right now the</span> <span data-start="1951.84" data-end="1954.03">optimizer you know it like it takes the</span> <span data-start="1954.03" data-end="1957.21">cost tensor and the network and then try</span> <span data-start="1957.21" data-end="1959.7">to like change things change the weights</span> <span data-start="1959.7" data-end="1961.98">and those last parameter is just we just</span> <span data-start="1961.98" data-end="1965.94">needed to output the cost the loss that</span> <span data-start="1965.94" data-end="1968.58">we have after each bedroom so this is</span> <span data-start="1968.58" data-end="1971.34">the code and the nice thing about you</span> <span data-start="1971.34" data-end="1972.63">know running in the browser is that you</span> <span data-start="1972.63" data-end="1974.25">can utilize all the nice browser things</span> <span data-start="1974.25" data-end="1978.02">like service workers and everything so I</span> <span data-start="1978.02" data-end="1980.94">spun up a little demo and I'm gonna just</span> <span data-start="1980.94" data-end="1982.44">show you the video right now cuz it</span> <span data-start="1982.44" data-end="1985.59">takes forever for to run actually so</span> <span data-start="1985.59" data-end="1988.95">like I said what we wanted to achieve</span> <span data-start="1988.95" data-end="1991.02">was to do a complementary color</span> <span data-start="1991.02" data-end="1994.2">prediction and in this case the input</span> <span data-start="1994.2" data-end="1996.36">color will always be this like slight</span> <span data-start="1996.36" data-end="1998.82">like light purple and this is our target</span> <span data-start="1998.82" data-end="2001.46">color this is the color that we want the</span> <span data-start="2001.46" data-end="2002.99">machine to predict this is the color</span> <span data-start="2002.99" data-end="2004.37">that the machine is predicting right now</span> <span data-start="2004.37" data-end="2006.74">this is completely randomly set up so it</span> <span data-start="2006.74" data-end="2009.38">could be any color it says cost zero</span> <span data-start="2009.38" data-end="2011.24">here but that's obviously wrong because</span> <span data-start="2011.24" data-end="2012.92">cos zero would mean that we have the</span> <span data-start="2012.92" data-end="2015.56">perfect prediction it should say cost</span> <span data-start="2015.56" data-end="2019.73">one but yeah I didn't fix it and I</span> <span data-start="2019.73" data-end="2020.69">thought it would be easier to just</span> <span data-start="2020.69" data-end="2022.4">explain to you that it's not correct</span> <span data-start="2022.4" data-end="2025.79">then should actually fix it so let's</span> <span data-start="2025.79" data-end="2029.63">take a look at this video so you can see</span> <span data-start="2029.63" data-end="2031.88">that it's like slowly like changing the</span> <span data-start="2031.88" data-end="2033.65">values and getting like better and you</span> <span data-start="2033.65" data-end="2036.64">can also see that the cost is getting</span> <span data-start="2036.64" data-end="2038.39">smaller and smaller</span> <span data-start="2038.39" data-end="2040.73">and then at some points I'm running like</span> <span data-start="2040.73" data-end="2042.83">a thousand patch this year I think so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2042.83" data-end="2045.95">I'm running a 25 batch size and doing it</span> <span data-start="2045.95" data-end="2047.99">I'll run a thousand batches and here at</span> <span data-start="2047.99" data-end="2050.87">the end I don't know how you feel about</span> <span data-start="2050.87" data-end="2052.46">it but I think it's like almost</span> <span data-start="2052.46" data-end="2054.83">indistinguishable the difference and if</span> <span data-start="2054.83" data-end="2057.409">you like if we look at the beginning it</span> <span data-start="2057.409" data-end="2059.57">starts all like with this and it like</span> <span data-start="2059.57" data-end="2062.72">really gradually very slowly kind of</span> <span data-start="2062.72" data-end="2065.77">like approximates the actual value and</span> <span data-start="2065.77" data-end="2067.55">but</span> <span data-start="2067.55" data-end="2069.139">every time you set it up it starts</span> <span data-start="2069.139" data-end="2071.119">completely randomly so I had to make a</span> <span data-start="2071.119" data-end="2073.099">video of like a nice run that actually</span> <span data-start="2073.099" data-end="2076.7">shows what I want to show but you know</span> <span data-start="2076.7" data-end="2078.32">you can like I said you can check out</span> <span data-start="2078.32" data-end="2080.119">the repository and just try it for</span> <span data-start="2080.119" data-end="2083.359">yourself this was one example from</span> </p>
