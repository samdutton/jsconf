<p><span data-start="14.11" data-end="19.06">thanks everybody thanks to jay s comp</span> <span data-start="19.06" data-end="21.349">I'm going to try it the first part of</span> <span data-start="21.349" data-end="23.09">the slides hopefully is going to be</span> <span data-start="23.09" data-end="24.59">somewhat entertaining it's kind of a</span> <span data-start="24.59" data-end="27.349">reminiscence of this conference and some</span> <span data-start="27.349" data-end="28.67">other just some sort of getting started</span> <span data-start="28.67" data-end="32.78">stuff so first of all a great big thanks</span> <span data-start="32.78" data-end="35.69">to John Charles Sisk who's a teammate of</span> <span data-start="35.69" data-end="37.94">virus on the kraken team who got this</span> <span data-start="37.94" data-end="40.76">slot and then gave it to me he's not</span> <span data-start="40.76" data-end="43.489">here he had to leave early and he sent</span> <span data-start="43.489" data-end="45.17">us this picture in slack and he actually</span> <span data-start="45.17" data-end="46.97">was not wearing a shirt so I did</span> <span data-start="46.97" data-end="49.1">everybody a favor and just really</span> <span data-start="49.1" data-end="53.839">quickly put a put a shirt on him he's</span> <span data-start="53.839" data-end="55.369">got so much chest hair it almost looked</span> <span data-start="55.369" data-end="56.75">like he had a sweater on but still it</span> <span data-start="56.75" data-end="61.97">was ok also it's been a long conference</span> <span data-start="61.97" data-end="63.68">and at this point for those of you who</span> <span data-start="63.68" data-end="65.36">have families that didn't travel with</span> <span data-start="65.36" data-end="67.79">you I'm sure you missed them i miss my</span> <span data-start="67.79" data-end="70.61">daughter the movie star and my son the</span> <span data-start="70.61" data-end="75.47">movie star it's unfortunate max max gets</span> <span data-start="75.47" data-end="77.329">two pictures because he's he's something</span> <span data-start="77.329" data-end="82.1">so that's him trying on my shorts I took</span> <span data-start="82.1" data-end="86.149">a while right ok so another kind of</span> <span data-start="86.149" data-end="88.579">reminiscence is that I grew up in the</span> <span data-start="88.579" data-end="92.39">80s as a lot of us did and there was</span> <span data-start="92.39" data-end="95.689">aspects of the 80s that still today seem</span> <span data-start="95.689" data-end="96.89">like they didn't ever happen and they</span> <span data-start="96.89" data-end="99.14">might not ever happen but they happen or</span> <span data-start="99.14" data-end="101.06">they seem to have happened and that's</span> <span data-start="101.06" data-end="103.939">the thing about nostalgia is that you</span> <span data-start="103.939" data-end="105.53">know when something's happening it's</span> <span data-start="105.53" data-end="107.21">hard to tell that it's this magical</span> <span data-start="107.21" data-end="108.71">thing it's only later on you look back</span> <span data-start="108.71" data-end="110.509">and you kind of pick that out as a time</span> <span data-start="110.509" data-end="112.7">period and say you know this thing this</span> <span data-start="112.7" data-end="116.45">thing was pretty special in fact when</span> <span data-start="116.45" data-end="118.429">during the 80s I was spending a lot of</span> <span data-start="118.429" data-end="119.63">time trying to pretend it wasn't</span> <span data-start="119.63" data-end="121.159">happening because some of that you know</span> <span data-start="121.159" data-end="123.889">some of the culture was felt you know we</span> <span data-start="123.889" data-end="126.139">kind of felt wrong in a way but any case</span> <span data-start="126.139" data-end="128.899">in the future keyboards will be held</span> <span data-start="128.899" data-end="131.42">like guitars it's hard to imagine but it</span> <span data-start="131.42" data-end="134.95">will happen someday cops will wear toms</span> <span data-start="134.95" data-end="139.81">so no socks and they'll drive Ferraris</span> <span data-start="139.81" data-end="142.27">there will be a media channel devoted to</span> <span data-start="142.27" data-end="147.489">music videos and cars will have gold</span> <span data-start="147.489" data-end="150.52">wing doors and people will dress up in</span> <span data-start="150.52" data-end="153.55">the desperate Star Wars movies will be</span> <span data-start="153.55" data-end="157.93">good got to look forward to that okay my</span> <span data-start="157.93" data-end="159.91">point is it sort of made it part of my</span> <span data-start="159.91" data-end="161.26">point is that when I when I get a few</span> <span data-start="161.26" data-end="162.76">drinks in me all pick a ridiculous</span> <span data-start="162.76" data-end="164.319">premise like the 80s is the future and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="164.319" data-end="165.64">I'll try to defend that while everybody</span> <span data-start="165.64" data-end="167.08">around looks at me like I'm crazy so</span> <span data-start="167.08" data-end="169.03">just wanted to bring that to that</span> <span data-start="169.03" data-end="172.269">happened a couple of nights ago so let</span> <span data-start="172.269" data-end="174.16">me move on into what's happened to</span> <span data-start="174.16" data-end="178.15">paypal since we started using nodejs it</span> <span data-start="178.15" data-end="181.299">came in as a prototyping framework so</span> <span data-start="181.299" data-end="184.15">some people came over from netflix bill</span> <span data-start="184.15" data-end="187.36">Scott Jeff Harrell Eric Toth and they</span> <span data-start="187.36" data-end="189.989">basically said hey we want to transform</span> <span data-start="189.989" data-end="192.22">you know what's going on at PayPal in a</span> <span data-start="192.22" data-end="193.36">lot of ways and part of that is the</span> <span data-start="193.36" data-end="195.599">technology so let's see if we can build</span> <span data-start="195.599" data-end="198.519">you know product faster with nodejs then</span> <span data-start="198.519" data-end="200.769">we were able to with job and that's</span> <span data-start="200.769" data-end="202.269">something that happened and there's some</span> <span data-start="202.269" data-end="204.31">talks around that Jeff's given some</span> <span data-start="204.31" data-end="205.63">talks about that so I'm not going to go</span> <span data-start="205.63" data-end="208.15">into great detail but the result was</span> <span data-start="208.15" data-end="209.95">that we started developing all of our</span> <span data-start="209.95" data-end="211.63">products all of our web and mid-tier</span> <span data-start="211.63" data-end="214.329">products on crack and jas which sits</span> <span data-start="214.329" data-end="218.38">over expressed so what that left us with</span> <span data-start="218.38" data-end="220.72">was people writing applications in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="220.72" data-end="223">JavaScript but still writing the</span> <span data-start="223" data-end="225.7">automation tests using Java using the</span> <span data-start="225.7" data-end="227.35">framework that we use to write tests in</span> <span data-start="227.35" data-end="233.29">Java so before I get to that if you</span> <span data-start="233.29" data-end="235.09">weren't here for Dave cadwaladrs talk</span> <span data-start="235.09" data-end="236.92">earlier he showed the testing pyramid</span> <span data-start="236.92" data-end="239.709">where UI tests it at the top that's a</span> <span data-start="239.709" data-end="241.48">great pyramid and some people at PayPal</span> <span data-start="241.48" data-end="244.66">flight like to use that analogy as well</span> <span data-start="244.66" data-end="246.22">it's not in my slides but I just wanted</span> <span data-start="246.22" data-end="247.48">say you know I agree with that as well</span> <span data-start="247.48" data-end="250.09">that UI tests you know are important and</span> <span data-start="250.09" data-end="251.35">they sit you know on the top they</span> <span data-start="251.35" data-end="254.65">shouldn't be everything you rely upon so</span> <span data-start="254.65" data-end="257.709">why should you test well let's take an</span> <span data-start="257.709" data-end="260.26">analogy so here's John Charles Sisk</span> <span data-start="260.26" data-end="262.08">again and this is from a golfing</span> <span data-start="262.08" data-end="264.46">excursion that I wasn't on yesterday I</span> <span data-start="264.46" data-end="268.18">guess but we'll use golf as an analogy</span> <span data-start="268.18" data-end="271.12">for web development or product</span> <span data-start="271.12" data-end="272.979">development and these guys who went</span> <span data-start="272.979" data-end="273.49">golfing</span> <span data-start="273.49" data-end="274.99">are some of the best developers we have</span> <span data-start="274.99" data-end="277.539">at the company so let's say they're the</span> <span data-start="277.539" data-end="278.979">best golfers that you could possibly</span> <span data-start="278.979" data-end="280.15">have so they went to the golf course</span> <span data-start="280.15" data-end="283">with their golf sticks to knock the ball</span> <span data-start="283" data-end="287.44">into the into the goal so here here's</span> <span data-start="287.44" data-end="288.91">them starting out there having a great</span> <span data-start="288.91" data-end="293.889">day their developers look at that that's</span> <span data-start="293.889" data-end="296.86">beautiful form right so you know they're</span> <span data-start="296.86" data-end="298.24">great they should never make any</span> <span data-start="298.24" data-end="299.74">mistakes because you going out your</span> <span data-start="299.74" data-end="301.06">golfing everything's fine you know how</span> <span data-start="301.06" data-end="303.069">to golf you're a great golfer okay well</span> <span data-start="303.069" data-end="304.99">but sometimes you don't have your best</span> <span data-start="304.99" data-end="307.27">day sometimes you know maybe you stayed</span> <span data-start="307.27" data-end="308.47">up the night before or you're just</span> <span data-start="308.47" data-end="309.789">you're a little bit distracted so</span> <span data-start="309.789" data-end="313.479">mistakes get made and sometimes side</span> <span data-start="313.479" data-end="319.229">effects get introduced into your code so</span> <span data-start="319.229" data-end="322.9">call that the side it back anyway okay</span> <span data-start="322.9" data-end="329.59">and here's here's Jeff taking a swing so</span> <span data-start="329.59" data-end="332.349">why test well even great developers have</span> <span data-start="332.349" data-end="334.09">their days when something gets through</span> <span data-start="334.09" data-end="336.4">right so that that's why test oh and</span> <span data-start="336.4" data-end="338.05">sometimes turtles end up on the golf</span> <span data-start="338.05" data-end="343.599">course as well moving fast for a turtle</span> <span data-start="343.599" data-end="347.009">right okay so let's test finally</span> <span data-start="347.009" data-end="349.719">selenium 101 for those of you who don't</span> <span data-start="349.719" data-end="352">kind of use it on a day-to-day basis or</span> <span data-start="352" data-end="353.44">have a lot of familiarity with it is</span> <span data-start="353.44" data-end="356.77">this fairly complex system whereby</span> <span data-start="356.77" data-end="358.75">you've got your language binding on the</span> <span data-start="358.75" data-end="360.49">left there where you write your test</span> <span data-start="360.49" data-end="362.52">whether it's in Java Python JavaScript</span> <span data-start="362.52" data-end="365.02">and then you've got JSON wire protocol</span> <span data-start="365.02" data-end="366.55">that communicates with some sort of</span> <span data-start="366.55" data-end="369.46">intermediary like a browser driver so it</span> <span data-start="369.46" data-end="370.87">might communicate with the driver on</span> <span data-start="370.87" data-end="373.21">your system itself or it might</span> <span data-start="373.21" data-end="375.009">communicate with the cloud that then</span> <span data-start="375.009" data-end="377.229">opens up another target and does some</span> <span data-start="377.229" data-end="379.96">stuff so this is this is just kind of</span> <span data-start="379.96" data-end="382.21">again kind of 101 and there's the rabbit</span> <span data-start="382.21" data-end="383.8">in the Hat because to me this stuff to</span> <span data-start="383.8" data-end="385.9">the right is magic and it works or</span> <span data-start="385.9" data-end="387.28">there's bugs and sometimes you have to</span> <span data-start="387.28" data-end="388.659">kind of figure out what you know which</span> <span data-start="388.659" data-end="391.03">of those components has a bug and report</span> <span data-start="391.03" data-end="393.34">it to the selenium team but for the most</span> <span data-start="393.34" data-end="395.62">part we're going to be on the left side</span> <span data-start="395.62" data-end="398.56">so where does Nemo fit it fits on this</span> <span data-start="398.56" data-end="401.5">left side where the language bindings</span> <span data-start="401.5" data-end="404.529">were so selenium webdriver is an NPM</span> <span data-start="404.529" data-end="407.11">module that has the JavaScript bindings</span> <span data-start="407.11" data-end="409.6">and it starts a you know a server if</span> <span data-start="409.6" data-end="412.36">necessary it sets capabilities it</span> <span data-start="412.36" data-end="416.35">provides the webdriver API and it you</span> <span data-start="416.35" data-end="418">know gives you the tools that you need</span> <span data-start="418" data-end="420.04">to execute commands and control browser</span> <span data-start="420.04" data-end="423.7">or device so what Nemo does is it sits</span> <span data-start="423.7" data-end="427.99">around that it's a rapper that basically</span> <span data-start="427.99" data-end="430">gives you some tools for configuring</span> <span data-start="430" data-end="433.93">that webdriver and also gives you a</span> <span data-start="433.93" data-end="436.81">plug-in capability so that you can kind</span> <span data-start="436.81" data-end="438.82">of make the system that you need it's</span> <span data-start="438.82" data-end="440.95">it's nothing but giving you the tools to</span> <span data-start="440.95" data-end="443.59">make the system that you need and and</span> <span data-start="443.59" data-end="445.18">you know we're going to look at some of</span> <span data-start="445.18" data-end="447.55">the plugins that I've made that I think</span> <span data-start="447.55" data-end="448.84">makes the most sense but the idea is</span> <span data-start="448.84" data-end="451.27">that anybody can come and make their own</span> <span data-start="451.27" data-end="453.16">set of plugins to do to do the things</span> <span data-start="453.16" data-end="456.22">that they need to do so the the plug-in</span> <span data-start="456.22" data-end="459.04">that I use primarily is called Nemo view</span> <span data-start="459.04" data-end="461.92">which we're going to go into and you</span> <span data-start="461.92" data-end="463.78">know other plugins so whatever you want</span> <span data-start="463.78" data-end="465.19">to put in there whatever you need kind</span> <span data-start="465.19" data-end="467.86">of a thing on top of that so at this</span> <span data-start="467.86" data-end="469.27">point we're just launching a webdriver</span> <span data-start="469.27" data-end="470.71">we're just launching a browser and</span> <span data-start="470.71" data-end="472.48">running commands but you still have to</span> <span data-start="472.48" data-end="474.1">have some sort of a test run or like</span> <span data-start="474.1" data-end="477.6">mocha or cucumber or jasmine or whatever</span> <span data-start="477.6" data-end="481.18">so that's something but again Nemo isn't</span> <span data-start="481.18" data-end="482.71">prescribing what you use it's just</span> <span data-start="482.71" data-end="484.15">saying here's here's this piece of it</span> <span data-start="484.15" data-end="486.7">now you know you use your test runner we</span> <span data-start="486.7" data-end="488.5">like to use mocha so all of my examples</span> <span data-start="488.5" data-end="491.35">use mocha and then on top of that you</span> <span data-start="491.35" data-end="494.41">need a task runner usually and at PayPal</span> <span data-start="494.41" data-end="496.45">we've been using grunt a lot people are</span> <span data-start="496.45" data-end="498.04">poking around with Gulf and obviously</span> <span data-start="498.04" data-end="500.2">for private projects people are but it's</span> <span data-start="500.2" data-end="502.09">not at least within paypal it's not</span> <span data-start="502.09" data-end="505.03">being heavily used yet and then I heard</span> <span data-start="505.03" data-end="506.47">of one called broccoli but I haven't</span> <span data-start="506.47" data-end="510.1">looked into it yeah so you need kind of</span> <span data-start="510.1" data-end="511.75">all these components to make a full</span> <span data-start="511.75" data-end="515.35">automation solution and if you look at</span> <span data-start="515.35" data-end="517.83">the selenium webdriver example script</span> <span data-start="517.83" data-end="520.51">for how to get started in JavaScript</span> <span data-start="520.51" data-end="524.05">this is the basic script that you see so</span> <span data-start="524.05" data-end="525.67">what we want to do was to take it from</span> <span data-start="525.67" data-end="529.36">here to here so that all this all this</span> <span data-start="529.36" data-end="530.98">other stuff like you see a lot of</span> <span data-start="530.98"

data-start="1114.63" data-end="1116.28">you should be interested in so there's</span> <span data-start="1116.28" data-end="1118.74">this locator directory that you should</span> <span data-start="1118.74" data-end="1120.15">look at so here's an example of a</span> <span data-start="1120.15" data-end="1122.79">locator file it's just simple JSON and</span> <span data-start="1122.79" data-end="1124.8">you can see that it's got a type and a</span> <span data-start="1124.8" data-end="1126.92">locator so this is just defining</span> <span data-start="1126.92" data-end="1131.7">elements for in this case a bank a bank</span> <span data-start="1131.7" data-end="1134.04">form so there's a number routing button</span> <span data-start="1134.04" data-end="1135.96">and then success and failure and we see</span> <span data-start="1135.96" data-end="1138.09">how those are used in a minute so what</span> <span data-start="1138.09" data-end="1139.8">happens is that Nemo view is going to</span> <span data-start="1139.8" data-end="1142.11">generate functions that something</span> <span data-start="1142.11" data-end="1144.06">javascript is great at its generating</span> <span data-start="1144.06" data-end="1145.86">dynamic functions for each of the</span> <span data-start="1145.86" data-end="1149.58">locators so look at the number and for</span> <span data-start="1149.58" data-end="1150.84">the number you're going to get all these</span> <span data-start="1150.84" data-end="1152.91">functions back you're going to get the</span> <span data-start="1152.91" data-end="1154.83">basic one which returns the web element</span> <span data-start="1154.83" data-end="1157.02">and then all these other ones that can</span> <span data-start="1157.02" data-end="1160.29">do different things so this is what it</span> <span data-start="1160.29" data-end="1163.53">looks like to add a bank using using</span> <span data-start="1163.53" data-end="1166.2">that view so you're you're we're setting</span> <span data-start="1166.2" data-end="1168.15">a couple of convenience variables and</span> <span data-start="1168.15" data-end="1171.12">then we're using the the Nemo view</span> <span data-start="1171.12" data-end="1176.11">methods to work through that that you I</span> <span data-start="1176.12" data-end="1179.1">okay so let's really quickly this is</span> <span data-start="1179.1" data-end="1182">about a five minute demo it's going to</span> <span data-start="1182" data-end="1184.26">basically cover those points that I</span> <span data-start="1184.26" data-end="1186.42">covered and we'll just do it again using</span> <span data-start="1186.42" data-end="1187.92">the sample app this is something you can</span> <span data-start="1187.92" data-end="1190.38">clone right now and an NPM install and</span> <span data-start="1190.38" data-end="1192.72">just get it running what it is is it's</span> <span data-start="1192.72" data-end="1194.55">called pay friend so it's like a little</span> <span data-start="1194.55" data-end="1197.67">mini kind of PayPal type of application</span> <span data-start="1197.67" data-end="1200.67">with with a sink it looks like one page</span> <span data-start="1200.67" data-end="1202.59">application behavior so it gives you</span> <span data-start="1202.59" data-end="1204.17">like a three-second weight between each</span> <span data-start="1204.17" data-end="1207.87">activity so you can say fail at fail</span> <span data-start="1207.87" data-end="1209.43">calm and it will fail log in and</span> <span data-start="1209.43" data-end="1214.47">anything else would be success and then</span> <span data-start="1214.47" data-end="1215.82">there's a couple of forms who's adding a</span> <span data-start="1215.82" data-end="1217.26">cardan adding a bank and both of those</span> <span data-start="1217.26" data-end="1218.91">also have the sort of success and</span> <span data-start="1218.91" data-end="1237.96">failure scenarios</span> <span data-start="1237.97" data-end="1242.02">so 100 100 1 is the failure number and</span> <span data-start="1242.02" data-end="1244.09">anything else is success for these for</span> <span data-start="1244.09" data-end="1251.15">these performs and you can log back out</span> <span data-start="1251.16" data-end="1253.72">so what we're going to do is we're going</span> <span data-start="1253.72" data-end="1255.88">to walk through sort of the timeline of</span> <span data-start="1255.88" data-end="1258.4">how you would test an application so for</span> <span data-start="1258.4" data-end="1260.44">example and this is just the</span> <span data-start="1260.44" data-end="1263.41">configuration again but when you first</span> <span data-start="1263.41" data-end="1265.63">start testing an application you're just</span> <span data-start="1265.63" data-end="1267.07">kind of writing the test on the flyer</span> <span data-start="1267.07" data-end="1269.59">just throwing the script together so it</span> <span data-start="1269.59" data-end="1273.89">looks something like this generic spec</span> <span data-start="1273.9" data-end="1277">where you know your locators are just</span> <span data-start="1277" data-end="1278.5">right right in the file everything's</span> <span data-start="1278.5" data-end="1280.27">just kind of like a big script literally</span> <span data-start="1280.27" data-end="1282.58">it's just a big functional script so</span> <span data-start="1282.58" data-end="1283.69">this is kind of what it looks like so</span> <span data-start="1283.69" data-end="1286.45">you're using the generic methods to to</span> <span data-start="1286.45" data-end="1289.54">run through the UI to to login add a</span> <span data-start="1289.54" data-end="1299.98">card at a bank account</span> <span data-start="1299.99" data-end="1302.24">okay so we're going to run that and it's</span> <span data-start="1302.24" data-end="1315.63">using the mocha runner on webstorm</span> <span data-start="1315.64" data-end="1317.26">and it just runs through all those</span> <span data-start="1317.26" data-end="1323.29">scenarios and you can use any you don't</span> <span data-start="1323.29" data-end="1326.56">have to use CSS locators you can use ID</span> <span data-start="1326.56" data-end="1328.96">locators or any of the other available</span> <span data-start="1328.96" data-end="1339.44">selenium locators</span> <span data-start="1339.45" data-end="1342.72">okay so the next step of testing an</span> <span data-start="1342.72" data-end="1345.21">application once once the UI starts to</span> <span data-start="1345.21" data-end="1346.74">harden a bit is that you say well I want</span> <span data-start="1346.74" data-end="1349.23">to start taking these locators out and I</span> <span data-start="1349.23" data-end="1350.37">want to start putting them in a</span> <span data-start="1350.37" data-end="1352.44">shareable location and that's where we</span> <span data-start="1352.44" data-end="1355.47">would start using locator files so again</span> <span data-start="1355.47" data-end="1358.529">we're telling nemo or an emo view rather</span> <span data-start="1358.529" data-end="1360.09">to look for these JSON files in this</span> <span data-start="1360.09" data-end="1365.97">directory so we've got this is bank card</span> <span data-start="1365.97" data-end="1368.25">login and nav so these are basically in</span> <span data-start="1368.25" data-end="1370.47">my mind when I when I split this</span> <span data-start="1370.47" data-end="1373.32">application of those were the four parts</span> <span data-start="1373.32" data-end="1375.69">of it and here's all the locators that</span> <span data-start="1375.69" data-end="1383.279">you would need and and this would be the</span> <span data-start="1383.279" data-end="1385.289">next step of the testing process where</span> <span data-start="1385.289" data-end="1388.26">now we're using the locator files</span> <span data-start="1388.26" data-end="1390.6">instead of the the generic methods so</span> <span data-start="1390.6" data-end="1393.63">we're using the login view the card view</span> <span data-start="1393.63" data-end="1396.69">the nav view and the bank view to run</span> <span data-start="1396.69" data-end="1402.929">the test now so I'm just pointing out</span> <span data-start="1402.929" data-end="1404.61">that there's the email locator and then</span> <span data-start="1404.61" data-end="1406.019">there's all these functions that are</span> <span data-start="1406.019" data-end="1407.789">built off of the email locator like wait</span> <span data-start="1407.789" data-end="1409.32">visible so if the page is loading it</span> <span data-start="1409.32" data-end="1411.33">will wait until it sees that element</span> <span data-start="1411.33" data-end="1412.74">before it moves on and does these other</span> <span data-start="1412.74" data-end="1433.11">things</span> <span data-start="1433.12" data-end="1435.01">and just to compare back again that's</span> <span data-start="1435.01" data-end="1438.49">the generic spec so we'll run the view</span> <span data-start="1438.49" data-end="1440.59">based one and I didn't mention it but we</span> <span data-start="1440.59" data-end="1442.42">did mention if we're using mocha to run</span> <span data-start="1442.42" data-end="1444.07">these tests so you'll see mocha syntax</span> <span data-start="1444.07" data-end="1470.78">around the webdriver commands</span> <span data-start="1470.79" data-end="1474">okay so the final step in cleaning all</span> <span data-start="1474" data-end="1475.59">this up is to say now I want to take</span> <span data-start="1475.59" data-end="1478.14">similar functionality and group it</span> <span data-start="1478.14" data-end="1479.7">together in different modules so for</span> <span data-start="1479.7" data-end="1483.39">example i made this file navigate j/s</span> <span data-start="1483.39" data-end="1485.16">that has all my navigation commands in</span> <span data-start="1485.16" data-end="1489.36">it and is using the navigation view and</span> <span data-start="1489.36" data-end="1491.24">some of the other views to do its work</span> <span data-start="1491.24" data-end="1493.74">so this is this is you know you could do</span> <span data-start="1493.74" data-end="1495.18">it however you want in your own project</span> <span data-start="1495.18" data-end="1496.5">but this is the pattern that i recommend</span> <span data-start="1496.5" data-end="1499.2">to people which is you know create these</span> <span data-start="1499.2" data-end="1501.42">these flow files i call them and and</span> <span data-start="1501.42" data-end="1502.89">kind of group similar functionality</span> <span data-start="1502.89" data-end="1505.26">together and then when you write your</span> <span data-start="1505.26" data-end="1509.85">tests the the actual code that you write</span> <span data-start="1509.85" data-end="1511.32">is going to look very semantic and it's</span> <span data-start="1511.32" data-end="1512.94">going to be pretty explanatory as far as</span> <span data-start="1512.94" data-end="1514.77">what your test is doing so here I'm</span> <span data-start="1514.77" data-end="1517.35">pulling in these three modules I'm</span> <span data-start="1517.35" data-end="1519.09">puffing them up with the Nemo object</span> <span data-start="1519.09" data-end="1522.24">when Nemo resolves and then in the</span> <span data-start="1522.24" data-end="1523.95">actual test itself you can see again</span> <span data-start="1523.95" data-end="1526.5">this is very I mean it's almost I mean</span> <span data-start="1526.5" data-end="1527.88">you could read it even if you didn't</span> <span data-start="1527.88" data-end="1529.47">know JavaScript okay we're logging in</span> <span data-start="1529.47" data-end="1531.6">failure success for card adding success</span> <span data-start="1531.6" data-end="1545.789">and failure Bank success and failure</span> <span data-start="1545.799" data-end="1547.869">and as you can imagine it's all going to</span> <span data-start="1547.869" data-end="1549.519">work because it's a screencast and I</span> <span data-start="1549.519" data-end="1551.2">like to stay away from the demo you know</span> <span data-start="1551.2" data-end="1560.47">the demo demons</span> <span data-start="1560.48" data-end="1562.429">so that's basically a walkthrough of</span> <span data-start="1562.429" data-end="1564.2">nemo view and the way that you would go</span> <span data-start="1564.2" data-end="1566.66">from the first writing of your test to</span> <span data-start="1566.66" data-end="1567.919">the third where everything's packed away</span> <span data-start="1567.919" data-end="1572.39">in a nice way and and reusable okay and</span> <span data-start="1572.39" data-end="1574.669">just a reminder at this point is that</span> <span data-start="1574.669" data-end="1576.38">this is this is how I train people to</span> <span data-start="1576.38" data-end="1578.15">use Nemo within paypal that doesn't mean</span> <span data-start="1578.15" data-end="1579.35">this is the way that you would have to</span> <span data-start="1579.35" data-end="1581.47">use it Nemo again it's just a simple</span> <span data-start="1581.47" data-end="1583.94">webdriver abstraction that allows you to</span> <span data-start="1583.94" data-end="1587.39">to add plugins and do the configuration</span> <span data-start="1587.39" data-end="1588.65">using can feel like we talked about</span> <span data-start="1588.65" data-end="1592.22">before so I'm I have seen and I'm</span> <span data-start="1592.22" data-end="1594.47">looking forward to seeing more examples</span> <span data-start="1594.47" data-end="1596.36">of how to use it from other people who</span> <span data-start="1596.36" data-end="1598.58">start to add their favorite modules in</span> <span data-start="1598.58" data-end="1600.35">their favorite you know task and test</span> <span data-start="1600.35" data-end="1603.77">runners around it and to get started to</span> <span data-start="1603.77" data-end="1605.12">look at that stuff and to play around</span> <span data-start="1605.12" data-end="1606.11">with the code that we looked at today</span> <span data-start="1606.11" data-end="1609.169">you just have to clone the Nemo example</span> <span data-start="1609.169" data-end="1612.98">app and we're looking for contributors</span> <span data-start="1612.98" data-end="1614.9">and I didn't I didn't mention it at the</span> <span data-start="1614.9" data-end="1616.429">outset but Nemo was actually named after</span> </p>
