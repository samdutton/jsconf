<p><span data-start="9.5" data-end="11.36">Hello, JSConf.</span> <span data-start="11.36" data-end="12.94">I'm super excited to be back here.</span> <span data-start="12.94" data-end="16.75">It's been a few years since I've been to JSConf EU.</span> <span data-start="16.75" data-end="22.539">I wish I could say that accessibility has gotten better in that time, but we still need</span> <span data-start="22.539" data-end="27.38">to be reminded that people with disabilities are left behind quite often.</span> <span data-start="27.38" data-end="31.589">To tell you about accessibility today, I'm going to do something a little bit different.</span> <span data-start="31.589" data-end="33">I don't have any slides.</span> <span data-start="33" data-end="38.23">Instead, we're going to take a live debugging tour of a React application that I've built</span> <span data-start="38.23" data-end="44.86">with a few components, the goal of which is to teach you how to debug components for accessibility</span> <span data-start="44.86" data-end="49.04">because you're all capable of doing it, you just need a little bit of knowledge and a</span> <span data-start="49.04" data-end="51.51">little bit of empathy for your user.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="51.51" data-end="56.5">You can find the repo a my GitHub.</span> <span data-start="56.5" data-end="61.98">With that, we're going to dive right into code.</span> <span data-start="61.98" data-end="68.13">If I go to the browser, I can show you the basing component library I've built.</span> <span data-start="68.13" data-end="72.979">It's got three components — a login form, a card flip, and a menu.</span> <span data-start="72.979" data-end="76.45">It's worth reiterating we can't cover all of it in 25 minutes.</span> <span data-start="76.45" data-end="83.39">I will show you keyboard mechanics, screen reader support, and things that are chronically</span> <span data-start="83.39" data-end="84.89">forgotten.</span> <span data-start="84.89" data-end="86.77">It really ends up impacting users.</span> <span data-start="86.77" data-end="90.149">So, to get started, let's look at our login form.</span> <span data-start="90.149" data-end="91.869">It has three fields in it.</span> <span data-start="91.869" data-end="93.77">Those fields have placeholders.</span> <span data-start="93.77" data-end="99.229">Unfortunately, a placeholder is not enough for a screenreader user to use a web page,</span> <span data-start="99.229" data-end="103.829">and I wish we could move on from this, but I see this so often.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="103.829" data-end="106.27">Let's check out how we can fix this.</span> <span data-start="106.27" data-end="111.03">If I were debugging this on a real page, I would open the developer tools.</span> <span data-start="111.03" data-end="116.999">So, if I open up my DevTools in Chrome, I can go and inspect this HTML and see what's</span> <span data-start="116.999" data-end="117.999">going on.</span> <span data-start="117.999" data-end="122.35">A quicker way to do this is to use a tool like the X Chrome extension.</span> <span data-start="122.35" data-end="123.52">There are other tools.</span> <span data-start="123.52" data-end="124.52">I like this one.</span> <span data-start="124.52" data-end="125.52">I happy to work on it.</span> <span data-start="125.52" data-end="128.369">It is built with React and JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="128.369" data-end="133.03">I can analyse any web page and see what's going on with this, and, sure enough, those</span> <span data-start="133.03" data-end="137.68">placeholder attributes are not enough for a screenreader user in all browsers.</span> <span data-start="137.68" data-end="139.569">That's something that we could fix.</span> <span data-start="139.569" data-end="146.1">There is also an error here about content not being contained in a landmark region.</span> <span data-start="146.1" data-end="151.76">Our main content is just sitting there in the DOM, and it's not wrapped in a landmark.</span> <span data-start="151.76" data-end="156.099">So we're not taking advantage of HTML to be screenreader users.</span> <span data-start="156.099" data-end="162.2">Let's go back over to my text editor, poke around, and fix some of this stuff.</span> <span data-start="162.2" data-end="168.58">In my app.js file, this is where everything comes together, my components.</span> <span data-start="168.58" data-end="174.03">I can see that there is a header element here, so that acts and one landmark.</span> <span data-start="174.03" data-end="178.719">If we scroll down, there is a main detective that has a class name.</span> <span data-start="178.719" data-end="179.719">Guess what?</span> <span data-start="179.719" data-end="180.98">That's not very semantic.</span> <span data-start="180.98" data-end="182.36">Let's fix that.</span> <span data-start="182.36" data-end="187.939">I'm going to change the divs to a main element which has an implicit role of main, but if</span> <span data-start="187.939" data-end="192.95">you're supporting Internet Explorer 11, which a lot of people with disabilities rely on,</span> <span data-start="192.95" data-end="194.79">we need to bolt on a role.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="194.79" data-end="196.79">I'm going to bolt on main.</span> <span data-start="196.79" data-end="198.329">It is redundant.</span> <span data-start="198.329" data-end="204.01">If you're supporting IE11 or below, you need to add that to expose the semantics.</span> <span data-start="204.01" data-end="208.84">Similarly, on the header element, we can add a roll of banner and will expose the fact</span> <span data-start="208.84" data-end="213.959">that this is a global header, not to be confused with a header inside an article tag.</span> <span data-start="213.959" data-end="219.43">That way, assistive technology, they can use these landmarks as navigation points in our</span> <span data-start="219.43" data-end="226.049">application, of like they might navigate by headings, you can also navigate by landmarks.</span> <span data-start="226.049" data-end="229.89">We uncovered those few problems in the X Chrome extension.</span> <span data-start="229.89" data-end="234.67">I am also going to show you the login form.</span> <span data-start="234.67" data-end="241.159">The login form demo in JavaScript, this example uses an array with the three field names.</span> <span data-start="241.159" data-end="249.349">They get past the login form and we can create a dynamic login form based on this array.</span> <span data-start="249.349" data-end="257.289">If I look at the login form component, it takes that array of fields, maps them to a</span> <span data-start="257.289" data-end="258.34">set of inputs.</span> <span data-start="258.34" data-end="260.919">Each input we iterate over its name.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="260.919" data-end="264.19">This is where those labels are missing.</span> <span data-start="264.19" data-end="271.97">So I'm going to add a label.</span> <span data-start="271.97" data-end="274.97">We've got something redundant here with the placeholder.</span> <span data-start="274.97" data-end="279.08">This is a design decision that you might need to make with your design team: do you have</span> <span data-start="279.08" data-end="283.21">a visible label, or do you use something like area label?</span> <span data-start="283.21" data-end="286.68">I'm going to opt for the visible label.</span> <span data-start="286.68" data-end="290.97">I don't know about you, but when I type in a form field that only has a placeholder and</span> <span data-start="290.97" data-end="296.169">I forget what I'm typing in, and I go back out and back, I would advocate for the visible</span> <span data-start="296.169" data-end="297.419">label.</span> <span data-start="297.419" data-end="301.47">If it was something like a telephone number, and it had a specific pattern, then that would</span> <span data-start="301.47" data-end="303.229">be a good place for a placeholder.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="303.229" data-end="309.99">Additionally, we can use HTML better here by adding a field set element around our form</span> <span data-start="309.99" data-end="310.99">fields.</span> <span data-start="310.99" data-end="317.419">I'm going to wrap in in a field set, and then this H2 heading I will wrap in a legend tag.</span> <span data-start="317.419" data-end="322.61">Leveraging HTML's capabilities to make a more semantic and accessible form, no matter how</span> <span data-start="322.61" data-end="328.849">you're delivering your HTML, this happens to be in JSX using React, so, to test this</span> <span data-start="328.849" data-end="334.36">in the spirit of test-driven development, I'm going to apply Selenium web driver.</span> <span data-start="334.36" data-end="341.74">I have a script in my package JSON file called integration, so I'm going to run mpm run integration.</span> <span data-start="341.74" data-end="346.539">It's going to use mocha.</span> <span data-start="346.539" data-end="350.16">It has found that there are no violations in this.</span> <span data-start="350.16" data-end="360.949">If we look at this test, no pressure doing is live!</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="360.949" data-end="366.509">Login, this is the fun part, right, watching me type!</span> <span data-start="366.509" data-end="368.1">So I have a test here.</span> <span data-start="368.1" data-end="375.68">It's actually using the just library the same extension we were using in the browser extension,</span> <span data-start="375.68" data-end="382.319">and we can leverage the accessibility API so we don't have to know the nitty-gritty</span> <span data-start="382.319" data-end="388.98">details of accessible names, and colour contrasts, and a lot of common accessibility problems.</span> <span data-start="388.98" data-end="393.83">So I'm using Selenium here because that's a lot like what a real user can experience.</span> <span data-start="393.83" data-end="394.89">I can fire up a browser.</span> <span data-start="394.89" data-end="397.389">In this case, I was using Chrome.</span> <span data-start="397.389" data-end="402.83">It hits that localhost URL for the login form, and then I have a single test in here.</span> <span data-start="402.83" data-end="405.18">It uses X build er.</span> <span data-start="405.18" data-end="411.99">That will return to me an object with accessibility violations that I can use to assert accessibility</span> <span data-start="411.99" data-end="413.139">problems.</span> <span data-start="413.139" data-end="418.85">It's worth pointing out this will only catch the low-hanging fruit, so those basics we</span> <span data-start="418.85" data-end="419.85">forget.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="419.85" data-end="425.449">It is nice to have a tool pointing out you've forgotten it and you can move on to use human</span> <span data-start="425.449" data-end="430.419">power for more complex problems.</span> <span data-start="430.419" data-end="433.319">We fixed our first few problems and our login form.</span> <span data-start="433.319" data-end="436.879">Let's go back to the browser and look at our next component.</span> <span data-start="436.879" data-end="440.409">I guess one thing to point out about this login form, when I added the field set, it</span> <span data-start="440.409" data-end="445.07">did add a border around it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="445.07" data-end="449.819">You can style it however you want, but under the hood, we've added great semantics to this</span> <span data-start="449.819" data-end="450.819">form.</span> <span data-start="450.819" data-end="453.71">So, on to our next component.</span> <span data-start="453.71" data-end="454.71">The card flip.</span> <span data-start="454.71" data-end="459.729">Now, I'm going — I'm not going to name where this came from, but it came from a real website</span> <span data-start="459.729" data-end="462.639">out of respect for the innocent!</span> <span data-start="462.639" data-end="464.379">It's a little profile.</span> <span data-start="464.379" data-end="471.93">In this case, I'm using a picture of my dog, Mr Ranier McChetterton, but, when I hover</span> <span data-start="471.93" data-end="477.76">over this, it reveals back side on the card flip.</span> <span data-start="477.76" data-end="483.689">If I'm using a keyboard only, if I tab through this web page, I don't ever reach the card</span> <span data-start="483.689" data-end="486.9">flip because it just works with the mouse.</span> <span data-start="486.9" data-end="495.24">So, for a keyboard-only user, someone using a screenreader, by the end of the workweek</span> <span data-start="495.24" data-end="504.04">when my programmer elbow problem flares up, this is super useful.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="504.04" data-end="506.53">We need to be able to focus and flip it back and forth.</span> <span data-start="506.53" data-end="512.8">I'm going to make a design decision here to make it work on click rather than hover.</span> <span data-start="512.8" data-end="518.56">I can tell you from experience that the reality of maintaining hover animations and keyboard</span> <span data-start="518.56" data-end="524.2">support, you don't want to make this move on keyboard focus, so that one-to-one interaction</span> <span data-start="524.2" data-end="525.28">isn't the same any more.</span> <span data-start="525.28" data-end="530.88">I'm going to change it to work a little bit differently.</span> <span data-start="530.88" data-end="534.83">Just to give you a little more info before we go and make our changes to this, we can</span> <span data-start="534.83" data-end="538.67">go inspect what this markup under the hood is looking like.</span> <span data-start="538.67" data-end="540.92">It is a series of detectives.</span> <span data-start="540.92" data-end="544.07">It does  —  it is a series of divs.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="544.07" data-end="545.92">I've got some content.</span> <span data-start="545.92" data-end="552.26">The back side of this card, we want to make it revealed when we interact it for everybody,</span> <span data-start="552.26" data-end="553.93">not just for mouse users.</span> <span data-start="553.93" data-end="559.18">With that, let's go back to our card flip.</span> <span data-start="559.18" data-end="564.76">The card flip demo is where we instantiate the component.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="564.76" data-end="569.72">It may be useful, they all have this card flip interaction.</span> <span data-start="569.72" data-end="572.089">Isle passing it some data.</span> <span data-start="572.089" data-end="575.4">It instantiates this card flip component.</span> <span data-start="575.4" data-end="577.51">It needs to manage state.</span> <span data-start="577.51" data-end="583.57">Is it active or not in we need to add markup to this to reach it.</span> <span data-start="583.57" data-end="588.71">It's sad how I find user interface components who have completely forgotten the keyboard.</span> <span data-start="588.71" data-end="597.79">We are going to fix this right now.</span> <span data-start="597.79" data-end="609.23">So, our card flip, it is in a slightly better state.</span> <span data-start="609.23" data-end="613.84">So, I'm going to give you a little tour of what I fixed here.</span> <span data-start="613.84" data-end="620.26">Our card flip component, if we scroll down and look at this markup, now, instead of just</span> <span data-start="620.26" data-end="623.81">a series of divs that we hover on, we actually have a button.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="623.81" data-end="626.37">The button is focusable by adult.</span> <span data-start="626.37" data-end="629.51">The text inside it is the team member's name, and a subtitle.</span> <span data-start="629.51" data-end="633.88">It is a short amount of title so okay for a button name.</span> <span data-start="633.88" data-end="637.24">I'm working on the click event for the button which works for everybody.</span> <span data-start="637.24" data-end="640.11">You can use it from the mouse, you can use it from the keyboard.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="640.11" data-end="641.99">This is way more accessible.</span> <span data-start="641.99" data-end="646.089">So that button is then going to trigger the card flip, and that is going expose the back</span> <span data-start="646.089" data-end="649.75">side of this card content inside of a dialogue element.</span> <span data-start="649.75" data-end="652.25">I'm using a role of dialogue.</span> <span data-start="652.25" data-end="653.97">It is similar to our landmarks earlier.</span> <span data-start="653.97" data-end="658.352">If you're useful the landmark element, you need to bolt on the role of dialogue in order</span> <span data-start="658.352" data-end="661.63">to support its semantics in older browsers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="661.63" data-end="662.83">This is a good start.</span> <span data-start="662.83" data-end="667.709">Now we need to look at how we are going to handle this interaction.</span> <span data-start="667.709" data-end="672.36">So, when I land on that button, I'm going to fire that click event, and it's in React</span> <span data-start="672.36" data-end="674.24">style, I'm going to change the state.</span> <span data-start="674.24" data-end="676.37">That's why I'm going to flip between the front and back.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="676.37" data-end="680.55">There is something you should know about this type of interaction is that we need to handle</span> <span data-start="680.55" data-end="684.42">the user's focus so they're not getting left behind in the background layer.</span> <span data-start="684.42" data-end="687.3">We will send focus into it.</span> <span data-start="687.3" data-end="691.82">In React, the great tool for that is the ref API.</span> </p>
