I'm here to talk to you about time, but before we begin let me make one announcement,</span> <span data-start="33.93" data-end="42.339">recently there is a huge popularity in conference talks, I have to tell you one thing, this</span> <span data-start="42.339" data-end="52.129">talk, this thing doesn't work I'm sorry, popularity in animated GIFs as conference talks.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="52.129" data-end="95.29">Oh I'm sorry, yes, it's gone. I'm so sorry. This has never happened before. I'm sorry.</span> <span data-start="95.29" data-end="98.31">Let's try once again, I'm sorry.</span> <span data-start="98.31" data-end="99.14">Yes.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="99.14" data-end="104.09"><span class="speaker">From The Floor</span>: Hooray!! \{Laughter\} \{Applause\}.</span> <span data-start="104.09" data-end="113.09">YES!! Animated gifs, this talk is totally and 100% animated gifs free! As part of that</span> <span data-start="113.09" data-end="120.53">we have rehearsed this talk has never been tested on animals, you can consume this talk</span> <span data-start="120.53" data-end="122.58">and apply it whenever you want.</span> <span data-start="122.58" data-end="131.98">Now, let's begin in 1742 Benjamin Franklin, in his book writes, "Remember that time is</span> <span data-start="131.98" data-end="138.239">money." This still proves today in digital reality of 2015.</span> <span data-start="138.239" data-end="143.269">Recent research shows that site loading in one second compared to a site that closes</span> <span data-start="143.269" data-end="154.269">in 3 seconds as 50% lower bounce rate, 22% higher conversion rate. This is a lot. Another</span> <span data-start="154.269" data-end="161.909">research shows that for every second of performance improvement for Wal-Mart.com they gave 2%</span> <span data-start="161.909" data-end="167.749">in conversion rate, doesn't sound that much, now we are talking about a company with 482</span> <span data-start="167.749" data-end="174.12">billion dollars in annual revenue from e-commerce, now we're talking about a lot of money. Firefox</span> <span data-start="174.12" data-end="181.049">made research and figured out that for shaving off 2.2 seconds from the Firefox browser download</span> <span data-start="181.049" data-end="189.409">page would give them 15.4% in conversion rate that would result in more than 10m down loads</span> <span data-start="189.409" data-end="201.749">per year more. This is huge, so time matters. Performance matters. There is one issue though,</span> <span data-start="201.749" data-end="209.04">statistics that uses these numbers leaves out one important thing, the users don't really</span> <span data-start="209.04" data-end="211.989">care about statistics. .</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="211.989" data-end="219.7">Users, our main stakeholders who give us money, who give us down loads, they don't care about</span> <span data-start="219.7" data-end="225.959">absolute numbers in seconds, milliseconds, number of down loads and so on and so on.</span> <span data-start="225.959" data-end="234.51">Let me give you one example, here is a site the title of which I deliberately hide, but</span> <span data-start="234.51" data-end="240.549">we can see that it is visually complete in more than five seconds, we know it happens</span> <span data-start="240.549" data-end="247.34">only after 8 seconds. This is crazy, people, if we were using only statistics we would</span> <span data-start="247.34" data-end="254.419">say this site is in desperate need or performance improvement, but would you be surprised if</span> <span data-start="254.419" data-end="265.24">I tell you this is a site that has 89 billion US dollars in revenue any way, you know why?</span> <span data-start="265.24" data-end="267.52">It's Amazon.com.</span> <span data-start="267.52" data-end="271.759">Using these statistics we would, we could conclude there is a crisis out there, but</span> <span data-start="271.759" data-end="277.28">fear not, let's see how this site works in a real browser.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="277.28" data-end="285.28">We type in URL and this site is almost instantly here. So, why does this happen? Statistics</span> <span data-start="285.28" data-end="292.669">tells us a different story, because performance is not about statistics. Even though being</span> <span data-start="292.669" data-end="298.099">an essential part of what we call 'Performance now' absolute numbers do not define performance</span> <span data-start="298.099" data-end="303.16">site, performance is not maths, it's about perception.</span> <span data-start="303.16" data-end="311.74">Today, I am not going to tell you how to shave off milliseconds of your page loading times,</span> <span data-start="311.74" data-end="318.229">I'm not going to tell you about absolute numbers of time at all, instead I will give you a</span> <span data-start="318.229" data-end="323.909">little bit different perspective on performance, I will tell you, using some simple but very</span> <span data-start="323.909" data-end="331.53">effective techniques, how to manage users perceptions. Time, as we perceive it in our</span> <span data-start="331.53" data-end="338.3">brains, sometimes it's completely different to the time that we can watch on the stop</span> <span data-start="338.3" data-end="340.629">watch.</span> <span data-start="340.629" data-end="345.97">To help us in this journey we will employ the most powerful tool that we have at our</span> <span data-start="345.97" data-end="354.78">disposal, being our brain. This is the tool where all the illusions of time happen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="354.78" data-end="360.56">Before we begin I might tell you a shocking truth not all your optimisation techniques</span> <span data-start="360.56" data-end="368.49">and results can be even noticeable by a user. In the</span> <span data-start="368.49" data-end="378.639">19th Century, German practical psychologist Weber and later his student postulated a law</span> <span data-start="378.639" data-end="389.53">that is now called Weber-Fechner law, the just noticeable differences between the two</span> <span data-start="389.53" data-end="398.68">stimuli, time is no exception to this law, this law can be applied to our durations.</span> <span data-start="398.68" data-end="406.099">Let's imagine we have a duration, any duration and the law says that there is a certain value,</span> <span data-start="406.099" data-end="416.27">JND, that is a constant coefficient of this duration, no matter what duration you have.</span> <span data-start="416.27" data-end="423.11">Experiments show that for small periods of times, less than 30 seconds, these there are</span> <span data-start="423.11" data-end="430.759">times that we, as web developers are particularly interested in, for this short of time, the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="430.759" data-end="438.949">Weber law can be approximated to a simple 20% rule. What does it mean? Let's say you</span> <span data-start="438.949" data-end="445.879">have a page that is down loading in 2 seconds, in order for your user to just notice any</span> <span data-start="445.879" data-end="456.069">difference in time you have to make your page faster in 2 seconds minus 20% being 1.6 seconds,</span> <span data-start="456.069" data-end="463.68">so if your page downloading slower than 1.6 seconds the users don't notice the difference,</span> <span data-start="463.68" data-end="472.06">so why do we spend so much time dealing with a tiny bit of milliseconds because users just</span> <span data-start="472.06" data-end="473.77">don't notice it.</span> <span data-start="473.77" data-end="481.449">Another thing is that 20% can be used as for performance optimisation but it can also be</span> <span data-start="481.449" data-end="486.349">used for regression allowance. For example, you deploy a feature to your site or your</span> <span data-start="486.349" data-end="491.939">product that slows done your site. Applying this 20% rule you can figure out your users</span> <span data-start="491.939" data-end="498.659">will even notice this difference. If, for example, your regression is 15%, you just</span> <span data-start="498.659" data-end="503.599">push the feature, forget about it and keep going. You don't need to make your site as</span> <span data-start="503.599" data-end="510.909">fast as it was before the feature, users just don't notice the difference, this is psychology.</span> <span data-start="510.909" data-end="516.05">There is one catch in this rule though, we are talking about 'Noticeable', difference.</span> <span data-start="516.05" data-end="522.849">Noticeable doesn't mean meaningful. In order for users to appreciate the optimisations</span> <span data-start="522.849" data-end="529.41">that you do, you have to go way beyond the 20% threshold.</span> <span data-start="529.41" data-end="535.47">To understand how our brain perceives time we need to figure out some properties of this</span> <span data-start="535.47" data-end="547.07">time. In 20th Century philosophy Martin Heidegger, in this book being on time, writes this, "Time</span> <span data-start="547.07" data-end="553.11">persists merely as the consequence of the events taking place in space", so time and</span> <span data-start="553.11" data-end="554.32">events.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="554.32" data-end="563.37">According to Heidegger, time consists of nearest events and has beginning and end. All the</span> <span data-start="563.37" data-end="568.399">events within this time have their beginning and end as well, as long as we don't have</span> <span data-start="568.399" data-end="574.23">any hard core philosophers in this room, we might agree with this.</span> <span data-start="574.23" data-end="578.81">For the sake of this talk, we'll call the beginning of the event 'Start event marker',</span> <span data-start="578.81" data-end="585.87">at the moment one event is over, we'll call it 'End event marker", so start and end event</span> <span data-start="585.87" data-end="595.589">marker. Another property of almost every event, every event has active phase and passive phase,</span> <span data-start="595.589" data-end="602.48">active phase is when your brain is mentally active, it doesn't mean how active, it might</span> <span data-start="602.48" data-end="607.899">be pure mental activity, it might be related to physical activity, but your brain is busy</span> <span data-start="607.899" data-end="616.36">doing something. In passive phase your brain has no other option other than just wait for</span> <span data-start="616.36" data-end="624.029">the event to be over. We can, using different techniques, manipulate how long are these</span> <span data-start="624.029" data-end="636.07">phases. Thus manage the wait. The problem is that this passive part is the most dangerous</span> <span data-start="636.07" data-end="641.88">thing, this is when people complain about long waits, they mean exactly this, because</span> <span data-start="641.88" data-end="649.36">active phase usually is not perceived as a wait at all for people, they're busy. Research</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="649.36" data-end="656.779">MIT but Richard Lawson shows that people in passive wait over estimate the time waiting</span> <span data-start="656.779" data-end="670.519">by 36%, this is a lot. Active and passive phase, the third most important thing about</span> <span data-start="670.519" data-end="679.839">wait advance is that people just hate passive wait. This is essential. People hate this.</span> <span data-start="679.839" data-end="689.44">We all might agree with this. There are multiple techniques to manage this perception of events.</span> <span data-start="689.44" data-end="696.639">We can, using this information I gave you, consider that in order to reduce this so hated</span> <span data-start="696.639" data-end="702.01">passive wait we have to increase the active phase of every event, then people will consider</span> <span data-start="702.01" data-end="707.68">that that event takes less time than it actually does. All the techniques for managing this</span> <span data-start="707.68" data-end="715.62">boil down to two simple once, the first one being pre-emptive start, in this case we deal</span> <span data-start="715.62" data-end="723.37">with only one start event marker, somehow we should move this marker in user's perception,</span> <span data-start="723.37" data-end="730.529">closer to the end. Since we don't do anything to the original event time, we just do this</span> <span data-start="730.529" data-end="738.149">in the user's brain, what happens in this last, in this part? Well, some sort of magic,</span> <span data-start="738.149" data-end="744.18">or rather something that your users don't need to know about. Let's see some examples.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="744.18" data-end="751.23">In 2009, research of Houston airport started getting an interesting and unusual type of</span> <span data-start="751.23" data-end="757.089">complaints, people were not satisfied with long baggage handling times. So administration</span> <span data-start="757.089" data-end="761.86">decided ok we will help people and they increased the number of handlers on the baggage line,</span> <span data-start="761.86" data-end="767.579">that dropped the overall time of handling to eight minutes, anybody who is travelling</span> <span data-start="767.579" data-end="772.199">knows that eight minutes from the moment you leave the plane to the moment you get the</span> <span data-start="772.199" data-end="786.41">bags on carousel is not that mean, in Manchester the fast time in UK, 6.5 minutes, surprisingly</span> <span data-start="786.41" data-end="789.73">enough the number of complaints didn't drop.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="789.73" data-end="796.269">Administration decided to investigate the problem, they figured out yes indeed the overall</span> <span data-start="796.269" data-end="803.459">handling time is eight minutes, in order to get from the aeroplane to the baggage carousel</span> <span data-start="803.459" data-end="809.32">for the average person requires 1 minute, the rest of the seven minutes the person stands</span> <span data-start="809.32" data-end="813.36">there waiting for his bags to show up.</span> <span data-start="813.36" data-end="820.43">Employing the pre-emptive start technique, administration came out with a really simple,</span> <span data-start="820.43" data-end="826.36">but very effective solution, what they did they started routing the planes to a terminal</span> <span data-start="826.36" data-end="834.23">further from the baggage carousel now it takes an average person 6 minutes to go from the</span> <span data-start="834.23" data-end="839.91">plane to the baggage carousel six minutes and then two minutes waiting for the bag.</span> <span data-start="839.91" data-end="848.019">So instead of one minute of active phase they gave passengers 6 minutes of active phase.</span> <span data-start="848.019" data-end="853.25">Instead of 7 minutes of waiting, they gave them only 2 minutes of passive waiting. Guess</span> <span data-start="853.25" data-end="860.329">what, the number of complaints dropped to zero. People didn't mind going longer, they</span> <span data-start="860.329" data-end="863.089">just didn't want to stand and wait.</span> <span data-start="863.089" data-end="871.509">This is off line, do we have examples closer to online we are front line developers. We</span> <span data-start="871.509" data-end="880.47">have example with the, safari has pre-load top hits, how does it work, you type in the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="880.47" data-end="888.18">URL in the browser and you get this 'Top hits' thing at the top, if you didn't disable it</span> <span data-start="888.18" data-end="895.399">deliberately. What is it? While you are typing your URL, safari tries to guess what page,</span> <span data-start="895.399" data-end="903.649">based on your history, what page are you trying to reach. While you are typing your URL safari</span> <span data-start="903.649" data-end="909.68">is already pre-downloading this page for you, so then when you click, "Go", your page is</span> <span data-start="909.68" data-end="918.009">here almost instantly. While you are typing the URL safari is pre-loading the page, the</span> <span data-start="918.009" data-end="924.62">same browser opening the new tab. You click on the link, choose,</span> <span data-start="924.62" data-end="931.399">"Open a new tab", sometimes animation and then the page is loaded. If we get into this</span> <span data-start="931.399" data-end="936.97">tabs animation a bit closer, we will notice, I don't know whether everybody sees here,</span> <span data-start="936.97" data-end="944.079">but there is this short blue line indicating that the page is in the downloading process</span> <span data-start="944.079" data-end="952.42">already. So if we — while the animation progresses, this bar is progressing as well, why you are</span> <span data-start="952.42" data-end="958.569">enjoying the animation of the tabs, this site is downloading to deliver to you as soon as</span> <span data-start="958.569" data-end="964.269">possible, preferably right thereafter animation is over.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="964.269" data-end="974.55">In our work we are starting getting this fancy, prefix, all the attributes that help us speed</span> <span data-start="974.55" data-end="981.459">up our sites as well. They even go being a technical solution they aim for the same thing</span> <span data-start="981.459" data-end="986.94">that I was telling you, to reduce the passive wait by increasing the active wait for you.</span> <span data-start="986.94" data-end="991.93">While you are downloading a page these attributes are already pre-loading resources you might</span> <span data-start="991.93" data-end="998.839">need on the next page, with that reducing your passive wait time when you get to those</span> <span data-start="998.839" data-end="999.629">pages.</span> <span data-start="999.629" data-end="1007.25">So, in the pre-emptive start technique, it all starts with the active phase and then</span> <span data-start="1007.25" data-end="1015.36">short passive wait at the end. Similarly to this, we can have early completion technique,</span> <span data-start="1015.36" data-end="1021.639">where we deal now with end event marker that we shift, somehow, in users' mind closer to</span> <span data-start="1021.639" data-end="1026.069">the beginning and have it right there at the end.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1026.069" data-end="1031.579">A good example of this technique is pretty much any video streaming service like YouTube</span> <span data-start="1031.579" data-end="1036.28">for example, it all starts with a passive wait. If you click the play button the spinner</span> <span data-start="1036.28" data-end="1043.459">is showing up to indicate that the video is in downloading process. So you are in passive</span> <span data-start="1043.459" data-end="1049.97">wait you have nothing else to do you just sit and wait, but then, once the first possible</span> <span data-start="1049.97" data-end="1058.76">to view chunk of the video is downloaded it starts playing in your video player, hence</span> <span data-start="1058.76" data-end="1064.88">switching you to the active phase because your brain now is busy watching the downloaded</span> <span data-start="1064.88" data-end="1070.94">part while the original event of downloading the whole movie is still in progress in the</span> <span data-start="1070.94" data-end="1078.14">background. You just don't mind because your brains busy. So we start with short passive</span> <span data-start="1078.14" data-end="1083.96">wait, and switch user to the active phase as soon as possible. Let's get back to our</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1083.96" data-end="1091.2">Amazon example but now with DevTools. In particularly we're interested in the timeline. If you want</span> <span data-start="1091.2" data-end="1097.97">to analyse Amazon.com all the essential assets required to render the top of the page that</span> <span data-start="1097.97" data-end="1103.96">is visible to user immediately, these assets like images and CSS and text are ready in</span> <span data-start="1103.96" data-end="1109.77">less than a second. They are ready to be rendered and they are rendered. This is what happens</span> <span data-start="1109.77" data-end="1115.289">when this assets are rendered on the screen user is switched from passive phase of the</span> <span data-start="1115.289" data-end="1119.53">wait, all the way to activated because there is something on the screen that users can</span> <span data-start="1119.53" data-end="1126.179">on assume already. They don't care whether it's 5 or 6 or 7 seconds after this switch</span> <span data-start="1126.179" data-end="1133.07">the page is keeps downloading this is where statistics doesn't give us real picture of</span> <span data-start="1133.07" data-end="1137">how users perceive your sites.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1137" data-end="1142.69">This is great where you have active phase, but what happens if for example your event</span> <span data-start="1142.69" data-end="1151.64">doesn't have obvious active phase. Well we create one. In the beginning of 20th century</span> <span data-start="1151.64" data-end="1156.78">managers of sky scrapers and high buildings in US started getting a lot of people living</span> <span data-start="1156.78" data-end="1162.98">in these buildings on long waiting for the elevators. Long wait times so people had to</span> <span data-start="1162.98" data-end="1168.23">wait for 10, 15 minutes to get to elevator during the rush hours, and of course they</span> <span data-start="1168.23" data-end="1168.929">were a bit</span> <span data-start="1168.929" data-end="1176.39">nervous when they were rushing to work or something. There was no technical solution,</span> <span data-start="1176.39" data-end="1183.679">no easy technical solution you cannot build more elevators in existing buildings you cannot</span> <span data-start="1183.679" data-end="1191.07">also tear down the building and build a new one with 5 levels. From here the story diverges.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1191.07" data-end="1198.03">Designers say it was a designer, but engineer say it was an engineer, but support somebody</span> <span data-start="1198.03" data-end="1207.12">came up with an idea and the idea was mirrors. Mirrors all the way from the floor to ceiling</span> <span data-start="1207.12" data-end="1214.409">in the lobby where people are waiting for the elevator itself, and guess what, after</span> <span data-start="1214.409" data-end="1219.6">that the number of complaints dropped to zero. What happened?</span> <span data-start="1219.6" data-end="1224.22">Before mirrors the whole process of waiting for an elevator was pure passive wait there's</span> <span data-start="1224.22" data-end="1230.7">no active phase, people had to stand and wait for the elevator. With employing the windows</span> <span data-start="1230.7" data-end="1236.2">we switch the whole passive wait into the active phase, because people looking at the</span> <span data-start="1236.2" data-end="1240.63">mirror they keep their brain busy they look at themselves before going to work they look</span> <span data-start="1240.63" data-end="1246.82">how they look like after the hard day working they peek at each other secretly and their</span> <span data-start="1246.82" data-end="1250.52">brain is busy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1250.52" data-end="1259.37">Long after this story, many years after that, some of us still use mirrors to entertain</span> <span data-start="1259.37" data-end="1270.95">their brain. \{laughter\} to conclude this, I would tell you that modern front-end developer</span> <span data-start="1270.95" data-end="1279.63">should always consider performance, but performance with only technical means is just simply not</span> <span data-start="1279.63" data-end="1286.89">enough. Modern front-end developers have to be technicians, they have to be psychologist</span> <span data-start="1286.89" data-end="1293.24">and a little about of magician. We should show the user what they want to see while</span> <span data-start="1293.24" data-end="1301.309">doing the real job behind the stage. Good developer knows how to build fast website,</span> <span data-start="1301.309" data-end="1309.96">excellent developer knows how to make user believe that the site is fast enough for them.</span> </p>
