data-end="205.37">are on so if you have dynamic HTML</span> <span data-start="205.37" data-end="208.94">document dynamic page we need to render</span> <span data-start="208.94" data-end="212.419">the

data-start="230.51" data-end="234.26">more it depends and therefore it's kind</span> <span data-start="234.26" data-end="236.09">of risky because it depends on your load</span> <span data-start="236.09" data-end="238.549">on your network and the instant</span> <span data-start="238.549" data-end="240.139">infrastructure you had where a lot of</span> <span data-start="240.139" data-end="244.31">the facts of factors can influence um</span> <span data-start="244.31" data-end="247.459">that and let's imagine that we have up</span> <span data-start="247.459" data-end="251.78">to 10 requests for data and each of them</span> <span data-start="251.78" data-end="255.53">depends on a previous one in this</span> <span data-start="255.53" data-end="259.07">worst-case your users would not see</span> <span data-start="259.07" data-end="263.599">anything for five seconds and that's</span> <span data-start="263.599" data-end="266.3">really scary and let's ask our users</span> <span data-start="266.3" data-end="269.72">what do they think about that so some of</span> <span data-start="269.72" data-end="273.19">them I just said and they are crying</span> <span data-start="273.19" data-end="276.11">seeing how our appt renders</span> <span data-start="276.11" data-end="282.11">but they wait but some of them are very</span> <span data-start="282.11" data-end="284.87">angry and might be even want to find us</span> <span data-start="284.87" data-end="286.64">it kill us because we implemented this</span> <span data-start="286.64" data-end="291.53">up and some of our users are also</span> <span data-start="291.53" data-end="294.44">developers and might be they know that</span> <span data-start="294.44" data-end="297.2">progressive rendering exists and they</span> <span data-start="297.2" data-end="302.98">are just saying that our app is crap and</span> <span data-start="302.98" data-end="308.14">how can we fix this how can we make our</span> <span data-start="308.14" data-end="310.82">application render sooner despite these</span> <span data-start="310.82" data-end="314.3">reasons we have liked for requesting</span> <span data-start="314.3" data-end="318.74">data and maybe other air conditions we</span> <span data-start="318.74" data-end="321.62">have in our app instead of sending em</span> <span data-start="321.62" data-end="324.74">the whole HTML buffer at once like</span> <span data-start="324.74" data-end="328.7">previous code does we can use a simple</span> <span data-start="328.7" data-end="333.02">idea instead of trying to serve this</span> <span data-start="333.02" data-end="336.11">very heavy and slow page like lifting up</span> <span data-start="336.11" data-end="339.77">is the stadium we can just split this</span> <span data-start="339.77" data-end="344.87">page and small pieces in chunks and send</span> <span data-start="344.87" data-end="349.81">this HTML page as multiple chunks and</span> <span data-start="349.81" data-end="352.49">obviously it looks more powerful right</span> <span data-start="352.49" data-end="357.83">and easy so and this approach would be</span> <span data-start="357.83" data-end="364.7">progressive rendering this animation is</span> <span data-start="364.7" data-end="367.88">trying to explain how that works so on</span> <span data-start="367.88" data-end="370.76">the left side you have typical rendering</span> <span data-start="370.76" data-end="373.43">implementation which goes for data</span> <span data-start="373.43" data-end="375.65">building the page in memory and then</span> <span data-start="375.65" data-end="378.68">just gives the whole page service from</span> <span data-start="378.68" data-end="381.89">the server in browser and until this</span> <span data-start="381.89" data-end="384.98">moment nobody sees anything I mean our</span> <span data-start="384.98" data-end="388.4">users of course and on the right the app</span> <span data-start="388.4" data-end="391.61">uses progressive rendering which means</span> <span data-start="391.61" data-end="395.54">it has last time to first byte and you</span> <span data-start="395.54" data-end="399.1">have something as soon as your first</span> <span data-start="399.1" data-end="404.26">portion of data is radiant server and</span> <span data-start="404.26" data-end="406.85">this is really tricky because from the</span> <span data-start="406.85" data-end="409.28">performance point of view I mean from</span> <span data-start="409.28" data-end="411.44">amber's point of view it's kind of maybe</span> <span data-start="411.44" data-end="415.01">even slower but from the perception</span> <span data-start="415.01" data-end="418.54">point of view our users they see that</span> <span data-start="418.54" data-end="421.7">our app works for them and does</span> <span data-start="421.7" data-end="424.4">something for them and this perception</span> <span data-start="424.4" data-end="426.95">is much better than seeing nothing for</span> <span data-start="426.95" data-end="429.41">five seconds even though maybe it's</span> <span data-start="429.41" data-end="434.41">technically a little bit slower and</span> <span data-start="434.41" data-end="437.93">there was a talk at last jest Cairo in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="437.93" data-end="441.8">Berlin where I unfortunately I can't</span> <span data-start="441.8" data-end="443.24">remember the name but it was a talk</span> <span data-start="443.24" data-end="445.4">about perception of performance and that</span> <span data-start="445.4" data-end="448.58">was a very similar idea that perception</span> <span data-start="448.58" data-end="452.96">says us that we need to do something as</span> <span data-start="452.96" data-end="455.15">soon as possible to show that our app</span> <span data-start="455.15" data-end="457.4">works for our user that we appreciate</span> <span data-start="457.4" data-end="461.54">that our user uses are up and this</span> <span data-start="461.54" data-end="466.25">exactly the point so you might be</span> <span data-start="466.25" data-end="468.02">wondering never heard of it never heard</span> <span data-start="468.02" data-end="469.79">of progressive rendering is it new or</span> <span data-start="469.79" data-end="472.31">like something train seeing which</span> <span data-start="472.31" data-end="477.02">invented recently actually now if we go</span> <span data-start="477.02" data-end="482">back in the history in 1997 HTTP 1.1 was</span> <span data-start="482" data-end="487.34">introduced as RFC and the most important</span> <span data-start="487.34" data-end="490.22">part in this for us is a Chunkin</span> <span data-start="490.22" data-end="493.76">encoding and basically what it says that</span> <span data-start="493.76" data-end="496.28">instead of serving the whole page the</span> <span data-start="496.28" data-end="499.039">whole buffer to a server you can split</span> <span data-start="499.039" data-end="502.22">it in several buffers and serve it</span> <span data-start="502.22" data-end="505.33">specifying length for each of them and</span> <span data-start="505.33" data-end="508.16">this is kind of a concept concept of</span> <span data-start="508.16" data-end="510.05">streaming if you are familiar with</span> </p>

data-end="873.71">page why is that because if you add a</span> <span data-start="873.71" data-end="875.75">new block on your page like at the</span> <span data-start="875.75" data-end="878.21">bottom
