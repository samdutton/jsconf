data-start="514.05" data-end="516.209">introduction of how to work with streams</span> <span data-start="516.209" data-end="519.63">in reactive mind set we're going to use</span> <span data-start="519.63" data-end="522.029">a library called extreme for this here's</span> <span data-start="522.029" data-end="523.89">how to create a stream that will</span> <span data-start="523.89" data-end="526.26">immediately emit five events the numbers</span> <span data-start="526.26" data-end="533.759">one through five as JavaScript objects</span> <span data-start="533.769" data-end="537.61">there we go but the stream is not going</span> <span data-start="537.61" data-end="539.559">to do anything until we add our first</span> <span data-start="539.559" data-end="542.079">listener to it a stream can be basically</span> <span data-start="542.079" data-end="544.3">thought of as a value changing over time</span> <span data-start="544.3" data-end="547.149">or a periodic sequence of events the</span> <span data-start="547.149" data-end="550.239">stream listener is basically three</span> <span data-start="550.239" data-end="552.309">callbacks a callback that is called when</span> <span data-start="552.309" data-end="555.959">a new value is emitted from the stream a</span> <span data-start="555.959" data-end="558.61">fatal error call back and a call back</span> <span data-start="558.61" data-end="560.499">when the stream is complete and will no</span> <span data-start="560.499" data-end="562.36">longer emit any values so what we have</span> <span data-start="562.36" data-end="565.149">here is a utility function that will</span> <span data-start="565.149" data-end="567.79">print out on the console when each of</span> <span data-start="567.79" data-end="569.499">these callbacks is called so if we try</span> <span data-start="569.499" data-end="571.509">that on our numbers stream as expected</span> <span data-start="571.509" data-end="573.399">we get the numbers one through five and</span> <span data-start="573.399" data-end="576.429">then the stream completes but where</span> <span data-start="576.429" data-end="580.389">streams get really powerful got a got a</span> <span data-start="580.389" data-end="583.299">key into this Maya gesture here is when</span> <span data-start="583.299" data-end="585.339">you can use them to manipulate data and</span> <span data-start="585.339" data-end="589.029">create data flows stream processes by</span> <span data-start="589.029" data-end="591.22">which we're transforming the data so for</span> <span data-start="591.22" data-end="593.079">example we can create a new stream of</span> <span data-start="593.079" data-end="596.259">the values x 10 based on our original</span> <span data-start="596.259" data-end="598.179">stream by mapping a function over it so</span> <span data-start="598.179" data-end="600.999">in here we're mapping x 10 to our stream</span> <span data-start="600.999" data-end="604.959">and we're printing it out maybe I should</span> <span data-start="604.959" data-end="606.879">switch back to the keyboard as you can</span> <span data-start="606.879" data-end="609.49">see now we have printed out the numbers</span> <span data-start="609.49" data-end="611.439">1 through 10 through 50 and the stream</span> <span data-start="611.439" data-end="613.99">completes but where this gets really</span> <span data-start="613.99" data-end="618.04">interesting is asynchrony this time</span> <span data-start="618.04" data-end="619.6">let's try printing out the numbers one</span> <span data-start="619.6" data-end="621.459">through five but let's wait a second in</span> <span data-start="621.459" data-end="624.899">between each in between each increment</span> <span data-start="624.899" data-end="627.519">access periodic will give us a stream</span> <span data-start="627.519" data-end="629.379">that waits a certain amount of time and</span> <span data-start="629.379" data-end="631.449">will count up into infinity but we don't</span> <span data-start="631.449" data-end="632.92">want to count into infinity we want to</span> <span data-start="632.92" data-end="635.41">count up to the number five so we can</span> <span data-start="635.41" data-end="636.91">create another stream called finished</span> <span data-start="636.91" data-end="640.299">that weight that filters out any values</span> <span data-start="640.299" data-end="643.36">that are less that are not greater than</span> <span data-start="643.36" data-end="645.759">five so the first value will emit is</span> <span data-start="645.759" data-end="647.529">when the count reaches six and then we</span> <span data-start="647.529" data-end="649.149">can end our original stream the count</span> <span data-start="649.149" data-end="651.61">stream when six is emitted so then we</span> <span data-start="651.61" data-end="653.019">can just get the numbers one through</span> <span data-start="653.019" data-end="656.819">five waiting a second in between mitts</span> <span data-start="656.819" data-end="663.07">and then the stream completes cool</span> <span data-start="663.07" data-end="665.42">wouldn't it be cool if we could treat</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="665.42" data-end="670.27">Bluetooth devices like uh like streams</span> <span data-start="670.27" data-end="672.8">I've been tinkering with a library for</span> <span

data-end="684.56">request device we're passing in filters</span> <span data-start="684.56" data-end="686.48">and optional services but now we give it</span> <span data-start="686.48" data-end="688.16">a listen object that's a description of</span> <span data-start="688.16" data-end="690.26">the services and characteristics and</span> <span data-start="690.26" data-end="692.33">those services that we want to observe</span> <span data-start="692.33" data-end="694.43">as a stream and what this library does</span> <span data-start="694.43" data-end="698.32">is it it gets that characteristic it</span> <span data-start="698.32" data-end="700.82">starts notifications running from them</span> <span data-start="700.82" data-end="702.32">and it hooks up an event

data-end="745.43">mapping from from values to string</span> <span data-start="745.43" data-end="748.34">gestures and we're just going to get the</span> <span data-start="748.34" data-end="751.28">the value of the gesture in binary from</span> <span data-start="751.28" data-end="753.68">the mile look it up on our table and</span> <span data-start="753.68" data-end="756.97">return the value if we

data-end="885.76">details here but what's interesting</span> <span data-start="885.76" data-end="886.99">about this function is it's actually</span> <span data-start="886.99" data-end="888.76">straight from the web bluetooth spec</span> <span data-start="888.76" data-end="892.57">draft it's used as an example there so</span> <span data-start="892.57" data-end="894.1">if we apply this parse heart rate</span> <span data-start="894.1" data-end="896.38">function to our stream of binary data we</span> <span data-start="896.38" data-end="898.65">can get a live feed of heart

data-end="1108.25">transforms your stream into a new form</span> <span data-start="1108.25" data-end="1110.86">that emits different types of values</span> <span data-start="1110.86"

data-end="1155.23">happening here is we're taking the pairs</span> <span data-start="1155.23" data-end="1157.03">of samples and we're just doing a little</span> <span data-start="1157.03"

the math</span> <span data-start="1170.74" data-end="1172.51">comparing how much time has passed and</span> <span data-start="1172.51" data-end="1175.24">how many cranks have happened we can do</span> <span data-start="1175.24" data-end="1176.98">that for speed as well so if i turn the</span> <span data-start="1176.98" data-end="1180.78">wheel we can get our PM off of the wheel</span> <span data-start="1180.78" data-end="1185.35">and finally what we want to do is</span> <span data-start="1185.35" data-end="1188.8">convert convert that RPM to km/h and we</span> <span data-start="1188.8" data-end="1190.06">do that by multiplying it by the</span> <span data-start="1190.06" data-end="1191.82">circumference of the wheel giving</span> <span data-start="1191.82" data-end="1194.34">how much

there there</span> <span data-start="1203.28" data-end="1207">you have it we've created four streams</span> <span data-start="1207" data-end="1209.52">of data now coming off of this bike I'll</span> <span data-start="1209.52" data-end="1211.8">end my arm this is all completely live</span> <span data-start="1211.8" data-end="1213.45">you can see my heart rate is going in a</span> <span
