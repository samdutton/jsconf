<p><span data-start="57.85" data-end="60.79">And I'm an accidental speaker.</span> <span data-start="60.79" data-end="62.13">I will show that too.</span> <span data-start="62.13" data-end="69.58">This is my Twitter handle if you want to follow and see my tech Tweets, my community Tweets,</span> <span data-start="69.58" data-end="71.34">you can.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="71.34" data-end="76.75">I started my journey with my community JS Lovers, JavaScript Lovers, three years back.</span> <span data-start="76.75" data-end="79.36">And after they started living in this.</span> <span data-start="79.36" data-end="83.26">Best things happen when they are unplanned.</span> <span data-start="83.26" data-end="84.26">Mostly.</span> <span data-start="84.26" data-end="90.84">Because JS Lovers was not planned, but I started it and a most awesome thing happened to me.</span> <span data-start="90.84" data-end="96.46">Before that, this is my team five years back.</span> <span data-start="96.46" data-end="99.74">As you can see, I'm the only female.</span> <span data-start="99.74" data-end="102.36">I was having two troubles at that time.</span> <span data-start="102.36" data-end="105.08">I moved to a senior level at that time.</span> <span data-start="105.08" data-end="110.34">And I was not able to see a lot of females at the senior level.</span> <span data-start="110.34" data-end="114.26">I was not able to get a mentor for myself in my city.</span> <span data-start="114.26" data-end="119.869">The second problem was, we all developers in my city, we were more focused towards our</span> <span data-start="119.869" data-end="120.869">job.</span> <span data-start="120.869" data-end="122.56">We were not into collaboration.</span> <span data-start="122.56" data-end="124.28">We are not into sharing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="124.28" data-end="130.759">We are our focus is only our job, my little 9 5, apart from that, we were not interested</span> <span data-start="130.759" data-end="132.14">in anything.</span> <span data-start="132.14" data-end="134.59">And I started actually saying these things.</span> <span data-start="134.59" data-end="138.58">Learn something new every day for yourself.</span> <span data-start="138.58" data-end="143.209">Just not for your company, not for your job, just for yourself.</span> <span data-start="143.209" data-end="144.57">So, what I did?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="144.57" data-end="151.05">So, I was just going around looking for mentors, looking for senior females in the tech field</span> <span data-start="151.05" data-end="155.97">and I was not able to get a single female in the tech industry in my city.</span> <span data-start="155.97" data-end="158.56">So, I was just talking to one of my colleagues.</span> <span data-start="158.56" data-end="161.4">I knew about meetup.com platform.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="161.4" data-end="162.87">And I just bounced the idea.</span> <span data-start="162.87" data-end="168.63">Would you be interested in sharing our knowledge with the other people who are new in this</span> <span data-start="168.63" data-end="169.63">IT world?</span> <span data-start="169.63" data-end="172.38">And my colleague was like, yeah, I can do it.</span> <span data-start="172.38" data-end="174.05">Because he was a trained speaker.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="174.05" data-end="175.78">So, I said, okay.</span> <span data-start="175.78" data-end="181.29">On the same day, in the evening, sitting in a cafe, I built my meetup page.</span> <span data-start="181.29" data-end="185.37">I picked this domain and my event was up.</span> <span data-start="185.37" data-end="190.22">And my journey from a developer to a coordinator was started.</span> <span data-start="190.22" data-end="196.45">We had one chapter, zero sponsor and no experience running a community.</span> <span data-start="196.45" data-end="199.66">I had no idea how I was going to do it.</span> <span data-start="199.66" data-end="203.48">But after three years, here we are.</span> <span data-start="203.48" data-end="209.33">Now we have done [ Applause ]</span> <span data-start="209.33" data-end="213.88">Sorry.</span> <span data-start="213.88" data-end="218.43">Okay.</span> <span data-start="218.43" data-end="219.97">Technical glitch.</span> <span data-start="219.97" data-end="221.17">Sorry.</span> <span data-start="221.17" data-end="227.06">So, after three years this is the stats.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="227.06" data-end="232.06">We have done more than 55 meetups in just in my city.</span> <span data-start="232.06" data-end="235.58">We have more than three chapters in India.</span> <span data-start="235.58" data-end="238.05">In Delhi itself we have 2700 members.</span> <span data-start="238.05" data-end="245.73">Out of that, 85% of the people are very active and we have 25 plus sponsors.</span> <span data-start="245.73" data-end="252.16">And not only this, we are the first community who will become the part of the Google Developer</span> <span data-start="252.16" data-end="253.7">Program from Delhi.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="253.7" data-end="258.979">And we are the first, most active community from India to be a part of that group.</span> <span data-start="258.979" data-end="263.49">So, yes, it was a very big achievement for us.</span> <span data-start="263.49" data-end="265.059">But it was easy?</span> <span data-start="265.059" data-end="266.66">Not at all.</span> <span data-start="266.66" data-end="267.999">I was having a full time job.</span> <span data-start="267.999" data-end="273.74">I was having although I'm not married, but I have my parents who I have to, you know,</span> <span data-start="273.74" data-end="274.759">I live with them.</span> <span data-start="274.759" data-end="277.749">The culture of India is very different.</span> <span data-start="277.749" data-end="279.759">My first trouble started with my family.</span> <span data-start="279.759" data-end="286.229">When I told them that this is what I'm trying to do, my father's reaction was, I told you,</span> <span data-start="286.229" data-end="287.759">become a teacher after schooling.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="287.759" data-end="291.509">But you were like, no, you want to study computers and everything.</span> <span data-start="291.509" data-end="293.259">Now you have a stable job.</span> <span data-start="293.259" data-end="294.56">You are in a group.</span> <span data-start="294.56" data-end="299.249">Now you want to teach people free of cost by paying for the venue and everything by</span> <span data-start="299.249" data-end="300.249">your pocket.</span> <span data-start="300.249" data-end="301.249">You are stupid.</span> <span data-start="301.249" data-end="304.219">[ Laughter ] And I was like, no, dad, it's not like that.</span> <span data-start="304.219" data-end="308.71">It is not teaching as a job, it's like mentoring and helping others.</span> <span data-start="308.71" data-end="312.9">And someday I might fight with my family and that started.</span> <span data-start="312.9" data-end="318.55">And every weekend when I'm stepping out of my home for doing my meetup, I used to have</span> <span data-start="318.55" data-end="319.83">a big fight with my family.</span> <span data-start="319.83" data-end="321.01">Why you are doing this?</span> <span data-start="321.01" data-end="322.46">This is a waste of time.</span> <span data-start="322.46" data-end="324.11">They are not able to understand.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="324.11" data-end="328.069">Not even my family, my friends also used to make a joke of me.</span> <span data-start="328.069" data-end="331.999">So, many of my friends started following me on Facebook because my whole feed was full</span> <span data-start="331.999" data-end="335.479">of the meetups, tech stuff and everything.</span> <span data-start="335.479" data-end="336.729">And I was like, okay, whatever.</span> <span data-start="336.729" data-end="342.879">So, today in the morning when I entered in the conference area I actually Tweeted, I'm</span> <span data-start="342.879" data-end="347.889">sorry, I will be shamelessly filling your feeds with the JSConf Tweets.</span> <span data-start="347.889" data-end="349.33">Deal with it.</span> <span data-start="349.33" data-end="351.24">My job problem was that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="351.24" data-end="357.08">But I didn't give up because I knew what I was going, and I was very focused.</span> <span data-start="357.08" data-end="361.749">How did we get to this level?</span> <span data-start="361.749" data-end="368.47">You need to know where you are running the community, you need to understand the culture.</span> <span data-start="368.47" data-end="373.749">In Delhi, doing a meetup or event on the weekdays, it will never work.</span> <span data-start="373.749" data-end="376.99">Only on the weekends people come out of their home to attend an event.</span> <span data-start="376.99" data-end="382.939">For that, you need to do a lot of hard work.</span> <span data-start="382.939" data-end="386.069">You need no know your members and the tech industry.</span> <span data-start="386.069" data-end="390.699">And I started the levels and Angular was just launched.</span> <span data-start="390.699" data-end="396.879">People were running behind Angular, they had no idea they needed to learn JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="396.879" data-end="402.369">There were a few developers that came to me and asked, should we just learn Angular in</span> <span data-start="402.369" data-end="405.599">frameworks, or is it important to learn JavaScript?</span> <span data-start="405.599" data-end="413.459">At that time, I decided to do the first meetup on JavaScript, no framework or nothing.</span> <span data-start="413.459" data-end="418.729">That helped me a lot because there were a lot of people who just started their career</span> <span data-start="418.729" data-end="421.999">by a framework and they had no idea about the basics.</span> <span data-start="421.999" data-end="429.509">So, whenever you are starting something, please know your city, your culture, your client.</span> <span data-start="429.509" data-end="433.159">I was ready for the events, I was ready for the meetup, but my city was not.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="433.159" data-end="438.332">There was not a single place available in my city where I can have 30 people with a</span> <span data-start="438.332" data-end="441.06">projector.</span> <span data-start="441.06" data-end="444.539">I actually struggled two months to get a venue.</span> <span data-start="444.539" data-end="450.889">And I ended up having my first meetup at a cafe, which was at a party zone.</span> <span data-start="450.889" data-end="453.379">And I was like, what?</span> <span data-start="453.379" data-end="456.039">And that was not even the closest venue.</span> <span data-start="456.039" data-end="460.85">So, whenever we were doing coding, a lot of people were coming in and asking, can we get</span> <span data-start="460.85" data-end="461.889">the table?</span> <span data-start="461.889" data-end="465.259">And we said this is a closed event.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="465.259" data-end="466.389">Area closed.</span> <span data-start="466.389" data-end="468.119">So, it was very troubling.</span> <span data-start="468.119" data-end="474.429">But before that, the most troubled part that have venue is, my parents used to think that</span> <span data-start="474.429" data-end="478.239">I'm lying because on the weekend I'm going to such a party happening place.</span> <span data-start="478.239" data-end="483.02">So, they used to assume that I'm just going out to, you know, have fun with my friends.</span> <span data-start="483.02" data-end="489.189">As a result, I have to spend extra money to record whole sessions to take the pictures</span> <span data-start="489.189" data-end="491.679">and go back and show my parents, see?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="491.679" data-end="492.679">I'm not partying.</span> <span data-start="492.679" data-end="495.31">I'm actually doing something relevant.</span> <span data-start="495.31" data-end="499.539">So, this is how the logistics were very tricky there.</span> <span data-start="499.539" data-end="500.989">And with the speakers also.</span> <span data-start="500.989" data-end="504.669">So, for one year we were not able to get an outside speaker.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="504.669" data-end="505.669">Reason?</span> <span data-start="505.669" data-end="507.289">We were not a brand name.</span> <span data-start="507.289" data-end="508.689">Developers used to come.</span> <span data-start="508.689" data-end="513.469">They used to love it, like it, but they were hesitant to come on the stage and share their</span> <span data-start="513.469" data-end="514.469">knowledge.</span> <span data-start="514.469" data-end="516.459">So, nobody.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="516.459" data-end="520.86">I became an accidental speaker because of that because I started giving the sessions</span> <span data-start="520.86" data-end="521.86">there.</span> <span data-start="521.86" data-end="527.16">But now after three years, I have so many speakers sending their slides requesting,</span> <span data-start="527.16" data-end="532.389">but now I don't have the time to, you know, bring every speaker on the stage.</span> <span data-start="532.389" data-end="534.649">So, this is how I never gave up.</span> <span data-start="534.649" data-end="538.17">When I was not able to get a speaker, I took that responsibility.</span> <span data-start="538.17" data-end="541.13">I learned stuff, I stood on the stage and gave the session.</span> <span data-start="541.13" data-end="544.04">So, logistics are very important.</span> <span data-start="544.04" data-end="548.44">You need to work on the logistics.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="548.44" data-end="553.05">The first venue, it was at a funny place, but the best part is, it was very accessible</span> <span data-start="553.05" data-end="555.089">by public transport.</span> <span data-start="555.089" data-end="557.12">Because I'm a female and an organizer.</span> <span data-start="557.12" data-end="562.389">I know every female who is struggling to get to the venue.</span> <span data-start="562.389" data-end="567.48">Delhi is not a friendly transport space.</span> <span data-start="567.48" data-end="572.65">As a female, when I was organizing, I was already taking care of these things by myself.</span> <span data-start="572.65" data-end="574.11">Community.</span> <span data-start="574.11" data-end="575.56">This is the most funny part.</span> <span data-start="575.56" data-end="579.79">Because when I decided to start the meetup, I was preparing myself that a lot of people</span> <span data-start="579.79" data-end="581.94">would be asking tech questions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="581.94" data-end="584.62">But nope.</span> <span data-start="584.62" data-end="586.43">What is a meetup and community?</span> <span data-start="586.43" data-end="590.36">And people are filling my messages with, what are you trying to do?</span> <span data-start="590.36" data-end="596.62">They were not able to understand is why a girl on every weekend is doing free meetups</span> <span data-start="596.62" data-end="600.36">and sharing her knowledge and not charging anything.</span> <span data-start="600.36" data-end="603.009">Is she trying to sell something?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="603.009" data-end="604.62">Is she going to hire us?</span> <span data-start="604.62" data-end="606.839">Is there a company behind it?</span> <span data-start="606.839" data-end="608.8">And I was like, no, my friend.</span> <span data-start="608.8" data-end="611.75">This is the essence of a community.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="611.75" data-end="615.209">This is a community by developers for developers.</span> <span data-start="615.209" data-end="619.66">I know the thing when I was looking for mentors and I was not able to get.</span> <span data-start="619.66" data-end="625.069">I'm helping you out so in the future you will go out and you will help others.</span> <span data-start="625.069" data-end="628.57">But from most of the people, it was alien stuff.</span> <span data-start="628.57" data-end="631.91">And I was getting random questions around it.</span> <span data-start="631.91" data-end="636.899">And one of the questions which I used to get frequently was, what do you do on meetups?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="636.899" data-end="643.35">Because getting an online platform to an offline event is very tricky.</span> <span data-start="643.35" data-end="648.62">You need to gain the trust and especially developers are very hesitant.</span> <span data-start="648.62" data-end="654.12">They feel very shy that how we will go to a random place, sit with random people.</span> <span data-start="654.12" data-end="657.23">Who am I going to talk to?</span> <span data-start="657.23" data-end="659.22">I got tired of answering this question.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="727.58" data-end="730.73">For one year we were running our meetups with our salary.</span> <span data-start="730.73" data-end="737.65">We paid for our food and venue and do the meetups free of cost.</span> <span data-start="737.65" data-end="749.49">I didn't have any experience, I have no experience how I can reach them.</span> <span data-start="749.49" data-end="753.73">Non branding meetups for the community.</span> <span data-start="753.73" data-end="756.629">So, let's try the time.</span> <span data-start="756.629" data-end="762.709">But luckily for us, we got a sponsor.</span> <span data-start="762.709" data-end="768.019">And, again, the same question, what are you doing on weekend?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="768.019" data-end="770.25">Are you trying to hire people?</span> <span data-start="770.25" data-end="772.819">Do you have any sort of questions.</span> <span data-start="772.819" data-end="777.06">And I was explaining a lot of that for working space.</span> <span data-start="777.06" data-end="782.259">And they got they were very happy and what they offered us is you can utilize our space</span> <span data-start="782.259" data-end="783.259">free of cost.</span> <span data-start="783.259" data-end="785.889">Then we did our meetup there is.</span> <span data-start="785.889" data-end="790.029">So, this is how we got our first venue sponsor.</span> <span data-start="790.029" data-end="794.829">After that, we got Microsoft as our official sponsor.</span> <span data-start="794.829" data-end="798.98">That was a big break for us because Microsoft was our first corporate sponsor.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="798.98" data-end="803.579">They came up with the venue, food, as well as speakers.</span> <span data-start="803.579" data-end="807.6">And this is how we have to get a sponsor.</span> <span data-start="807.6" data-end="810.98">First is food and venue, and second is knowledge partners.</span> <span data-start="810.98" data-end="815.029">They can send their speakers to send knowledge.</span> <span data-start="815.029" data-end="818.07">One thing I learned out of that, sponsors are a relationship.</span> <span data-start="818.07" data-end="823.62">For me, it is not that if someone is sponsoring, I will say yes.</span> <span data-start="823.62" data-end="826.91">I first evaluate what value they can add.</span> <span data-start="826.91" data-end="828.98">What value I can add to them.</span> <span data-start="828.98" data-end="830.68">Only then do I say yes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="830.68" data-end="835.279">Because JS Lovers is a community dedicated to developers only.</span> <span data-start="835.279" data-end="841.189">So, if some sponsor is coming to sell something or pitch something, I just say no.</span> <span data-start="841.189" data-end="843.009">Unless and until it is something valuable.</span> <span data-start="843.009" data-end="850.66">Same with me, if I'm not able to add any value to their community, my community, I say no.</span> <span data-start="850.66" data-end="855.57">So, if you can going to pick any sponsor, please pick is very carefully.</span> <span data-start="855.57" data-end="856.86">It is very important.</span> <span data-start="856.86" data-end="859.11">Because your members are very smart.</span> <span data-start="859.11" data-end="863.709">They will understand that you have a paid sponsor standing on the stage.</span> <span data-start="863.709" data-end="865.86">So, you need to be very careful.</span> <span data-start="865.86" data-end="868.519">I have said no to many sponsors.</span> <span data-start="868.519" data-end="874.27">And I don't regret because I know because of that there is trust of my members.</span> <span data-start="874.27" data-end="877.51">A few of the sponsors are here.</span> <span data-start="877.51" data-end="880.559">Out of that, Amazon.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="880.559" data-end="885.069">And we keep doing a lot of swags.</span> <span data-start="885.069" data-end="888.89">And people get hooked to us.</span> <span data-start="888.89" data-end="892.339">But it is not that every time they will get swag.</span> <span data-start="892.339" data-end="893.839">This is the most tricky part.</span> <span data-start="893.839" data-end="896.54">This is a surprise factor.</span> <span data-start="896.54" data-end="902.019">If you are coming to our meetup this month, you might get, or you might not get.</span> <span data-start="902.019" data-end="904.899">This is always a surprise factor.</span> <span data-start="904.899" data-end="905.899">Collaborations.</span> <span data-start="905.899" data-end="910.04">Collaboration was very, very important.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="932.88" data-end="934.24">And they said, yes.</span> <span data-start="934.24" data-end="938.339">So, we did an IoT workshop and got good response.</span> <span data-start="938.339" data-end="939.67">I asked for the feedback.</span> <span data-start="939.67" data-end="946.939">Now they feel happy because they have a skill apart from the primary skill and they enjoyed</span> <span data-start="946.939" data-end="947.939">that.</span> <span data-start="947.939" data-end="955.519">And I analyzed and saw, yes, it is important, if I'm a developer, IoT, it is fun.</span> <span data-start="955.519" data-end="958.129">You never know what is your hobby.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="958.129" data-end="962.8">I started doing collaboration with other communities and other technologies.</span> <span data-start="962.8" data-end="967.889">And this helped my members as well as me too as an organizer because I learned what other</span> <span data-start="967.889" data-end="970.379">organizers are doing, how they are doing.</span> <span data-start="970.379" data-end="974.999">So, I was missing the biggest thing, which is code of conduct in my community.</span> <span data-start="974.999" data-end="979.66">While I was doing the collaboration, one of the organizers actually shared with me that</span> <span data-start="979.66" data-end="982.129">you should have a code of conduct in your community.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="982.129" data-end="988.399">Because if someone is actually trouble you, that code of conduct can help you a lot.</span> <span data-start="988.399" data-end="989.86">And then I said, oh, yes.</span> <span data-start="989.86" data-end="991.059">I forgot.</span> <span data-start="991.059" data-end="993.019">And this is how I learned it.</span> <span data-start="993.019" data-end="994.87">By doing the collaboration.</span> <span data-start="994.87" data-end="996.45">By meeting new organizers.</span> <span data-start="996.45" data-end="1000.79">So, please, if you are getting the opportunity of doing collaboration, do it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1000.79" data-end="1001.79">I'm not scared.</span> <span data-start="1001.79" data-end="1004.66">A lot of people come to me and say, you are a JavaScript community.</span> <span data-start="1004.66" data-end="1007.779">Why are you doing meetup on this?</span> <span data-start="1007.779" data-end="1009.22">Because my members are asking for it.</span> <span data-start="1009.22" data-end="1011.649">They wanted to learn and grow.</span> <span data-start="1011.649" data-end="1013.18">Feedback.</span> <span data-start="1013.18" data-end="1019.459">Always, always ask for the feedback because this is what I believe, feedback is your next</span> <span data-start="1019.459" data-end="1020.459">steps.</span> <span data-start="1020.459" data-end="1026.199">If JS Lovers is able to come through three years just because of we worked on feedback.</span> <span data-start="1026.199" data-end="1032.92">If I'm not getting a feedback, I feel I'm doing literally a very wrong thing.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1165.89" data-end="1166.89">That's it.</span> <span data-start="1166.89" data-end="1168.27">And that actually helped us a lot.</span> <span data-start="1168.27" data-end="1173.25">Now people started looking for that one meetup in a month to meet us.</span> <span data-start="1173.25" data-end="1174.78">Building the best team.</span> <span data-start="1174.78" data-end="1178.85">Running our community at such scale is very tricky.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1178.85" data-end="1183.25">It was just me and my co organizer and we used to have full time jobs also.</span> <span data-start="1183.25" data-end="1184.79">So, it's like a crazy job.</span> <span data-start="1184.79" data-end="1186.32">We were doing two jobs.</span> <span data-start="1186.32" data-end="1190.13">I was not able a build a team because we were looking for the best people.</span> <span data-start="1190.13" data-end="1194.86">And as a result, I was just ending up following with them.</span> <span data-start="1194.86" data-end="1200.919">But after a few months I realized I should look for the self motivated people who understand</span> <span data-start="1200.919" data-end="1203.42">what it takes to be a part of the community.</span> <span data-start="1203.42" data-end="1208.29">As a result, we are five people who help in social media, graphics and everything.</span> <span data-start="1208.29" data-end="1212.48">They take care of everything and I don't need to do any follow up or anything.</span> <span data-start="1212.48" data-end="1217.78">They just know because they are self motivated and they know what they want to do.</span> <span data-start="1217.78" data-end="1224.6">And this is the most asked question, what's the group?</span> <span data-start="1224.6" data-end="1227.89">People used to put all the code on the WhatsApp.</span> <span data-start="1227.89" data-end="1233.659">And I had to drop that group.</span> <span data-start="1233.659" data-end="1238.62">You need to be there every time doing moderation and everything.</span> <span data-start="1238.62" data-end="1243.539">So, it was like I'm running an offline community and also maintaining an online community.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1243.539" data-end="1247.57">And every time I have to push the discussion from one place to another.</span> <span data-start="1247.57" data-end="1249.25">And I was like, this is not them.</span> <span data-start="1249.25" data-end="1250.63">This is what you asked.</span> <span data-start="1250.63" data-end="1251.63">You need to run it.</span> <span data-start="1251.63" data-end="1255.909">I can't be the organize the main person behind that.</span> <span data-start="1255.909" data-end="1257.289">These two things didn't work for me.</span> <span data-start="1257.289" data-end="1262.38">So, I stopped and kept everything on my platform, which is Meetup.</span> <span data-start="1262.38" data-end="1265.96">But the second problem.</span> <span data-start="1265.96" data-end="1270.32">In one of the meetups we have a few females and then there's only me.</span> <span data-start="1270.32" data-end="1276.49">Then there are a few females and then, again, it's only me.</span> <span data-start="1276.49" data-end="1282.399">So, I was hoping that a lot of females would come because a female is the front face.</span> <span data-start="1282.399" data-end="1283.48">She is running the show.</span> <span data-start="1283.48" data-end="1286.23">She knows all the pain, she has taken care of everything.</span> <span data-start="1286.23" data-end="1287.45">But, no.</span> <span data-start="1287.45" data-end="1288.76">This is not happening.</span> </p>
