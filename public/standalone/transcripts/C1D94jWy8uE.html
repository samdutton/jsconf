<span data-start="44.46" data-end="46.26">think it's really important to value</span> <span data-start="46.26" data-end="47.969">that and I really appreciate that that</span> <span data-start="47.969" data-end="52.23">tradition is continued here today I had</span> <span data-start="52.23" data-end="54.18">a question at the time that I was trying</span> <span data-start="54.18" data-end="56.64">to figure out the answer to how do you</span> <span data-start="56.64" data-end="59.609">test your front-end I think we've got</span> <span data-start="59.609" data-end="61.17">some really good answers about how to</span> <span data-start="61.17" data-end="64.17">test our unit tests how to test our</span> <span data-start="64.17" data-end="65.85">functions our classes and our UI</span> <span data-start="65.85" data-end="68.1">components and isolation I think it</span> <span data-start="68.1" data-end="69.54">becomes more difficult when we try to</span> <span data-start="69.54" data-end="71.88">integrate that all these things and put</span> <span data-start="71.88" data-end="74.659">it all together a lot can go wrong on</span> <span data-start="74.659"

data-end="83.52">deployments when we put all those things</span> <span data-start="83.52" data-end="85.29">together anything could break down and</span> <span data-start="85.29" data-end="86.939">we could have all the unit tests in the</span> <span data-start="86.939" data-end="88.56">world and they won't help us in those</span> <span data-start="88.56" data-end="91.71">cases so the type of tests they try to</span> <span data-start="91.71" data-end="93.869">exercise this are called end end tests</span> <span data-start="93.869" data-end="95.729">testing things from one end all the way</span> <span data-start="95.729" data-end="100.47">to the other and back I had a lot of</span> <span data-start="100.47" data-end="102.63">really great conversations at the</span> <span data-start="102.63"

data-end="122.82">becoming friends with my wife while we</span> <span data-start="122.82" data-end="124.74">were hanging out talking about testing</span> <span data-start="124.74" data-end="128.19">and he talked about all the tests that</span> <span data-start="128.19" data-end="131.22">his team had written they had thousands</span> <span data-start="131.22" data-end="133.45">and thousands of unit tests</span> <span data-start="133.45" data-end="135.64">lots and lots of integration tests and</span> <span data-start="135.64" data-end="138.1">maybe a thousand or so an N test which</span> <span data-start="138.1" data-end="139.78">is quite a lot they were testing an</span> <span data-start="139.78" data-end="141.97">enterprise app which is just an app that</span> <span data-start="141.97" data-end="145.569">does way too many things and I was so</span> <span data-start="145.569" data-end="147.31">impressed with all the things he had to</span> <span data-start="147.31" data-end="148.99">say about their stack and their tools</span> <span data-start="148.99" data-end="151.09">and all the effort they put in I applied</span> <span data-start="151.09" data-end="152.5">to work at his company and a few months</span> <span data-start="152.5" data-end="154.27">later my wife and I moved out to</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="213.98" data-end="216.89">JavaScript and that language would</span> <span data-start="216.89" data-end="219.44">usually use a library to speak the</span> <span data-start="219.44" data-end="221.42">language of selenium the webdriver API</span> <span data-start="221.42" data-end="223.16">it would send those commands to the</span> <span data-start="223.16" data-end="224.45">service and the service would queue all</span> <span data-start="224.45" data-end="226.01">these commands and would try to send</span> <span data-start="226.01" data-end="228.76">them to any given browser real browsers</span> <span data-start="228.76" data-end="232.37">and so there was just a number of</span> <span data-start="232.37" data-end="234.77">different abstractions and integration</span> <span data-start="234.77" data-end="237.32">and interfaces where things could go</span> <span data-start="237.32" data-end="239.81">wrong it could be that your test code</span> <span data-start="239.81" data-end="242.69">had an issue or using the API different</span> <span data-start="242.69" data-end="244.7">and all the different API is to work</span> <span data-start="244.7" data-end="246.35">with selenium in every language and even</span> <span data-start="246.35" data-end="247.519">within JavaScript there's several</span> <span data-start="247.519" data-end="248.63">choices they're all a little bit</span> <span data-start="248.63" data-end="251.45">different those could have issues or you</span> <span data-start="251.45" data-end="253.22">could be using it incorrectly the</span> <span data-start="253.22" data-end="254.42">selenium service queuing up those</span> <span data-start="254.42" data-end="255.739">commands and sending them to the browser</span> <span data-start="255.739" data-end="258.08">drivers for each browser the browser</span> <span data-start="258.08" data-end="260.06">drivers could have bugs there are a lot</span> <span data-start="260.06" data-end="261.32">of ways where this could go off the</span> <span data-start="261.32" data-end="271.37">rails just with this architecture</span> <span data-start="271.38" data-end="274.32">so the greatest complexity of all is our</span> <span data-start="274.32" data-end="277.8">app I find that as we write modern</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="277.8" data-end="280.2">JavaScript apps we're doing a lot of</span> <span data-start="280.2" data-end="282.18">things now in the browser we're making</span> <span data-start="282.18" data-end="284.04">all these different API calls just when</span> <span data-start="284.04" data-end="287.07">the page loads those come back in</span> <span data-start="287.07" data-end="289.47">different timings different orders</span> <span data-start="289.47" data-end="293.13">sometimes that can cause just different</span> <span data-start="293.13" data-end="295.02">behaviors in our front-end whenever the</span> <span data-start="295.02" data-end="297.44">user interacts with the API with our UI</span> <span data-start="297.44" data-end="300.24">that makes more calls more things happen</span> <span data-start="300.24" data-end="302.76">and all these happen things happen</span> <span data-start="302.76" data-end="304.77">asynchronously</span> <span data-start="304.77" data-end="308.19">so we are rendering m''d it could finish</span> <span data-start="308.19" data-end="309.69">at any time and we don't really</span> <span data-start="309.69" data-end="311.73">necessarily know when it is at least</span> <span data-start="311.73" data-end="314.46">from our test codes point of view us as</span> <span data-start="314.46" data-end="316.2">users as humans it's very intuitive to</span> <span data-start="316.2" data-end="317.94">us but we run our test code it does</span> <span data-start="317.94" data-end="320.61">exactly what we tell to do and if it's</span> <span data-start="320.61" data-end="323.1">trying to if it clicks a button and then</span> <span data-start="323.1" data-end="325.02">it

knowing</span> <span data-start="328.35" data-end="329.91">that it finished rendering or we might</span> <span data-start="329.91" data-end="337.53">get something very unexpected so the</span> <span data-start="337.53" data-end="339.39">greatest problem of all is when we take</span> <span data-start="339.39" data-end="341.22">this selenium architecture and combine</span> <span data-start="341.22" data-end="343.71">it with the complexity of our apps it's</span> <span data-start="343.71" data-end="346.83">really a recipe for just frustration and</span> <span data-start="346.83" data-end="349.5">what we'd find is we'd write a commit</span> <span data-start="349.5" data-end="350.97">and we'd run tests locally and</span> <span data-start="350.97" data-end="352.2">everything will look good we'd push it</span> <span data-start="352.2" data-end="355.59">to the build and it would fail some</span> <span data-start="355.59" data-end="357.39">tests would fail and usually in an</span> <span data-start="357.39" data-end="360.15">end-to-end test and we'd run that build</span> <span data-start="360.15" data-end="361.71">again because it was a test that we</span> <span data-start="361.71" data-end="363.51">didn't even like shouldn't have broken</span> <span data-start="363.51" data-end="366.72">and it would pass and we'd see this over</span> <span data-start="366.72" data-end="368.79">and over again and we're different</span> <span data-start="368.79" data-end="370.5">commits we just randomly failed this</span> <span data-start="370.5" data-end="371.67">different tests and we call this</span> <span data-start="371.67" data-end="374.84">flakiness and the problem might be</span> <span data-start="374.84" data-end="376.74">something with a selenium architecture</span> <span data-start="376.74" data-end="378.54">often it was a combination of that and</span> <span data-start="378.54" data-end="380.52">just the complexity of our app working</span> <span data-start="380.52" data-end="382.29">in different before with different</span> <span data-start="382.29" data-end="384.45">performance characteristics particularly</span> <span data-start="384.45" data-end="386.88">when we're on build environments they're</span> <span data-start="386.88" data-end="388.83">virtualized you know they just things</span> <span data-start="388.83" data-end="390.75">can slow down or the database anything</span> <span data-start="390.75" data-end="392.13">could make it just work a little bit</span> <span data-start="392.13" data-end="394.74">slower and one part of the stack at any</span> <span data-start="394.74" data-end="396.6">given time and something will fail</span> <span data-start="396.6" data-end="399.479">somewhere we ran into this so much we</span> <span data-start="399.479" data-end="400.86">had a bill job that would just</span> <span data-start="400.86" data-end="402.87">continuously run and check the latest</span> <span data-start="402.87" data-end="404.58">commits on master and just run all the</span> <span data-start="404.58" data-end="405.06">tests</span> <span data-start="405.06" data-end="407.4">and it would just flush out dozens and</span> <span data-start="407.4" data-end="408.98">dozens of tests that just failed a lot</span> <span data-start="408.98" data-end="411.87">even with that we just kept tripping</span> <span data-start="411.87" data-end="413.94">over this issue over and over again test</span> <span data-start="413.94" data-end="420.36">it would just fail once in a while why</span> <span data-start="420.36" data-end="422.82">do we keep doing this well these tests</span> <span data-start="422.82" data-end="424.92">we found to be extremely valuable as I</span> <span data-start="424.92" data-end="425.94">said before you could have all your</span> <span data-start="425.94" data-end="428.88">tests
