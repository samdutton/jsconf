<p><span data-start="2.5" data-end="6.45">Values Influence Practices By</span> <span data-start="30.9" data-end="31.9">[ Applause ] >> All right.</span> <span data-start="31.9" data-end="32.9">Thanks for coming.</span> <span data-start="32.9" data-end="38.19">I continue this theme of speaking about community, but I look at it from a different perspective.</span> <span data-start="38.19" data-end="43.6">We look at the culture of communities in terms of norms and values that are established in</span> <span data-start="43.6" data-end="51.399">communities and how in different communities have usually fairly cohesive values and practices,</span> <span data-start="51.399" data-end="55.08">but among different communities you see huge differences.</span> <span data-start="55.08" data-end="59.9">And I want to talk about some of those effects and what you can learn from looking into other</span> <span data-start="59.9" data-end="60.96">communities.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="60.96" data-end="64.699">This is joint with Chris, Anna, James and Ferdian.</span> <span data-start="64.699" data-end="69.35">I'm at Carnegie Mellon University.</span> <span data-start="69.35" data-end="72.63">This is not with experience.</span> <span data-start="72.63" data-end="76">I don't have much experience with JavaScript to be honest.</span> <span data-start="76" data-end="78.67">This is from an outsider's perspective.</span> <span data-start="78.67" data-end="89.45">We study ecosystems as an outsider, and we hope we have an idea of comparing ecosystems</span> <span data-start="89.45" data-end="91.31">learning about this from the outside.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="91.31" data-end="97.221">And we have been looking into this as a research project which we called breaking APIs for</span> <span data-start="97.221" data-end="101.86">the last couple of years and we have a Twitter account and web page based on this that I'm</span> <span data-start="101.86" data-end="105.68">going to advertise a little bit later.</span> <span data-start="105.68" data-end="108.39">So we looked broadly at ecosystems.</span> <span data-start="108.39" data-end="119.47">And they form around platforms and products where you have a network structure of dependencies.</span> <span data-start="119.47" data-end="124.17">You can depend on a package, and that package can depend on other packages.</span> <span data-start="124.17" data-end="130.02">And you have many of those communities around in different languages and different products.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="130.02" data-end="136.06">The main point of this talk is that the culture of the ecosystem matters.</span> <span data-start="136.06" data-end="141.26">There are lots of different values, different ecosystems adopt different values.</span> <span data-start="141.26" data-end="143.89">Different things are more important than other things.</span> <span data-start="143.89" data-end="146.68">And leads to different tradeoffs.</span> <span data-start="146.68" data-end="149.73">You can't achieve everything perfectly.</span> <span data-start="149.73" data-end="153.42">Some communities favor some things over others.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="153.42" data-end="158.19">And following this, different cost allocations, some people have an easier time.</span> <span data-start="158.19" data-end="164.68">People are new to an ecosystem or people establish or put into an ecosystem.</span> <span data-start="164.68" data-end="169.489">And you often see consequences in terms of what we call ecosystem health.</span> <span data-start="169.489" data-end="174.59">So are there specific problems that you see in ecosystems, like it's hard to retain developers</span> <span data-start="174.59" data-end="175.709">in this ecosystem?</span> <span data-start="175.709" data-end="180.46">Or a lot of packages are generally considered low quality, things like that.</span> <span data-start="180.46" data-end="183.87">And why would you want to learn about this?</span> <span data-start="183.87" data-end="187.5">There are lots of different issues where this might be interesting.</span> <span data-start="187.5" data-end="191.54">Let's say you want to change a policy or introduce a new policy.</span> <span data-start="191.54" data-end="197.25">Say you want to change the versioning rules in your ecosystem or the way� how you upload</span> <span data-start="197.25" data-end="198.25">packages.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="198.25" data-end="200.53">Packages need to be reviewed first in some way.</span> <span data-start="200.53" data-end="201.83">How you make this decision?</span> <span data-start="201.83" data-end="203.75">How do you think about those tradeoffs?</span> <span data-start="203.75" data-end="206.56">How do you decide whether this is a good idea?</span> <span data-start="206.56" data-end="208.58">What are the consequences based on this?</span> <span data-start="208.58" data-end="212.51">So understanding the space, understanding tradeoffs can be a help.</span> <span data-start="212.51" data-end="215.54">Or you want to fight a health issue.</span> <span data-start="215.54" data-end="218.81">You have problems retaining and recruiting new developers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="218.81" data-end="224.489">What design decision in your ecosystem might be contributing to this?</span> <span data-start="224.489" data-end="228.69">How can you debug your community to figure out what to change?</span> <span data-start="228.69" data-end="230.87">Or design a new community.</span> <span data-start="230.87" data-end="236.351">I don't think any of us will design the next npm, but there might be a chance where we</span> <span data-start="236.351" data-end="242.659">are focusing on sub communities, say Hoodie or some number of packages where you want</span> <span data-start="242.659" data-end="244.349">to push specific values.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="244.349" data-end="248.41">What can you do to foster goals in one community?</span> <span data-start="248.41" data-end="253.07">And, again, for this, culture really matters.</span> <span data-start="253.07" data-end="257.18">It's important to understand the values that� it's important to understand the tradeoffs.</span> <span data-start="257.18" data-end="262.37">And we have been doing research on this for a while.</span> <span data-start="262.37" data-end="266.52">What I'm going to talk about is mostly based on interviews and surveys that we have conducted</span> <span data-start="266.52" data-end="268.62">throughout the last couple of years.</span> <span data-start="268.62" data-end="272.13">And we looked at this through one specific lens.</span> <span data-start="272.13" data-end="274.78">And that's breaking changes.</span> <span data-start="274.78" data-end="280.31">The idea here is that if you use a package, there are lots of dependencies often mind</span> <span data-start="280.31" data-end="283.25">that package and you depend on a number of packages.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="283.25" data-end="287.25">And all of those packages have maintainers, and they could make just changes to their</span> <span data-start="287.25" data-end="288.25">packages.</span> <span data-start="288.25" data-end="289.99">And some of those changes are modular.</span> <span data-start="289.99" data-end="294.43">So you just update and have the great new version and everything works fine.</span> <span data-start="294.43" data-end="297.08">But some of those changes are breaking changes.</span> <span data-start="297.08" data-end="299.88">So they may change some of their APIs.</span> <span data-start="299.88" data-end="302.78">So when you update, your code isn't working anymore.</span> <span data-start="302.78" data-end="305.71">You have to invest some time, get interrupted.</span> <span data-start="305.71" data-end="310.83">You need to invest in new code when you want to migrate.</span> <span data-start="310.83" data-end="312.34">This can rip through the ecosystem.</span> <span data-start="312.34" data-end="313.98">It can have consequences.</span> <span data-start="313.98" data-end="319.99">A single change can affect hundreds of developers and their packages.</span> <span data-start="319.99" data-end="322.889">So you can start thinking about costs.</span> <span data-start="322.889" data-end="325.69">What's the cost of a breaking change in this sense?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="325.69" data-end="330.82">And we think about this as kind of a balance of who takes cost� it's somewhat an abstract</span> <span data-start="330.82" data-end="331.91">concept.</span> <span data-start="331.91" data-end="337.56">But in the extreme case, it's really easy to make a change and impact hundreds of thousands</span> <span data-start="337.56" data-end="344.13">of developers out there who all get interrupted and who all need to invest in doing some rework.</span> <span data-start="344.13" data-end="349.16">So it makes it really easy for maintainers to break something and puts the cost on the</span> <span data-start="349.16" data-end="350.16">users.</span> <span data-start="350.16" data-end="351.75">That's one extreme.</span> <span data-start="351.75" data-end="356.77">The opposite extreme would be you refrain from making a change even though it's really</span> <span data-start="356.77" data-end="358.74">important to you.</span> <span data-start="358.74" data-end="360.61">There are lots of reasons for making changes.</span> <span data-start="360.61" data-end="367">Nothing is really ever stable, but if you are not allowed to make breaking changes,</span> <span data-start="367" data-end="372.68">if you really refrain from this, you're taking on costs, mostly technical debt, opportunity</span> <span data-start="372.68" data-end="376.76">costs, maybe have some performance problems that you could fix with an API change, but</span> <span data-start="376.76" data-end="378.49">you can't really do that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="378.49" data-end="379.49">Right?</span> <span data-start="379.49" data-end="384.44">So it be really costly for you and maybe in the longterm also for your users not to break</span> <span data-start="384.44" data-end="385.6">anything.</span> <span data-start="385.6" data-end="391.009">And then there's a lot of passes in the middle where you kind of, as a maintainer, you break</span> <span data-start="391.009" data-end="396.53">something, but you try to reduce the cost for your users by mitigating some of those</span> <span data-start="396.53" data-end="397.53">changes.</span> <span data-start="397.53" data-end="403.25">A typical example is you invest some effort in writing a migration grade to make it easier</span> <span data-start="403.25" data-end="405.25">for your users to update.</span> <span data-start="405.25" data-end="409.38">You might synchronize releases with other packages or on a schedule to make it easier</span> <span data-start="409.38" data-end="411.52">to make changes and not get interrupted.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="411.52" data-end="420.52">And processes like backporting and deprecation, how you can delay the impact of changes.</span> <span data-start="420.52" data-end="421.65">So it's not as immediate.</span> <span data-start="421.65" data-end="425.27">And there are hundreds of those practices.</span> <span data-start="425.27" data-end="431.37">And, again, what I want to show is that different communities have different cost allocations,</span> <span data-start="431.37" data-end="435.86">use different practices, and kind of really negotiate differently in this space.</span> <span data-start="435.86" data-end="440.139">So in this talk I'm primarily going to talk about three ecosystems.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="440.139" data-end="442.34">There are many more.</span> <span data-start="442.34" data-end="447.169">Our web page contains survey data on 18 ecosystems in total.</span> <span data-start="447.169" data-end="451.38">But I want to dive in a little bit deeper on three of those.</span> <span data-start="451.38" data-end="456.32">And I'm going to start with Eclipse and them assuming you know less about them than NodeJS.</span> <span data-start="456.32" data-end="463.73">When I'm talking about those ecosystems, think about your community and what practices you</span> <span data-start="463.73" data-end="467.9">do and how this is different from what you see in those ecosystems.</span> <span data-start="467.9" data-end="470.08">And think about why.</span> <span data-start="470.08" data-end="471.629">Is this a good idea?</span> <span data-start="471.629" data-end="472.629">Should this be different?</span> <span data-start="472.629" data-end="479.52">Should we copy things that I'm going to show you Eclipse?</span> <span data-start="479.52" data-end="484.16">Let's start with Eclipse.</span> <span data-start="484.16" data-end="486.91">You have probably heard of it.</span> <span data-start="486.91" data-end="489.27">Originally for Java programming.</span> <span data-start="489.27" data-end="491.389">Has hundreds of plugins.</span> <span data-start="491.389" data-end="493.02">These plugins can depend on other plugins.</span> <span data-start="493.02" data-end="496.16">So you have this ecosystem structure.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="496.16" data-end="502.02">And if you look into this community, if you talk to people, or even if you just look at</span> <span data-start="502.02" data-end="508.669">their web page, you realize what values are important in this community.</span> <span data-start="508.669" data-end="514.06">So one important value is backward compatibility.</span> <span data-start="514.06" data-end="520.159">They say on their web page extremely explicitly, as the API prime director, when involving</span> <span data-start="520.159" data-end="526.56">the component API from release to release, do not break existing clients, right?</span> <span data-start="526.56" data-end="528.67">They really focus on stability.</span> <span data-start="528.67" data-end="530.54">And that's not something that they just say.</span> <span data-start="530.54" data-end="532.92">This is a culture that they live.</span> <span data-start="532.92" data-end="535.67">And here I can show you some data from our survey.</span> <span data-start="535.67" data-end="538.32">And I'm going to show you more plots like this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="538.32" data-end="544.92">But how to read this is mostly� so we ask, how important is stability to your community?</span> <span data-start="544.92" data-end="548.55">And the higher up they are, the more important it is.</span> <span data-start="548.55" data-end="550.25">These are all positive values.</span> <span data-start="550.25" data-end="554.29">So we ask pretty from a little bit important to very important.</span> <span data-start="554.29" data-end="557.24">And most people say, yes, stability is important.</span> <span data-start="557.24" data-end="562.27">But what you still see are differences among ecosystems, and we have sorted this by average</span> <span data-start="562.27" data-end="563.41">rank.</span> <span data-start="563.41" data-end="568.5">And what you see is that Eclipse is really on the far end here.</span> <span data-start="568.5" data-end="575.81">Eclipse is the ecosystem on which developers rate stability as the most important practice.</span> <span data-start="575.81" data-end="578.05">Way more than other ecosystems.</span> <span data-start="578.05" data-end="581.27">And this is consistent� largely consistent within this community.</span> <span data-start="581.27" data-end="588.12">So this value that's communicated is actually accepted by the community and you see consequences.</span> <span data-start="588.12" data-end="593.529">So when we ask them, for example, about how often are you making breaking changes?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="593.529" data-end="596.91">Or how often are you faced by breaking changes?</span> <span data-start="596.91" data-end="602.79">You see answers that Eclipse� changes in other ecosystems.</span> <span data-start="602.79" data-end="607.01">So this is actually a best practice.</span> <span data-start="607.01" data-end="610.45">In terms of cost distribution, what I have shown you in the beginning, this is pretty</span> <span data-start="610.45" data-end="618.11">much on the extreme side whereas a developer, you are not allowed to make breaking changes.</span> <span data-start="618.11" data-end="624.94">Use a lot of work arounds, a lot of creative hacking and getting around limitations.</span> <span data-start="624.94" data-end="630.06">And there's the reduction of the impact of releases.</span> <span data-start="630.06" data-end="633.25">A fixed schedule, once a year there's a big release.</span> <span data-start="633.25" data-end="641.86">And large parts of the community synchronize and go through a month-long process of checking</span> <span data-start="641.86" data-end="644.66">things and so on.</span> <span data-start="644.66" data-end="645.89">So severing a tradeoff.</span> <span data-start="645.89" data-end="649.12">What can they achieve and what are the problems here?</span> <span data-start="649.12" data-end="651.63">So Eclipse is extremely stable.</span> <span data-start="651.63" data-end="653.399">It's convenient to use.</span> <span data-start="653.399" data-end="660.6">You can put packets written 13 years ago in a new version of Eclipse, and they work.</span> <span data-start="660.6" data-end="665.45">Try doing this with JavaScript packages.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="665.45" data-end="668.3">Yearly updates are sufficient for many in the community.</span> <span data-start="668.3" data-end="672.92">You don't need to update from week to week to see the next update.</span> <span data-start="672.92" data-end="674.95">But this has consequences.</span> <span data-start="674.95" data-end="681.8">Eclipse is seen by many we spoke to as is stagnant and staid platform.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="681.8" data-end="687.65">They have it without the generics, they couldn't update those.</span> <span data-start="687.65" data-end="694.11">And if I take my students as references, I would say they are not using Eclipse anymore</span> <span data-start="694.11" data-end="695.11">these days.</span> <span data-start="695.11" data-end="697.68">So at least in Java, people have switched to IntelliJ.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="697.68" data-end="709.29">Not sure it's a good example, but by that example Twitter is pretty much dead.</span> <span data-start="709.29" data-end="712.76">I'm not sure with the students these days.</span> <span data-start="712.76" data-end="718.84">Eclipse reports that they have difficulty recruiting and retaining developers�and</span> <span data-start="718.84" data-end="723.5">that also these coordinated releases are kind of a pain point for them� for the community.</span> <span data-start="723.5" data-end="727.79">So they invest a lot of evident, but it's also painful.</span> <span data-start="727.79" data-end="730.05">When we ask the question about health.</span> <span data-start="730.05" data-end="733.76">How much do you face the difficulty of recruiting new developers?</span> <span data-start="733.76" data-end="735.87">It's on the far end.</span> <span data-start="735.87" data-end="741.81">If we ask about how much do you feel limited in innovating in your ecosystem, it's on the</span> <span data-start="741.81" data-end="751.94">far end, but on the other side if you ask� What I have shown you here is one end.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="751.94" data-end="756.79">Eclipse has made specific decisions which I guess you see as very different from your</span> <span data-start="756.79" data-end="762.709">community and they have accepted certain tradeoffs and have certain goals with this.</span> <span data-start="762.709" data-end="769.209">I want to talk about the second ecosystem, R, kind of the npm for R.</span> <span data-start="769.209" data-end="773.32">R is a language for statistically computation.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="773.32" data-end="779.34">And there are a couple of thousand packages on CRAN that are usually cutting edge research</span> <span data-start="779.34" data-end="780.4">and statistics.</span> <span data-start="780.4" data-end="787.18">So when you interview people in this community you often speak to physicists or soil analysis,</span> <span data-start="787.18" data-end="793.709">researchers, retired professors who maintain some packages in this community.</span> <span data-start="793.709" data-end="798.209">And they do something pretty interesting about dependencies and about versioning.</span> <span data-start="798.209" data-end="800.269">We call it the snapshot consistency.</span> <span data-start="800.269" data-end="807.22">The goal is the most recent version of all packages on the ecosystem should be compatible.</span> <span data-start="807.22" data-end="811.931">So it doesn't matter that the newest version of package A is compatible with an older version</span> <span data-start="811.931" data-end="817.829">of package B, it just has to be compatible with the newest version of package B at this</span> <span data-start="817.829" data-end="818.829">time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="818.829" data-end="824.71">So at any point you should be able to install any packages in that ecosystem, update all</span> <span data-start="824.71" data-end="828.18">at once, and it should be compatible.</span> <span data-start="828.18" data-end="831.449">So to achieve this, this requires coordination.</span> <span data-start="831.449" data-end="836.279">So what typically happens here is you are allowed to break things, but when you break</span> <span data-start="836.279" data-end="840.959">something, you reach out to people in that community that are affected.</span> <span data-start="840.959" data-end="842.14">You coordinate.</span> <span data-start="842.14" data-end="846.08">And then you typically more or less publish both packages.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="876.92" data-end="879.72">Some volunteers review changes.</span> <span data-start="879.72" data-end="882.77">So you don't just upload things as an npm.</span> <span data-start="882.77" data-end="885">But you actually submit your changes.</span> <span data-start="885" data-end="889.32">Somebody review this is, run tests on the entire ecosystem to see whether something</span> <span data-start="889.32" data-end="892.22">breaks.</span> <span data-start="892.22" data-end="895.17">In terms of costs, we have a different picture.</span> <span data-start="895.17" data-end="900.42">So you can make breaking changes, but you have to reach out and some volunteers take</span> <span data-start="900.42" data-end="901.88">on some of the additional costs.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="901.88" data-end="906.459">And you cannot have the constant synchronization here.</span> <span data-start="906.459" data-end="910.149">In terms of values, it's not quite that obvious as in Eclipse.</span> <span data-start="910.149" data-end="913.709">It's not strongly communicated on their web page.</span> <span data-start="913.709" data-end="919.06">When we talk to people that are kind of core members of this community, they say they want</span> <span data-start="919.06" data-end="923.98">to make it easy for end users to install and update packages.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="923.98" data-end="929.98">And one of our interviews said CRAN primarily has the academic user in mind who want timely</span> <span data-start="929.98" data-end="931.86">access to current research.</span> <span data-start="931.86" data-end="938.36">And this timely access reflects the contrast, let's say to Eclipse, where you have releases</span> <span data-start="938.36" data-end="939.82">once a year.</span> <span data-start="939.82" data-end="944.32">These people are doing research and want to publish things and get them out there.</span> <span data-start="944.32" data-end="949.41">It's a review process, but much faster than yearly rearrests.</span> <span data-start="949.41" data-end="953.779">interestingly, and I don't have much time to talk about this, this is a value that's</span> <span data-start="953.779" data-end="956.87">not communicated on their Website.</span> <span data-start="956.87" data-end="957.87">It's not transparent.</span> <span data-start="957.87" data-end="963.23">And if you ask people, rapid access or quick release is actually not showing up as one</span> <span data-start="963.23" data-end="966.709">of the key values that the community as a whole shares.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="966.709" data-end="971.66">It's somewhere between Eclipse and bioconducter that both have yearly releases.</span> <span data-start="971.66" data-end="980.16">I think that to the developers of the community, the idea is we want to be faster than the</span> <span data-start="980.16" data-end="982.61">turnaround than those yearly releases.</span> <span data-start="982.61" data-end="989.029">But to package maintainers, it's slower than npm where you can upload things.</span> <span data-start="989.029" data-end="991.089">You have to go through a review process.</span> <span data-start="991.089" data-end="996.449">There are certain values where we speculate they are not communicated well, so people</span> <span data-start="996.449" data-end="1000.32">don't see why the ecosystem is designed this way.</span> <span data-start="1000.32" data-end="1006.16">So, again, there are tradeoffs and costs and benefits.</span> <span data-start="1006.16" data-end="1009.59">So they have relatively short release cycles.</span> <span data-start="1009.59" data-end="1010.709">They achieve compatibility.</span> <span data-start="1010.709" data-end="1013.649">It's actually pretty good usually at that.</span> <span data-start="1013.649" data-end="1019.83">But at the same time, you have this urgency in� this burden to react to updates.</span> <span data-start="1019.83" data-end="1024.159">So, at any time there could be a breaking change that if you depend on that package</span> <span data-start="1024.159" data-end="1030.339">you may need to coordinate, you may get interrupted.</span> <span data-start="1030.339" data-end="1036.65">And this leads to other consequences where people aggressively reduce the number of dependencies</span> <span data-start="1036.65" data-end="1040.919">that they want to depend� they would rather copy and paste code from another package than</span> <span data-start="1040.919" data-end="1045.53">being exposed to this change is something we heard repeatedly.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1045.53" data-end="1051.14">And this gatekeeping causes additional effort and causes friction in this community.</span> <span data-start="1051.14" data-end="1054.41">So, this is always a contested point.</span> <span data-start="1054.41" data-end="1059.789">So, again, I have shown you another example that's probably very different from what you</span> <span data-start="1059.789" data-end="1061.2">know.</span> <span data-start="1061.2" data-end="1065.29">And I think I can make this shorter on Node because, I guess, you know the community much</span> <span data-start="1065.29" data-end="1068.48">better there than me.</span> <span data-start="1068.48" data-end="1073.22">But my first contact with node was something like this.</span> <span data-start="1073.22" data-end="1074.22">Right?</span> <span data-start="1074.22" data-end="1076.37">Last week's tutorial is out of date today.</span> <span data-start="1076.37" data-end="1079.28">This is a couple of years ago that I heard this.</span> <span data-start="1079.28" data-end="1082.919">I forgot who the source was.</span> <span data-start="1082.919" data-end="1088.33">But then you also saw things like this which I think is insane, or unique.</span> <span data-start="1088.33" data-end="1094.82">That people actually started documenting the APIs, at least of the Node APIs, with stability</span> <span data-start="1094.82" data-end="1095.82">indicators.</span> <span data-start="1095.82" data-end="1101.27">They have� it's simpler these days� but this entire infrastructure about things we</span> <span data-start="1101.27" data-end="1102.67">are experimenting with this API.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1129.61" data-end="1131.74">A really low bar.</span> <span data-start="1131.74" data-end="1136.179">Also, you hear this in interviews with Isaac.</span> <span data-start="1136.179" data-end="1143.99">And the goal is to make it easy and fast for developers and publish and use packages.</span> <span data-start="1143.99" data-end="1148.799">If you look at stability, Node is not in the top space.</span> <span data-start="1148.799" data-end="1152.9">This is not the value that is most important in this community.</span> <span data-start="1152.9" data-end="1157.37">But if you look at innovation, this is where Node is at the far end.</span> <span data-start="1157.37" data-end="1163.34">Where the community thinks innovation is a key or is a very important value for us, among</span> <span data-start="1163.34" data-end="1165.77">other ones as well.</span> <span data-start="1165.77" data-end="1171.53">In terms of costs, though, it's pretty much on the extreme where it's really easy to just</span> <span data-start="1171.53" data-end="1174.74">break something and let other people deal with it.</span> <span data-start="1174.74" data-end="1179.289">The main saving grace is you're not forced to update, right?</span> <span data-start="1179.289" data-end="1184.32">So you can stick to an old version when you can't really do in CRAN that much.</span> <span data-start="1184.32" data-end="1186.15">And Eclipse in way.</span> <span data-start="1186.15" data-end="1190.51">You can't really stay behind or partially stay behind on some packages.</span> <span data-start="1190.51" data-end="1191.64">Which is easy here.</span> <span data-start="1191.64" data-end="1193.6">So there's some technology behind it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1193.6" data-end="1196.51">And there's a bunch of practices around this.</span> <span data-start="1196.51" data-end="1202.02">So the semantic versioning is broadly adopted as signaling what's breaking and what's not</span> <span data-start="1202.02" data-end="1203.14">breaking.</span> <span data-start="1203.14" data-end="1207.62">This is something that doesn't make sense to people in CRAN and R.

<p><span data-start="1232.87" data-end="1237.84">And then there's a lot of grassroots tool building from the community that tries to</span> <span data-start="1237.84" data-end="1241.5">build tooling to kind of cope with large amounts of changes.</span> <span data-start="1241.5" data-end="1247.809">Things like Greenkeeper and a bunch of these security projects that try to fit changes</span> <span data-start="1247.809" data-end="1251.89">for you which are important and which are not.</span> <span data-start="1251.89" data-end="1254.72">So in terms of tradeoffs, again, there are costs and benefits.</span> <span data-start="1254.72" data-end="1257.6">It's certainly a much more open community.</span> <span data-start="1257.6" data-end="1258.6">It's easier to get in.</span> <span data-start="1258.6" data-end="1263.49">It's attractive to new developers, at least compared to others.</span> <span data-start="1263.49" data-end="1269.39">But it's perceived somewhat as unstable and having little quality control, right?</span> <span data-start="1269.39" data-end="1272.9">There's a lot of junk on npm.</span> <span data-start="1272.9" data-end="1277.72">And the rapid changes out there require constant maintenance, right?</span> <span data-start="1277.72" data-end="1282.88">So at least if you decide to keep up, and that's usually a good idea, I guess, if you</span> <span data-start="1282.88" data-end="1286.2">decide to keep up, you have a lot of changes to deal with dependencies.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1286.2" data-end="1290.11">There are often a large number of dependencies.</span> <span data-start="1290.11" data-end="1295.809">And then the community helps with tooling and community efforts.</span> <span data-start="1295.809" data-end="1302.48">So from an outsider's perspective, I have the impression that the amount of change in</span> <span data-start="1302.48" data-end="1306.2">Node and in this ecosystem is slowing down a little bit.</span> <span data-start="1306.2" data-end="1310.84">Potentially because there are more commercial users who want more stability.</span> <span data-start="1310.84" data-end="1312.07">More users in general.</span> <span data-start="1312.07" data-end="1314.14">Maybe a larger community.</span> <span data-start="1314.14" data-end="1320.59">So is Node actually getting more stable and, more importantly, should it get more stable?</span> <span data-start="1320.59" data-end="1325.57">And think this is an interesting question for the community to ask because stability</span> <span data-start="1325.57" data-end="1329.34">can be a nice value, but it also has its cost.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1329.34" data-end="1333.69">And we have seen the extreme in Eclipse.</span> <span data-start="1333.69" data-end="1336.72">And this might be worse to think about.</span> <span data-start="1336.72" data-end="1341.15">So what I tried to show here is that culture really matters for an ecosystem.</span> <span data-start="1341.15" data-end="1342.15">Right?</span> <span data-start="1342.15" data-end="1343.15">There are tradeoffs.</span> </p>
