that</span> <span data-start="124.91" data-end="127.1">out the window in this format so be</span> <span data-start="127.1" data-end="129.26">ready to be called on and know that when</span> <span

data-end="133.94">you are very representative of everyone</span> <span data-start="133.94" data-end="136.22">else in the room and it's okay it's the</span> <span data-start="136.22" data-end="141.24">only way I can do a good job in doing so</span> <span data-start="141.25" data-end="143.75">the second point that I'd like to know</span> <span data-start="143.75" data-end="146.23">is that it's very important that you be</span> <span data-start="146.23" data-end="150.2">actually making something or doing</span> <span data-start="150.2" data-end="151.64">something with the information we</span> <span data-start="151.64" data-end="154.13">provide that's why we have all these TAS</span> <span data-start="154.13" data-end="157.19">here this week is so that we can</span> <span data-start="157.19" data-end="159.58">actually work with you on your actual</span> <span data-start="159.58" data-end="164.45">problems if if you stick around

data-end="177.92">curriculum there at a github repo you</span> <span data-start="177.92" data-end="180.05">can download it and start working</span> <span data-start="180.05" data-end="181.94">through the assignments and the TAS will</span> <span data-start="181.94" data-end="184.34">circulate some of them needs a bit more</span> <span data-start="184.34" data-end="187.459">sort of personal

diversion</span> <span data-start="190.489" data-end="193.73">into this advanced crash course I'm</span> <span data-start="193.73" data-end="196.4">going to tell you not this is not</span> <span data-start="196.4" data-end="198.53">advanced for people who already know</span> <span data-start="198.53" data-end="200.09">backbone this is advanced for people</span> <span data-start="200.09" data-end="202.64">just learning JavaScript the following</span> <span data-start="202.64" data-end="205.3">talk is going to be very fast</span> <span data-start="205.3" data-end="207.8">introduction to a framework but it will</span> <span data-start="207.8" data-end="209.39">not have much pertinent information to</span> <span data-start="209.39" data-end="210.83">you who are already writing the backbone</span> <span data-start="210.83" data-end="212.59">no makes sense</span> <span data-start="212.59" data-end="215.66">okay so to get things kicked off can I</span> <span data-start="215.66" data-end="217.88">get a show of hands of people who are in</span> <span data-start="217.88" data-end="220.31">the room because of the fundamental</span> <span data-start="220.31" data-end="221.38">curriculum and that</span> <span data-start="221.38" data-end="222.7">they plan to keep working on through the</span> <span data-start="222.7" data-end="229.27">top a little bit and can I get a so</span> <span data-start="229.27" data-end="230.35">handsome people who are in the room</span> <span data-start="230.35" data-end="232.06">because they want to hear the short</span> <span data-start="232.06" data-end="236.38">version of how to write backbone okay so</span> <span data-start="236.38" data-end="237.34">with that in mind I'm gonna start</span> <span data-start="237.34" data-end="238.75">calling people up some people are random</span> <span data-start="238.75" data-end="240.85">if I accidentally mistake you as being</span> <span

data-end="248.44">downside so what I want to know is where</span> <span data-start="248.44" data-end="249.61">you're starting what you're doing the</span> <span data-start="249.61" data-end="250.9">backbone so that I can make sure that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="250.9" data-end="253.3">I'm speaking to your actual experience</span> <span data-start="253.3" data-end="254.65">at your use case can I get a sense of</span> <span data-start="254.65" data-end="257.44">what what you do with back though or</span> <span data-start="257.44" data-end="259.12">don't do with backbone or wire quite</span> <span data-start="259.12" data-end="270.71">just comes assess it no experience in</span> <span data-start="270.72" data-end="273.34">perfect okay that's uh that's very</span> <span data-start="273.34" data-end="276.78">helpful no experience in backbone</span> <span data-start="276.78" data-end="292.46">moderate experience of JavaScript</span> <span data-start="292.47" data-end="295.12">experience back encounter knows</span> </p>

as a calibration mechanism for me</span> <span data-start="305.8" data-end="307.87">when you say you know JavaScript well</span> <span data-start="307.87" data-end="310.03">what does the object that

where's your backbone</span> <span data-start="340.57" data-end="345.96">situation I do</span> <span data-start="345.97" data-end="348.45">to get a more broad picture</span> <span data-start="348.45"

<span data-start="370.139" data-end="371.46">we're about what we have planned is</span> <span data-start="371.46" data-end="373.62">pretty well targeted at what it seems as</span> <span

data-end="402.71">the significance of these words is</span> <span data-start="402.71" data-end="406.02">pretty desperately documented you don't</span> <span data-start="406.02" data-end="410.52">find in my experience a central you know</span> <span data-start="410.52" data-end="413.419">list of what it is you need to have</span> <span data-start="413.419" data-end="416.039">heard of and how you
