data-start="178.41" data-end="181.14">keep helps to keep your code modular and</span> <span data-start="181.14" data-end="183.56">more modular code basically means</span> <span data-start="183.56" data-end="185.91">whenever need you need to add something</span> <span data-start="185.91" data-end="187.98">or you need to change something you can</span> <span data-start="187.98"

simple rule keep dividing</span> <span data-start="213.18" data-end="214.769">and refactoring your files as and when</span> <span data-start="214.769" data-end="216.84">they get too big so you just need to</span> <span data-start="216.84" data-end="218.76">stop at points in your development and</span> <span data-start="218.76" data-end="221.82">see what could be separated out into</span> <span data-start="221.82" data-end="223.86">separate modules and just keep on doing</span> <span data-start="223.86" data-end="226.65">it periodically so let's take a simple</span> <span data-start="226.65"

basically</span> <span data-start="1718.98" data-end="1721.72">border-collapse:collapse so if you do</span> <span data-start="1721.72" data-end="1724.29">rat it basically will disappear the</span>

data-start="1778.3" data-end="1783.25">required so another thing which I forgot</span> <span data-start="1783.25" data-end="1784.93">to mention is if 50% of the audience</span> <span data-start="1784.93" data-end="1787.06">submits the correct solution this level</span> <span data-start="1787.06" data-end="1789.79">would get cleared and out of 1:03 we</span> <span data-start="1789.79" data-end="1793.51">just 17 correct solutions you want CSS</span> <span data-start="1793.51" data-end="1801.07">lovers I don't think we are going to</span> <span data-start="1801.07" data-end="1805.63">reach 50% correct solution okay solution</span> <span data-start="1805.63" data-end="1807.58">for this is obvious or people are</span> <span data-start="1807.58" data-end="1808.9">sending display:block</span> <span data-start="1808.9" data-end="1814.06">so assuming 50% audience was not doing</span> <span data-start="1814.06" data-end="1825">funny stuff Oh</span> <span data-start="1825.01" data-end="1827.42">so we would have a block which would</span> <span data-start="1827.42" data-end="1829.28">actually kill the enemy and level clear</span> <span data-start="1829.28" data-end="1831.95">so this is an interesting one last level</span> <span data-start="1831.95" data-end="1835.28">from my side they will do so the player</span> <span data-start="1835.28" data-end="1837.89">is on a platform and he needs to capture</span> <span data-start="1837.89" data-end="1839.75">the flag but the issue is the platforms</span> <span data-start="1839.75" data-end="1842.39">on order and save seem level so I'm not</span> <span data-start="1842.39" data-end="1845.14">able to get the flag so how do you get</span> <span data-start="1845.14" data-end="1847.46">something which has broken on the next</span> <span data-start="1847.46" data-end="1849.62">line to actually get on the same level</span> <span data-start="1849.62" data-end="1858.24">as the previous element come on</span> <span data-start="1858.25" data-end="1865.24">not a single right solution okay so the</span> <span data-start="1865.24" data-end="1867.789">solution is basically white-space:nowrap</span> <span data-start="1867.789" data-end="1884.34">so that's it hi</span> <span data-start="1884.34" data-end="1887.289">pretty much the beginning of your talk</span> <span data-start="1887.289" data-end="1890.019">you talked about keeping your files</span> <span data-start="1890.019" data-end="1893.5">modular and small right</span> <span data-start="1893.5" data-end="1896.769">but you mentioned CSS and then you</span> <span data-start="1896.769" data-end="1898.929">mentioned if you're using sass you</span> <span data-start="1898.929" data-end="1900.669">should use the mid sense file for sense</span> <span data-start="1900.669" data-end="1903.309">like don't you think that reason sass</span> <span data-start="1903.309" data-end="1906.309">you should keep small files but then</span> <span data-start="1906.309" data-end="1910.6">concatenate them into one CSS file when</span> <span data-start="1910.6" data-end="1913.33">you deploy so production is not really</span> <span data-start="1913.33" data-end="1915.759">of a concern here it's a good practice</span> <span data-start="1915.759" data-end="1917.889">even to get your audio styles in to</span> <span data-start="1917.889" data-end="1921.61">single CSS so you don't have I mean</span> <span data-start="1921.61" data-end="1923.95">multiple HTTP request being sent from</span> <span data-start="1923.95" data-end="1925.45">the browser so that is something which</span> <span data-start="1925.45" data-end="1928.029">is fine the concern here is actually the</span> <span data-start="1928.029" data-end="1930.399">indie development process so you know</span> <span data-start="1930.399" data-end="1932.59">why you need modularity is because you</span> <span data-start="1932.59" data-end="1934.629">need to append things and change things</span> <span data-start="1934.629" data-end="1937.419">over time right so spreading of files is</span> <span data-start="1937.419" data-end="1939.159">necessary in develop and not in</span> <span data-start="1939.159" data-end="1943.12">production I guess another small</span> <span data-start="1943.12" data-end="1948.519">question you show that you're separating</span> <span data-start="1948.519" data-end="1952.179">it to files according to kind of the</span> <span data-start="1952.179" data-end="1954.789">style of the components dropdowns and</span> <span data-start="1954.789" data-end="1956.529">stuff like that right don't you think</span> <span data-start="1956.529" data-end="1959.529">maybe also it would be good to separate</span> <span data-start="1959.529" data-end="1963.129">it to the pages that you're using or the</span> <span data-start="1963.129" data-end="1966.429">templates that are associated with most</span> <span data-start="1966.429" data-end="1967.99">of these styles because a lot of times</span> <span data-start="1967.99" data-end="1970.45">styles are associated more with the page</span> <span data-start="1970.45" data-end="1973.059">they appear on and not with a specific</span> <span data-start="1973.059" data-end="1977.47">component right so so writing styles</span> <span data-start="1977.47" data-end="1979.299">pertaining to specific pages is</span> <span data-start="1979.299" data-end="1981.85">something we all have been doing for a</span> <span data-start="1981.85" data-end="1985.679">long time now but the issue with that is</span> <span data-start="1985.679" data-end="1988.149">it leads to basically a lot of</span> <span data-start="1988.149" data-end="1991.36">repetitive code and code gets repeated</span> <span data-start="1991.36" data-end="1992.11">on</span> <span data-start="1992.11" data-end="1995.32">friend pages and even though certain</span> <span data-start="1995.32" data-end="1997.69">things are same on all the pages you</span> <span data-start="1997.69" data-end="1999.91">still have repeated code so the solution</span> <span data-start="1999.91" data-end="2001.44">for this which many people have started</span> <span data-start="2001.44" data-end="2004.2">using is to have a different outlook</span> <span data-start="2004.2" data-end="2006.78">over this so instead of styling things</span> <span data-start="2006.78" data-end="2008.82">on specific pages again and again you</span> <span data-start="2008.82" data-end="2012.54">basically what you do is look out for</span> <span data-start="2012.54" data-end="2014.22">things which are common in all the pages</span> <span data-start="2014.22" data-end="2016.559">and separate down them as components so</span> <span data-start="2016.559" data-end="2018.24">that is reason number one I have I</span> <span data-start="2018.24" data-end="2020.22">haven't included those page Styles in</span> <span data-start="2020.22" data-end="2025.53">the sample solution eyes just showed so</span> <span data-start="2025.53" data-end="2027.69">you basically should have components in</span> <span data-start="2027.69" data-end="2030.03">your averages and styling pages but even</span> <span data-start="2030.03" data-end="2031.919">if you have those specific page styling</span> <span data-start="2031.919" data-end="2034.26">things even if it's a requirement you</span> <span
