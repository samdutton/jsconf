data-end="776.86">all so let's go back to our house and in</span> <span data-start="776.86" data-end="780.1">this scenario we're we're gonna look at</span> <span data-start="780.1" data-end="782.02">a way to do this so it's a little bit of</span> <span data-start="782.02" data-end="783.73">a stretching so we would probably not do</span> <span data-start="783.73" data-end="785.5">this with houses in real life but just</span> <span data-start="785.5" data-end="787.87">bear with me so in this scenario we're</span> <span data-start="787.87" data-end="790.24">looking at where we'd actually just like</span> <span data-start="790.24" data-end="793.24">hide the key next to the house some</span> <span data-start="793.24" data-end="795.33">people would do that for convenience</span> <span data-start="795.33" data-end="797.05">maybe it would be under</span> <span data-start="797.05" data-end="799.029">the flowerpot on the veranda or like a</span> <span data-start="799.029" data-end="800.83">secret spot under the stairs something</span> <span data-start="800.83" data-end="803.11">like that it's convenient but it's not</span> <span data-start="803.11" data-end="804.79">really recommended because anybody could</span> <span data-start="804.79" data-end="807.36">get in your house if they found the key</span> <span data-start="807.36" data-end="810.94">so therefore you decide to get one of</span> <span data-start="810.94" data-end="813.37">those key boxes that are more popular</span> <span data-start="813.37" data-end="815.38">now especially with Airbnb where you pop</span> <span data-start="815.38" data-end="817.48">your key into key box and then you set a</span> <span data-start="817.48" data-end="820.269">code on the keyed box and in this way</span> <span data-start="820.269" data-end="822.43">you can access only you can access the</span> <span data-start="822.43" data-end="824.68">key with something you remember not</span> <span data-start="824.68" data-end="834.04">something that's stored anywhere so for</span> <span data-start="834.04" data-end="838.029">to do this we can implement we can do</span> <span data-start="838.029" data-end="841.209">this in our code as well we can import</span> <span data-start="841.209" data-end="848.2">key by from a password and with this</span> <span data-start="848.2" data-end="850.3">function called import key and we want</span> <span data-start="850.3" data-end="851.5">to use the password-based key derivation</span> <span data-start="851.5" data-end="855.19">function to we ask the user for their</span> <span data-start="855.19" data-end="856.69">password and then we transform the</span> <span data-start="856.69" data-end="859.24">password in turkey by using this</span> <span data-start="859.24" data-end="861.04">function and then again we have to</span> <span data-start="861.04" data-end="865.66">encode our strings and using that</span> <span data-start="865.66" data-end="870.43">password key we can derive a key and as</span> <span data-start="870.43" data-end="871.93">the name implies it's really good at</span> <span data-start="871.93" data-end="874.51">making keys from passwords but since</span> <span data-start="874.51" data-end="876.91">user selected passwords are often easier</span> <span data-start="876.91" data-end="879.49">to guess than something we generated</span> <span data-start="879.49" data-end="884.709">randomly we also need a truly random key</span> <span data-start="884.709" data-end="888.93">and we add that and we call it the salt</span> <span data-start="888.93" data-end="891.79">so this function derived key is</span> <span data-start="891.79" data-end="894.25">determined amidst deterministic meaning</span> <span data-start="894.25" data-end="895.839">that as long as he prided with the same</span> <span data-start="895.839" data-end="898.779">salt on the same password the output</span> <span data-start="898.779" data-end="901.57">will be the same so we can generate it</span> <span data-start="901.57" data-end="903.61">again and/or derive it again and again</span> <span data-start="903.61" data-end="907.3">and in our case so far we would have to</span> <span data-start="907.3" data-end="910">save that salt together with our cipher</span> <span data-start="910" data-end="912.55">text so it doesn't provide the password</span> <span data-start="912.55" data-end="914.74">provides us with some extra security but</span> <span data-start="914.74" data-end="916.81">the salt is not giving us much extra</span> <span data-start="916.81" data-end="919.12">right now but later on we will see how</span> <span data-start="919.12" data-end="923.35">the salt can shine so let's go back to</span> <span data-start="923.35" data-end="925.899">our house there we only had a key luck</span> <span data-start="925.899" data-end="927.82">with the passcode on it</span> <span data-start="927.82" data-end="930.47">so we need to get one of those</span> <span data-start="930.47" data-end="933.86">that has a code and a regular luck I</span> <span data-start="933.86" data-end="936.2">don't think those exist yet that's what</span> <span data-start="936.2" data-end="938.48">we're getting and then we take that salt</span> <span data-start="938.48" data-end="941.33">or that key for the regular lock and we</span> <span data-start="941.33" data-end="943.55">put that one under the flowerpot so to</span> <span data-start="943.55" data-end="945.529">get in we need to find the key that</span> <span data-start="945.529" data-end="947.6">we've hidden very secretly under the</span> <span data-start="947.6" data-end="949.76">flowerpot and we need to remember our</span> <span data-start="949.76" data-end="951.83">code then we can get our house key and</span> <span data-start="951.83" data-end="961.93">we can get into our house so that um</span> <span data-start="961.93" data-end="964.73">yeah so that was this is our basic</span> <span data-start="964.73" data-end="968.779">encryption and as you can see the</span> <span data-start="968.779" data-end="971.149">encryption stays the same but we're now</span> <span data-start="971.149" data-end="973.7">deriving the key instead of generating</span> <span data-start="973.7" data-end="978.44">the key so let's move over to cloud</span> <span data-start="978.44" data-end="981.08">storage

data-end="1231.4">hard for me to understand in the</span> <span data-start="1231.4" data-end="1233.2">beginning because they're usually taught</span> <span data-start="1233.2" data-end="1235.96">and

we'll put it into</span> <span data-start="1339.76" data-end="1342.97">that key box again that has a code and</span> <span data-start="1342.97" data-end="1345.1">then it has to lock and then you

<span data-start="1353.97" data-end="1356.769">this algorithm I won't go much further</span> <span data-start="1356.769" data-end="1360.37">into that they will look at the flow so</span> <span data-start="1360.37" data-end="1362.47">for sharing data you'll take your plain</span> <span data-start="1362.47" data-end="1367.659">text and you'll let's see no there's</span> <span data-start="1367.659" data-end="1372.159">something wrong yeah no yes sir</span> <span data-start="1372.159" data-end="1376.99">ah you'll take you'll first generate a</span> <span data-start="1376.99" data-end="1378.639">key like we did all the way in the</span> <span data-start="1378.639" data-end="1380.2">beginning and you'll encrypt the data</span> <span data-start="1380.2" data-end="1382.539">with that and you get your ciphertext</span> <span data-start="1382.539" data-end="1385.57">but then you take your generated key and</span> <span data-start="1385.57" data-end="1387.58">you encrypt that with the other person's</span> <span data-start="1387.58" data-end="1390.1">public key and you get an encrypted</span> <span data-start="1390.1" data-end="1392.74">generated key and you can share both of</span> <span data-start="1392.74" data-end="1397.69">those and put it in the cloud and then</span> <span data-start="1397.69" data-end="1401.409">to decrypt the other person will take</span> <span data-start="1401.409" data-end="1403.59">their private key decrypt encrypted</span> <span data-start="1403.59" data-end="1406.779">generated key get the generated key and</span> <span data-start="1406.779" data-end="1410.429">then decrypt the ciphertext to plaintext</span> <span data-start="1410.429" data-end="1413.2">so as you can see with all these keys we</span> <span data-start="1413.2" data-end="1415.059">got a really stay sharp</span> <span data-start="1415.059" data-end="1420.309">to not mess it up but where you know</span> <span data-start="1420.309" data-end="1422.08">that private key can't just be laying</span> <span data-start="1422.08" data-end="1425.38">around so this is what we do with our</span> <span data-start="1425.38" data-end="1429.13">private keys we encrypted with the</span> <span data-start="1429.13" data-end="1431.799">derived key and then we can decrypt it</span> <span data-start="1431.799" data-end="1433.57">again so if you then look at the whole</span> <span data-start="1433.57" data-end="1436.63">flow if I want to decrypt something</span> <span data-start="1436.63" data-end="1439.84">shared with me I first have to get my</span> <span data-start="1439.84" data-end="1442.69">derived key decrypt my encrypted private</span> <span data-start="1442.69" data-end="1444.909">key then I use my private creek to</span> <span data-start="1444.909" data-end="1447.37">decrypt my encrypted generated key I get</span> <span data-start="1447.37" data-end="1449.2">my generated key and I can finally</span> <span data-start="1449.2" data-end="1451.899">decrypt my text and I get my plaintext</span> <span data-start="1451.899" data-end="1454.48">back and this is actually what we</span> <span data-start="1454.48" data-end="1456.94">usually do also with things we only want</span> <span data-start="1456.94" data-end="1459.61">to share with ourselves we do the same</span> <span data-start="1459.61" data-end="1462.22">flow so that it will be the equal</span> <span data-start="1462.22" data-end="1464.59">process so then you just use your</span> <span data-start="1464.59" data-end="1467.2">public-key when encrypted and then you</span> <span data-start="1467.2" data-end="1469.44">do this whole song and dance to get your</span> <span data-start="1469.44" data-end="1476.74">content back so intent ocation I kind of</span> <span data-start="1476.74" data-end="1478.72">just skipped the whole authentication</span> <span data-start="1478.72" data-end="1480.309">part as you might have noticed we just</span> <span data-start="1480.309" data-end="1482.289">put things on the cloud and without</span> <span data-start="1482.289" data-end="1485.11">knowing who anyone was and the reason</span> <span data-start="1485.11" data-end="1486.669">for that that it it becomes more</span> <span data-start="1486.669" data-end="1488.97">problematic than in a normal web app</span> <span data-start="1488.97" data-end="1492.01">since we use our password to generate</span> <span data-start="1492.01" data-end="1494.08">keys we don't really the password</span> <span data-start="1494.08" data-end="1496.45">becomes much more sensitive than in a</span> <span data-start="1496.45"
