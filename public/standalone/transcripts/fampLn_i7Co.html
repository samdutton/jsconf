year Facebook decided that they</span> <span data-start="335.75" data-end="338.84">were going to go on a diet they realized</span> <span data-start="338.84" data-end="341.27">that their site speed was

<span data-start="346.16" data-end="350">sort of one part of of that puzzle and</span> <span data-start="350" data-end="351.919">they hired me to come in and look at</span> <span data-start="351.919" data-end="355.55">their CSS at that point just before i</span> <span data-start="355.55" data-end="357.229">started i went to velocity conference</span> <span data-start="357.229" data-end="358.76">and i heard two of their engineers david</span> <span data-start="358.76" data-end="361.25">and chang hao talk about their haste</span> <span data-start="361.25" data-end="364.43">based packaging system it is a really</span> <span data-start="364.43" data-end="367.43">neat idea basically they parse their</span> <span data-start="367.43" data-end="369.47">logs and they figure out which files are</span> <span data-start="369.47" data-end="371.33">requested together most frequently and</span> <span data-start="371.33" data-end="372.949">they build those into

data-end="405.17">wrong thing and so everybody did the</span> <span data-start="405.17" data-end="408.53">wrong thing this was what I sort of</span> <span data-start="408.53" data-end="410.42">started out with when you know when I</span> <span data-start="410.42" data-end="412.76">went to consult with them now their</span> <span data-start="412.76" data-end="415.46">performance group had a lot of different</span> <span data-start="415.46" data-end="417.08">angles they were working at they were</span> <span data-start="417.08" data-end="420.29">working on big pipe and X HP and a bunch</span>

data-end="434.98">lots of different pieces coming together</span> <span data-start="434.98" data-end="437.48">the end result was that they reduce</span> <span data-start="437.48" data-end="439.31">their response time in half in only six</span> <span data-start="439.31" data-end="441.89">months that's a pretty important gain</span> <span data-start="441.89"

data-end="1775.99">we know where the boundary of our object</span> <span data-start="1775.99" data-end="1779.11">stops because I could say you know media</span> <span data-start="1779.11"

data-end="1831.19">oh good the code for this is perfect we</span> <span data-start="1831.19" data-end="1832.84">say well but we need a blue one so we</span> <span data-start="1832.84" data-end="1835.12">copy paste the entire CSS over and then</span> <span data-start="1835.12" data-end="1836.44">we change the white background color to</span> <span data-start="1836.44"

data-end="1846.16">apply that sort of like a mix in to the</span> <span data-start="1846.16" data-end="1851.5">base object it's really simple if we</span> <span data-start="1851.5" data-end="1852.85">look at the code of the media object is</span> <span data-start="1852.85" data-end="1854.83">just a few lines of code it's a div</span> <span data-start="1854.83" data-end="1857.77">basically a rapper element with an A in</span> <span data-start="1857.77" data-end="1859.96">it a link and then image inside of that</span> <span data-start="1859.96" data-end="1862.21">and then we have a body area which is</span> <span data-start="1862.21" data-end="1864.64">where our content of our media object</span> <span data-start="1864.64" data-end="1870.55">will be the CSS is also really simple we</span> <span data-start="1870.55" data-end="1872.62">basically have a new formatting context</span> <span data-start="1872.62"

like your site is you will</span> <span data-start="1881.29" data-end="1882.55">want to use a different one than this</span> <span data-start="1882.55" data-end="1884.08">but this works well for just sort of</span> <span data-start="1884.08" data-end="1887.5">plain websites and then it's pretty</span> <span data-start="1887.5" data-end="1889.78">simple a few floats and of some margins</span> <span
