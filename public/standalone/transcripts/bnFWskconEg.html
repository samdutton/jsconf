there so here's a very simple example</span> <span data-start="325.81" data-end="329.29">of a Cylon program so the first thing we</span> <span data-start="329.29" data-end="332.95">do is we say var

Cylon</span> <span data-start="336.97" data-end="340.69">module then we declare our robot Cylon</span> <span data-start="340.69" data-end="343.75">has a declarative syntax as opposed to</span> <span data-start="343.75" data-end="346.21">an imperative one so you define the</span> <span data-start="346.21" data-end="347.95">things that you're going to use and then</span> <span data-start="347.95" data-end="350.8">they just work so we say our salon robot</span> <span data-start="350.8" data-end="354.76">has a connection to an arduino using the</span> <span data-start="354.76" data-end="358.96">fermata adapter on pork dev TTYL ACM 0</span> <span data-start="358.96" data-end="360.61">which if you're using Linux is your</span> <span data-start="360.61" data-end="363.07">default serial port so we have a single</span> <span data-start="363.07" data-end="365.43">connection then we have a single device</span> <span data-start="365.43" data-end="369.88">which is this led which is using the LED</span> <span data-start="369.88" data-end="373.36">driver on pin 13 and then the work that</span> <span data-start="373.36" data-end="375.19">we're going to do the work that we're</span> <span data-start="375.19" data-end="378.01">going to do is every one second we're</span> <span data-start="378.01" data-end="380.41">going to my dot LED table which will</span> <span data-start="380.41" data-end="382.87">cause the led to flash on and off and</span> <span data-start="382.87" data-end="385.33">then last we tell the robot to start up</span> <span data-start="385.33" data-end="387.46">so we see here the three important</span> <span data-start="387.46" data-end="390.13">conceptual ideas behind

software</span> <span data-start="394.48" data-end="396.49">design pattern similar to the way that</span> <span data-start="396.49" data-end="399.19">object relational map to use different</span> <span data-start="399.19" data-end="401.08">kinds of database back-end engines</span> <span data-start="401.08" data-end="402.56">without changing your</span> <span data-start="402.56" data-end="404.87">ode Cylon jess allows you to use</span> <span data-start="404.87" data-end="407.27">hardware devices different hardware</span> <span data-start="407.27" data-end="409.52">devices but using the same code by</span> <span data-start="409.52" data-end="412.03">changing the adapter and then the driver</span> <span data-start="412.03" data-end="414.35">we're using the double adapter pattern</span> <span data-start="414.35" data-end="416.63">so we have adapters for our connections</span> <span data-start="416.63" data-end="417.95">and then we have separate ones for</span> <span data-start="417.95" data-end="419.84">drivers so the code for an LED is</span> <span data-start="419.84" data-end="421.22">exactly the same whether you're running</span> <span data-start="421.22" data-end="422.66">it on the BeagleBone black or a</span> <span data-start="422.66" data-end="426.77">raspberry pi or an arduino so here's our</span> <span data-start="426.77" data-end="432.29">some video and so we have here the</span> <span data-start="432.29" data-end="434.75">arduino and it's plugged in to the</span> <span data-start="434.75" data-end="437.29">largest LED that we could find</span> <span data-start="437.29" data-end="442.43">conveniently and so what an adrian runs</span> <span data-start="442.43" data-end="445.25">the code here it's going to be</span> <span data-start="445.25" data-end="447.02">communicating using the serial interface</span> <span data-start="447.02" data-end="449.96">and yes it is blinking gratuitous</span> <span data-start="449.96" data-end="454.729">applause applause for a two thousand</span> <span data-start="454.729" data-end="458.36">five hundred dollar lamp so it's using</span> <span data-start="458.36" data-end="460.82">the fermata protocol which is running on</span> <span data-start="460.82" data-end="462.59">the microcontroller itself this is the</span> <span data-start="462.59" data-end="464.54">same way that Johnny Five and a lot of</span> <span data-start="464.54" data-end="467.39">other similar robotics tools work it's</span> <span data-start="467.39"
