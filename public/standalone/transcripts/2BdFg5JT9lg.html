<p><span data-start="21.82" data-end="27.779">Ok, third time zones, developers and time zones are clearly a love/hate relationship,</span> <span data-start="27.779" data-end="31.95">I can tell this from looking in my Twitter stream where I see all sorts of developers</span> <span data-start="31.95" data-end="41.37">complaining about time zones. Why are they such a problem? We'll start with a simple</span> <span data-start="41.37" data-end="49.93">problem you will encounter: how soon is now, you have a time and date you want to display</span> <span data-start="49.93" data-end="56.94">in your interface or you want to get users to write it for you, but when is that time,</span> <span data-start="56.94" data-end="60.73">because 10 o'clock for you is not 10 o'clock for someone else.</span> <span data-start="60.73" data-end="69.89">The simplest solution is avoid the problem and never show dates and times in your interface,</span> <span data-start="69.89" data-end="76.57">not really practical. What's an actual solution, you could decide, you know what ever time</span> <span data-start="76.57" data-end="82.149">the server thinks it is, that's what I'm going to output, the users have to do the mechanical</span> <span data-start="82.149" data-end="86.75">computation, that's not a solution that's starting a problem again.</span> <span data-start="86.75" data-end="94.39">Let's look into the history of time zones. Basically, there was a concept that worked</span> <span data-start="94.39" data-end="100.13">really well up to the mid-19th century which was mean solar time, when the sun is directly</span> <span data-start="100.13" data-end="106.79">overhead, that's noon. Every town and village used that system, until the railway and telegraph</span> <span data-start="106.79" data-end="110.229">connected them and they realised everyone was using a difference version of the time</span> <span data-start="110.229" data-end="115.479">because the sun was in a difference spot. A proposal was done to standardise the time</span> <span data-start="115.479" data-end="128.2">and divide the world in 24 bands, one hour per band, neat, precise and mathematical,</span> <span data-start="128.2" data-end="142.65">it remained perfect until it reality at which time borders came into fly, some work was</span> <span data-start="142.65" data-end="147.75">done to calculate the differences between what the time zones in the world are in what</span> <span data-start="147.75" data-end="157.829">mean solar time says they should be in, Beijing runs on Beijing time, the furthest west parts</span> <span data-start="157.829" data-end="163.859">of China are three hours out from where the sun says they should be. You don't want to</span> <span data-start="163.859" data-end="167.28">have to deal with this calculation yourself, you don't want to have to try and work out</span> <span data-start="167.28" data-end="172.109">where they are, so you give your users a preference, you let them choose what time zone they're</span> <span data-start="172.109" data-end="179.949">in, then you have a whole range of other problems. Every time zone picker that I've seen on the</span> <span data-start="179.949" data-end="189.75">web, is a trade-off between the comprehensiveness of the data and the ease of use. Most users</span> <span data-start="189.75" data-end="196.98">don't actually know what their time zone is and they hate putting it in, like this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="196.98" data-end="201.91">Also just seeing a gigantic list is really annoying. At this point you need to ask yourself,</span> <span data-start="201.91" data-end="207.72">do you really need a time zone, a defined time zone or to you just need the concept</span> <span data-start="207.72" data-end="213.59">of local time. Really what you are trying to do, you are just taking one date and time</span> <span data-start="213.59" data-end="219.38">and display it in a different date and time depending on where your user is. The third</span> <span data-start="219.38" data-end="226.59">solution is you just deal with UTC. Standard reference point for time.</span> <span data-start="226.59" data-end="234.07">You store it in UTC on the server, you output it in UTC to the browser and you use JavaScript</span> <span data-start="234.07" data-end="238.63">to just convert to it the local time on the fly as the very last step, this is by far</span> <span data-start="238.63" data-end="244.44">the best solution for the majority of use cases, it's used by a lot of websites today,</span> <span data-start="244.44" data-end="252.459">what's is UTC, it's co-ordinated universal time it's the successor for Greenwich meantime</span> <span data-start="252.459" data-end="261.65">it kind of stands not for much as a acronym itself, when it was being created the organisers</span> <span data-start="261.65" data-end="267.5">wanted to have the same acronym for every country in the world, of course the English</span> <span data-start="267.5" data-end="273.68">and French can never agree on word order, an acronym was picked that was wrong for everyone,</span> <span data-start="273.68" data-end="276.13">putting everyone on an equal footing \{Laughter\}.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="276.13" data-end="282.87">That's great when you can get away with it, sometimes you do sometimes need to store a</span> <span data-start="282.87" data-end="288.38">user preference for time zones. If you want to send scheduled notifications scheduled</span> <span data-start="288.38" data-end="293.35">notifications at the same time everyday, in your users local time regardless of day light</span> <span data-start="293.35" data-end="300">saving time over a course of the year.</span> <span data-start="300" data-end="305.4">So what's a better way of get the users time zone you can try and detect it in the browser,</span> <span data-start="305.4" data-end="316.28">it has to problems, it seems simplest enough in theory, you create the date, you call the</span> <span data-start="316.28" data-end="325.87">one thing available, it returns minutes from UTC, then you just map the offset to a time</span> <span data-start="325.87" data-end="330.52">zone and find out that everything is broken.</span> <span data-start="330.52" data-end="335.65">So to understand why it's broken we have to take another look at another history lesson.</span> <span data-start="335.65" data-end="340.07">So five years ago Patrick McKenzie wrote a very famous blog posed, called false hoods</span> <span data-start="340.07" data-end="347.21">people believe about names, it was based on how many pieces of software he'd broken with</span> <span data-start="347.21" data-end="358.88">various names. Two years later, false hoods programmers believe about time, this contained</span> <span data-start="358.88" data-end="364.87">34 false hoods, hours, minutes seconds, about all the different ways that programmes can</span> <span data-start="364.87" data-end="372.02">stuff up when they are trying to deal with time, this got spread around and he was in</span> <span data-start="372.02" data-end="386.43">undated with things he'd mist so-had to post the follow-up, with all the ones he'd missed,</span> <span data-start="386.43" data-end="397.44">- I'll pull out two of my festival writs, â€” I can easily maintain a time list, time</span> <span data-start="397.44" data-end="403.11">myself, also false. So why are these false, if you want domain ten your own time zone</span> <span data-start="403.11" data-end="409.41">list, these there are problems you are going to have to deal with, day light saving time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="409.41" data-end="413.5">Not all the countries in the world do day light saving time, some do, some don't, for</span> <span data-start="413.5" data-end="420.74">the ones that do, not all parts of the countries use day light saving time. Day light saving</span> <span data-start="420.74" data-end="424.639">time, one knows that just jumps forward an hour and jumps back an hour, except for Lord</span> <span data-start="424.639" data-end="431.84">How island which only does half an hour, why? I've no idea, you have to account for it any</span> <span data-start="431.84" data-end="438.68">way. When do places go in and out of day light saving time? This was my attempt to visualise</span> <span data-start="438.68" data-end="443.48">the different times of the year when different regions do it, I couldn't fit it all on one</span> <span data-start="443.48" data-end="450.71">screen, also another little oddity there, Morocco and Egypt, when Egypt chooses to do</span> <span data-start="450.71" data-end="457.33">so, go into day light saving time, come out for one month during Ramadan, so that fasting</span> <span data-start="457.33" data-end="463.45">is easier during day light hours, then back into day light saving time and out again,</span> <span data-start="463.45" data-end="469.7">so four clock changes in one year, because Ramadan is based on the siting of the moon</span> <span data-start="469.7" data-end="476.139">you can't actually know the precise date that that's going to happen \{Laughter\}.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="476.139" data-end="485.91">All right, you have got the rules of daylight saving time you have finally figured that</span> <span data-start="485.91" data-end="493.27">all out, then they all go and change. So the base offset, so how far ahead or behind UTC</span> <span data-start="493.27" data-end="500.48">a certain region is. Just this year alone there have been five changes. These range</span> <span data-start="500.48" data-end="506.699">from whole countries to just small states. Deciding to start or stop doing daylight saving</span> <span data-start="506.699" data-end="510.46">time this happens a lot.</span> <span data-start="510.46" data-end="516.74">Deciding to change when daylight saving time starts and stops, this also changes a lot.</span> <span data-start="516.74" data-end="525.01">Then, the not very common case, but still quite interesting of the country of Samoa,</span> <span data-start="525.01" data-end="532.1">where the date of December 302011, they went from one side of the international date line</span> <span data-start="532.1" data-end="539.63">and at midnight they crossed over and went straight to December 31. This did make sense</span> <span data-start="539.63" data-end="543.7">in order to trade better with Australia and New Zealand, but their nearest</span> <span data-start="543.7" data-end="551.32">neighbours of American Samoa, kept trading, they are now separated by 70 kilometres and</span> <span data-start="551.32" data-end="561.71">24 hours it's the same time of day in both places, just a different day.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="561.71" data-end="567.029">The big problem is politics, which is really the cause of all the other problems we have</span> <span data-start="567.029" data-end="571.11">already seen, governments change, when they change they often change their minds from</span> <span data-start="571.11" data-end="577.69">the previous government, that's when they recognise that a zone exists, there is a group</span> <span data-start="577.69" data-end="591.62">of towns in Australia, halfway between Adelaide and Perth, that choose a time zone â€” 
your software has to account for it. One off</span> <span data-start="591.62" data-end="597.94">changes such as the Sydney Olympics, making daylight saving time start a month early,</span> <span data-start="597.94" data-end="603.63">this year Turkey will extend daylight saving time by a month because of local elections,</span> <span data-start="603.63" data-end="608.94">when you are lucky the governments will announce these changes with enough notice to update</span> <span data-start="608.94" data-end="613.69">the software, in reality, update all the software, in reality all the changes will happen within</span> <span data-start="613.69" data-end="621.24">a month, in extreme cases within a day, in some very rare cases they have actually announced</span> <span data-start="621.24" data-end="624.22">they have done it thereafter fact \{Laughter\}.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="624.22" data-end="630.48">How on earth do you even keep up with all of this, it's where the time zone database</span> <span data-start="630.48" data-end="641.33">comes in, it's managed by IANA, it's really just run by a group of really dedicated volunteers,</span> <span data-start="641.33" data-end="649.2">who try and keep track of all the government make it open sources and spread it out to</span> <span data-start="649.2" data-end="655.88">the software your computers run, if you want to use it in JavaScript, there are some libraries</span> <span data-start="655.88" data-end="663">that compile this data, but there are lmultiple releases of the database every year, everyone</span> <span data-start="663" data-end="668.44">of the libraries has to recompile the data every time there is a release, it means you</span> <span data-start="668.44" data-end="681.36">have to keep your libraries up-to-date,  the server is going to have a list of time
zones, your client will have a list of time</span> <span data-start="681.36" data-end="690.38">zones and they can get out of sync very easily.</span> <span data-start="690.38" data-end="695.81">Keeping up-to-date is important. So, I gave the first version of this talk at JSConf Australia</span> <span data-start="695.81" data-end="702.36">a year and a half ago, this is a list of changes in the time zone database since I gave this</span> <span data-start="702.36" data-end="704.82">talk last time â€” \{Laughter\}.</span> <span data-start="704.82" data-end="715.06">Now, the last four here have an unreleased date, mainly because they were announced after</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="715.06" data-end="719.3">I landed in Berlin for this conference and I haven't yet made the full release of the</span> <span data-start="719.3" data-end="723.18">database, it goes to show how often these things change.</span> <span data-start="723.18" data-end="731.39">When I first gave the talk I picked out one prime example of a politically motivated change</span> <span data-start="731.39" data-end="741.24">that was hard to predict ahead of time, Crimea switching from Ukraine to Moscow town, I can't</span> <span data-start="741.24" data-end="749.649">think of a more politically motivated example than North Korea switching away from Japan</span> <span data-start="749.649" data-end="753.22">and South Korea to establish its own time zone.</span> <span data-start="753.22" data-end="762.31">It's all very interesting, but should you care? Yes, your users will, I know this from</span> <span data-start="762.31" data-end="763.58">bitter, personal experience.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="763.58" data-end="770.3">If you want to so this is my tale of where I didn't do enough research into time zones</span> <span data-start="770.3" data-end="780.14">initially and I caused things to go very, very wrong. Not long after I started at Alasian,</span> <span data-start="780.14" data-end="783.91">JIRA the issue tracking software gained the ability to</span> <span data-start="783.91" data-end="790.77">store user preference four time zone. I wanted to spend some 20% time to ad in a little ad</span> <span data-start="790.77" data-end="797.64">on that would basically turn updating your time zone into a one click operation. Just</span> <span data-start="797.64" data-end="803.99">detect when the browser was out of sync with the user preference. This was fine.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="803.99" data-end="812.35">I was using one of the JS libraries before, JS time zone detect, what it does it groups</span> <span data-start="812.35" data-end="818.63">identical zones together so all of central Europe is detected as use Berlin because the</span> <span data-start="818.63" data-end="825.959">countries all use the exact same rules. For zones that have very similar rules but daylight</span> <span data-start="825.959" data-end="830.99">saving time starts at slightly different dates it has some fine grain logic to work out the</span> <span data-start="830.99" data-end="832">difference.</span> <span data-start="832" data-end="836.92">This is working fine I did some statistical analysis, usage of the feature was going up.</span> <span data-start="836.92" data-end="845.899">Then about a year later, something happened it seems innocuous but Israel started daylight</span> <span data-start="845.899" data-end="854.519">saving time a few days differently from what they were doing before. This combined with</span> <span data-start="854.519" data-end="861.33">the fine grain logic caused support requests where users in Israel started being detected</span> <span data-start="861.33" data-end="868.88">as being in Gaza. As one of our customers noted it was both incorrect and very offensive.</span> <span data-start="868.88" data-end="875.339">I don't know about you when I started in tech I didn't really have career goals, I just</span> <span data-start="875.339" data-end="880.019">thought I would see how it goes, but I am pretty sure that if I did have career goals</span> <span data-start="880.019" data-end="884.95">I would not have made one of them to increase political tension. In a longstanding conflict</span> <span data-start="884.95" data-end="891.709">in the middle east. \{laughter\} so obviously had to fix this, but how.</span> <span data-start="891.709" data-end="898.36">I couldn't just update the library, it had changed its API in the meantime. I also realised</span> <span data-start="898.36" data-end="902.58">this problem could come up with other countries in the future so I starter to rethink the</span> <span data-start="902.58" data-end="909.51">approach completely. Eventually, I realised that the best way to do it was to get the</span> <span data-start="909.51" data-end="915.13">list of definitions from the surfer which already had to have them anyway, filter the</span> <span data-start="915.13" data-end="927.76">list based on UTC offsets in the browser then GIF the user a choice to make the final selection.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="927.76" data-end="936.45">We have not had anymore support cases about hot topics since then, but I found out later</span> <span data-start="936.45" data-end="941.43">that I wasn't the only one to have made this mistake the known Linux software also has</span> <span data-start="941.43" data-end="947.44">a problem with people in Israel being detected as in Palestine, it just shows it very, very</span> <span data-start="947.44" data-end="951.74">easy to get something wrong.</span> <span data-start="951.74" data-end="958.14">That's just dealing with the time zone definitions themselves. So I found out later when I started</span> <span data-start="958.14" data-end="961.839">digging more into this that there are all sorts of other problems to do with time zones</span> <span data-start="961.839" data-end="967.329">when you are dealing with software, as the developers of Angular found out \{laughter\}</span> <span data-start="967.329" data-end="975.37">when the unit test suite would only run when running New Zealand or certain states of Australia.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="975.37" data-end="983.24">This was effectively a bug in the 5 specification about how to handle historical dates, whatever</span> <span data-start="983.24" data-end="989.73">the daylight saving time rules are now have always applied. Australia and New Zealand</span> <span data-start="989.73" data-end="997.48">started doing daylight saving time in 1971, and Angular was testing for dates in 1970.</span> <span data-start="997.48" data-end="1002.67">ECMAScript 5 assumes that those dates still had daylight saving time. This has been fixed</span> <span data-start="1002.67" data-end="1009.07">in ES6 but the damage was done and the browsers still had this problem.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1009.07" data-end="1014.92">Some people suggested I use geolocation, try to detect where the user is physically and</span> <span data-start="1014.92" data-end="1022.07">map that too time zone. I can understand why that's maybe not a good idea, we look back</span> <span data-start="1022.07" data-end="1032.079">20 years. So Microsoft in Windows 95, added a time zone selection map. After a border</span> <span data-start="1032.079" data-end="1033.529">dispute between Peru and</span> <span data-start="1033.529" data-end="1039.1">Ecuador they started to have to redraw the borders, the real kicker came when the Indian</span> <span data-start="1039.1" data-end="1045.25">Government threatened to boycott all Microsoft products until the border drawn against Pakistan</span> <span data-start="1045.25" data-end="1053.279">was changed in their map. Microsoft solved the problem by removing the feature completely.</span> <span data-start="1053.279" data-end="1057.929">To understand why this is such a problem, you just have to look at Google maps in 3</span> <span data-start="1057.929" data-end="1063.23">different countries. In this case Google maps Germany, India and China show the Kashmir</span> <span data-start="1063.23" data-end="1071.759">region with significantly redrawn borders depending on where you are viewing the map.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1071.759" data-end="1076.84">There are some people who have tried to solve this though, the geonames API, does take a</span> <span data-start="1076.84" data-end="1082.929">latitude and longitude and map it to a time zone identifier. I don't know what they do</span> <span data-start="1082.929" data-end="1088.32">about border disputes I will leave that up to them to decide, a lot of you will using</span> <span data-start="1088.32" data-end="1093.94">this API without knowing it it's better known as the backing service for Apple's time zone</span> <span data-start="1093.94" data-end="1101.73">selection. If you want to use it in the browser it's not at seam let's as it would be in Apple's</span> <span data-start="1101.73" data-end="1110.009">products, because every geolocation request prompts the user to allow it. Some other things</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1110.009" data-end="1117.549">I learned. You should never rely on the abbreviation of a time zone as being a unique identifier.</span> <span data-start="1117.549" data-end="1124.649">For example IST, which some people will just think is island standard time or island summer</span> <span data-start="1124.649" data-end="1131.309">time also applies to Israel and India.</span> <span data-start="1131.309" data-end="1139.369">The other thing is that IANA time zone identifier such as Europe/Berlin is shown in UIs everywhere,</span> <span data-start="1139.369" data-end="1144.46">I have made this mistake everywhere. What I realise the maintainers of the database</span> <span data-start="1144.46" data-end="1150.239">recommend you don't display them to the end user, they are not easily translatable they</span> <span data-start="1150.239" data-end="1155.859">don't necessarily represent a region. They recommend you use the long name of the time</span> <span data-start="1155.859" data-end="1161.649">zone such as Central European Time this is where the Unicode common locale data repository</span> <span data-start="1161.649" data-end="1167.139">comes in they maintain mappings between time zone identifier and translation in a whole</span> <span data-start="1167.139" data-end="1173.34">heap of different locals. If you want to use this in a browser there's the jQuery globalise,</span> <span data-start="1173.34" data-end="1184.1">it can handle the translations for you but as with everything there's now another trade</span> <span data-start="1184.1" data-end="1191.21">off. Comprehensiveness of the translations and the file size you are loading in the browser.</span> <span data-start="1191.21" data-end="1198.85">That's a lot of doom and gloom, but there are some better things on the way if you want</span> <span data-start="1198.85" data-end="1204.879">to deal with time zones in the browser. The first one of these is the ECMAScript internationalisation</span> <span data-start="1204.879" data-end="1214.289">API. Which says that you will just be able to do one call and get the user's time zone</span> <span data-start="1214.289" data-end="1222.269">identifier as determined by their operating system. Unfortunately you can't do that cross</span> <span data-start="1222.269" data-end="1228.029">browser right now, the first version of the specification had some very  behaviour</span> <span data-start="1228.029" data-end="1233.129">that been fixed up in version 2, Chrome is the only browser that give you this right</span> <span data-start="1233.129" data-end="1241.44">now. It will do away with a lot of the problems that I have encountered.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1241.44" data-end="1248.7">This is also led into someone wanting to do a navigator.time zone much shorter API, a</span> <span data-start="1248.7" data-end="1253.95">way of getting that. It properly won't get through because of the previous API but people</span> <span data-start="1253.95" data-end="1259.479">are trying to work at better ways of doing this.</span> <span data-start="1259.479" data-end="1263.84">The current problem with the time zone database as well is that every time there's a release</span> <span data-start="1263.84" data-end="1267.289">you have to be notified of it you pretty much just</span> <span data-start="1267.289" data-end="1272.159">have to sign up to a mailing list, find out when there was a new release, download the</span> <span data-start="1272.159" data-end="1277.429">new version, add it back into your software, see how that goes. There are some people trying</span> <span data-start="1277.429" data-end="1282.309">to work on a distribution service so you just subscribe to the service when there's a new</span> <span data-start="1282.309" data-end="1287.239">update you just get given the automatically.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1287.239" data-end="1293.259">There is one thing I won't listen to as a solution. Which is swatch internet time, or</span> <span data-start="1293.259" data-end="1300.97">also known as removing the concept of time zones altogether. Understand Stefano he wrote</span> <span data-start="1300.97" data-end="1311.179">a very good blog post, if you remove the concept of time zones and just puts the entire world</span> <span data-start="1311.179" data-end="1316.2">on one single time reference, it still doesn't help you know whether someone on the other</span> <span data-start="1316.2" data-end="1320.649">side of the world us awake or asleep at the same time as you. It still doesn't let you</span> <span data-start="1320.649" data-end="1325.379">know if they are at work or at home. It just changes the reference point but it doesn't</span> <span data-start="1325.379" data-end="1327.749">solve the problem.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1327.749" data-end="1337.149">Ok so we're getting to the end of a long day, and I just want you to remember three key</span> <span data-start="1337.149" data-end="1344.729">things when dealing with time zones. The first one is do you really need a time zone and</span> <span data-start="1344.729" data-end="1349.59">a time zone definition or do you just need the concept of local time? They are 2 very</span> <span data-start="1349.59" data-end="1355.35">different things. For the majority of cases I have seen, you just need to know what the</span> <span data-start="1355.35" data-end="1360.45">local time is for the user at that moment in time.</span> <span data-start="1360.45" data-end="1365.119">The next one is if you deal with time zones you will be wrong. I don't know where, I don't</span> <span data-start="1365.119" data-end="1371.83">know when but you will be wrong somehow. It's like a moment of Zen, you embrace it, you</span> <span data-start="1371.83" data-end="1377.7">hold on to it you move on you try to minimise how wrong you are. \{laughter\}</span> <span data-start="1377.7" data-end="1386.159">The final one is these problems have existed for a lot longer than JavaScript has. There</span> <span data-start="1386.159" data-end="1393.44">have been people working on these problems since before our language existed. Time zones</span> <span data-start="1393.44" data-end="1399.799">are hard and a lot of people have put a lot of work into trying to make them easier to</span> <span data-start="1399.799" data-end="1404.809">deal with in software. We should learn from the decades of experience of these people,</span> <span data-start="1404.809" data-end="1408.509">and not try and reinvent the wheel. Learn from them, don't ignore history. Thank you</span> </p>
