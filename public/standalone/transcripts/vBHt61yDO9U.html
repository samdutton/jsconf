data-end="937.99">position fix basically just doesn't work</span> <span data-start="937.99" data-end="941.71">well at all on Android 2.3 and actually</span> <span data-start="941.71" data-end="943.21">it turns out that position fixed it</span> <span data-start="943.21" data-end="945.22">doesn't really work that great on iOS in</span> <span data-start="945.22" data-end="947.56">general too so stay away from a fixed</span> <span data-start="947.56" data-end="949.27">position if you can in your layout and</span> <span data-start="949.27" data-end="951.01">you will save yourself a whole lot of</span> <span data-start="951.01" data-end="952.6">headaches now the interesting thing</span> <span data-start="952.6" data-end="953.98">about position fixed is that people</span> <span data-start="953.98" data-end="955.77">figured out this little interesting hack</span> <span data-start="955.77" data-end="959.37">called back face visibility:hidden and</span> <span data-start="959.37" data-end="961.45">there are different variations of it</span> <span data-start="961.45" data-end="963.55">people will apply this to various divs</span> <span data-start="963.55" data-end="965.65">and elements that they want fix</span> <span data-start="965.65" data-end="967.45">positioning on they'll apply it to</span> <span data-start="967.45" data-end="969.13">elements that apparently they want</span> <span data-start="969.13" data-end="970.75">better scroll performance on and I know</span> <span data-start="970.75" data-end="972.22">that Paul Irish is here he'll be talking</span> <span data-start="972.22" data-end="973.51">more about scroll performance later</span> <span data-start="973.51" data-end="974.589">today so I don't want to talk about that</span> <span data-start="974.589" data-end="974.92">too much</span> <span data-start="974.92" data-end="977.32">and you'll also see that sometimes the</span> <span data-start="977.32" data-end="979.24">add perspective and sometimes they add</span> <span data-start="979.24" data-end="981.73">like transforms to it and the premise</span> <span data-start="981.73" data-end="984.339">behind this is that for these screens</span> <span data-start="984.339" data-end="986.38">like WebKit and blink and particularly</span> <span data-start="986.38" data-end="987.79">can promote elements that have these</span> <span data-start="987.79" data-end="991.21">qualifying properties to their own layer</span> <span data-start="991.21" data-end="993.31">so you can get improved performance of</span> <span data-start="993.31" data-end="994.93">these elements on older Android devices</span> <span data-start="994.93" data-end="996.37">now it can end up being a problem though</span> <span data-start="996.37" data-end="998.62">sometime if you overuse this and it's</span> <span data-start="998.62" data-end="1000.03">not a blanket solution if you don't have</span> <span data-start="1000.03" data-end="1002.01">enough virtual RAM you can end up with</span> <span data-start="1002.01" data-end="1003.57">worse performance and the transfer of</span> <span data-start="1003.57" data-end="1005.43">the work from the CPU to GPU can</span> <span data-start="1005.43" data-end="1007.2">actually take a performance hit as well</span> <span data-start="1007.2" data-end="1009.96">and so actually the jury is out on this</span> <span data-start="1009.96" data-end="1011.7">one for me I would love to actually talk</span> <span data-start="1011.7" data-end="1013.77">to more people because I've done that</span> <span data-start="1013.77" data-end="1015.57">and we still kind of didn't agree like</span> <span data-start="1015.57" data-end="1018.15">for example I went and talked to a bunch</span> <span data-start="1018.15" data-end="1020.67">of people at MOBA Phi lo-fi as a company</span> <span data-start="1020.67" data-end="1022.5">in Vancouver I pop in there now and then</span> <span data-start="1022.5" data-end="1023.82">and talk to them about mobile stuff</span> <span data-start="1023.82" data-end="1024.87">because that's what they do all day</span> <span data-start="1024.87" data-end="1026.85">every day and they were like Angelina</span> <span data-start="1026.85" data-end="1029.579">back face visibility no huge performance</span> <span data-start="1029.579" data-end="1032.069">problems it's not worth it we would deal</span> <span data-start="1032.069" data-end="1033.3">with websites where people use it all</span> <span data-start="1033.3" data-end="1034.86">over the place and apparently using it</span> <span data-start="1034.86" data-end="1036.03">multiple times can cause huge</span> <span data-start="1036.03" data-end="1037.949">performance problems but if you search</span> <span data-start="1037.949" data-end="1039.42">for problem or even if you search for</span> <span data-start="1039.42" data-end="1041.79">solutions to the problems of position</span> <span data-start="1041.79" data-end="1043.829">fixed on Android and respectively iOS</span> <span data-start="1043.829" data-end="1046.74">you will find this as the recommended</span> <span data-start="1046.74" data-end="1048.63">solution in different variations of this</span> <span data-start="1048.63" data-end="1050.37">sort and also sometimes in relation to</span> <span data-start="1050.37" data-end="1052.41">scrolling performance because you know</span> <span data-start="1052.41" data-end="1054.17">pushing on to the GPU can theoretically</span> <span data-start="1054.17" data-end="1057.45">make it more responsive so your mileage</span> <span data-start="1057.45" data-end="1059.19">may vary on this one I don't want to</span> <span data-start="1059.19" data-end="1061.05">like hands-down recommend this I want</span> <span data-start="1061.05" data-end="1062.79">you to use this judiciously and make up</span> <span data-start="1062.79" data-end="1065.12">your own mind</span> <span data-start="1065.12" data-end="1067.64">so yes it can cause more performance</span> <span data-start="1067.64" data-end="1070.25">issues and then it solves so if you're</span> <span data-start="1070.25" data-end="1072.23">an Android 2.3 using min height max</span> <span data-start="1072.23" data-end="1074.539">height min with max width they behave</span> <span data-start="1074.539" data-end="1076.82">inconsistently I've noticed that min</span> <span data-start="1076.82" data-end="1079.01">width and Max width will behave pretty</span> <span data-start="1079.01" data-end="1080.9">good but min high to max I like don't</span> <span data-start="1080.9" data-end="1081.32">even bother</span> <span data-start="1081.32" data-end="1082.61">they just won't stretch the way that you</span> <span data-start="1082.61" data-end="1083.96">think they will and it's really annoying</span> <span data-start="1083.96" data-end="1086.44">so just avoid those if possible</span> <span data-start="1086.44" data-end="1089.419">overflow:auto nope just don't use it</span> <span data-start="1089.419" data-end="1091.73">sometimes it kind of works and then you</span> <span data-start="1091.73" data-end="1093.32">actually the time is that it kind of</span> <span data-start="1093.32" data-end="1094.61">works you'll have a container and the</span> <span data-start="1094.61" data-end="1096.919">text will overflow but then kind of be</span> <span data-start="1096.919" data-end="1098.539">cut off in a weird way and then nobody</span> <span data-start="1098.539" data-end="1099.95">can read it so just just don't just stay</span> <span data-start="1099.95" data-end="1103.309">with overflow:auto so yeah just don't</span> <span data-start="1103.309" data-end="1106.13">use it and the z-index now z-index is</span> <span data-start="1106.13" data-end="1108.049">another one that comes up a lot it has a</span> <span data-start="1108.049" data-end="1109.46">lack of respect for absolutely</span> <span data-start="1109.46" data-end="1110.87">positioned elements which is really</span> <span data-start="1110.87" data-end="1112.22">annoying because often with mobile</span> <span data-start="1112.22" data-end="1114.049">designs you want to have a sticky header</span> <span data-start="1114.049" data-end="1115.07">at the top that you'll absolutely</span> <span data-start="1115.07" data-end="1116.84">position sometimes and I don't really</span> <span data-start="1116.84" data-end="1118.01">like this one websites will have little</span> <span data-start="1118.01" data-end="1119.39">tabs on the side that you can click on</span> <span data-start="1119.39" data-end="1121.52">that are social or contact things and so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1121.52" data-end="1123.529">I think the absolute positioning is</span> <span data-start="1123.529" data-end="1125.21">actually a pretty important thing for</span> <span data-start="1125.21" data-end="1126.529">mobile in this respect considering how</span> <span data-start="1126.529" data-end="1129.11">people use it however it turns out this</span> <span data-start="1129.11" data-end="1130.97">is actually very easy to easy to set</span> <span data-start="1130.97" data-end="1133.49">just make sure that you add a z-index on</span> <span data-start="1133.49" data-end="1135.11">the body tag and make sure that that is</span> <span data-start="1135.11" data-end="1137.059">set well to zero and then all the other</span> <span data-start="1137.059" data-end="1139.909">index elements will stack on top of it a</span> <span data-start="1139.909" data-end="1141.559">lot of the time people will just give</span> <span data-start="1141.559" data-end="1143.39">something as the index but not you know</span> <span data-start="1143.39" data-end="1145.19">think that they want to have a z-index</span> <span data-start="1145.19" data-end="1147.59">beneath that element it's something that</span> <span data-start="1147.59" data-end="1148.94">just kind of works out of the box and</span> <span data-start="1148.94" data-end="1150.44">other browsers but here this is the easy</span> <span data-start="1150.44" data-end="1152.63">fix for it so if your rosy index</span> <span data-start="1152.63" data-end="1155.27">problems I'm solutioning this isn't the</span> <span data-start="1155.27" data-end="1160.789">trick for you this one weird trick so</span> <span data-start="1160.789" data-end="1163.399">the other caveat is ms are poorly</span> <span data-start="1163.399" data-end="1164.72">supported and M's are kind of the</span> <span data-start="1164.72"

data-end="1177.98">frustrating for you Remz don't even</span> <span data-start="1177.98" data-end="1179.659">think about it now interesting thing</span> <span data-start="1179.659" data-end="1181.85">though I found out that the X unit is</span> <span data-start="1181.85" data-end="1183.59">supported so if you want to start</span> <span data-start="1183.59"
