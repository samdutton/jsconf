think it's a</span> <span data-start="213.76" data-end="215.59">perfectly fine language and had it</span> <span data-start="215.59" data-end="217.12">existed i would not have felt the need</span> <span data-start="217.12" data-end="218.92">to invent a new language or anything we</span> <span data-start="218.92" data-end="222.67">would have just made apps with this but</span> <span data-start="222.67" data-end="224.41">that didn't happen right I mean for like</span> <span data-start="224.41" data-end="226.57">a solid year we were told ECMO scripts</span> <span data-start="226.57" data-end="228.58">for its common this this is the real</span> <span data-start="228.58" data-end="232.06">deal guys and and you know from the they</span> <span data-start="232.06" data-end="234.37">hosted classes on this Mozilla you know</span> <span data-start="234.37" data-end="236.14">had the reference implementation and</span> <span data-start="236.14" data-end="239.41">then all it took was one meeting for</span> <span data-start="239.41" data-end="240.94">this thing to get abandoned completely</span> <span data-start="240.94" data-end="243.79">and then now my history is a little</span> <span data-start="243.79" data-end="244.9">fuzzy on this part because I kind of</span> <span data-start="244.9" data-end="247.03">stopped paying attention but I believe</span> <span data-start="247.03" data-end="248.95">this is the one that came after it kind</span> <span data-start="248.95" data-end="250.87">of went backwards a little and this is I</span> <span data-start="250.87" data-end="252.37">think this is called harmony it's kind</span> <span data-start="252.37" data-end="253.93">of a few of the things from four and a</span> <span data-start="253.93" data-end="255.91">few other things from other places and I</span> <span data-start="255.91" data-end="257.62">just checked Wikipedia last night and</span> <span data-start="257.62" data-end="261.58">there's now echo script five and I have</span> <span data-start="261.58" data-end="265.03">no idea what this does but the thing</span> <span data-start="265.03" data-end="266.47">that gets to me is like every time they</span> <span data-start="266.47" data-end="267.85">announce a new one of these ECMO scripts</span> <span data-start="267.85" data-end="269.86">like people get really excited like who</span> <span data-start="269.86" data-end="272.11">oh man things are going to change this</span> <span data-start="272.11" data-end="274.99">time right and and the same image always</span> <span data-start="274.99" data-end="276.49">comes to my mind when people have</span> <span data-start="276.49" data-end="279.21">reaction which is this like the</span> <span data-start="279.21" data-end="281.8">standards bodies were like you know here</span> <span data-start="281.8" data-end="283.12">comes a new JavaScript guys what</span> <span data-start="283.12" data-end="285.789">everyone gets excited so I think I speak</span> <span data-start="285.789" data-end="288.46">for everyone when I say good grief you</span> <span data-start="288.46" data-end="293.229">know and this is really unfortunate just</span> <span data-start="293.229" data-end="294.849">because if you kind of look at the</span> <span data-start="294.849" data-end="296.849">landscape outside the client-side web</span> <span data-start="296.849" data-end="300.789">things like Ruby Python Java scholars</span> <span data-start="300.789" data-end="304.99">gala it's really exciting out there it</span> <span data-start="304.99" data-end="307.03">for a number of reasons one I don't know</span> <span data-start="307.03" data-end="308.44">if you guys read read it or not but it</span> <span data-start="308.44" data-end="310.18">seems like someone invents a new</span> <span data-start="310.18" data-end="312.4">language like every week and you know</span> <span data-start="312.4" data-end="313.96">maybe the language won't survive but</span> <span data-start="313.96" data-end="315.669">like there's lots of really great ideas</span> <span data-start="315.669" data-end="317.44">and they all cross influence each other</span> <span data-start="317.44" data-end="320.02">and you know scholars is relatively new</span> <span data-start="320.02" data-end="321.819">and it's it's it's a really great</span> <span data-start="321.819" data-end="324.159">language built on top of the JVM but</span> <span data-start="324.159" data-end="326.83">additionally within each language like</span> <span data-start="326.83" data-end="329.38">so much is being done like you know the</span> <span data-start="329.38" data-end="331.69">difference between ruby 1.9 and 1.8 is</span> <span data-start="331.69" data-end="333.729">so great and they're always trying to</span> <span data-start="333.729" data-end="336.37">add things to python etc and i really</span> <span data-start="336.37" data-end="339.159">wish we had that on the client-side web</span> <span data-start="339.159" data-end="342.43">and we don't and it's kind of it's kind</span> <span data-start="342.43" data-end="344.349">of funny like we call it the open web</span> <span data-start="344.349" data-end="346.69">but it's really closed to us the</span> <span data-start="346.69" data-end="349.06">developers like very rarely do the</span> <span data-start="349.06" data-end="350.889">standards bodies come and ask us the</span> <span data-start="350.889" data-end="352.33">developers like what do you need it's</span> <span data-start="352.33" data-end="355.3">very much a we know how to make it you</span> <span data-start="355.3" data-end="357.28">guys just sit we'll figure it out and</span> <span data-start="357.28" data-end="359.5">and that's really distressing to me</span> <span data-start="359.5" data-end="361.63">again coming from these communities or</span> <span data-start="361.63" data-end="363.039">where i can say hey I want this feature</span> <span data-start="363.039" data-end="365.38">and a couple weeks later it's in there</span> <span data-start="365.38" data-end="370.659">and then to not have that so basically</span> <span data-start="370.659" data-end="372.909">there's there's kind of two ways to</span> <span data-start="372.909" data-end="375.31">approach this problem you know given</span> <span data-start="375.31" data-end="377.56">that javascript is not going to change</span> <span data-start="377.56" data-end="379.27">like we can't go in and change</span> <span data-start="379.27" data-end="382.3">javascript in every browser the only</span> <span data-start="382.3" data-end="383.74">option is really to build something on</span> <span data-start="383.74" data-end="385.75">top of javascript and what most people</span> <span data-start="385.75" data-end="387.43">do is precisely that right they build</span> <span data-start="387.43" data-end="388.63">some library that kind of makes</span> <span data-start="388.63" data-end="392.979">javascript insane we had kind of a</span> <span data-start="392.979" data-end="395.86">different approach which was to build a</span> <span data-start="395.86" data-end="398.229">whole language on top of javascript and</span> <span data-start="398.229" data-end="401.83">we call it objective j and this is kind</span> <span data-start="401.83" data-end="404.289">of the stuff it does i'll get into it</span> <span data-start="404.289" data-end="404.9">and a little</span> <span data-start="404.9" data-end="406.91">detail in a second but I want to tell</span> <span data-start="406.91" data-end="409.07">you why we decided to make a language as</span> <span data-start="409.07" data-end="412.79">opposed to a set of libraries like every</span> <span data-start="412.79" data-end="415.91">single language is equally dynamic like</span> <span data-start="415.91" data-end="418.58">if you want garbage collection and C++</span> <span data-start="418.58" data-end="420.47">you can get it you just have to</span> <span data-start="420.47" data-end="421.85">implement it yourself and you know you</span> <span data-start="421.85" data-end="423.949">make the garbage collected object class</span> <span data-start="423.949" data-end="426.05">and as long as every single object in</span> <span data-start="426.05" data-end="428.84">your application you know subclasses</span> <span data-start="428.84" data-end="431.449">that your whole program will be garbage</span> <span data-start="431.449" data-end="433.61">collected right if you want first class</span> <span data-start="433.61" data-end="436.22">function objects and C++ you can do that</span> <span data-start="436.22" data-end="438.8">too just make the functor class you want</span> <span data-start="438.8" data-end="441.02">classes and see fine right the wrapper</span> <span data-start="441.02" data-end="442.669">functions and this is what people used</span> <span data-start="442.669" data-end="444.62">to do right back in the sea days before</span> <span data-start="444.62" data-end="446.81">we had C++ and objective-c in cetera et</span> <span data-start="446.81" data-end="448.88">cetera people actually wrote rapper</span> <span data-start="448.88" data-end="451.07">functions around structs to simulate</span> <span data-start="451.07" data-end="454.34">classes and see but when we did that no</span> <span data-start="454.34" data-end="457.01">one said ah see see how elegant see is</span> <span data-start="457.01" data-end="458.599">you can do just about anything and see</span> <span data-start="458.599" data-end="459.71">no people were like man this really</span> <span data-start="459.71" data-end="462.169">sucks this should really be a language</span> <span data-start="462.169" data-end="464.36">feature and that's the way I feel about</span> <span data-start="464.36" data-end="466.28">a lot of the things that people are</span> <span data-start="466.28" data-end="468.349">currently doing with libraries today</span> <span data-start="468.349" data-end="471.199">specifically trying to fix kind of like</span> <span data-start="471.199" data-end="474.05">the class problems in JavaScript I think</span> <span data-start="474.05" data-end="475.37">there's a pretty clear difference in</span> <span data-start="475.37" data-end="477.949">your code between the things that</span> <span data-start="477.949" data-end="480.26">actually achieve goals for your</span> <span data-start="480.26" data-end="482.51">application like taking the cosine of a</span> <span data-start="482.51" data-end="484.639">number right like that that's that's</span> <span data-start="484.639" data-end="486.38">something that has to do with the direct</span> <span data-start="486.38" data-end="488.659">goal of your application

data-end="629.829">technical but you know if you import</span> <span data-start="629.829" data-end="631.24">code and then you write code and then</span> <span data-start="631.24" data-end="633.25">you

data-start="700" data-end="702.64">with classical inheritance and I think</span> <span data-start="702.64" data-end="704.2">this has proven itself because a lot of</span> <span data-start="704.2" data-end="706.21">what libraries do today in javascript is</span> <span data-start="706.21" data-end="708.96">kind of emulate this classical behavior</span> <span data-start="708.96"

two</span> <span data-start="723.61" data-end="725.5">are kind of related is dynamic dispatch</span> <span data-start="725.5" data-end="727.96">and method missing if you guys are</span> <span

at</span> <span data-start="742.33" data-end="745.84">runtime etc but by far I think the</span> <span data-start="745.84" data-end="747.37">coolest thing about objective J is that</span> <span data-start="747.37" data-end="750.7">it is completely open source and to give</span> <span data-start="750.7" data-end="752.8">you an example of what that means we</span> <span data-start="752.8"

week</span> <span data-start="762.37" data-end="764.08">later we added that language feature and</span> <span data-start="764.08" data-end="765.79">you're just not going to get that you</span> <span data-start="765.79" data-end="768.4">know if the language itself is an open</span> <span data-start="768.4" data-end="770.71">source so the other cool thing is that</span> <span data-start="770.71"
