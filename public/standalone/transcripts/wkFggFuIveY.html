data-start="136.84" data-end="138.939">always more things to keep getting added</span> <span data-start="138.939" data-end="141.819">to it and so it's you know it's</span> <span data-start="141.819"

out and</span> <span data-start="147.55" data-end="149.83">do like MVPs you know so we can try to</span> <span data-start="149.83" data-end="151.21">get something out to the customer so</span> <span data-start="151.21" data-end="153.91">they can see it quicker and those things</span> <span data-start="153.91" data-end="156.13">have kind of you know evolve how we do</span> <span data-start="156.13" data-end="157.99">software you used to try to plan out</span> <span data-start="157.99" data-end="160.24">every possible thing up front and you</span> <span data-start="160.24" data-end="161.62">know you never even get started you know</span> <span data-start="161.62" data-end="163.36">the project takes years to be for you</span> <span data-start="163.36" data-end="165.58">all the planning so now we're at least</span> <span data-start="165.58" data-end="169.12">delivering you know value sooner and so</span> <span data-start="169.12" data-end="170.98">with Sprint's and trying to evolve the</span> <span data-start="170.98" data-end="173.92">code so we've tried to do this feature</span> <span data-start="173.92" data-end="176.77">base stuff before you a lot of times we</span> <span data-start="176.77" data-end="178.6">use git commits you know and branches to</span> <span data-start="178.6" data-end="181.27">try and put whole features together and</span> <span data-start="181.27" data-end="184.96">move them in a merge at a time and we</span> <span data-start="184.96" data-end="186.01">and the other thing we try to do is</span> <span data-start="186.01" data-end="187.72">organize by feature so a lot of times</span> <span data-start="187.72" data-end="189.13">you'll see people trying to organize</span> <span data-start="189.13" data-end="191.56">their code base so that all the things</span> <span data-start="191.56" data-end="194.47">around a particular domain or portion of</span> <span data-start="194.47" data-end="197.95">the screen are all handled in one area a</span> <span data-start="197.95" data-end="199.84">lot of times you've with feet you know</span> <span data-start="199.84" data-end="201.67">features you want to do a/b testing so</span> <span data-start="201.67" data-end="203.29">you'll want to turn on a new feature or</span> <span data-start="203.29" data-end="205.09">you want to change a feature to a new</span> <span data-start="205.09" data-end="207.7">new version so sometimes you might have</span> <span data-start="207.7" data-end="209.2">feature switches where you want people</span> <span data-start="209.2" data-end="211.39">to be able to do that early adopters</span> <span data-start="211.39" data-end="213.28">might you know be able to try some of</span> <span data-start="213.28" data-end="217.24">your new code app so what are the</span> <span data-start="217.24" data-end="218.83">challenges with with feature base 2</span> <span data-start="218.83" data-end="221.5">element well sometimes maintaining</span> <span data-start="221.5" data-end="223.93">flexibility so we start to get too rigid</span> <span data-start="223.93" data-end="226.48">and we can't use new technology we can't</span> <span data-start="226.48" data-end="227.47">it would get locked into certain</span> <span data-start="227.47" data-end="230.46">frameworks so that can be a problem</span> <span data-start="230.46" data-end="232.99">wiring and boilerplate sometimes it's</span> <span data-start="232.99" data-end="235.66">just a mess to try and code this stuff</span> <span data-start="235.66" data-end="237.34">up so it even you know hooks together so</span> <span data-start="237.34" data-end="240.97">it's a lot of work sharing across</span> <span data-start="240.97" data-end="243.22">features can be challenging as far as</span> <span data-start="243.22" data-end="245.44">trying to keep things isolated but yet</span> <span data-start="245.44" data-end="248.59">still be able to share things and then</span> <span data-start="248.59" data-end="250.12">also to be able to fire things off at</span> <span data-start="250.12" data-end="251.53">the right time so sometimes things need</span> <span data-start="251.53" data-end="253.33">to happen in order and different things</span> <span data-start="253.33" data-end="255.55">like that so hooks and dependencies are</span> <span data-start="255.55" data-end="260.89">challenges so some previous things that</span> <span data-start="260.89" data-end="262.09">you could have done to try and do</span> <span data-start="262.09" data-end="263.98">feature based development or you could</span> <span data-start="263.98" data-end="266.2">have like I said mention are used pull</span> <span data-start="266.2" data-end="268.15">requests and do emerge things together</span> <span data-start="268.15" data-end="270.16">but you know sometimes you you get</span> <span data-start="270.16" data-end="272.29">through the development of the branch in</span> <span data-start="272.29" data-end="275.44">the feature and then it gets held up you</span> <span data-start="275.44" data-end="277.18">know maybe it's waiting for something</span> <span data-start="277.18" data-end="278.3">else to be done</span> <span data-start="278.3" data-end="281.21">or people want to review it again or you</span> <span data-start="281.21" data-end="282.409">know those guys are busy on something</span> <span data-start="282.409" data-end="284.69">else and so sometimes things don't line</span> <span data-start="284.69" data-end="286.94">up and then you know things get merged</span> <span data-start="286.94" data-end="288.44">out of order and it's just it's a mess</span> <span data-start="288.44" data-end="289.909">you know it can be really challenging to</span> <span data-start="289.909" data-end="293.18">try and move the code together it's hard</span> <span data-start="293.18" data-end="294.979">to it's hard to a/b test to if you if</span> <span data-start="294.979" data-end="296.36">these features are developed you know</span> <span data-start="296.36" data-end="298.19">where they be replace each other you</span> <span data-start="298.19" data-end="299.569">know with the commits then there's no</span> <span data-start="299.569" data-end="301.22">way to go back or you know in all that</span> <span data-start="301.22" data-end="302.889">so it's it could be tricky</span> <span data-start="302.889" data-end="305.36">so there's some boilerplate projects</span> <span data-start="305.36" data-end="307.22">that try to you know kind of take this</span> <span data-start="307.22" data-end="310.19">idea of adding features at a time until</span> <span data-start="310.19" data-end="311.93">they leave include like a CLI where you</span> <span data-start="311.93" data-end="314.15">can you know generate some code that's</span> <span data-start="314.15" data-end="317.389">already hooked up you know so that helps</span> <span data-start="317.389" data-end="320.03">it can work but you know you're kind of</span> <span data-start="320.03" data-end="322.069">locked into whatever they have you know</span> <span data-start="322.069" data-end="323.27">what if you know hopefully it's an</span> <span data-start="323.27" data-end="324.5">active community and they're still</span> <span data-start="324.5" data-end="326.27">developing it and you know upgrading it</span> <span data-start="326.27" data-end="328.34">but you kind of are stuck you know if</span> <span data-start="328.34" data-end="330.44">they're using the specific technology or</span> <span data-start="330.44" data-end="332.449">you're kind of locked into that so it</span> <span data-start="332.449" data-end="334.099">can be pretty you know and so it can</span> <span data-start="334.099" data-end="335.69">over time it can get stale especially if</span> <span data-start="335.69" data-end="338.78">they move on to other things so the</span> <span data-start="338.78" data-end="340.43">dependency injection frameworks you know</span> <span data-start="340.43" data-end="341.9">there's probably a thousand different</span> <span data-start="341.9" data-end="345.59">ones out in MPM a lot of them are kind</span> <span data-start="345.59" data-end="347.15">of complicated and they do all kinds of</span> <span data-start="347.15" data-end="349.25">different things but from what I've seen</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="349.25" data-end="350.96">I haven't really seen any that really</span> <span data-start="350.96" data-end="353.11">fit this feature-based development</span> <span data-start="353.11" data-end="357.139">process very well you could just take a</span> <span data-start="357.139" data-end="358.819">global object and start throwing stuff</span> <span data-start="358.819" data-end="361.58">on that but you know there's you can</span> <span data-start="361.58" data-end="363.08">obviously have collisions name</span> <span data-start="363.08" data-end="365.69">collisions and things so that you don't</span> <span data-start="365.69" data-end="367.37">know you know there's no protection</span> <span data-start="367.37" data-end="369.409">against overwriting something else and</span> <span data-start="369.409" data-end="371.99">no use it's contracts and stuff like</span> <span data-start="371.99" data-end="373.34">that so there's there challenges with</span> <span data-start="373.34" data-end="376.43">doing that kind of a template so that</span> <span data-start="376.43" data-end="378.71">leads me to feature you so this is a</span> <span data-start="378.71" data-end="381.379">library that Kevin Bridges wrote one of</span> <span data-start="381.379" data-end="383.539">my good friends I worked with Kevin for</span> <span data-start="383.539" data-end="385.43">about eight years of our GA in st. Louis</span> <span data-start="385.43" data-end="389.539">and Kevin's just he's an inspiring guy</span> <span data-start="389.539" data-end="393.139">to me he's he's had the long career you</span> <span data-start="393.139" data-end="395.539">know and and I know I've went through my</span> <span data-start="395.539" data-end="397.129">career ups and downs and got burned out</span> <span data-start="397.129" data-end="399.71">a few times and fired back up and Kevin</span> <span data-start="399.71" data-end="400.879">just seems like he's just one little</span> <span data-start="400.879" data-end="402.469">solid guys that just you know plows on</span> <span data-start="402.469" data-end="406.009">through creates beautiful software great</span> <span data-start="406.009" data-end="409.94">documentation and so he was working on a</span> <span data-start="409.94" data-end="411.9">react native an expo project</span> <span data-start="411.9" data-end="414.99">and he got the idea well if he could try</span> <span data-start="414.99" data-end="418.32">and extract this feature you based</span> <span data-start="418.32" data-end="421.89">approach from his existing project he</span> <span data-start="421.89" data-end="423.48">started to see some similarities and how</span> <span data-start="423.48" data-end="426.18">things might be able to pull doubt be</span> <span data-start="426.18" data-end="428.85">pulled out from his app and so that's</span> <span data-start="428.85" data-end="430.14">how future you kind of came about he</span> <span data-start="430.14" data-end="432.66">started from that idea so this is you</span> <span data-start="432.66" data-end="434.55">know primarily for a reactor a react</span> <span data-start="434.55" data-end="436.86">native or Expo type app but I think the</span> <span data-start="436.86" data-end="438.78">ideas are good and I think you know it</span> <span data-start="438.78" data-end="440.31">could easily be applied to a lot of</span> <span data-start="440.31" data-end="442.02">different frameworks and that so it's</span> <span data-start="442.02" data-end="444.78">really more Universal Nass so the</span> <span data-start="444.78" data-end="448.35">project is at feature UJS org and his</span> <span data-start="448.35" data-end="453.57">github is there with Kevin ast so what</span> <span data-start="453.57" data-end="456.39">are the benefits of feature you</span> <span data-start="456.39" data-end="457.62">well it's designed for feature</span> <span data-start="457.62" data-end="459.51">development I mean he it's that's what</span> <span data-start="459.51" data-end="461.82">he built it for it's simple and flexible</span> <span data-start="461.82" data-end="463.17">it doesn't have a lot of those</span> <span data-start="463.17" data-end="464.25">complicated things that the DI</span> <span data-start="464.25" data-end="467.28">frameworks have it makes it easy for</span> <span data-start="467.28" data-end="469.8">cross feature sharing it makes it easy</span> <span data-start="469.8" data-end="471.75">to capsulate things into into specific</span> <span data-start="471.75" data-end="475.17">features organizing by feature testing a</span> <span data-start="475.17" data-end="478.47">and B test a and B testing and it's</span> <span data-start="478.47" data-end="480.27">dramatically it reduces your boilerplate</span> <span data-start="480.27" data-end="481.68">and wiring out when I saw how little</span> <span data-start="481.68" data-end="483.72">wiring you have to do once you start</span> <span data-start="483.72" data-end="485.55">using this I was like wow this is this</span> <span data-start="485.55" data-end="486.93">is good I mean this is good just even</span> <span data-start="486.93" data-end="488.94">from you know non-feature development if</span> <span data-start="488.94" data-end="491.79">you wanted to get get up and going you</span> <span data-start="491.79" data-end="493.41">know it just really dramatically reduces</span> <span data-start="493.41" data-end="494.24">that wiring</span> <span data-start="494.24" data-end="496.62">he's also got lifecycle hooks where</span> <span data-start="496.62" data-end="498.6">things will

aspects where</span> <span data-start="503.49" data-end="506.04">you can extend with new technology so</span> <span data-start="506.04" data-end="508.26">this can just be added in and all of a</span> <span data-start="508.26" data-end="509.58">sudden now you have a new technology</span> <span data-start="509.58" data-end="512.07">that's that's being used and he's got</span> <span data-start="512.07" data-end="513.81">really good validation across all this</span> <span data-start="513.81" data-end="516.69">and usage contracts so one of these</span> <span data-start="516.69" data-end="517.92">things that's kind of difficult with</span> <span data-start="517.92" data-end="520.89">with defining stuff across dependencies</span> <span data-start="520.89" data-end="522.48">an app is to make sure you've got all</span> <span data-start="522.48" data-end="524.13">the things accounted for so if you're</span> <span data-start="524.13" data-end="526.41">expecting a widget over

<span data-start="529.71" data-end="531.21">to make sure it's it's matching up you</span> <span data-start="531.21" data-end="532.68">spell everything right you know it's all</span> <span data-start="532.68" data-end="534.9">hooked up and you want to know quickly</span> <span data-start="534.9" data-end="540.99">if it's if it hasn't so a high-level</span> <span data-start="540.99" data-end="544.08">overview how this works we create and</span> <span data-start="544.08" data-end="545.55">register features so</span> <span data-start="545.55" data-end="547.019">that's the kind of the main main part of</span> <span data-start="547.019" data-end="549.45">it you can instantiate and register</span> <span data-start="549.45" data-end="551.25">certain aspects if you need them so</span> <span data-start="551.25" data-end="555">things like Redux or Redux logic or he's</span> <span data-start="555" data-end="556.92">got a built-in feature router that works</span> <span data-start="556.92" data-end="561.029">well with with react native then you</span> <span data-start="561.029" data-end="562.35">launch the app with the features and</span> <span data-start="562.35" data-end="564.6">assets it actually has a hook where you</span> <span data-start="564.6" data-end="566.37">just define what it's going to do when</span> <span data-start="566.37" data-end="569.19">it launches and it takes care of it it</span> <span data-start="569.19" data-end="571.769">does all the heavy work of wiring things</span> <span data-start="571.769" data-end="574.47">up and Verret validating and then</span> <span data-start="574.47" data-end="576.63">features themselves can define what he</span> <span data-start="576.63" data-end="579.87">calls facets or feature asset and that's</span> <span data-start="579.87" data-end="582">there for cross cross feature sharing so</span> <span data-start="582" data-end="583.079">that's I'll show you a little bit more</span> <span data-start="583.079" data-end="584.91">about that and features will basically</span> <span data-start="584.91" data-end="586.5">define them and other features will use</span> <span data-start="586.5" data-end="587.97">them so then that way that's how you get</span> <span data-start="587.97" data-end="591.87">the cross sharing and feature you can it</span> <span data-start="591.87" data-end="593.31">can help manage and validate those paths</span> <span data-start="593.31" data-end="594.839">so like I said it if you define the</span> <span data-start="594.839" data-end="596.64">contracts it'll actually make sure that</span> <span data-start="596.64" data-end="598.29">they exist and are spelled right and all</span> <span data-start="598.29" data-end="601.38">that so I don't don't know if you can</span> <span data-start="601.38" data-end="603.269">read this chart very well but you can</span> <span data-start="603.269" data-end="605.31">look at the slides later and it kind of</span> <span data-start="605.31" data-end="606.51">just summarizes what I was talking about</span> <span data-start="606.51" data-end="607.709">we got a bunch of different features</span> <span data-start="607.709" data-end="610.2">that make up your app launch app brings</span> <span data-start="610.2" data-end="612.93">it all together it exposes it pulls all</span> <span data-start="612.93" data-end="615.089">the facets that are defined across all</span> <span data-start="615.089" data-end="616.709">the features pulls it together into an</span> <span data-start="616.709" data-end="621.94">object and gives it to your to your app</span> <span data-start="621.95" data-end="624.779">so here's a just example of kind of the</span> <span data-start="624.779" data-end="626.07">structure you might use and you could</span> <span data-start="626.07" data-end="627.51">really use whatever structure you want</span> <span data-start="627.51" data-end="629.49">but this seemed to work pretty well with</span> <span data-start="629.49" data-end="634.14">feature based development and so you</span> <span data-start="634.14" data-end="636.18">basically would have you know an index</span> <span data-start="636.18" data-end="638.22">file that kicks everything off calls the</span> <span data-start="638.22" data-end="639.72">launch app pulls together the features</span> <span data-start="639.72" data-end="641.73">and all that and then I like to have</span> <span data-start="641.73" data-end="643.649">like a features directory and in each</span> <span data-start="643.649" data-end="646.29">directory in the index that accumulates</span> <span data-start="646.29" data-end="648.27">all of them and then in different</span> <span data-start="648.27" data-end="649.86">directories for each feature so then and</span> <span data-start="649.86" data-end="651.839">that might just be an index file or it</span> <span data-start="651.839" data-end="653.97">could be an index and actions file and a</span> <span data-start="653.97" data-end="655.23">producer file and you know you could</span> <span data-start="655.23" data-end="656.97">split it up however you want components</span> <span data-start="656.97" data-end="658.56">you know everything everything that's</span> <span data-start="658.56" data-end="659.88">related to that feature can all live</span> <span data-start="659.88" data-end="664.63">together right there and at one one spot</span> <span data-start="664.64" data-end="667.649">so this feature object is a kind of a</span> <span data-start="667.649" data-end="670.44">key concept so you basically call create</span> <span data-start="670.44" data-end="672.6">feature you give it a unique name and</span> <span data-start="672.6" data-end="674.97">this will and if you name it the same</span> <span data-start="674.97" data-end="677.04">thing it'll complain got validation and</span> <span data-start="677.04" data-end="678.329">make sure you know each features got a</span> <span data-start="678.329" data-end="679.459">unique name</span> <span data-start="679.459" data-end="682.05">he's got an optional flag for if it's</span> <span data-start="682.05" data-end="683.01">enabled or not so you can actually</span> <span data-start="683.01" data-end="685.079">toggle this on and off with logic you</span> <span data-start="685.079" data-end="688.68">know if you wanted and then the facets</span> <span data-start="688.68" data-end="690.029">part that's where you actually would</span> <span data-start="690.029" data-end="693.389">define and use facets so you can</span> <span data-start="693.389" data-end="695.13">actually define what you assets that you</span> <span data-start="695.13" data-end="697.11">provide from your feature and ask that</span> <span data-start="697.11" data-end="699.449">you want to use in this case then it</span> <span data-start="699.449" data-end="701.55">would validate that those those assets</span> <span data-start="701.55" data-end="703.949">those facets live or exist somewhere</span> <span data-start="703.949" data-end="708.089">that they're created and then in this</span> <span data-start="708.089" data-end="711.69">case if we're using redux then there</span> <span data-start="711.69" data-end="713.31">might be a reducer that's associated</span> <span data-start="713.31" data-end="715.44">with it and if using Redux logic then</span> <span data-start="715.44" data-end="717.959">you might have a logic array if it comes</span> <span data-start="717.959" data-end="721.98">with it and then some optional callbacks</span> <span data-start="721.98" data-end="724.29">app will start and an app did start and</span> <span data-start="724.29" data-end="726.69">it provides you hook then where you can</span> <span data-start="726.69" data-end="729.81">provide what what the you know the app</span> <span data-start="729.81" data-end="731.1">was gonna start up with with the</span> <span data-start="731.1" data-end="733.35">component and also you know fire off</span> <span data-start="733.35" data-end="735.3">other things later so it gives you those</span> <span data-start="735.3" data-end="739.26">nice hooks and I mentioned in the</span> <span data-start="739.26" data-end="741.63">feature directory I had like an index</span> <span data-start="741.63" data-end="743.76">file and in there I basically import all</span> <span data-start="743.76" data-end="745.35">the features that I'm that I have and</span> <span data-start="745.35" data-end="748.709">then export them as a array and so this</span> <span data-start="748.709" data-end="750.329">will be the actually the arrays the</span> <span data-start="750.329" data-end="752.64">array of features that gets used by our</span> <span data-start="752.64" data-end="756.48">launch app and so here's launch app and</span> <span data-start="756.48" data-end="759.18">this was in the source index file so we</span> <span data-start="759.18" data-end="760.949">might have a couple aspects that I've</span> <span data-start="760.949" data-end="762.63">created here I've used in Redux Redux</span> <span data-start="762.63" data-end="764.79">logic if you don't have any then those</span> <span data-start="764.79" data-end="766.31">will be you know just the empty array I</span> <span data-start="766.31" data-end="768.839">got my features coming in from source in</span> <span data-start="768.839" data-end="770.91">our source feature index and then</span> <span data-start="770.91" data-end="772.94">basically called register root app and</span> <span data-start="772.94" data-end="775.32">kind of whatever code I need to do so</span> <span data-start="775.32" data-end="777.6">for web app react app then you would</span> <span data-start="777.6" data-end="780.54">call react Dom render for an expo app</span> <span data-start="780.54" data-end="783.48">you call expo dot register root element</span> <span data-start="783.48" data-end="786.269">and you know whatever whatever at you</span> <span data-start="786.269" data-end="788.339">need to do for your startup so this</span> <span data-start="788.339" data-end="789.329">would work with many you know many</span> <span data-start="789.329" data-end="793.44">different types of systems so features</span> <span data-start="793.44" data-end="797.18">aspects register facets kind of context</span> <span data-start="797.18" data-end="800.819">so this cross feature sharing usage</span> <span data-start="800.819" data-end="802.98">contracts so this is a kind of this kind</span> <span data-start="802.98" data-end="804.42">of evolved from the first version that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="804.42" data-end="806.55">Kevin created he created the first</span> <span data-start="806.55" data-end="809.819">version back in March and like I said he</span> <span data-start="809.819" data-end="811.56">specifically was using an expo at the</span> <span data-start="811.56" data-end="813.279">time and then when I</span> <span data-start="813.279" data-end="815.199">I started to look at it to help him I</span> <span data-start="815.199" data-end="817.6">was gonna put a web app with it through</span> <span data-start="817.6" data-end="819.91">it through it then we realized there</span> <span data-start="819.91" data-end="821.41">needed to be some some changes to make</span> <span data-start="821.41" data-end="823.449">it a little simpler and live different</span> <span data-start="823.449" data-end="826.329">interfaces for UI sharing and cross</span> <span data-start="826.329" data-end="827.949">cross future sharing so basically we</span> <span data-start="827.949" data-end="830.829">kind of evolved it and then went through</span> <span data-start="830.829" data-end="832.389">you some design sessions and then Kevin</span> <span data-start="832.389" data-end="834.279">went back and and implemented version</span> <span data-start="834.279" data-end="837.97">one so this is what this usage contracts</span> <span data-start="837.97" data-end="839.949">look like for for cross feature sharing</span> <span data-start="839.949" data-end="842.23">so basically in this case and the facets</span> </p>

data-end="1770.35">practices of just a few things to note I</span> <span data-start="1770.35" data-end="1773.2">think it's pretty simple to use once you</span> <span data-start="1773.2" data-end="1775.929">try it but you know the good thing is to</span> <span data-start="1775.929" data-end="1777.669">avoid cross feature imports so instead</span> <span data-start="1777.669" data-end="1779.919">of importing from feature a to feature B</span> <span data-start="1779.919" data-end="1782.799">directly use the you know use the facets</span> <span data-start="1782.799"

data-end="1790.27">know so you don't have to be changing</span> <span data-start="1790.27" data-end="1791.98">you know a lot of files with imports and</span> <span data-start="1791.98" data-end="1794.049">things so that that's great it also</span> <span data-start="1794.049" data-end="1796.419">helps for swapping and for a/b testing</span> <span data-start="1796.419"

data-end="1802.03">the define used and they use so that</span> <span data-start="1802.03" data-end="1803.89">basically will catch spelling mistakes</span> <span data-start="1803.89"
