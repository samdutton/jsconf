<p><span data-start="52.04" data-end="54.379">Berlin, they paid for my flight.</span> <span data-start="54.379" data-end="60">They're hiring script developers.</span> <span data-start="60" data-end="62.6">Okay.</span> <span data-start="62.6" data-end="65.62">The meaning of words.</span> <span data-start="65.62" data-end="74.04">I want to start by reminding you of a\h‑‑ of someone's guiding principle.</span> <span data-start="74.04" data-end="77.65">Creators need an immediate connection to what they're creating.</span> <span data-start="77.65" data-end="83.409">This is Brett victor's guiding principle I'll show you some of his ideas following this</span> <span data-start="83.409" data-end="89.78">principle to give you an idea of what he's talking about.</span> <span data-start="89.78" data-end="96.84">On the right side we have an editor, on the left we're showing a picture the code generates.</span> <span data-start="96.84" data-end="103.579">The editor allows direct manipulation of values, changing a value on the right gets an immediate</span> <span data-start="103.579" data-end="106.35">result on the left.</span> <span data-start="106.35" data-end="113.11">There is no compilation or any other sort of waiting, every change is instant.</span> <span data-start="113.11" data-end="120.06">So, Brett thinking this immediate connection is very important.</span> <span data-start="120.06" data-end="124.359">You can't do certain things if the computer makes you wait all the time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="124.359" data-end="133.459">And I very much agree.</span> <span data-start="133.459" data-end="137.11">\h‑‑ Brett is very inspiring go watch all his videos if you haven't.</span> <span data-start="137.11" data-end="141.43">I think his ideas should be part of every creative environment.</span> <span data-start="141.43" data-end="145.78">However, I thought I'd play his principles to something different.</span> <span data-start="145.78" data-end="152.69">So, the ideas I'll show attempt to remove everything that stands between your idea and</span> <span data-start="152.69" data-end="156.57">running or sharing it as a program.</span> <span data-start="156.57" data-end="167.56">So, do we have an immediate connection to what we're creating in JavaScript? Nein.</span> <span data-start="167.56" data-end="174.82">I think this preference million is often violated. Are many things which are actually disconnecting</span> <span data-start="174.82" data-end="180.44">us from our creative process.</span> <span data-start="180.44" data-end="184.52">Setting up development environments is a pain in the ass.</span> <span data-start="184.52" data-end="187.38">Here's a tweet.</span> <span data-start="187.38" data-end="192.07">If you set up your development environment yourself, and if you can't tear it down and</span> <span data-start="192.07" data-end="195.37">recreate it in one command you are coding in prototype.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="195.37" data-end="197.59">I think Jessica makes an important point here.</span> <span data-start="197.59" data-end="206.62">Jo hulledn't have to copy paste or overflow answers with the highest vote rating or whatever,</span> <span data-start="206.62" data-end="208.39">or Blog posts.</span> <span data-start="208.39" data-end="212.31">All of this stuff really must be automated.</span> <span data-start="212.31" data-end="218.46">But, even if you're using something like Vagrant, it's going to take time until your environment</span> <span data-start="218.46" data-end="220.94">is set up.</span> <span data-start="220.94" data-end="225.66">Alas, we're not done with waiting for things.</span> <span data-start="225.66" data-end="234.51">Another thing we wait for is long running tests or MPM install or deployments to servers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="234.51" data-end="240.32">Like for example when a test run takes more than a few minutes, I can't do anything during</span> <span data-start="240.32" data-end="243.43">that time that changes it's outcome.</span> <span data-start="243.43" data-end="250.51">I'm forced to work on something else and when I get back to the test result, when it's done,</span> <span data-start="250.51" data-end="255.51">my mind will have lost all context.</span> <span data-start="255.51" data-end="261.78">Another disconnect is managing package deopinion den say and releasing packages.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="261.78" data-end="267.24">We depend on packages also on NPM and GitHub and other places, where it gets really fun</span> <span data-start="267.24" data-end="272.819">is when you're publishing your own packages there, coordinating between these different</span> <span data-start="272.819" data-end="278.79">services is difficult and you will make mistakes unless you're very careful.</span> <span data-start="278.79" data-end="286.7">For example it's possible you mixed up version numbers between NPM and GitHub.</span> <span data-start="286.7" data-end="292.51">There's even more to fix like randomly occurring CIRs, test timeouts or third party failures,.</span> <span data-start="292.51" data-end="297.9">Here's a tweet that sums it up nicely, I think.</span> <span data-start="297.9" data-end="302.47">Programming is the act officiousing one error so you may proceed to the next error, by Michael</span> <span data-start="302.47" data-end="304.6">Fogus.</span> <span data-start="304.6" data-end="309.68">It's Ironic and probably true.</span> <span data-start="309.68" data-end="322.78">This is wanders above the sea of flog by Fredirich.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="322.78" data-end="328.97">Pictures have different interpretations just like JavaScript syntax rules.</span> <span data-start="328.97" data-end="335.58">John Gaddis an American historian felt that the character of a wanderer is contradictory,</span> <span data-start="335.58" data-end="342.28">suggesting mastery over landscape at the same time the insignificance of the individual</span> <span data-start="342.28" data-end="345.2">within it.</span> <span data-start="345.2" data-end="352.639">Computers are insanely powerful, but, still we can realize the full potential of our ideas.</span> <span data-start="352.639" data-end="359.23">Maybe we are the wanderer above the sea of computation.</span> <span data-start="359.23" data-end="363.8">We like to look at terminal windows or at least we think we do.</span> <span data-start="363.8" data-end="369.17">It is certainly part of our identity.</span> <span data-start="369.17" data-end="376.08">The text displayed to us offer abstract descriptions of what's going on.</span> <span data-start="376.08" data-end="385.49">It alerts us of problems and eventually will always ask us what we want to do next.</span> <span data-start="385.49" data-end="390.86">So while the terminal is a great interface, I think we're too often doing things that</span> <span data-start="390.86" data-end="392.52">the computer is better at.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="392.52" data-end="397.21">We suck at playing computer.</span> <span data-start="397.21" data-end="403.16">So,\h‑‑ Ooops.</span> <span data-start="403.16" data-end="406.14">Sorry.</span> <span data-start="406.14" data-end="417.49">Befehlsze Ilenbeklemmung, having forgotteden what you want to enter into the command prompt.</span> <span data-start="417.49" data-end="420.919">The terminal interfaces we use are well designed.</span> <span data-start="420.919" data-end="424.419">That's because most of them are four years old.</span> <span data-start="424.419" data-end="430.93">But that's not the problem, what\h‑‑ because we can imitate great examples from the past.</span> <span data-start="430.93" data-end="435.13">What matters is that I want to work with people who aren't programmers.</span> <span data-start="435.13" data-end="441.81">I also want to teach people and seriously get them started with programming.</span> <span data-start="441.81" data-end="447.65">I don't want to tell them what they're supposed enter into their terminal when stuff goes</span> <span data-start="447.65" data-end="450">wrong.</span> <span data-start="450" data-end="454.31">And the same is true in my job where people are using my tool automation.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="454.31" data-end="460.71">If your process is sufficiently complex you need to automate it.</span> <span data-start="460.71" data-end="471.86">Browserliebe, browser love sharing, sharing an internet address lovingly for browser consumption.</span> <span data-start="471.86" data-end="477.87">Browsers are powerful,both as instruments of media consumption like looking at cat pictures</span> <span data-start="477.87" data-end="484.26">and it's instruments of creation, you're also read so the demo I'm going to show you later</span> <span data-start="484.26" data-end="491.33">is browser‑based, I wanted to build something that I can share immediately.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="491.33" data-end="496.669">There is no read me with a pattern of commands or please download this and install that instructions.</span> <span data-start="496.669" data-end="498.58">It just works.</span> <span data-start="498.58" data-end="499.669">Hopefully.</span> <span data-start="499.669" data-end="501.71">Because it's a live coding demo.</span> <span data-start="501.71" data-end="508.86">So, let's look at a couple of problem areas, I'll focus on dependency management and building</span> <span data-start="508.86" data-end="510.68">in today.</span> <span data-start="510.68" data-end="518.589">So, what does depend mean? It means that code that we write depends on a stack of things</span> <span data-start="518.589" data-end="525.99">working properly, which is the hardware, and the operating system no J S or browsers or</span> <span data-start="525.99" data-end="527.529">dependencies we use.</span> <span data-start="527.529" data-end="534.74">So as an example let's assume we have a Mac with node installed and let's build a package.</span> <span data-start="534.74" data-end="539.38">So, I don't know about you but I had a fantastic breakfast this morning, let's write a module</span> <span data-start="539.38" data-end="542.5">for making pancakes.</span> <span data-start="542.5" data-end="550.52">So, usually I search for modules that I can use, so let's to search.com and look for things</span> <span data-start="550.52" data-end="555.73">that we can use\h‑‑ NPM search.com.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="555.73" data-end="558.87">There's NPM.org search.</span> <span data-start="558.87" data-end="561.79">I usually get this.</span> <span data-start="561.79" data-end="565.3">I don't even understand it.</span> <span data-start="565.3" data-end="566.3">Well, I do, but ..</span> <span data-start="566.3" data-end="572.177">so, then we found our packages and I need to itch stall these packages, so I switch</span> <span data-start="572.177" data-end="577.35">to\h‑‑ and we need to install these packages, so I as much to terminal and install the commands</span> <span data-start="577.35" data-end="580.32">for the packages I found.</span> <span data-start="580.32" data-end="588.13">Next, well, what next\h‑‑ wait for a few seconds or minutes depending on what it's</span> <span data-start="588.13" data-end="596.75">going to download, and after that I open my file from the terminal.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="596.75" data-end="598.99">And finally we're in the code.</span> <span data-start="598.99" data-end="605.37">In my editor like ten minutes later, I begin by requiring the modules I installed just</span> <span data-start="605.37" data-end="608.48">before.</span> <span data-start="608.48" data-end="613.68">And then I can write my function making use of the modules I found.</span> <span data-start="613.68" data-end="615.99">We'll do this in a demo.</span> <span data-start="615.99" data-end="623.16">At last I explore my bacon pancake factory function, we need to be a proper module citizen,</span> <span data-start="623.16" data-end="627.95">then I go back to step one and two to find and intell a suit suitable testing framework.</span> <span data-start="627.95" data-end="638.38">I go back to\h‑‑ create a file that puts the tests, sorry, create a file to put the</span> <span data-start="638.38" data-end="643.931">test for our module N the test we're going to require a test framework and our own module</span> <span data-start="643.931" data-end="652.61">and finally write our test Phew! So, I don't know about you, but, this is really complicated,</span> <span data-start="652.61" data-end="656.16">this really sucks when you're maintaining many small modules you have to do all most</span> <span data-start="656.16" data-end="660.07">all of this by hand and many, many times.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="660.07" data-end="663.01">And it's incredibly easy to make mistakes.</span> <span data-start="663.01" data-end="669.29">Of it also gets very repetitive for files within the same package, for example, when</span> <span data-start="669.29" data-end="674.6">you're building a react up with nicely separated components in their own modules you'll have</span> <span data-start="674.6" data-end="678.3">to require react in every single file.</span> <span data-start="678.3" data-end="685.9">As programmers, seeing the same block of code usually makes us forthing with rage! That's</span> <span data-start="685.9" data-end="691.649">not Dry! But in case we accept our reality.</span> <span data-start="691.649" data-end="693.32">Weird isn't it.</span> <span data-start="693.32" data-end="704.399">Of so what if we went back to here and we remove everything that isn't our code? If</span> <span data-start="704.399" data-end="708.78">of we're left with function declaration.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="708.78" data-end="714.16">It's calling pancakes and bacon and it's passing an array of results into fry.</span> <span data-start="714.16" data-end="722.2">What if we just tried to run this now? We better reports that some words are not defined\h‑‑</span> <span data-start="722.2" data-end="729.09">well, of course, you might think, but think for a moment, these are words that have meaning</span> <span data-start="729.09" data-end="730.37">for us.</span> <span data-start="730.37" data-end="734.56">We know that they exist, somewhere, and we know what they're supposed to do, we have</span> <span data-start="734.56" data-end="742.48">expectations if we understand them, why can't the computer? So, to help the computer to</span> <span data-start="742.48" data-end="747.42">understand, let's look at how the computer sees code.</span> <span data-start="747.42" data-end="752.8">This large blob of text is the abtract industry and you don't need to read it.</span> <span data-start="752.8" data-end="761.64">So, we search the DAC for words or in terms of\h‑‑ identifier nodes.</span> <span data-start="761.64" data-end="765.92">And each time we find an identifier we check to see if it's been defind anywhere in our</span> <span data-start="765.92" data-end="767.95">file.</span> <span data-start="767.95" data-end="775.37">And since they're not defined in this case, we get a list of these three identifiers.</span> <span data-start="775.37" data-end="778.399">Which is what we saw before.</span> <span data-start="778.399" data-end="788.73">So, we have our unknown identifiers, and we match these against our known words.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="788.73" data-end="793.92">What are known words? They're things we remember.</span> <span data-start="793.92" data-end="797.43">They're modules we've written ourselves.</span> <span data-start="797.43" data-end="803.41">They're modules like\h‑‑ there are modules on NPM like redact or load ash, or there are</span> <span data-start="803.41" data-end="809.75">modules like note build like HTTP or FS.</span> <span data-start="809.75" data-end="817.5">Well, it turns out that a simple functional transformation of your code and a prediction</span> <span data-start="817.5" data-end="824.98">of words that you're referred to yield the expended code that you can run, and pass into</span> <span data-start="824.98" data-end="835.14">note\h‑‑ and it works, prepending the appropriate required calls and exporting your</span> <span data-start="835.14" data-end="839.31">main module, we'll see that in a bit.</span> <span data-start="839.31" data-end="844.42">So, and that means that a series of manual commands that you have to enter into terminal</span> <span data-start="844.42" data-end="850.25">and editor can be expressed by just mentioning a word.</span> <span data-start="850.25" data-end="854.98">I think that's a pretty powerful idea.</span> <span data-start="854.98" data-end="859.29">So before we go to the demo ..</span> <span data-start="859.29" data-end="861.93">I want to talk about building stuff.</span> <span data-start="861.93" data-end="869.75">So, what does build mean in our context? It means taking our source and our dependencies</span> <span data-start="869.75" data-end="875.35">and creating something that can be executed by node or a web browser.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="875.35" data-end="879.24">Docker is an amazing tool, we're going to use it as a very efficient build system and</span> <span data-start="879.24" data-end="887.86">"runtime" you can post a\h‑‑ archive of your code and dependency to a docker DBHM</span> <span data-start="887.86" data-end="893.769">point and it will extract the archive and build our package running any commands we</span> <span data-start="893.769" data-end="895.57">tell it to.</span> <span data-start="895.57" data-end="899.779">And in the end, it will spit out a nice little contain their can be run on any other docker</span> <span data-start="899.779" data-end="901.29">host.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="901.29" data-end="906.12">That means we can run this container on our local development environment, but also on</span> <span data-start="906.12" data-end="912.12">a core OS cluster of thousands of nodes.</span> <span data-start="912.12" data-end="916.99">At the end of the word look up face we end up with a dependency tree.</span> <span data-start="916.99" data-end="922.95">Sort of like an MPM shrink up file that includes everything required to install something.</span> <span data-start="922.95" data-end="924.19">Okay.</span> <span data-start="924.19" data-end="926.66">Demo time.</span> <span data-start="926.66" data-end="938.98">So, FN, F 1\h‑‑ thank you Jan that didn't work (FN + F 1).</span> <span data-start="938.98" data-end="944.42"Audience member: Try it now. >> Command ..</span> <span data-start="944.42" data-end="951.709">yes! Are you seeing what I'm seeing? I think so.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="951.709" data-end="956.92">So, this is my prototype editor.</span> <span data-start="956.92" data-end="961.63">So we go in here and we have a name and we have a description\h‑‑ hold on.</span> <span data-start="961.63" data-end="970.259">6 (Making pang cakes that's what it's going to make, pancake pancake (Singing).</span> <span data-start="970.259" data-end="973.63"Audience member: Can someone come up here and dance please.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="973.63" data-end="979.29">So, this is probably something went wrong here because this function is returning a</span> <span data-start="979.29" data-end="981.44">German sausage specialality.</span> <span data-start="981.44" data-end="990.01">So, let's just, you know, turn this into something which we want so making bacon pancakes means</span> <span data-start="990.01" data-end="993.389">frying bacon and pancakes.</span> <span data-start="993.389" data-end="996.82">And let's remove this comment.</span> <span data-start="996.82" data-end="1005.35">So we have used these words and our editor knows that these are not defined yet, so we</span> <span data-start="1005.35" data-end="1015.02">go in here in to bacon andism me meant this function and we go back and it's defined.</span> <span data-start="1015.02" data-end="1016.3">Magic.</span> <span data-start="1016.3" data-end="1023.02">And liquid kind of magic and we go to pancakes and we return pancakes.</span> <span data-start="1023.02" data-end="1028.339">Go back again, another function defined and there's one more left, which is frying, so</span> <span data-start="1028.339" data-end="1036.5">frying means making a set of items hot, so we take the items, we want to cook, and we</span> <span data-start="1036.5" data-end="1039">join them in a string.</span> <span data-start="1039" data-end="1040.41">Okay.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1040.41" data-end="1041.41">So ..</span> <span data-start="1041.41" data-end="1047.799">we go back once more and we have a program which the computer is, fully able to understand</span> <span data-start="1047.799" data-end="1051.4">and knows everything we're using in our program.</span> <span data-start="1051.4" data-end="1055">But, we're not calling this function yet.</span> <span data-start="1055" data-end="1058.25">Let's create a command line interface for this.</span> <span data-start="1058.25" data-end="1060.179">Okay, so ..</span> <span data-start="1060.179" data-end="1065.309">we're going to build the JS Con of breakfast modeling interface.</span> <span data-start="1065.309" data-end="1069.36">So, it's a new module.</span> <span data-start="1069.36" data-end="1082.299">And we are going to just\h‑‑ log\h‑‑ so we call our make bacon pancakes function</span> <span data-start="1082.299" data-end="1087.08">and we also call the function we just defined in our program.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1087.08" data-end="1089.81">Makes sense? Okay.</span> <span data-start="1089.81" data-end="1092.53">So, here comes the docker part.</span> <span data-start="1092.53" data-end="1103.26">When I click "engage" this dependency tree, which has been generated is going to be turned</span> <span data-start="1103.26" data-end="1109.4">into a jarble archive and posted to the docker Daem no which will turn it into a nice image</span> <span data-start="1109.4" data-end="1112.33">we can execute.</span> <span data-start="1112.33" data-end="1120.45">This is the name of the image, let's go to my terminal and rune run it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1120.45" data-end="1136.08">Works (Applause) so, let's go into the docker container and run bash.</span> <span data-start="1136.08" data-end="1139.32">Free docker tutorial.</span> <span data-start="1139.32" data-end="1146.47">So here we have index such as, which is\h‑‑ which has a required statement, we have to</span> <span data-start="1146.47" data-end="1153.169">recall it typed into our editor and exporting this thing as a module.</span> <span data-start="1153.169" data-end="1159.13">And we also have\h‑‑ sorry, we also have node modules with the function we referenced</span> <span data-start="1159.13" data-end="1166.48">and there's another index of JS in here, which is our making bacon pancake function, it is</span> <span data-start="1166.48" data-end="1175">also requiring stuff this is probably very obvious by now but, there's even more modules,</span> <span data-start="1175" data-end="1176">right.</span> <span data-start="1176" data-end="1182.69">And it's like bacon for example also as an J S file and it's returning a string bacon</span> <span data-start="1182.69" data-end="1184.61">and exporting itself.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1184.61" data-end="1192.25">So, we turned this very simple to understand, I would say, representation of a module hierarchy</span> <span data-start="1192.25" data-end="1196.58">into something very obvious.</span> <span data-start="1196.58" data-end="1203.919">So, the next step is kind of, you know, let's go out of this container again, and just run</span> <span data-start="1203.919" data-end="1210.92">it again, and I think this is a very sorry amount of bacon pancakes for JSConf 2014,</span> <span data-start="1210.92" data-end="1217.21">so let's go back and, you know, we could just do this.</span> <span data-start="1217.21" data-end="1223.69">(Laughing) run it multiple times and engage, again.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1223.69" data-end="1230.66">Write and run it, but it's not very exciting, so I know a function on NPM which does this</span> <span data-start="1230.66" data-end="1239.34">much Bert than I could do, so, not only does our editor know words from our own creations,</span> <span data-start="1239.34" data-end="1250.87">it also knows all the words which exit on NPM so I can just reference load Ash and tell</span> <span data-start="1250.87" data-end="1260.57">it to run 20 times, if works as expected, click on this, it will open loadash on NPM</span> <span data-start="1260.57" data-end="1270.78">that's what I was referencing, so we build this again (Lodash) and I run it again and</span> <span data-start="1270.78" data-end="1274.679">it works.</span> <span data-start="1274.679" data-end="1286.21">(Applause) so, let's descend into the madness of the container once more.</span> <span data-start="1286.21" data-end="1297.29">This time my node modules had Lodash, it does exactly what you would do if you wanted to</span> <span data-start="1297.29" data-end="1300.169">install Lodash, it installs it.</span> <span data-start="1300.169" data-end="1306.7">(Chuckles from the audience) so ..</span> <span data-start="1306.7" data-end="1309.79">I would say one more thing, but it's not really that special any way.</span> <span data-start="1309.79" data-end="1316.53">One more thing, we created a CLI from our make bacon pancakes, this is saw some, let's</span> <span data-start="1316.53" data-end="1320.43">make them pancakes with maple syrup.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1320.43" data-end="1321.5">Ummmm fantastic.</span> <span data-start="1321.5" data-end="1328.27">Let's go back and recompile whatever our CLI.</span> <span data-start="1328.27" data-end="1330.18">And run it again.</span> <span data-start="1330.18" data-end="1331.73">Sorry.</span> <span data-start="1331.73" data-end="1336.57">And we have maple syrup, it's really, I want to change something off this program, I just</span> <span data-start="1336.57" data-end="1344.26">do it, run it again and it works, I don't have to bump dependencies or Synlink or whatever.</span> <span data-start="1344.26" data-end="1349.7">\h‑‑ Symlink\h‑‑ or whatever.</span> <span data-start="1349.7" data-end="1357.07">We could also turn this function into an API, right, let's say we have the breakfast server,</span> <span data-start="1357.07" data-end="1361.48">API,\h‑‑ sorry.</span> <span data-start="1361.48" data-end="1371.14">Bacon pancake API, and, in here, we oar just going to do the hello world example so we</span> <span data-start="1371.14" data-end="1378.57">create a server and the computer is smart because it knows suddenly what you already</span> <span data-start="1378.57" data-end="1386.69">knew that HTTP is of course the built‑in HTTP module node J S, so we're going to answer</span> <span data-start="1386.69" data-end="1391.6">this request with a response and of course, we're going to make bacon pancakes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1391.6" data-end="1405.38">And it works, so we call this function and we listen to a port and for convenience reasons</span> <span data-start="1405.38" data-end="1413.44">we're also going to add a log line.</span> <span data-start="1413.44" data-end="1418.11">\h‑‑ what's the magic.P address, I don't know, let's copy paste it.</span> <span data-start="1418.11" data-end="1422.56">Okay this is the IP address of the docker Daemon.</span> <span data-start="1422.56" data-end="1434.79">Right, so we built this and there's some amazing docker output.</span> <span data-start="1434.79" data-end="1436.49">And we run this ..</span> <span data-start="1436.49" data-end="1441.02">what was the name?
