<p><span data-start="15.11" data-end="21.89">I would like to introduce the lovely members of the TC39 who are joining us today to answer</span> <span data-start="21.89" data-end="24.16">questions.</span> <span data-start="24.16" data-end="28.13">It would be great if you could each introduce yourselves and mention who you're representing</span> <span data-start="28.13" data-end="30.82">on the TC TC.</span> <span data-start="30.82" data-end="33.54"Audience member: I work on V8 at Google.</span> <span data-start="33.54" data-end="37.98"Audience member: I'm Aki, and I work at PayPal.</span> <span data-start="37.98" data-end="41.31">I work for Google and one of the core contributors to Babel.</span> <span data-start="41.31" data-end="46.09"Audience member: I'm Keith, and I work for GitHub.</span> <span data-start="46.09" data-end="49.93"Audience member: I work at Google.</span> <span data-start="49.93" data-end="55.24"Audience member: I'm Lynn Clark, I work at Mozilla.</span> <span data-start="55.24" data-end="57.64"Audience member: .. work at blood glucose berg.</span> <span data-start="57.64" data-end="59.41"Audience member: Also at Mozilla.</span> <span data-start="59.41" data-end="67.68"Audience member: I'm Leo, I work at Buku and .. . >> Now, we've got a lot of really task people</span> <span data-start="67.68" data-end="73.1">representing a diverse number of companies and groups, but, in fact, there are more people</span> <span data-start="73.1" data-end="74.1">here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="74.1" data-end="75.1">They're among you.</span> <span data-start="75.1" data-end="77.28">We have a number of TC39 members who are not on stage.</span> <span data-start="77.28" data-end="81.21">If they could stand up and wave hello?</span> <span data-start="81.21" data-end="83.54">Yes.</span> <span data-start="83.54" data-end="89.62">So be if we don't manage to get to your question, please come and see us after this panel, and</span> <span data-start="89.62" data-end="90.62">we would love to talk to you.</span> <span data-start="90.62" data-end="95.06">We will be hanging around the community lounge just behind the Google booth.</span> <span data-start="95.06" data-end="96.68">Everyone knows where it is.</span> <span data-start="96.68" data-end="100.71">Come and say hi.</span> <span data-start="100.71" data-end="109.24">I'm going to start with a question that the JSConf EU team had for us which is date.parse.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="109.24" data-end="115.15">They had an issue with the website in that iOS wouldn't volume down to the right spot,</span> <span data-start="115.15" data-end="117.92">and the question is: date.parse, who did it wrong?</span> <span data-start="117.92" data-end="119.67">V8 or Chrome?</span> <span data-start="119.67" data-end="122.85"Audience member: I can take that one.</span> <span data-start="122.85" data-end="127.25">So I encourage everyone in the room to go to their DevTools console after this talk</span> <span data-start="127.25" data-end="130.929">and try out date.parse 1 octopus 2018.</span> <span data-start="130.929" data-end="137.09">It works in Chrome, it works in JSC and Safari and nowhere else.</span> <span data-start="137.09" data-end="140.78">It turns out based on the spec, everyone is right.</span> <span data-start="140.78" data-end="144.09">There are certain date formats guaranteed to work according to all browsers according</span> <span data-start="144.09" data-end="152.769">to the spec at least, but when the format is not matched, it's up to the implementation.</span> <span data-start="152.769" data-end="159.149">Others still try to parse the date.</span> <span data-start="159.149" data-end="160.84"Audience member: Let's talk about what we are doing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="160.84" data-end="167.379">Mathias gave us a great explanation about what the spec is.</span> <span data-start="167.379" data-end="172.819">It's not an implementation but it tells us how to implement a JavaScript engine.</span> <span data-start="172.819" data-end="182.799">Let's just talk about what the TC39 is, and what the process is and how it works?</span> <span data-start="182.799" data-end="184.129"Audience member: No!</span> <span data-start="184.129" data-end="185.459">[Laughter].</span> <span data-start="185.459" data-end="194.83"Audience member: I will start with a TC39 works and let someone else explain the stages of the process.</span> <span data-start="194.83" data-end="200.739">We are a committee of delegates who are representing members in .. international.</span> <span data-start="200.739" data-end="206.889">We get together every two months, and we usually meet for three days.</span> <span data-start="206.889" data-end="212.859">We discuss what proposals are up, we talk about the impact of the language, we discuss</span> <span data-start="212.859" data-end="220.669">what changes need to be made, and we operate on consensus, which means that we all have</span> <span data-start="220.669" data-end="225.579">to agree for something to move forward, which is pretty unique in programming language standards.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="225.579" data-end="231.049">So, that's kind of like the basic gist of what TC39 is and does.</span> <span data-start="231.049" data-end="233.889">Does anybody else want to go through the proposal process?</span> <span data-start="233.889" data-end="237.98"Audience member: Sure, there are four stages.</span> <span data-start="237.98" data-end="243.09">Stage 0 is like a pseudo stage that is a proposal exists.</span> <span data-start="243.09" data-end="249.799">Stage 1 is that the committee has considered that this is a problem space that we want</span> <span data-start="249.799" data-end="253.089">to continue to explore, and find a solution for.</span> <span data-start="253.089" data-end="260.43">Stage 2 is that there is a draft specification, so there is some spec text that identifies</span> <span data-start="260.43" data-end="263.52">what the behaviour should be.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="263.52" data-end="270.09">Stage 3 says that there is — there should be significant in the field implementations,</span> <span data-start="270.09" data-end="274.76">in other words, some browsers or other engines should have implemented this feature, and</span> <span data-start="274.76" data-end="279.1">stage 4 means it's ready to land in the spec.</span> <span data-start="279.1" data-end="287.2">Every year, we make a cut of the stage 4 features that are — I think it's somewhere around</span> <span data-start="287.2" data-end="301.99">March, and, by around June time, that's [sound feed distorted] .</span> <span data-start="301.99" data-end="312.34"Audience member: I think it's important to mention that the meetings happen every two maps, it happens</span> <span data-start="312.34" data-end="320.07">where we discuss, like, — every to months, consensus taking stuff, but actual conversation</span> <span data-start="320.07" data-end="325.93">about how it should be written happens all the time.</span> <span data-start="325.93" data-end="331.43">This is not like every two months, we pick up, "Two months ago, where did we leave off?"</span> <span data-start="331.43" data-end="332.43">It's not.</span> <span data-start="332.43" data-end="338.62">It's usually, the meetings that we have are more like this is what has been happening</span> <span data-start="338.62" data-end="342.46">on GitHub on the TC39 organisation for two months.</span> <span data-start="342.46" data-end="345.979">Let's decide on how to move forward.</span> <span data-start="345.979" data-end="347.26"Audience member: Great.</span> <span data-start="347.26" data-end="351.97">We had a couple of community questions about how the speccing process works.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="351.97" data-end="355.3">One person asked: is JavaScript evolving at the right speed?</span> <span data-start="355.3" data-end="361.34">Are you in features being sufficiently integrated with other new and existing features?</span> <span data-start="361.34" data-end="362.48"Audience member: Yes.</span> <span data-start="362.48" data-end="363.62">[Laughter].</span> <span data-start="363.62" data-end="374.95"Audience member: I think one proposal that might be a great one to illustrate is is the clasp proposal.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="374.95" data-end="379.12">One person asked: what is going on with the private method?</span> <span data-start="379.12" data-end="383.3">We've got the hash sign which is used to express private.</span> <span data-start="383.3" data-end="385">Most use the private key word.</span> <span data-start="385" data-end="388.63">How did we come up to the paint that we're using the hash sign?</span> <span data-start="388.63" data-end="396.3"Audience member: There is private access which allows you to get the private property off an object.</span> <span data-start="396.3" data-end="398.64">There is the private declaration.</span> <span data-start="398.64" data-end="402.89">The reason we came upon this decision is because every other language that has private is also</span> <span data-start="402.89" data-end="404.32">statically typed.</span> <span data-start="404.32" data-end="410.26">You can figure out exactly what the property is based on the object it is being called</span> <span data-start="410.26" data-end="411.26">on.</span> <span data-start="411.26" data-end="412.73">For JavaScript, we don't have that.</span> <span data-start="412.73" data-end="415">There's no way of knowing what the object is.</span> <span data-start="415" data-end="421.26">Whether it's supposed to be a private or public property, based on the base reference, that</span> <span data-start="421.26" data-end="425.18">this dot object dot whatever.</span> <span data-start="425.18" data-end="430.6">So we have to have a different sidual to distinguish between private and property access.</span> <span data-start="430.6" data-end="437.911">That's how we came on the dot hash, whatever the name is, to access the properties.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="437.911" data-end="445.45">To mirror access, we decided that the declaration should also include the hash symbol.</span> <span data-start="445.45" data-end="452.42">It makes it clear up front that this is the part of the name that the way that you access</span> <span data-start="452.42" data-end="455.44">it is that you pretend that the hash is part of the name.</span> <span data-start="455.44" data-end="457.87">So, if it is hash pro.</span> <span data-start="457.87" data-end="461.64">You access it by this hash prop.</span> <span data-start="461.64" data-end="469.16">You think of it that the hash is the name, not the signatures, the private modifier key,</span> <span data-start="469.16" data-end="470.8">or anything else.</span> <span data-start="470.8" data-end="472.03"Audience member: Nice.</span> <span data-start="472.03" data-end="477.2">The private class field was being proposed as a single proposal.</span> <span data-start="477.2" data-end="480.74">However, there were several other class-related proposals that were being proposed at the</span> <span data-start="480.74" data-end="483.28">same time such as public fields.</span> <span data-start="483.28" data-end="487.46">How was the communication across those proposals?</span> <span data-start="487.46" data-end="491.56"Audience member: We do a lot of work to make sure these two features are synchronised.</span> <span data-start="491.56" data-end="497.87">We actually split them and then merged them, and split them again between public and private,</span> <span data-start="497.87" data-end="500.33">and instant, and static properties.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="500.33" data-end="506.28">Just trying to figure out all of the different issues that could have happened with either</span> <span data-start="506.28" data-end="507.28">of them.</span> <span data-start="507.28" data-end="512.75">Then once we settled upon the semantics that we were happy with, we merged them all again.</span> <span data-start="512.75" data-end="514.169"Audience member: Awesome.</span> <span data-start="514.169" data-end="518.459">I think a natural question that would follow this, is we've got this hash symbol now, this</span> <span data-start="518.459" data-end="523.669">could be confusing to newcomers, and another person has asked us over Twitter: with these</span> <span data-start="523.669" data-end="528.269">new operators and features being added to JavaScript, are we at risk of becoming too</span> <span data-start="528.269" data-end="531.48">cryptic syntax-wise for new developers.</span> <span data-start="531.48" data-end="536.829">I'm very much in favour of them but web development it being approachable is a big boon.</span> <span data-start="536.829" data-end="542.809"Audience member: I guess you could say, it's something that comes up in the meetings.</span> <span data-start="542.809" data-end="547.47">It's referred to as the syntax budget, is a there is only so much syntax you can add</span> <span data-start="547.47" data-end="552.07">to a language before it becomes ASCII gibberish.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="552.07" data-end="558.66">So it is very much a concern, and everybody pays a lot of attention to it, and we try</span> <span data-start="558.66" data-end="562.18">to make all of these proposals fit together as a whole.</span> <span data-start="562.18" data-end="567.76"Audience member: This is why syntax proposals are different from new API methods, like array proto-phenotype</span> <span data-start="567.76" data-end="573.559">or something like — prototype, or you caning loo up to how to call a method on an array.</span> <span data-start="573.559" data-end="579.62">When there is a new somebody tax, that produces a burden on the developers to recognise the</span> <span data-start="579.62" data-end="582.209">new syntax and its meanings.</span> <span data-start="582.209" data-end="588.07">Syntax is more complicated to learn as a newcomer than it is to call another method.</span> <span data-start="588.07" data-end="592.819"Audience member: Maybe this is also a good point for another note on the process.</span> <span data-start="592.819" data-end="598.639">One thing we are trying as a middle ground between design by committee, either achieving</span> <span data-start="598.639" data-end="606.35">nothing, because in constant deadlock, or I get my feature in, and you get yours, we</span> <span data-start="606.35" data-end="612.709">get this explosion of features that nobody really needs, we have the so-called champions'</span> <span data-start="612.709" data-end="613.709">model.</span> <span data-start="613.709" data-end="621.68">Our proposals have one or more champions who work on really developing the feature, and</span> <span data-start="621.68" data-end="628.41">present it to the committee, and by and large, the committee overall does not do the design.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="628.41" data-end="635.23">It needs to achieve consensus, but it is not like all everybody gets to chime in and say,</span> <span data-start="635.23" data-end="640.869">"I want this tweak in, and this syntax should be slightly different," and then I'm happy.</span> <span data-start="640.869" data-end="649.85">In practice, that works out fairly well to achieve a manageable complexity budget.</span> <span data-start="649.85" data-end="654.089"Audience member: Another question that is going around like the general development of how JavaScript</span> <span data-start="654.089" data-end="659.67">is designed is a question around what is JavaScript's identity?</span> <span data-start="659.67" data-end="666.069">Are we moving towards other non-strongly typed project language, like object-orientated concepts</span> <span data-start="666.069" data-end="670.62">like ES6 classes, or more functional?</span> <span data-start="670.62" data-end="676.19">This is tied to where are we going as a goal in JavaScript?</span> <span data-start="676.19" data-end="681.399">What are we aiming for?</span> <span data-start="681.399" data-end="688.959"Audience member: I think — I believe JavaScript has a very strong notation on all the behaviours</span> <span data-start="688.959" data-end="695.92">it does around the types that are well defined in JavaScript, but I think being a dynamic-type</span> <span data-start="695.92" data-end="699.899">language, it is one of the highlights of JavaScript itself.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="699.899" data-end="707.18">I don't see this thing happening for now; I don't expect this to happen in TC39.</span> <span data-start="707.18" data-end="713.47">I think it's a highlight, and we should consider all the advantages from using a dynamic language,</span> <span data-start="713.47" data-end="715.329">and a type language.</span> <span data-start="715.329" data-end="721.089">Both are fine, but we're on the right place here.</span> <span data-start="721.089" data-end="726.879"Audience member: I also think that this is just to some extent a false distinction.</span> </p>
