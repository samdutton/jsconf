<p><span data-start="83.189" data-end="84.99">Java whatever you do in the backend</span> <span data-start="84.99" data-end="87.479">that's just one team that develops this</span> <span data-start="87.479" data-end="90.42">application at some point someone might</span> <span data-start="90.42" data-end="91.59">have realized ok the team is getting</span> <span data-start="91.59" data-end="93.869">bigger and structuring it as one team</span> <span data-start="93.869" data-end="95.31">and one application doesn't really work</span> <span data-start="95.31" data-end="97.92">out so well so people start to split it</span> <span data-start="97.92" data-end="100.259">up and the easiest way and the most</span> <span data-start="100.259" data-end="102.689">obvious way to structure or just split</span> <span data-start="102.689" data-end="104.52">up a development team is to realize okay</span> <span data-start="104.52" data-end="106.59">we have back-end developers we have</span> <span data-start="106.59" data-end="108.6">front-end developers let's make it back</span> <span data-start="108.6" data-end="110.34">and team in a front-end team who of you</span> <span data-start="110.34" data-end="115.229">is working in this team setting it's the</span> <span data-start="115.229" data-end="119.939">most ok interesting at some point some</span> <span data-start="119.939" data-end="121.979">of the back-end problems might become</span> <span data-start="121.979" data-end="123.93">bigger and the back-end team quite often</span> <span data-start="123.93" data-end="125.7">becomes the bigger team and at someone</span> <span data-start="125.7" data-end="128.099">you have like 500 developers and 25</span> <span data-start="128.099" data-end="129.78">back-end developers and then you realize</span> <span data-start="129.78" data-end="131.76">them again we're having a team of 25</span> <span data-start="131.76" data-end="133.77">people and that doesn't scale so</span> <span data-start="133.77" data-end="135.48">you start to split up the back end and</span> <span data-start="135.48" data-end="137.04">there's this microservice thing that</span> <span data-start="137.04" data-end="138.72">people have been doing for ages now or</span> <span data-start="138.72" data-end="140.25">even before that they call it</span> <span data-start="140.25" data-end="141.99">service-oriented architecture and that</span> <span data-start="141.99" data-end="144.42">was basically the same but hmm okay so</span> <span data-start="144.42" data-end="146.43">this is a very very naive approach to</span> <span data-start="146.43" data-end="147.78">say okay the back-end team becomes</span> <span data-start="147.78" data-end="153.18">bigger so let's split it up but I don't</span> <span data-start="153.18" data-end="155.7">know if you know the year but it's 2018</span> <span data-start="155.7" data-end="157.41">and maybe we're having a front-end</span> <span data-start="157.41" data-end="158.73">application that requires more than</span> <span data-start="158.73" data-end="161.28">three or five developers but maybe we</span> <span data-start="161.28" data-end="163.11">have a front-end team of like 20</span> <span data-start="163.11" data-end="165.63">developers or maybe we've heard of the</span> <span data-start="165.63" data-end="167.61">term that was called cross-functional</span> <span data-start="167.61" data-end="169.98">teams where we say we should not split</span> <span data-start="169.98" data-end="171.3">up the team and a product management</span> <span data-start="171.3" data-end="173.61">team and a designer team in a front-end</span> <span data-start="173.61" data-end="174.99">team and a back-end team but instead</span> <span data-start="174.99" data-end="177.39">have a team for every part of our</span> <span data-start="177.39" data-end="178.65">application for every part of our</span> <span data-start="178.65" data-end="182.31">business domain and that's why in some</span> <span data-start="182.31" data-end="186.12">at some point people started to use a</span> <span data-start="186.12" data-end="187.98">different approach this is sometimes</span> <span data-start="187.98" data-end="190.22">referred to as self-contained systems</span> <span data-start="190.22" data-end="192.63">which comes from the DDD world</span> <span data-start="192.63" data-end="194.34">never mind that part but the approach</span> <span data-start="194.34" data-end="197.07">here is to say okay we have a team for</span> <span data-start="197.07" data-end="198.48">instance if we were talking about a web</span> <span data-start="198.48" data-end="201">shop team inspire they are responsible</span> <span data-start="201" data-end="203.07">for suggestions of new products we have</span> <span data-start="203.07" data-end="204.78">a team search they're responsible for</span> <span data-start="204.78" data-end="206.79">the search team check out obvious what</span> <span data-start="206.79" data-end="209.1">they do and the team is responsible for</span> <span data-start="209.1" data-end="211.47">both the front-end part the backend part</span> <span data-start="211.47" data-end="214.26">the everything that's there the product</span> <span data-start="214.26" data-end="216.93">management part that's one team by the</span> <span data-start="216.93" data-end="219.06">way I asked about Nolan before Nolan did</span> <span data-start="219.06" data-end="221.58">this website micro front-ends org this</span> <span data-start="221.58" data-end="223.44">picture is from microfarad and ster org</span> <span data-start="223.44" data-end="225.72">didn't it say it's on when the slides it</span> <span data-start="225.72" data-end="227.64">was on the first slide well sorry I</span> <span data-start="227.64" data-end="229.86">forgot to mention mentioned that it's an</span> <span data-start="229.86" data-end="231.81">open license that why we can use it it's</span> <span data-start="231.81" data-end="235.35">cool website so we didn't make up the</span> <span data-start="235.35" data-end="237.51">term micro front and I think Nolan</span> <span data-start="237.51" data-end="239.49">didn't either but yeah they made this</span> <span data-start="239.49" data-end="244.08">cool website the question is why do we</span> <span data-start="244.08" data-end="245.28">want to do something like this I</span> <span data-start="245.28" data-end="247.02">mentioned reasons for it but there are</span> <span data-start="247.02" data-end="248.78">several reasons why you want to do this</span> <span data-start="248.78" data-end="251.94">exactly one reason is that what you</span> <span data-start="251.94" data-end="253.739">mentions the team is growing and you</span> <span data-start="253.739" data-end="255.72">have too much developers in one team and</span> <span data-start="255.72" data-end="257.85">you have to split up to work you can do</span> <span data-start="257.85" data-end="259.83">it by either making a lot of Trello</span> <span data-start="259.83" data-end="262.5">cards or JIRA tickets or something like</span> <span data-start="262.5" data-end="264.24">that and let developers work on</span> <span data-start="264.24" data-end="265.71">different domains but this don't often</span> <span data-start="265.71" data-end="267.639">work out very well because you have</span> <span data-start="267.639" data-end="272.199">all domain knowledge needed another</span> <span data-start="272.199" data-end="275.05">reason could be that you want to deploy</span> <span data-start="275.05" data-end="277.749">your product or your front-end or your</span> <span data-start="277.749" data-end="280.87">product separately this could be a</span> <span data-start="280.87" data-end="283.719">reason that you have differents vzf</span> <span data-start="283.719" data-end="286.12">different sprints times and you want to</span> <span data-start="286.12" data-end="288.009">release more often for example but your</span> <span data-start="288.009" data-end="290.499">main product is released once in a month</span> <span data-start="290.499" data-end="292.99">then you can split up the front ends and</span> <span data-start="292.99" data-end="295.349">you can deploy the products separately</span> <span data-start="295.349" data-end="299.499">another idea could be that you want to</span> <span data-start="299.499" data-end="302.919">isolate your run time this could be very</span> <span data-start="302.919" data-end="304.509">different reasons for example you have a</span> <span data-start="304.509" data-end="306.129">payment service and you have to collect</span> <span data-start="306.129" data-end="308.219">special day to form a payments of</span> <span data-start="308.219" data-end="312.27">payment service provider and you have</span> <span data-start="312.27" data-end="315.729">conflicts with normal us privacy but for</span> <span data-start="315.729" data-end="317.77">a payment you have to do it so this</span> <span data-start="317.77" data-end="321.759">could be also a valid approach and the</span> <span data-start="321.759" data-end="327.43">most or I think the most important i've</span> <span data-start="327.43" data-end="329.889">reason to to split up michael front-ends</span> <span data-start="329.889" data-end="332.199">is that you have one legacy application</span> <span data-start="332.199" data-end="334.15">and you want to modernize it but you</span> <span data-start="334.15" data-end="336.219">don't want to do a big band migration</span> <span data-start="336.219" data-end="338.02">that you have to throw away all the code</span> <span data-start="338.02" data-end="340.24">and rewrite everything with the</span> <span data-start="340.24" data-end="341.77">microphones and you can modernize the</span> <span data-start="341.77" data-end="344.02">application piece by piece and then you</span> <span data-start="344.02" data-end="347.8">have one small part that is new and the</span> <span data-start="347.8" data-end="350.319">big legacy part and you can migrate this</span> <span data-start="350.319" data-end="354.849">big application step by step but the</span> <span data-start="354.849" data-end="357.52">question is if we have reasons how to do</span> <span data-start="357.52" data-end="359.139">it how do we actually do that there are</span> <span data-start="359.139" data-end="361.089">several approaches that we want to</span> <span data-start="361.089" data-end="365.289">mention but the question is we now have</span> <span data-start="365.289" data-end="367.139">a problem what's the obvious solution</span> <span data-start="367.139" data-end="369.789">these days always the same blockchain is</span> <span data-start="369.789" data-end="370.93">always the solution to every problem</span> <span data-start="370.93" data-end="373.3">right we're missing a blockchain talk at</span> <span data-start="373.3" data-end="374.379">this conference I mentioned it before</span> <span data-start="374.379" data-end="377.56">not that I'm a fan of it ok no getting</span> <span data-start="377.56" data-end="379.12">serious again what are solutions on how</span> <span data-start="379.12" data-end="381.849">to implement micro front-ends one way is</span> <span data-start="381.849" data-end="383.56">to have a short shared we run time where</span> <span data-start="383.56" data-end="385.839">many front ends run within the same</span> <span data-start="385.839" data-end="388.659">runtime or we can I say every front-end</span> <span data-start="388.659" data-end="391.509">has its own runtime there's also like a</span> <span data-start="391.509" data-end="392.949">mixed approach that we're going to talk</span> <span data-start="392.949" data-end="395.14">about</span> <span data-start="395.15" data-end="398.86">let's get started with the own runtime</span> <span data-start="398.86" data-end="401.57">how do we separate rent times of</span> <span data-start="401.57" data-end="404">applications well we're in the web and</span> <span data-start="404" data-end="405.65">there's a technology that's pretty cool</span> <span data-start="405.65" data-end="408.32">we just reinvent the wheel and yeah use</span> <span data-start="408.32" data-end="410.199">hyperlinks so we have one application</span> <span data-start="410.199" data-end="414.65">that is called in our shop example the</span> <span data-start="414.65" data-end="417.41">inspire page so we have a website let's</span> <span data-start="417.41" data-end="420.38">say inspired the shop calm and on that</span> <span data-start="420.38" data-end="422.449">page we can see new products than we</span> <span data-start="422.449" data-end="424.97">have searched the shop comm and we can</span> <span data-start="424.97" data-end="426.889">find products there and then there's the</span> <span data-start="426.889" data-end="428.9">product website products dot the shop</span> <span data-start="428.9" data-end="431.69">comm the first two just link to these</span> <span data-start="431.69" data-end="435.74">products that the shop comm one approach</span> <span data-start="435.74" data-end="437.69">the you see very often in web shops is</span> <span data-start="437.69" data-end="439.19">that you also have a payment page</span> <span data-start="439.19" data-end="441.11">separately because you ran through the</span> <span data-start="441.11" data-end="443.06">checkout process you come to the payment</span> <span data-start="443.06" data-end="445.4">point and then you do one special thing</span> <span data-start="445.4" data-end="447.26">in one of these runtimes in one of these</span> <span data-start="447.26" data-end="449.27">front ends and that's actually pretty</span> <span data-start="449.27" data-end="451.31">cool because the runtimes are completely</span> <span data-start="451.31" data-end="453.919">separated I mean in a case of an online</span> <span data-start="453.919" data-end="455.9">shop let's be honest that probably</span> <span data-start="455.9" data-end="458.75">doesn't work that well I can tell you we</span> <span data-start="458.75" data-end="460.58">at blend will have done exam it's</span> <span data-start="460.58" data-end="463.639">exactly this example we have put out our</span> <span data-start="463.639" data-end="466.19">payment service into our payment page</span> <span data-start="466.19" data-end="469.94">into a different front end it was quite</span> <span data-start="469.94" data-end="473.57">a big work but now it's a huge benefit</span> <span data-start="473.57" data-end="476.81">to half exactly this set up again for</span> <span data-start="476.81" data-end="478.49">blender it makes sense I think it's a</span> <span data-start="478.49" data-end="480.53">payment you said also landing pages</span> <span data-start="480.53" data-end="481.13">right</span> <span data-start="481.13" data-end="482.66">are separate exactly they're completely</span> <span data-start="482.66" data-end="483.77">separate from the rest of the</span> <span data-start="483.77" data-end="485.27">application so it makes sense to take</span> <span data-start="485.27" data-end="487.699">them out because then it's easier to to</span> <span data-start="487.699" data-end="489.65">decide okay with the landing pages we</span> <span data-start="489.65" data-end="491.36">want to use the next big thing in web</span> <span data-start="491.36" data-end="493.49">technology and that's what you exactly</span> <span data-start="493.49" data-end="495.77">did right yeah we used next yes so the</span> <span data-start="495.77" data-end="498.59">next yes you have different approaches</span> <span data-start="498.59" data-end="499.849">and you have different goals to achieve</span> <span data-start="499.849" data-end="501.68">with each project for a landing page</span> <span data-start="501.68"

you can use something simple like</span> <span data-start="1598.53" data-end="1601.05">engine eggs or an express server for</span> <span data-start="1601.05" data-end="1602.61">that but they are complicated more</span> <span data-start="1602.61" data-end="1604.74">complicated stuff out there you can use</span> <span data-start="1604.74" data-end="1606.57">that you find it if you search for</span> <span data-start="1606.57" data-end="1608.91">routing or microformats and obviously if</span> <span data-start="1608.91" data-end="1610.32">you're using like a shared runtime</span> <span data-start="1610.32" data-end="1612.12">approach where you're using react view</span> <span data-start="1612.12" data-end="1614.31">and angular on the same page you can't</span> <span data-start="1614.31" data-end="1616.44">just use angular router because yeah you</span> <span data-start="1616.44" data-end="1617.76">also need to support direct route to</span> <span data-start="1617.76" data-end="1619.41">somehow or you develop your own router</span> <span data-start="1619.41" data-end="1620.94">because developing your own library is</span> <span data-start="1620.94" data-end="1625.76">always a good idea right irony Thanks</span> <span data-start="1625.76" data-end="1629.76">okay so again the conclusion microphone</span> <span data-start="1629.76" data-end="1631.53">ends might help you big time we have</span> <span data-start="1631.53" data-end="1636">kind of different opinions on one when</span> <span data-start="1636" data-end="1637.65">you want to introduce micro fragments</span> <span data-start="1637.65" data-end="1639.57">for me it's always a question of if your</span> <span data-start="1639.57" data-end="1641.64">team is getting too big then they might</span> <span data-start="1641.64" data-end="1643.73">really really help you if you're</span> <span data-start="1643.73" data-end="1646.92">modernizing applications like mi just</span> <span data-start="1646.92" data-end="1648.99">mentioned then it's really a big help we</span> <span data-start="1648.99" data-end="1651.06">can because even if you have this big</span> <span data-start="1651.06" data-end="1653.49">old XJ s3 application that some</span> <span data-start="1653.49" data-end="1656.52">companies still have you can someone is</span> <span data-start="1656.52" data-end="1658.98">laughing not the one I was talking to</span> <span data-start="1658.98" data-end="1660.84">actually he didn't start laughing okay</span> <span data-start="1660.84" data-end="1662.82">then you can just start developing your</span> <span data-start="1662.82" data-end="1664.74">new components with react and integrate</span> <span data-start="1664.74" data-end="1666.87">them to your old application or do it</span> <span data-start="1666.87" data-end="1669.15">the way that blender does this all works</span> <span data-start="1669.15" data-end="1671.13">and it helps you a lot but it comes at a</span> <span data-start="1671.13" data-end="1675.03">cost again 17 webpack configs right so</span> <span data-start="1675.03" data-end="1678.06">always introduce new micro front ends</span> <span data-start="1678.06" data-end="1680.82">with care I've seen projects that have</span> <span data-start="1680.82" data-end="1683.76">like 10 to 15 micro front ends for like</span> <span data-start="1683.76" data-end="1687.09">three front end developers that usually</span> <span data-start="1687.09" data-end="1689.76">hurts a lot so take care when you</span> <span data-start="1689.76" data-end="1691.86">introduce new micro front ends just be</span> <span data-start="1691.86" data-end="1694.2">sure that you don't implement or just</span> <span data-start="1694.2" data-end="1696.6">adds new complexity too because it's</span> <span data-start="1696.6" data-end="1698.54">cool to have micro front ends right now</span> <span data-start="1698.54" data-end="1702.36">always check if it's needed and mostly</span> <span data-start="1702.36" data-end="1704.15">it's when you want to modernize your</span> <span data-start="1704.15" data-end="1706.23">applications then it's a really good way</span> <span data-start="1706.23" data-end="1708.81">to add new micro front ends don't forget</span> <span data-start="1708.81" data-end="1710.88">if you modernize to throw away old code</span> <span data-start="1710.88" data-end="1713.52">that's the most important thing always</span> <span data-start="1713.52" data-end="1715.26">keep in mind that throwing away code</span> <span data-start="1715.26" data-end="1717.99">should be the best way when you review a</span> <span data-start="1717.99" data-end="1719.82">code make sure that the code is</span> <span data-start="1719.82" data-end="1723.09">removable later on this will help if you</span> <span data-start="1723.09" data-end="1724.86">want to implement micro front ends once</span> <span data-start="1724.86" data-end="1727.08">in a time maybe in five years so if you</span> <span data-start="1727.08" data-end="1729.33">use microphones for like you mentioned</span> <span data-start="1729.33" data-end="1730.02">the</span> <span data-start="1730.02" data-end="1731.73">legacy or the modernizing of legacy</span> <span data-start="1731.73" data-end="1733.98">applications and you start with the</span> <span data-start="1733.98" data-end="1736.74">extras monolith and start the new react</span> <span data-start="1736.74" data-end="1738.54">application there if you then decide</span> <span data-start="1738.54" data-end="1740.25">okay we want to go with view jeaious</span> <span data-start="1740.25" data-end="1742.35">then maybe don't set up the third</span> <span data-start="1742.35" data-end="1744.36">microphone and with view J's but try to</span> <span data-start="1744.36" data-end="1747.24">get rid of one of the others first I'll</span> <span data-start="1747.24" data-end="1748.74">just start a new micro front-end with</span> <span data-start="1748.74" data-end="1751.08">react because you have it already all</span> <span data-start="1751.08" data-end="1756.24">right miss x3 s3 that's actually all of</span> <span data-start="1756.24" data-end="1757.68">our content I think we have like three</span> <span data-start="1757.68" data-end="1759.81">four minutes left for questions are</span> <span data-start="1759.81" data-end="1763.61">there any questions about this topic</span> <span data-start="1763.61" data-end="1771.57">there's one yes I didn't get that word</span> <span data-start="1771.57" data-end="1775.59">how do you synchronize what yes that's</span> <span data-start="1775.59" data-end="1776.61">an interesting thing that's actually</span> <span data-start="1776.61" data-end="1778.17">something that I just experienced in an</span> <span data-start="1778.17" data-end="1779.19">application where people had problems</span> <span data-start="1779.19" data-end="1782.46">with that so what we do is we have quite</span> <span data-start="1782.46" data-end="1784.05">a lot of events flowing between the</span> <span data-start="1784.05" data-end="1786.24">iframe and the outer regions so we have</span> <span data-start="1786.24" data-end="1788.31">for this this placeholder image that's</span> <span data-start="1788.31" data-end="1790.86">rendered before the actual content of</span> <span data-start="1790.86" data-end="1792.45">the four iframes rendered and at some</span> <span data-start="1792.45" data-end="1794.31">point the iframe is gonna send a okay</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1794.31" data-end="1795.96">I'm done rendering and then the image is</span> <span data-start="1795.96" data-end="1797.16">replaced with the content of the real</span> <span data-start="1797.16" data-end="1799.74">iframe does that somehow answer your</span> <span data-start="1799.74" data-end="1804.54">question great other questions or do you</span> <span data-start="1804.54" data-end="1812.1">want to add something sorry no how do</span> <span data-start="1812.1" data-end="1819.12">you share what state state yeah if you</span> <span data-start="1819.12" data-end="1821.64">want to share a state you always want to</span> <span data-start="1821.64" data-end="1823.32">make sure that it's the lowest level</span> <span data-start="1823.32" data-end="1823.83">possible</span> <span data-start="1823.83" data-end="1825.54">mostly it's something like a refresh</span> <span data-start="1825.54" data-end="1827.31">token or a jpg and you want to build up</span> <span data-start="1827.31" data-end="1828.69">the state by your own because you have</span> <span data-start="1828.69" data-end="1830.43">your own state management library in</span> <span data-start="1830.43" data-end="1834.21">every other language if you have one</span> <span data-start="1834.21" data-end="1836.37">state management library for multiple</span> <span data-start="1836.37" data-end="1838.92">languages something like Redux or</span> <span data-start="1838.92" data-end="1840.51">something like mopix</span> <span data-start="1840.51" data-end="1842.73">then it's possible to use the same state</span> <span data-start="1842.73" data-end="1845.58">library and just swap out the UI part it</span> <span data-start="1845.58" data-end="1849.06">heavily depends but mostly you want to</span> <span data-start="1849.06" data-end="1852.03">go down as much as possible and don't</span> <span data-start="1852.03" data-end="1853.74">share any stage between them that's</span> <span data-start="1853.74" data-end="1855.21">exactly exactly what I wanted to say so</span> <span data-start="1855.21" data-end="1857.37">you mentioned JSON web tokens or let's</span> <span data-start="1857.37" data-end="1858.78">say the information has to be about the</span> <span data-start="1858.78" data-end="1861.15">current user you may share that state if</span> <span data-start="1861.15" data-end="1862.89">you want to share more state then</span> <span data-start="1862.89" data-end="1863.97">probably these</span> <span data-start="1863.97" data-end="1866.009">should not be two different microphones</span> <span data-start="1866.009" data-end="1867.84">because they're responsible for the same</span> <span data-start="1867.84" data-end="1870.36">business domain so they should actually</span> <span data-start="1870.36" data-end="1885.509">be one application how do you make them</span> <span data-start="1885.509" data-end="1887.309">communicate with each other it totally</span> <span data-start="1887.309" data-end="1889.59">depends on the approach so if it's the</span> <span data-start="1889.59" data-end="1891.99">iframe approach you can just use this</span> <span data-start="1891.99" data-end="1894.09">postmessage api is that the name I think</span> <span data-start="1894.09" data-end="1896.519">it's the name yes if it's in the shared</span> <span data-start="1896.519" data-end="1898.59">runtime you can have them Central even</span> <span data-start="1898.59" data-end="1900.889">passed there what we're doing with a</span> <span data-start="1900.889" data-end="1902.879">separate runtime thing is that we have a</span> <span data-start="1902.879" data-end="1905.039">even pass in the backend and some of the</span> <span data-start="1905.039" data-end="1907.59">events are actually transferred to the</span> <span data-start="1907.59" data-end="1910.11">front end using WebSockets so that I can</span> <span data-start="1910.11" data-end="1912.69">communicate using that what's important</span> <span data-start="1912.69" data-end="1914.1">there from my point of view is have a</span> <span data-start="1914.1" data-end="1917.039">defined contract on what is allowed as a</span> <span data-start="1917.039" data-end="1919.59">communication I experience one project</span> <span data-start="1919.59" data-end="1922.259">they just through Redux messages Redux</span> <span data-start="1922.259" data-end="1924.919">actions into the Redux message bus and</span> <span data-start="1924.919" data-end="1926.97">nowhere there was any documentation</span> <span data-start="1926.97" data-end="1929.19">about the messages someone just assumed</span> <span data-start="1929.19" data-end="1930.779">okay if the message is called</span> <span data-start="1930.779" data-end="1932.669">at user then there's probably this</span> <span data-start="1932.669" data-end="1935.94">property that's gonna be a hell so if</span> <span data-start="1935.94" data-end="1937.889">you communicate with each other define a</span> <span data-start="1937.889" data-end="1939.69">contract there there is also a good</span> <span data-start="1939.69" data-end="1941.039">library from Zendesk</span> <span data-start="1941.039" data-end="1944.009">it's called shared shared storage it's</span> <span data-start="1944.009" data-end="1945.6">something like local storage but for</span> <span data-start="1945.6" data-end="1948.72">different domains x''b all which works</span> <span data-start="1948.72" data-end="1950.399">very good for if you have different</span> <span data-start="1950.399" data-end="1954.09">runtimes I think and there's one last</span> <span data-start="1954.09" data-end="1964.62">question</span> <span data-start="1964.63" data-end="1967.04">what is Universal renderings that back</span> <span data-start="1967.04" data-end="1968.6">into the server-side rendering in front</span> <span data-start="1968.6" data-end="1969.5">and rendering I'm not sure right now</span> <span data-start="1969.5" data-end="1972.23">yeah if you have I want to have</span> <span data-start="1972.23" data-end="1973.85">universal rendering you have to say with</span> <span data-start="1973.85" data-end="1976.64">one framework and you can't mix the</span> <span data-start="1976.64" data-end="1978.29">different front ends in between that's</span> <span data-start="1978.29" data-end="1980.15">more integrated in the web server like</span> <span data-start="1980.15" data-end="1981.77">if you have an express server then you</span> <span data-start="1981.77" data-end="1984.38">could do weird stuff there you can do</span> <span data-start="1984.38" data-end="1986.18">weird stuff but it's hard and yet it's</span> <span data-start="1986.18" data-end="1988.31">minimal work it's not really something</span> <span data-start="1988.31" data-end="1990.86">that that works out of the boxes like</span> <span data-start="1990.86" data-end="1994.43">react render or view of angular or I</span> <span data-start="1994.43" data-end="1996.02">don't know if there are further</span> <span data-start="1996.02"
