Right, so, I'm not getting a whole lot of anything</span> <span data-start="19.439" data-end="20.439">on the screen. (Hey .. oh, no .. here we go. And I think we are good to go. Right.</span> <span data-start="20.439" data-end="22.289">We go on the screen, brilliant, hello, we've come a long way haven't we in the past 20</span> <span data-start="22.289" data-end="27.63">years since the '90s, I mean, back then you would have some friends over, it'd be going</span> <span data-start="27.63" data-end="32.66">great, then two of your friends would start having a disagreement involving the release</span> <span data-start="32.66" data-end="37.989">gait of ghost busters, but then it starts to get heated, none of them are backing down,</span> <span data-start="37.989" data-end="44.28">the mood of the dinner party is at stake, but it's okay, for you hold aloft the answer,</span> <span data-start="44.28" data-end="51.42">for you are the proud owner of Microsoft Cinemania. Giving you instant access to the history of</span> <span data-start="51.42" data-end="57.6">cinema. Well, it's not really instant, first you must go to the room with the computer</span> <span data-start="57.6" data-end="65.19">in and turn it on, and then the fan starts whirring, you get that friendly static crackle</span> <span data-start="65.19" data-end="73.67">as the CRT monitor whirs into action, windows 3.1 slowly boots up. Then you get your desktop,</span> <span data-start="73.67" data-end="83">eventually. And it does this (Horn sound) and that really sets expectations we are dealing</span> <span data-start="83" data-end="88.11">with an operating system that thinks that booting successfully is a fanfare worthy moment</span> <span data-start="88.11" data-end="100.77">(Applause) and by the power of multimedia C ROM you veal that ghost busters was release</span> <span data-start="100.77" data-end="109.49">in the 1984, you did that in under ten minutes, the dinner party is saved. The web changed</span> <span data-start="109.49" data-end="117.2">everything, with the web you get information instantly, no installation, they looked out</span> <span data-start="117.2" data-end="121.909">of date the CDs almost instantly, having separate apps for these things became weird, the stuff</span> <span data-start="121.909" data-end="127.11">ton internet was better, built with new interconnected with the modern world in run, the browser</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="127.11" data-end="133.98">Runtime replaced more my native App, office tooling, code editors, native apps became</span> <span data-start="133.98" data-end="139.03">the exception, if you look at the top ten selling laptops on Amazon they include chrome</span> <span data-start="139.03" data-end="145.879">books that's how secondary native apps are, though that's not true on mobile. The native</span> <span data-start="145.879" data-end="149.47">apps still rule, because they build to the strength of the platform and a lot of the</span> <span data-start="149.47" data-end="155.51">web predates that, some of the web is hostile to mobile. This is a creative agency that</span> <span data-start="155.51" data-end="159.23">I won't name; this is what you get if you visit their site.</span> <span data-start="159.23" data-end="164.32">> Choosing your creative agency isn't like buying a pair of shoes, so why group make</span> <span data-start="164.32" data-end="174.08">yourself Coffee and visit our site on real screen. They're kind over right, I never had</span> <span data-start="174.08" data-end="185.75">a shoe tell me to Fuck off and come back when I have real feet. You can see the things they're</span> <span data-start="185.75" data-end="193.05">expert in, which includes, responsive sites, of course (Laughing) the more worrying case</span> <span data-start="193.05" data-end="198.84">the sites are simply hostile to just the mobile web, not just the mobile platform, this is</span> <span data-start="198.84" data-end="203.659">a horrible situation, the user has gone to these sites in a browser following a deep</span> <span data-start="203.659" data-end="208.05">link rather than sending them the thing they want, we send them to another thing where</span> <span data-start="208.05" data-end="213.5">they can download a thing to install a thing that can run that Macon train the thing they</span> <span data-start="213.5" data-end="218.29">originally wanted somewhere in in the interface. It's not a good United Nations experience,</span> <span data-start="218.29" data-end="225.15">it's one developers think is good to get you after the web to the native app. Think about</span> <span data-start="225.15" data-end="230.89">the native apps you use and rely on, this that is where the web is failing what caused</span> <span data-start="230.89" data-end="234.69">that failure, what features do they have that can make it impossible to replicate on the</span> <span data-start="234.69" data-end="242.84">web. I use these apps often, or they can't be done on the web because of push notification,</span> <span data-start="242.84" data-end="247.319">that is vital for the apps in yellow, they tell me someone sent me something, or something</span> <span data-start="247.319" data-end="252.74">happens in the background when the App isn't open,I rarely use trip it, I forget I have</span> <span data-start="252.74" data-end="258.791">it. Then it'll send me a notification that a flight is delayed or canceled. Background</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="258.791" data-end="264.98">Sync, from downloading pod cast to sending an eâ€‘mail late their failed to send at the</span> <span data-start="264.98" data-end="270.95">time, which sends to off line, I depend on this for more apps that I realize for playing</span> <span data-start="270.95" data-end="274.92">music, checking where my hotel is, looking up a meeting location, I continue want to</span> <span data-start="274.92" data-end="285.54">depend on connectivity for these things, we need better performance and integration to</span> <span data-start="285.54" data-end="290.64">the O several, battery staps, accounting information, the web can't do these, and that's a bug,</span> <span data-start="290.64" data-end="295.55">what gives me hope is that these are bugs that are getting fixed not just being thought</span> <span data-start="295.55" data-end="299.82">about, code is landing to fix these things, and these are the ones I want to talk about</span> <span data-start="299.82" data-end="304.201">today these require something new, background Sync, that happen in the background, push</span> <span data-start="304.201" data-end="309.04">notification are received and dealt with in the background. Off line, doesn't run in the</span> <span data-start="309.04" data-end="314.65">background but requires context to run before pages, and that thing is the service worker.</span> <span data-start="314.65" data-end="321.6">And this is the Spec. That bit got a round applause at GoogleIO (Applause) don't patronize,</span> <span data-start="321.6" data-end="330.6">me, I could of dressed it up a bit. I like what graphic cards into in this present, they're</span> <span data-start="330.6" data-end="335.41">just circuit boards, but they need to sort of dress themselves up to make them look like</span> <span data-start="335.41" data-end="339.72">the must have for people. Even though they don't do anything on their own. The boxes</span> <span data-start="339.72" data-end="344.24">they come in are amazing in this kind of sub deviant arts craft, you get the usual sort</span> <span data-start="344.24" data-end="349.66">of sexist nonsense you get with gaming, you always get things like the hideous off string</span> <span data-start="349.66" data-end="360.02">of Sh reck and Yoda and also teenage mutant Ninja dog. So in this vain, I present to you</span> <span data-start="360.02" data-end="372.84">the service worker! (Applause) that's Memrod using his evil pow tore control browser feature.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="372.84" data-end="379.9">We need a logo, stop me. This is something being worked on between Google Mozilla Sam</span> <span data-start="379.9" data-end="387.87">sung. It has no Dom access, unlike a shared worker it can exist without a reference to</span> <span data-start="387.87" data-end="394.12">it and shuts down when not in used this is the gabbinge background context we need. It's</span> <span data-start="394.12" data-end="401.31">in Bruce tore day, you'll need COMCanary, you'll need go about about flags and enable</span> <span data-start="401.31" data-end="407.62">experimental browser feature and restart. If chrome isn't your thing you can use fire</span> <span data-start="407.62" data-end="414.98">fox nightly, go to about Config and enable service worker and give the Bruce ear restart.</span> <span data-start="414.98" data-end="420.72">I'm going to stick with canary, Google played for my flight and hoe it will, it would be</span> <span data-start="420.72" data-end="427.9">rude not to. And the debugging tool is forever ahead. If you want to know what support or</span> <span data-start="427.9" data-end="435.041">sub features, it's service worker ready and tells you which browser support what. It's</span> <span data-start="435.041" data-end="440.37">the foundation for the others, off line suffers from the same misconceptions as progressive</span> <span data-start="440.37" data-end="446.78">enhancement, I think, people say my App doesn't need to work off line because my users have</span> <span data-start="446.78" data-end="450.72">permanent internet connectivity, but it's not just about zero connectivity, it's about</span> <span data-start="450.72" data-end="457.63">treating the network as an enhancement, when user clicks a link to your site, the URL start</span> <span data-start="457.63" data-end="462.61">a navigation, a document is created, but we have to go to network to get the data for</span> <span data-start="462.61" data-end="469.151">that, that can take a long time, it will come back eventually, we can't rend E. we have</span> <span data-start="469.151" data-end="475.49">to send request for the Java, the images, as these come back we can start to render,</span> <span data-start="475.49" data-end="481.71">but the sub resource trigger other sub resources, fonts, images used in the CSS, when they come</span> <span data-start="481.71" data-end="487.36">back we get towards our find render. As a practical example I'll take train â€‘â€‘ it's</span> <span data-start="487.36" data-end="497.37">a responsive site, I was on a train when I started building it I had a moment of zero</span> <span data-start="497.37" data-end="503.81">inspiration. But let's load it on a phone that's 250â€‘kilo births fifteenâ€‘yearâ€‘old</span> <span data-start="503.81" data-end="509.47">me would have kill you for a 256 kill birth con next, not the best today but far from</span> <span data-start="509.47" data-end="516.97">the worst. So, three, two, one, go. We get the first render, that wasn't JavaScript dependent</span> <span data-start="516.97" data-end="520.77">. we get content after 5 seconds that's from</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="520.77" data-end="529.32">Flickr, those images are 200 K each, that's what it gave me if I wanted to coverer this</span> <span data-start="529.32" data-end="536.08">density. First image through, after thirtyâ€‘seconds, other images start loading, after what seems</span> <span data-start="536.08" data-end="543.31">like years, we get the full render. Now, that video wasn't realâ€‘time, I had to cut it</span> <span data-start="543.31" data-end="548.64">down, it took so long, those are the correct figures, we can compress the images better,</span> <span data-start="548.64" data-end="554.32">we can do things to insure the top images load first,I just took what Flickr gave me.</span> <span data-start="554.32" data-end="561.68">We are still beating native, the equivalent is the visit the App store, download, it's</span> <span data-start="561.68" data-end="567.96">a slow user experience, but native kicks our ass on the second visit it used that initial</span> <span data-start="567.96" data-end="572.92">download and install cash loads of stuff, we have the browser cash, but the whole internet</span> <span data-start="572.92" data-end="578.72">is fighting for that, if we change one line in CSS or java script, we change the file</span> <span data-start="578.72" data-end="584.221">name, we break the cash,we like to deploy often, we're breaking the cash office. This</span> <span data-start="584.221" data-end="590.1">page register for a service worker allowing us to do something about the second load.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="590.1" data-end="596.99">Registration estruation is simple, miter JavaScript like, this you can also scope it to an area</span> <span data-start="596.99" data-end="601.57">of your origin, and that's use informal you have single origin with many apps, like Google</span> <span data-start="601.57" data-end="607.95">does with calendar and stuff like that. The default scope is the whole origin, which we'll</span> <span data-start="607.95" data-end="612.08">use here, it returns a promise so you can find out if it works or not. You can register</span> <span data-start="612.08" data-end="618.93">for a service worker on 750 DPS, the service worker is so power it would p a disaster it</span> <span data-start="618.93" data-end="626.75">fall boss a man in the middle is a good place to butt demo stuff and local host is exempt</span> <span data-start="626.75" data-end="635.93">for development. Console log, listen for install events, service worker for the first time,</span> <span data-start="635.93" data-end="639.68">so let's see that in action. First, I'm going to go to service worker internal, which is</span> <span data-start="639.68" data-end="644.14">where our debugging stuff is living at the moment, as you can see there's nothing there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="644.14" data-end="650.15">Then I'll open the train site, a dead version of it . As you can see on the bottom corner</span> <span data-start="650.15" data-end="655.51">there, our service worker is successfully registered F we go to service worker internals</span> <span data-start="655.51" data-end="662.43">there, it is, there's our console log, we can launch Dev tools, we can also set break</span> <span data-start="662.43" data-end="669.16">points run stuff on the console, etcâ€¦ If we fast forward time a bit, the service worker</span> <span data-start="669.16" data-end="674.33">terminates, that's not a bug, it's just not needed at the moment, closes to conserve memory.</span> <span data-start="674.33" data-end="680.29">And congratulations, at that point, you're now wielding the power of the service worker,</span> <span data-start="680.29" data-end="687.54">but what did that actually get us? Nothing. (Laughing) but, wait, oh, my God, it's actually</span> <span data-start="687.54" data-end="694.46">a good thing that it does nothing. The unapologetically made it good. Compare it to App cash, if you</span> <span data-start="694.46" data-end="701.81">give manifest, and that manifest only contains the words cash manifest,I would expect to</span> <span data-start="701.81" data-end="708.57">go from this to this said no one ever in the world. So, we didn't want to do that, service</span> <span data-start="708.57" data-end="712.74">worker doesn't do anything unless you tell it to do something, App Cache broke a lot</span> <span data-start="712.74" data-end="721.51">of eggs and failed to make a omelet, has the right ingredients, routing fetching cashing,</span> <span data-start="721.51" data-end="729.91">updates and version control,blouse first reverse the piles of implicit behavior, which are,</span> <span data-start="729.91" data-end="735.69">of course, guarded by the army of robot wasps. If you've used that Cache before you'll know</span> <span data-start="735.69" data-end="743.99">what I mean. We sort it out, without getting stung. This is the extensible web. Don't ask</span> <span data-start="743.99" data-end="750.35">don't take fish, ask for a fisher rod, but take the fish as well. We need both high and</span> <span data-start="750.35" data-end="760.43">low level AIs, the service worker is event driven we've seen install, it's also fetch,</span> <span data-start="760.43" data-end="766.1">this fires for any navigation for your scope, but also for any sub resource from that page.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="766.1" data-end="771.75">In service worker internals, we're going to start off the service worker, inspect it,</span> <span data-start="771.75" data-end="778.5">navigate to our train site, you see as soon as we navigate we hit the break point many</span> <span data-start="778.5" data-end="787.75">if net fetch, we get one for the CSS, we skip from there, we'll get the logo, the JavaScript,</span> <span data-start="787.75" data-end="795.07">we rendered before JavaScript because we care about performance, get API call to Flikr.</span> <span data-start="795.07" data-end="802.8">And then get all the image requests coming in. But, hey, the cool bit is, this is â€‘â€‘ this</span> <span data-start="802.8" data-end="807.59">is an event, like other vents like clique, touch start, key down, you can present the</span> <span data-start="807.59" data-end="812.71">default and do something else Y. can respond with something else. Responses can be created</span> <span data-start="812.71" data-end="822.4">manually, give it some texts, and if do we, that the page gives us this to this. But the</span> <span data-start="822.4" data-end="828.74">swears interesting thing here S. we delivered that without going to the network at all,</span> <span data-start="828.74" data-end="835.14">making it the first off line demo of the talk only almost halfway through, but we can do</span> <span data-start="835.14" data-end="839.51">better than that. When the browser discover the service worker for first time, we'll send</span> <span data-start="839.51" data-end="845.38">it to the network, get it to make load of requests and get responses it might with fast</span> <span data-start="845.38" data-end="850.18">it might be slow,the network is not predictable, we're not disrupting the user they already</span> <span data-start="850.18" data-end="856.839">have the page open. If our response comes back we'll put them in the Cache, this preâ€‘Cache</span> <span data-start="856.839" data-end="863.02">method is what native would do with an initial install back age, we do it in the background</span> <span data-start="863.02" data-end="871.42">without disrupting the user, the loot page template, JavaScript, all the stat tick stuff,</span> <span data-start="871.42" data-end="877.26">when we get a request for one of those things, we'll just get it from the Cache, the uncertainty</span> <span data-start="877.26" data-end="883.49">of the network is no learn our problem, this is simple thanks to the cashing API, full</span> <span data-start="883.49" data-end="891.17">control of the Cache in the install event from earlier, we get this vent â€‘â€‘ and</span> <span data-start="891.17" data-end="895.57">we can pass a promise into there that extends the installation process, use to indicate</span> <span data-start="895.57" data-end="903.51">success and failure as well. Here we're going to create a Cache, give a name, and then add</span> <span data-start="903.51" data-end="909.95">stuff to it, our static has sets, if any of these fail, the whole operation fails. And,</span> <span data-start="909.95" data-end="913.52">service worker won't control pages, so if the install succeeds we know we have these</span> <span data-start="913.52" data-end="918.2">thing in the Cach oh, there are deopinion Dennis, it's not thee canary yet, there's</span> <span data-start="918.2" data-end="927.42">a poly fill, the proper implementation in a few weeks. How do we use these Cache items,</span> <span data-start="927.42" data-end="935.17">responds with Cac hade.match, it will find a response that matches that request, it's</span> <span data-start="935.17" data-end="941.029">done by method, URL, similar to the browser Cach e if there's no match you'll get no back,</span> <span data-start="941.029" data-end="947.79">if we get no, we can send something else, what should we do instead, we could send a</span> <span data-start="947.79" data-end="954.44">fall back entry, what if we want to try the network, to do this we need the make a request</span> <span data-start="954.44" data-end="961.279">using JavaScript. In 1999, Microsoft engineers were design ago new excitingAPI, what should</span> <span data-start="961.279" data-end="967.121">they call it, it contained abbreviations, initialisms, they shouldn't decide if it should</span> <span data-start="967.121" data-end="977.92">be all caps or just the first letter like getElement by â€‘â€‘ so they did both XMLHttpReques</span> <span data-start="977.92" data-end="987.8">the â€‘â€‘ restricted to HTTP but it isn't, and request, you get a request object back,</span> <span data-start="987.8" data-end="995.78">yet you don't. We tried to modernize it is a bit, fetching some JSON, is verboten, we've</span> <span data-start="995.78" data-end="999.91">been patching this API for fifteen years, I do not want to use this AI when it's old</span> <span data-start="999.91" data-end="1008.58">enough to drink. Thankfully, the fetch back by Mozilla, it gives lower level control,</span> <span data-start="1008.58" data-end="1016.97">weave already seen some of it. Lower APSI usually easier to use than higher level one,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1016.97" data-end="1024.35">HHR is so bad, it's not true here, the equivalent to this in Fetch Fetch URL gives you a promise,</span> <span data-start="1024.35" data-end="1030.85">pass it how you want, gives you a promise, done.

Remy, you're going to send</span> <span data-start="1341.27" data-end="1345.57">a chat in there, but not until we have something on the screen.</span> <span data-start="1345.57" data-end="1360.019">> Huhâ€¦ I got it by the wayâ€¦ > Fine â€‘â€‘</span> <span data-start="1360.019" data-end="1371.38">> It's pretty good. > Youâ€™re enjoying your morning so far, was</span> <span data-start="1371.38" data-end="1372.57">breakfast good? > Yes</span> <span data-start="1372.57" data-end="1378.1">> I didn't breakfast, I was afraid I might throw it up.

That's â€‘â€‘ we've seen that happen</span> <span data-start="1470.09" data-end="1476.85">before, this is nothing new, what I'm going to do now is I'm going to close Chromium completely,</span> <span data-start="1476.85" data-end="1485.309">int browsers not open at all. No recent apps on. So .. many Remy would you care to send</span> <span data-start="1485.309" data-end="1493.179">another message.

So .. right, I'm hideously running over now, the way we coded that, it's just</span> <span data-start="1558.12" data-end="1562.33">a standard, from your page, you register for push messaging, we'll give you the details</span> <span data-start="1562.33" data-end="1567.72">like the ID and end point where to send messages, but when that actually, when that's called</span> <span data-start="1567.72" data-end="1572.04">you gel get an vent in the service worker, you'll get to do what you want at this point,</span> <span data-start="1572.04" data-end="1577.94">look at data, update cache, show notification, once again, you get to did what you want,</span> <span data-start="1577.94" data-end="1583.24">in that case you can navigate to that page, refocus an existing tab. Background sink is</span> <span data-start="1583.24" data-end="1590.57">similar, you don't need a service operator for that, sometime late your fire an vent</span> <span data-start="1590.57" data-end="1595.45">in the service worker to do something for me that I was unable to do earlier. These</span> <span data-start="1595.45" data-end="1599.72">things require use permission, of course, they'll be told of this.</span> <span data-start="1599.72" data-end="1602.98">> You have ten minutes. > I have ten minutes, oh,I'm going to tell</span> <span data-start="1602.98" data-end="1613.83">you about how to code push and Sythisc, then (Laughing) okay, how did that demo work, Jack?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1613.83" data-end="1619.1">Well, I'll tell you. From the page you call navigator.serviceWorker.ready that gives you</span> <span data-start="1619.1" data-end="1627.37">the registration â€‘â€‘ navigator.serviceWorker â€‘â€‘ on our registration we call push.register,</span> <span data-start="1627.37" data-end="1631.09">that gives you the details and you post those to the service, you'll associate that with</span> <span data-start="1631.09" data-end="1636.34">the current use their will give you the end point information where you'll send the information.</span> <span data-start="1636.34" data-end="1643.37">For home, GSM, Google Cloud messaging, every browser can use their own, you'll need an</span> <span data-start="1643.37" data-end="1648.309">account set up with the different push messaging providers the data you'll send to these things</span> <span data-start="1648.309" data-end="1651.9">will be exactly the same, you'll just have to know which way you're sending it, which</span> <span data-start="1651.9" data-end="1660.35">will be a URL, when the user receives a message, you get a push event and you have a look to</span> <span data-start="1660.35" data-end="1667.36">see what kind of data, I'm going to react to that, I'm going to do â€‘â€‘ after this</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1667.36" data-end="1673.5">I'll show a notification. Something, this is something that native, even the really</span> <span data-start="1673.5" data-end="1679.85">best native apps, they get it wrong, often I'll get a tweet, I won't notice it when it</span> <span data-start="1679.85" data-end="1684.37">around arrive, on the under ground I'll see the notification, I'll click et, I'll get</span> <span data-start="1684.37" data-end="1693.151">nothing because they haven't cached that data off line. You get an vent when you get a click</span> <span data-start="1693.151" data-end="1699.309">notification and you do what you want, usually navigating to the page, give a we to enumerate</span> <span data-start="1699.309" data-end="1704.53">the client, which there pages within your scope, look at theme them, see if they're</span> <span data-start="1704.53" data-end="1711.22">focused, hidden, hang on, there's already a window that has focus, so I don't need to</span> <span data-start="1711.22" data-end="1715.66">show a notification or I don't need to navigate anywhere,I can determine that stuff ahead</span> <span data-start="1715.66" data-end="1720.97">of time.
