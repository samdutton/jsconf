Uh-huh .. Okay.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="63.39" data-end="66.66">You know, you would expect a lot of things when you're about to do a talk.</span> <span data-start="66.66" data-end="71">The last thing you expect is your computer to just shut down</span> <span data-start="71" data-end="72.28">on you.</span> <span data-start="72.28" data-end="84.71">But these things happen.</span> <span data-start="84.71" data-end="85.71">And okay.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="85.71" data-end="86.71">Yay!</span> <span data-start="86.71" data-end="87.71">All right.</span> <span data-start="87.71" data-end="88.71">applause].</span> <span data-start="88.71" data-end="89.71">All right, right back to it.</span> <span data-start="89.71" data-end="92.759">So, I'm going to talk basically about being the only engineer</span> <span data-start="92.759" data-end="95.77">in a non-technical organisation, and, you know,</span> <span data-start="95.77" data-end="98.36">this could because you're a consultant working with a</span> <span data-start="98.36" data-end="102.22">company that has no technical expertise, or it could because</span> <span data-start="102.22" data-end="105.709">you're the only engineer on salary at a company that</span> <span data-start="105.709" data-end="109.039">maybe has like outsource developers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="109.039" data-end="112.379">And I'm just going to explain a little bit about how I came to that</span> <span data-start="112.379" data-end="114.16">position and what I did with it.</span> <span data-start="114.16" data-end="121.42">So yet again, I'm Sarah Saltic-Meyer, hit me up on Twitter: Meyerini.</span> <span data-start="121.42" data-end="127.92">And I started out at a tech company where more</span> <span data-start="127.92" data-end="132.76">than 50 per cent of the staff were software engineers.</span> <span data-start="132.76" data-end="134.53">And you know, we were a pretty cool.</span> <span data-start="134.53" data-end="140.209">Web development company in 2013, so we were on that backbone</span> <span data-start="140.209" data-end="146.57">in rails, you know, Ts all about the monolithic MVC</span> <span data-start="146.57" data-end="149.999">single page app, and, you know, that's where I sort of</span> <span data-start="149.999" data-end="151.51">grew up as an engineer.</span> <span data-start="151.51" data-end="159.459">That's where I learned best practices and where I, you know, kind of absorbed what software</span> <span data-start="159.459" data-end="163.019">engineering was, which was like constant refactoring.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="163.019" data-end="165.549">You know, always pushing for technical excellent, well</span> <span data-start="165.549" data-end="167.17">tested code.</span> <span data-start="167.17" data-end="171.78">All the good things that we come and talk about at conferences like this, and it was</span> <span data-start="171.78" data-end="175.73">a particular kind of culture, like video games.</span> <span data-start="175.73" data-end="178.489">We didn't work at all on the day when Apple would do a developer</span> <span data-start="178.489" data-end="181.219">conference, because there are things that are more</span> <span data-start="181.219" data-end="186.019">important in life, and I loved it there.</span> <span data-start="186.019" data-end="190.099">That was a company in Boston, and I really wanted to</span> <span data-start="190.099" data-end="193.329">go back to New York, which is where I grew up.</span> <span data-start="193.329" data-end="199.17">So I did that, sort of ran away, you know, took a job for the</span> <span data-start="199.17" data-end="204.049">sake of taking a job, which was, you know, kind of a terrible</span> <span data-start="204.049" data-end="208.659">idea in a sense because I almost immediately got coached</span> <span data-start="208.659" data-end="213.87">by the company of my dreams, I felt really connected</span> <span data-start="213.87" data-end="216.209">to the product, not so much a technical product,</span> <span data-start="216.209" data-end="220.53">but just having the opportunity to work on it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="220.53" data-end="223.86">I couldn't turn it down, didn't turn it down.</span> <span data-start="223.86" data-end="228.51">So in this non-technical organisation there was suddenly one technical</span> <span data-start="228.51" data-end="231.03">person and that was me.</span> <span data-start="231.03" data-end="237.079">So, you know, what did I do there, and what do you do there?</span> <span data-start="237.079" data-end="242.859">It was another single page app this time because it was 2014 where were on</span> <span data-start="242.859" data-end="247.319">to angular, and we had  —  it was an e-commerce that had</span> <span data-start="247.319" data-end="251.819">a big loading spinner every time you got there,</span> <span data-start="251.819" data-end="253.37">and I hated that.</span> <span data-start="253.37" data-end="256.62">I thought there was so much to be done to improve</span> <span data-start="256.62" data-end="261.519">it, and so I wanted us to move to service side rendering</span> <span data-start="261.519" data-end="268.19">of our pages, I wanted us to get away from angular and</span> <span data-start="268.19" data-end="272.87">rendering and that was one of my first things, looking</span> <span data-start="272.87" data-end="279.27">through the app, figuring out what test coverage was</span> <span data-start="279.27" data-end="284.22">necessary, and what  —  you know, if there were better</span> <span data-start="284.22" data-end="287.15">ways that we could be rendering our templates, like</span> <span data-start="287.15" data-end="289.83">anything that was in Hamil C, maybe, should have been in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="289.83" data-end="293.699">Hamil.</span> <span data-start="293.699" data-end="298.85">A lot of what I did there, because it was a non-technical organisation again, we had</span> <span data-start="298.85" data-end="304.539">print designers doing our web design, which resulted</span> <span data-start="304.539" data-end="309.47">in some very beautiful pages, but if you have ever</span> <span data-start="309.47" data-end="313.889">fought the battle of  —  well, the mobile design looks</span> <span data-start="313.889" data-end="317.099">like things as you have elements A, B and C, and then</span> <span data-start="317.099" data-end="322.271">on the desktop designs it is elements C, B and A, then you</span> <span data-start="322.271" data-end="325.49">know of my struggle at this company.</span> <span data-start="325.49" data-end="329.449">(Laughter) . It was a lot of: gosh, well, we can make it look prettier</span> <span data-start="329.449" data-end="333.139">at this great point, and at this point, but anywhere</span> <span data-start="333.139" data-end="336.71">in between we are utterly screwed and no one has considered</span> <span data-start="336.71" data-end="337.71">this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="337.71" data-end="341.16">Also, you know, one of the things when you are at</span> <span data-start="341.16" data-end="343.599">a non-technical company, you're probably not going to</span> <span data-start="343.599" data-end="347.81">get to work on big projects, interesting projects, the</span> <span data-start="347.81" data-end="350.77">kind of projects that get you up in the morning as an</span> <span data-start="350.77" data-end="351.77">engineer.</span> <span data-start="351.77" data-end="358.52">You know, when you're taking something and building a web framework that has never been</span> <span data-start="358.52" data-end="360.331">built before, you're not solving problems that have</span> <span data-start="360.331" data-end="363.31">never been solved before; you're building landing pages</span> <span data-start="363.31" data-end="369.74">for  —  to sell make-up, and I wanted to do that because</span> <span data-start="369.74" data-end="373.24">I identified with that product.</span> <span data-start="373.24" data-end="381.19">But it wasn't engineering; it was web design.</span> <span data-start="381.19" data-end="386.8">And I think generally, when you are the only person making these</span> <span data-start="386.8" data-end="391.68">decisions, you don't get to choose, basically.</span> <span data-start="391.68" data-end="395.22">So how did I respond to this?</span> <span data-start="395.22" data-end="397.5">I got more productive than I'd ever been in my</span> <span data-start="397.5" data-end="398.5">life before.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="398.5" data-end="403.25">I used to be a lazy developer, but I think a lot of us fall into software engineering,</span> <span data-start="403.25" data-end="406.849">because it is a pretty reliable line of work.</span> <span data-start="406.849" data-end="410.259">I've responded to being the only person who could fix things</span> <span data-start="410.259" data-end="414.96">by purely trying to fix them, getting up every day and</span> <span data-start="414.96" data-end="421.069">working on weekends, and I also  —  we had lunch & learns</span> <span data-start="421.069" data-end="424.1">at this company, and I hosted about three or four</span> <span data-start="424.1" data-end="429.47">lunch & learns on web development, and I got the social media</span> <span data-start="429.47" data-end="433.219">manager and the executive assistant building their</span> <span data-start="433.219" data-end="437.069">own personal websites and HTML and CSS, and this was was</span> <span data-start="437.069" data-end="441.449">the most gratifying thing possible, building empathy</span> <span data-start="441.449" data-end="445.97">for software engineering by making it more of my kind around</span> <span data-start="445.97" data-end="447.389">me.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="447.389" data-end="450.449">So if you have opportunity to do that, this is</span> <span data-start="450.449" data-end="453.46">possible, you know, maybe not for consultants who are</span> <span data-start="453.46" data-end="456.8">working, but definitely possible if you are a salary employee</span> <span data-start="456.8" data-end="460.419">working in the same physical location as these non-technical</span> <span data-start="460.419" data-end="461.49">staff members.</span> <span data-start="461.49" data-end="467.509">You know, there is an engineer inside everyone just waiting to come out.</span> <span data-start="467.509" data-end="473.629">And a lot of people recognise that engineering is sort of a better</span> <span data-start="473.629" data-end="476.55">thing than the one they may have, and there may</span> <span data-start="476.55" data-end="481.8">be people on your customer support team or on your marketing</span> <span data-start="481.8" data-end="485.88">team who really want what you have, which is the skills</span> <span data-start="485.88" data-end="489.05">that got you into the job that you have.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="489.05" data-end="494.97">And, you know, seek them out and use them.</span> <span data-start="494.97" data-end="502.55">So you're also now, when you are the only engineer, you're the only champion</span> <span data-start="502.55" data-end="504.46">that technology has.</span> <span data-start="504.46" data-end="509.5">You know, if you come from a traditional engineering environment, whoever</span> <span data-start="509.5" data-end="512.603">the sort of top engineer is, you know, your CTO, your</span> <span data-start="512.603" data-end="515.8">VP of engineering, that person's job in addition</span> <span data-start="515.8" data-end="519.21">to making decisions and managing the day-to-day work</span> <span data-start="519.21" data-end="522.969">of the department, they are always advocating for</span> <span data-start="522.969" data-end="528.56">technology to, you know, your C-level team or your owner</span> <span data-start="528.56" data-end="531.08">of the business.</span> <span data-start="531.08" data-end="536.75">And so if you have a powerful CTL, then that's somebody who can take the time to say,</span> <span data-start="536.75" data-end="540.639">"Well we need to spend a week writing tests for this,</span> <span data-start="540.639" data-end="547.41">or we spend to spend a month refactoring our order service."</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="547.41" data-end="551.12">If you don't have somebody like that as a buffer</span> <span data-start="551.12" data-end="554.29">between you and management, then you are suddenly the</span> <span data-start="554.29" data-end="555.73">buffer.</span> <span data-start="555.73" data-end="557.69">You are both the engine and the buffer between</span> <span data-start="557.69" data-end="560.76">the engine and what's trying to make the engine work.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="560.76" data-end="565.17">So you need a) to really really work on your communication</span> <span data-start="565.17" data-end="569.94">skills, and (b), you need to have a certain amount</span> <span data-start="569.94" data-end="575.07">of like gravitas and weight within the company.</span> <span data-start="575.07" data-end="578.88">Basically, that upper management needs to trust you that you're</span> <span data-start="578.88" data-end="581.66">not just fucking around when you say, "I need more</span> <span data-start="581.66" data-end="584.779">time to do this, to do it right."</span> <span data-start="584.779" data-end="589.29">And if they don't trust you, then you will not get that time, and your</span> <span data-start="589.29" data-end="591.329">product will suffer for it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="591.329" data-end="592.82">Pretty much inevitably.</span> <span data-start="592.82" data-end="596.98">On the other hand, there is a huge bright side which</span> <span data-start="596.98" data-end="600">is that as if you were the only engineer, nobody is</span> <span data-start="600" data-end="602.73">going to teach you how to be a better engineer at that</span> <span data-start="602.73" data-end="603.86">company.</span> <span data-start="603.86" data-end="609.69">So much of what we do as engineers on a team is the kind of unacknowledged labour of tutoring</span> <span data-start="609.69" data-end="614.279">other developers, and this happens pretty much automatically</span> <span data-start="614.279" data-end="616.49">when you're working next to somebody who does a similar</span> <span data-start="616.49" data-end="620.06">thing to you, even the most junior developer and the</span> <span data-start="620.06" data-end="624.3">most senior, the intersection, the diagram of their</span> <span data-start="624.3" data-end="627.86">knowledge is not the total sum of their knowledge, but</span> <span data-start="627.86" data-end="632.61">two people together know more than any one person could.</span> <span data-start="632.61" data-end="635.75">And so basically, by osmosis, turning to somebody and</span> <span data-start="635.75" data-end="642.279">saying "how do I do this?", and obviously things like</span> <span data-start="642.279" data-end="646.339">you're slack, you're IRAC, you end up learning quite</span> <span data-start="646.339" data-end="650.98">a bit, but when you're the only engineer, you don't have</span> <span data-start="650.98" data-end="651.98">that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="651.98" data-end="658.31">So maybe you get good at spreadsheets, because spreadsheets are the way your company communicates</span> <span data-start="658.31" data-end="659.31">with each other.</span> <span data-start="659.31" data-end="662.91">This was the case with me; if it didn't exist in a spreadsheet, it wasn't real.</span> <span data-start="662.91" data-end="667.01">Or maybe you get really good at e-mails or maybe try to</span> <span data-start="667.01" data-end="670.091">spend a lot of time with that print designer who is actually</span> <span data-start="670.091" data-end="674.73">really good at their job and understands colour and</span> <span data-start="674.73" data-end="676.75">spacing in a way that you never will.</span> <span data-start="676.75" data-end="680.671">But, you know, you can learn from them, you can learn from that, and you</span> <span data-start="680.671" data-end="681.671">should.</span> <span data-start="681.671" data-end="688.24">Because it is the most you are going to get in terms of</span> <span data-start="688.24" data-end="689.24">skill growth.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="689.24" data-end="694.74">We've all been there, sort of a solitary developer with stack overflow as their only</span> <span data-start="694.74" data-end="697.11">real friend.</span> <span data-start="697.11" data-end="699.68">You always have stack overflow but that's never where</span> <span data-start="699.68" data-end="702.329">you're going to do most of your skill.</span> </p>
