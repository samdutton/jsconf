data-end="132.41">interact through a browser recode we'd</span> <span data-start="132.41" data-end="134.51">like to have components for you right so</span> <span data-start="134.51" data-end="136.01">we have a toolkit of components that</span> <span data-start="136.01" data-end="138.38">allow to build coding experience in the</span> <span data-start="138.38"

data-end="146.63">use are not right so for instance when</span> <span data-start="146.63" data-end="148.4">it comes two teams of the right we have</span> <span data-start="148.4"

to</span> <span data-start="161.76" data-end="165.99">playground I hope we fixed it today how</span> <span data-start="165.99" data-end="169.11">many of you use tab script in in a</span> <span data-start="169.11" data-end="174.54">project we work on that so the good</span> <span data-start="174.54" data-end="176.01">thing is no tab script has been open</span> <span data-start="176.01" data-end="178.74">source lost October so it's really a tab</span> <span data-start="178.74" data-end="180.18">script plus the language services and</span> <span data-start="180.18" data-end="182.25">open source and I think I write highly</span> <span data-start="182.25" data-end="185.49">recommend try to play the taps key</span> <span data-start="185.49" data-end="187.17">playground to learn what this language</span> <span data-start="187.17" data-end="190.65">has to offer for you I think it uses</span> <span data-start="190.65" data-end="192.54">some dirty words like classes modules</span> <span data-start="192.54" data-end="196.5">and even interfaces 3 30 words but the</span> <span data-start="196.5" data-end="199.47">goal is really to reduce

data-start="204.39" data-end="208.41">reduce the developer stress that's my j</span> <span data-start="208.41" data-end="210.63">unit happen that's why patterns that's</span> <span data-start="210.63" data-end="212.88">why clips now we want to liberate</span> <span data-start="212.88" data-end="215.76">developers to have fun coding so the x 2</span> <span data-start="215.76" data-end="217.62">playground is yet another component that</span> <span data-start="217.62" data-end="220.8">is built on our stuff ok i will show you</span> <span data-start="220.8" data-end="222.45">later briefly it's probably one of the</span> <span data-start="222.45" data-end="223.89">most powerful playgrounds with</span> <span data-start="223.89" data-end="225.57">refactoring support and all kinds of</span> <span data-start="225.57" data-end="229.56">good stuff on a sure when you come to</span> <span data-start="229.56" data-end="231.72">script editing we are used and for that</span> <span data-start="231.72" data-end="233.31">i like to give you a quick demo that's</span> <span data-start="233.31" data-end="234.57">the one which uses most of our</span> <span data-start="234.57" data-end="237.15">components which using a workbench that</span> <span data-start="237.15" data-end="240.24">you can do coding off and a an app that</span> <span data-start="240.24" data-end="243.48">can put in the that you can put into at</span> <span data-start="243.48" data-end="246.48">the marketplace what you can do and</span> <span data-start="246.48" data-end="251.79">that's pretty cool for office 365 and</span> <span data-start="251.79" data-end="254.19">that's the only time i do some microsoft</span> <span data-start="254.19" data-end="258.84">product stuff but what you can do is you</span> <span data-start="258.84" data-end="263.01">can write extensions for excel overt in</span> <span data-start="263.01" data-end="267.15">html5 okay and for instance here i have</span> <span data-start="267.15" data-end="270.12">written one which allows me to bubble</span> <span data-start="270.12" data-end="273.03">some stock quotes right and that's the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="273.03" data-end="276.63">HTML which it which is extension i say</span> <span data-start="276.63" data-end="278.67">bubble it will go to the net and show me</span> <span data-start="278.67" data-end="282.229">all the stock quotes that's an okay</span> <span data-start="282.229" data-end="284.43">dangerous exercise because it might be</span> <span data-start="284.43" data-end="284.88">naked</span> <span data-start="284.88" data-end="288.6">but it's not too bad today huh it's good</span> <span data-start="288.6" data-end="290.49">so anyway so that's what you show what</span> <span data-start="290.49" data-end="292.17">you can do but the point is not that the</span> <span data-start="292.17" data-end="294.6">point is you can use html5 technology to</span> <span data-start="294.6" data-end="297.78">do that and the point is to try this out</span> <span data-start="297.78" data-end="299.22">you can do doll in the browser right</span> <span data-start="299.22" data-end="300.3">that's the point that's the scenario</span> <span data-start="300.3" data-end="302.25">getting started you want to try</span> <span data-start="302.25" data-end="304.37">something you do it in the browser</span> <span data-start="304.37" data-end="306.57">deployed if you like it you can upgrade</span> <span data-start="306.57" data-end="308.76">to the full ID and I can quickly show</span> <span data-start="308.76" data-end="320.7">you what you can do in the browser okay</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="320.71" data-end="326.4">I'm confused but that's fine it's not it</span> <span data-start="326.4" data-end="332.08">this PowerPoint come on don't drive me</span> <span data-start="332.08" data-end="336.19">nuts here we go well okay so let me a</span> <span data-start="336.19" data-end="338.23">people view but at least it's big enough</span> <span data-start="338.23" data-end="340.39">so you see now that's the workbench it</span> <span data-start="340.39" data-end="342.79">uses many of our kind of the toolkit of</span> <span data-start="342.79" data-end="345.1">developer components and it shows his</span> <span data-start="345.1" data-end="348.64">app is really html5 it has an HTML page</span> <span data-start="348.64" data-end="351.16">which load several scripts which has</span> <span data-start="351.16" data-end="355.33">some script logic right in the script I</span> <span data-start="355.33" data-end="362.72">have normal stuff live Kull validation</span> <span data-start="362.73" data-end="365.71">come on yeah you see squiggles all this</span> <span data-start="365.71" data-end="373.48">stuff you have a reference searching who</span> <span data-start="373.48" data-end="375.76">uses this stuff right you get it in</span> <span data-start="375.76" data-end="384.76">place you have refactoring it's really</span> <span data-start="384.76" data-end="386.38">challenging to live in this tight</span> <span data-start="386.38" data-end="389.47">resolution but you see if refactoring</span> <span data-start="389.47" data-end="393.45">all this kind of neat stuff you have</span> <span data-start="393.45" data-end="396.28">navigation help and so on right you can</span> <span data-start="396.28" data-end="401.23">navigate to stuff so it's pretty rich</span> <span data-start="401.23" data-end="408.25">right it has outlining step stuff right</span> <span data-start="408.25" data-end="411.1">things like that so this just to show</span> <span data-start="411.1" data-end="412.93">you right it's pretty rich experience so</span> <span data-start="412.93" data-end="414.4">we say even for getting started</span> <span data-start="414.4" data-end="415.78">experience you want to be rich and you</span> <span data-start="415.78" data-end="418.09">want to have a good coding experience</span> <span data-start="418.09" data-end="421.24">with all the comfort develop comfort use</span> <span data-start="421.24" data-end="424.48">from a browser so enough that's kind of</span> <span data-start="424.48" data-end="428.92">the background let's go over and talk</span> <span data-start="428.92" data-end="432.52">about what's behind it and how we grew</span> <span data-start="432.52" data-end="436">into it and our journey actually started</span> <span data-start="436" data-end="438.31">two years ago and we have grown in three</span> <span data-start="438.31" data-end="440.32">stages right and the challenge is really</span> <span data-start="440.32" data-end="443.62">how to become bigger and bigger and the</span> <span data-start="443.62" data-end="446.02">approach you try to use is what i would</span> <span data-start="446.02" data-end="448.24">call extreme triple extreme programming</span> <span data-start="448.24" data-end="450.85">right which means we don't use some</span> <span data-start="450.85" data-end="452.56">technology only until you</span> <span data-start="452.56" data-end="455.139">we needed until it really hurts right we</span> <span data-start="455.139" data-end="456.34">knew from the beginning yesterday's</span> <span data-start="456.34" data-end="458.919">require Chester's AMD which is cool but</span> <span data-start="458.919" data-end="461.38">we want to lean back and say let's wait</span> <span data-start="461.38" data-end="463.389">till you reuse it and then we dive in</span> <span data-start="463.389" data-end="465.16">right you want to feel the pain and then</span> <span data-start="465.16" data-end="467.68">feel good afterwards so and that's the</span> <span data-start="467.68" data-end="469.54">three stages know we have kind of small</span> <span data-start="469.54" data-end="471.669">when we grew quickly to fifty thousand</span> <span data-start="471.669" data-end="474.79">lines of code 100,000 and to debut two</span> <span data-start="474.79" data-end="475.87">hundred thousand lines of code which you</span> <span data-start="475.87" data-end="478.06">wrote ourselves plus test code with all</span> <span data-start="478.06" data-end="479.38">the libraries right this goes much</span> <span data-start="479.38" data-end="482.919">higher what I found interesting for each</span> <span data-start="482.919" data-end="485.979">of these stages we have some patterns</span> <span data-start="485.979" data-end="488.71">that we are alone to us so yes I confess</span> <span data-start="488.71" data-end="491.169">that cannot get fully get away v</span> <span data-start="491.169" data-end="493.6">patterns right in the smaller stage we</span> <span data-start="493.6" data-end="495.85">really concerned about modules classes</span> <span data-start="495.85" data-end="498.01">interfaces promises right how you manage</span> <span data-start="498.01" data-end="500.139">callbacks interface i will talk more</span> <span data-start="500.139" data-end="501.93">about that sounds a bit strange that</span> <span data-start="501.93" data-end="505.36">interfaces are powerful way to tell</span> <span data-start="505.36" data-end="509.74">others what expect and in particular it</span> <span data-start="509.74" data-end="511.99">helps you define the shape of things and</span> <span data-start="511.99" data-end="514">that's what it will show later models</span> <span data-start="514" data-end="516.159">and classes every project has to think</span> <span data-start="516.159" data-end="518.86">of which patterns they use for that in</span> <span data-start="518.86" data-end="521.08">the small stage what is interesting we</span> <span data-start="521.08" data-end="522.789">only use about ten percent of typescript</span> <span data-start="522.789" data-end="526.72">because we had some concerns right we</span> <span data-start="526.72"
