<p><span data-start="1.37" data-end="23.02">Hello JSConf! How are you?! Yes.</span> <span data-start="23.02" data-end="25.289">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="25.289" data-end="30.14">I'm Dominikus Baur and as you might of noticed I suffer from an all too common problem in</span> <span data-start="30.14" data-end="35.07">the tech world, which is yet another bearded dude.</span> <span data-start="35.07" data-end="40.539">And, here's my totally scientific analysis of the JSConf speake speaker profile pictures</span> <span data-start="40.539" data-end="41.539">on the web site.</span> <span data-start="41.539" data-end="47.489">As you can see, I'm not alone, there are so many of us, we should probably form a support</span> <span data-start="47.489" data-end="51.64">group or something or just shave those damn things off, I don't know.</span> <span data-start="51.64" data-end="57.39">So, any ways what does this bearded guy do? I'm based in Munich, Germany and I work as</span> <span data-start="57.39" data-end="64.18">a data visualization freelancer, here are some of the projects that I did in the recent</span> <span data-start="64.18" data-end="72.02">time I had a bat better life index for OECD, I did sell if I city, which is an analysis</span> <span data-start="72.02" data-end="80.69">of the Selfie phenomenon, and also visits here which is the visualization for personal</span> <span data-start="80.69" data-end="81.69">travels.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="81.69" data-end="84.96">And you can find them all on my web site, so check them out.</span> <span data-start="84.96" data-end="86.98">They're of course web‑based.</span> <span data-start="86.98" data-end="93.27">All right, so let's start, I guess most of you know data visualization, otherwise you</span> <span data-start="93.27" data-end="94.27">wouldn't be here.</span> <span data-start="94.27" data-end="99.75">The basic idea is to turn complex data sets into visually representations and if they're</span> <span data-start="99.75" data-end="105.52">done right then you can easily spot patterns and understand the underlying data.</span> <span data-start="105.52" data-end="110.87">And, this year, for example, is a pretty famous and old one, and it depicts Napoleons march</span> <span data-start="110.87" data-end="112.78">to Moscow.</span> <span data-start="112.78" data-end="117.8">In this graphic you can see the course that the army took, you can see it's shrinking</span> <span data-start="117.8" data-end="120.42">size, so people are dying there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="120.42" data-end="124.57">And you can also see the temperature down at the bottom which might give you a clue</span> <span data-start="124.57" data-end="127.6">why the army was shrinking.</span> <span data-start="127.6" data-end="132.459">So you have lots and lots of information in an easily digestible format you can argue</span> <span data-start="132.459" data-end="134.89">that it's somewhat beautiful.</span> <span data-start="134.89" data-end="142.56">So, that makes data V I S for p perfect tool for portable devices think of all the data</span> <span data-start="142.56" data-end="148.849">you're producing or have to work with while on the go, and visualizations spares you from</span> <span data-start="148.849" data-end="153.909">working with the raw numbers and gives you a quick overview to find out what's important.</span> <span data-start="153.909" data-end="160.739">And with displays becoming even smaller now, maybe even watch sized, it can quickly show</span> <span data-start="160.739" data-end="166.959">you what's relevant or interesting to you without forcing you to look at a spread sheet.</span> <span data-start="166.959" data-end="173.12">Okay, so how do we go about building these things? Of course, there's the native approach,</span> <span data-start="173.12" data-end="178.639">but, as you all know that's a real pain to do it like that, so you have to support IOS</span> <span data-start="178.639" data-end="184.049">of coursing you also have to support Andriod and they're completely different, once you</span> <span data-start="184.049" data-end="190.209">actually visit the zoo and try to do something for windows phone or Blackberry or whatever</span> <span data-start="190.209" data-end="197.849">they are all called, you're in a complete mess and porting code isn't easily possible.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="197.849" data-end="202.819">So what better way to solve this problem than going to the web.</span> <span data-start="202.819" data-end="209.84">So, the web has come so far in the past years that it's viable to develop full blown applications</span> <span data-start="209.84" data-end="219.2">even for mobile devices, especially news organizations are very keen to create visualizations and</span> <span data-start="219.2" data-end="223.63">attractive visualizations that work across devices, of course, so here's a couple of</span> <span data-start="223.63" data-end="228.79">examples from the New York times who are doing an amazing job out there, but there are other</span> <span data-start="228.79" data-end="236.2">teams like the Guardian Washington Post and so on that are also creating really cool stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="236.2" data-end="243.529">Okay, so, what I'll try today is I'll try to give you a quick crash course of developing</span> <span data-start="243.529" data-end="248.23">data visualizations for mobile devices in 20 minutes or less.</span> <span data-start="248.23" data-end="253.76">First, I'll give you a quick overview, I'll talk a little bit about responsive web design</span> <span data-start="253.76" data-end="259.48">and how that already gets us halfway to our target, I would say.</span> <span data-start="259.48" data-end="267.33">But, it's also interesting to pursue mobile first approach to focus on the strengths that</span> <span data-start="267.33" data-end="273.86">you actually get from having a portable device, that's also touch controlled, which lets you</span> <span data-start="273.86" data-end="276.19">do much more interesting stuff.</span> <span data-start="276.19" data-end="281.31">And finally, of course, the big issue, I would say in this whole topic is interray action,</span> <span data-start="281.31" data-end="289.639">so how do you best support an interaction on those tiny portable screens.</span> <span data-start="289.639" data-end="298.72">If you need more inspirations for this topic, here's two web sites that can give you that,</span> <span data-start="298.72" data-end="308.1">so mobileV.is and the other one is mobileinfov Uzi.com, and both just collections of mobile</span> <span data-start="308.1" data-end="313.12">visualizations, you can look at those, they're ever growing and there's really great stuff</span> <span data-start="313.12" data-end="314.94">there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="314.94" data-end="316.76">Okay.</span> <span data-start="316.76" data-end="326.06">Of what are the main differences between desktop and mobile? So first, the obvious one, interaction</span> <span data-start="326.06" data-end="334.04">happens via touch instead of a mouse, so, we no longer have this one single minuscule</span> <span data-start="334.04" data-end="341.59">cursor, but we have potentially multiple fingers that are overlapping everything on your screen</span> <span data-start="341.59" data-end="348.24">and just creating a mess, and we have very specific results of that, for example, we're</span> <span data-start="348.24" data-end="354.419">losing hovering, we're getting something else like hovering, I'll talk about that in a minute.</span> <span data-start="354.419" data-end="360.21">There's really a huge difference between that, and then, second of course, we have different</span> <span data-start="360.21" data-end="365.91">screen sizes and formats, so with a laptop, or a desktop, we usually have relatively low</span> <span data-start="365.91" data-end="375.13">Res, large screens, 16 by 10 or 16 by 9 aspect ratio in landscape and on mobile devises you</span> <span data-start="375.13" data-end="380.13">have your high resolution, very, very small portrait oriented screens.</span> <span data-start="380.13" data-end="386.31">And, this of course changes how you go about information layout, density, things like that.</span> <span data-start="386.31" data-end="394.539">All right, if you want to develop data Vis for the web, I remember mend one library that</span> <span data-start="394.539" data-end="398.949">you might have heard about today, already\h‑‑ I'll recommend one library you might have</span> <span data-start="398.949" data-end="405.411">heard about today already, we had this fantastic talk before where we saw there's a huge, another</span> <span data-start="405.411" data-end="412.61">zoo out there with all of those various types of charting libraries that let you do crazy</span> <span data-start="412.61" data-end="413.61">things.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="413.61" data-end="420.06">All in different ways, but really, D3 is kind of the lowest common denominator, so people</span> <span data-start="420.06" data-end="422.67">that are doing data V I S know of it.</span> <span data-start="422.67" data-end="428.969">So who here has heard of it? Who has used it? Cool.</span> <span data-start="428.969" data-end="432.84">So, it really is pretty common.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="432.84" data-end="438.12">It's mostly being developed by one guy, Mike post dock working at the New York times, I'm</span> <span data-start="438.12" data-end="445.03">not sure if that gives them an unfair advantage, yeah, who knows, Mike is doing an amazing</span> <span data-start="445.03" data-end="453.77">job, he's producing lots and lots of example for 3 D if you go to BL.ocks.org, you can</span> <span data-start="453.77" data-end="461.689">find hundreds and hundreds of things with really really amazing stuff in there, D3 has</span> <span data-start="461.689" data-end="468.009">a very, very active community, and still being developed and hasn't been abandoned two years</span> <span data-start="468.009" data-end="471.06">ago or something like that.</span> <span data-start="471.06" data-end="476.09">What's really great about those examples here, usually they work directly on mobile, so if</span> <span data-start="476.09" data-end="482.389">you open up this page on your smartphone, for example and try one of these, it usually</span> <span data-start="482.389" data-end="489.8">just works because the interaction issue isn't one for D3, so if you want to go from mouse</span> <span data-start="489.8" data-end="495.56">to touch, usually you only have to change your vent handlers a bit, so usually on a</span> <span data-start="495.56" data-end="501.219">desktop you would write something like that, on mouse down, do something.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="501.219" data-end="507.61">And for touch, those events, those vent names change to touch star, touch move, touch end</span> <span data-start="507.61" data-end="513.639">instead of the mouse equivalents, of course, those events can appear multiple times because</span> <span data-start="513.639" data-end="519.709">you have multiple fingers, then you can keep track of those fingers and do pinching and</span> <span data-start="519.709" data-end="520.709">stuff.</span> <span data-start="520.709" data-end="525.67">The nice thing is that most of the three automatically does that, so you have certain behaviors that</span> <span data-start="525.67" data-end="530.61">automatically support pinching for example so interaction really spent an issue, what's</span> <span data-start="530.61" data-end="532.14">anker shoe is screen size.</span> <span data-start="532.14" data-end="537.89">3 D leaves all the scaling to the developer, pretty much.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="537.89" data-end="544.26">And that means, of course, that your visualization then becomes really tiny on a small screen,</span> <span data-start="544.26" data-end="549.73">so those are screen shots from Bl.ocks.org, as they would appear on your smartphone, imagine</span> <span data-start="549.73" data-end="556.2">that thing a little bit smaller, and especially with like, the tree map on the right here,</span> <span data-start="556.2" data-end="560.579">you can really read anything or do anything with it.</span> <span data-start="560.579" data-end="562.24">So scaling is an issue.</span> <span data-start="562.24" data-end="566.97">And, of course, what codew we do when we want to have our web sites scale, right? We go</span> <span data-start="566.97" data-end="574.029">to responsive web design, which is fantastic, so basically, you want to have a page that</span> <span data-start="574.029" data-end="581.149">adjusts to the size of your view port, and, we can apply those same principles that we</span> <span data-start="581.149" data-end="588.139">get in responsive web design to visualizations, of course, so you grab your favorite responsive</span> <span data-start="588.139" data-end="594.389">web design framework like foundation or bootstrap or whatever, then your chart just becomes</span> <span data-start="594.389" data-end="601.269">one of those boxes in your grid, and you give it a fixed width and then it's just based</span> <span data-start="601.269" data-end="608.769">on the device's screen size so that's really useful I'll show you an example from my own</span> <span data-start="608.769" data-end="611.56">work where we use that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="611.56" data-end="618.449">So the OCED willing been project was something that I did with Moritz Stefaner, you might</span> <span data-start="618.449" data-end="627.079">know OECD, it's a big organization that collects data on well‑being and how people feel worldwide.</span> <span data-start="627.079" data-end="633.51">And this project here regional well being focuses on certain regions on the globe so</span> <span data-start="633.51" data-end="638.769">you can check out how well people are doing in certain aspects so we have things like</span> <span data-start="638.769" data-end="643.81">safety, the job market, education and so on.</span> <span data-start="643.81" data-end="648.899">And they asked us to create a visualization that lets people easily explore this data,</span> <span data-start="648.899" data-end="653.551">our idea is to focus on a certain region and then let people explore from there, and what</span> <span data-start="653.551" data-end="658.41">better region for that than the one where people actually level at the moment, so this</span> <span data-start="658.41" data-end="666.3">page starts with your home region, then you get this nice visualization that shows the</span> <span data-start="666.3" data-end="669.67">various aspects of well being.</span> <span data-start="669.67" data-end="675.99">You get a list of similar regions to your own which sometimes is very surprising, and</span> <span data-start="675.99" data-end="683.8">then down at the bottom of the page you get an overview of those of quality factors and</span> <span data-start="683.8" data-end="692.66">details so you can compare, for example, safety to other regions in your country and so on.</span> <span data-start="692.66" data-end="698.88">Okay, so you can just Bruce that, you can just jump from region to region, adds we didn't</span> <span data-start="698.88" data-end="703.91">have the budget to create three different web sites for three different form factors</span> <span data-start="703.91" data-end="711.889">we made the whole thing responsive, and if you're trying it on your tablet or your smartphone</span> <span data-start="711.889" data-end="714.76">even you might see that it should just work.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="714.76" data-end="719.949">And hear's kind of the underlying magic so all of those pink boxes are our grid elements</span> <span data-start="719.949" data-end="729.42">in bootstrap, and, yeah, by just putting those visualizations into those boxes you actually</span> <span data-start="729.42" data-end="732.05">get the whole responsiveness for free.</span> <span data-start="732.05" data-end="738.11">And, depending on your screen size, of course, the layout changes some elements become bigger</span> <span data-start="738.11" data-end="744.889">on smartphones for example, and as you can see, like those three detail views in a row</span> <span data-start="744.889" data-end="749.88">become two and then one on a smartphone, so it actually works pretty well.</span> <span data-start="749.88" data-end="755.35">But, of course, that's not everything, there are those little details that you learn on</span> <span data-start="755.35" data-end="758.63">the go, on the job.</span> <span data-start="758.63" data-end="760.48">And I'll talk about those a bit.</span> <span data-start="760.48" data-end="767.32">So one thing is drawing a visualization is usually quite heavy on the CPU and the battery</span> <span data-start="767.32" data-end="768.71">and so on.</span> <span data-start="768.71" data-end="772.88">And you don't want to dill your browser tab just because you decide that you want to redraw</span> <span data-start="772.88" data-end="778.889">your visualization every time the user adjusts the window size by one fix el.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="778.889" data-end="782.959">So that's when something like debounce for example or throttle comes in really handy,</span> <span data-start="782.959" data-end="787.699">I usually use the underscore version, but there are, of course other implementations</span> <span data-start="787.699" data-end="788.699">out there.</span> <span data-start="788.699" data-end="794.59">The basic ideas behind those debouncers is that you give it a function, in our case,</span> <span data-start="794.59" data-end="803.36">render, and this function, is at most, called every resize, refresh, rate, if you set that</span> <span data-start="803.36" data-end="813.81">to 300 milliseconds then it's only drawn every third of a second and not like hundreds of</span> <span data-start="813.81" data-end="816.31">times per second.</span> <span data-start="816.31" data-end="821.36">Which is quite useful and you might also see that if you actually try it on your laptop</span> <span data-start="821.36" data-end="826.37">and adjust the size of the window you see that the visualization takes a bit to be redraw,</span> <span data-start="826.37" data-end="831.1">but at least that keeps us from crashing the browser window, which is nice.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="831.1" data-end="837">Of all right, another thing are meta view ports, so that's something you want to set</span> <span data-start="837" data-end="838.149">on mobile devices.</span> <span data-start="838.149" data-end="845.029">It's just in the header of your HTML, and there's this meta tag called view port.</span> <span data-start="845.029" data-end="852.029">And you can define certain things how mobile Safari or mobile Chrome displays your web</span> <span data-start="852.029" data-end="853.029">site.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="853.029" data-end="859.48">You can say for example width equals the vice width the web site is initially as big as</span> <span data-start="859.48" data-end="863.089">your screen, from the width.</span> <span data-start="863.089" data-end="867.64">And you also want to set the initial scale to one, so it's zoomed to one hundred percent.</span> <span data-start="867.64" data-end="873.22">Sometimes it might be useful to say something like user scalable equals no, which means</span> <span data-start="873.22" data-end="880.089">that people can't enlarge your page by pinching.</span> <span data-start="880.089" data-end="883.05">Depends on the application if you want to did that.</span> <span data-start="883.05" data-end="889.85">One last thing when you come to responsive visualizations are SVGU view port, most are</span> <span data-start="889.85" data-end="898.709">build in SVG, I guess all the 3 D examples use SVG, usually.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="898.709" data-end="904.19">And what's nice about SVG is that as the names scalable vector graphics implies, it's actually</span> <span data-start="904.19" data-end="909.72">a vector graphic so it can easily be scaled and you can control that using CSS.</span> <span data-start="909.72" data-end="916.41">So with the view box, attribute here you can define your own virtual coordinate system</span> <span data-start="916.41" data-end="923.66">within the SVG, so here the coordinate system goes from zero zero to 500 by 250.</span> <span data-start="923.66" data-end="930.199">And, everything that you draw within the SVG is then scaled according to this coordinate</span> <span data-start="930.199" data-end="932.42">system.</span> <span data-start="932.42" data-end="937">And what you also want to do is you want to define that the aspect ratio of your virtual</span> <span data-start="937" data-end="943.019">coordinate system stays the same, and that's what the second attribute does, preserve aspect</span> <span data-start="943.019" data-end="945.3">ratio.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="945.3" data-end="950.91">There's actually two parameters, the second one meet means your SVG is always scaled so</span> <span data-start="950.91" data-end="954.39">that it's everything is visible and nothing is cut off.</span> <span data-start="954.39" data-end="964.75">And, the first one, the XMidYMin thing, means your SVG view port should be centered on the</span> <span data-start="964.75" data-end="973.089">horizontal access and should be aligned with the minimum on the Y access.</span> <span data-start="973.089" data-end="974.089">So it looks like this.</span> <span data-start="974.089" data-end="979.48">So if the SVG actually fits into your window, everything is fine.</span> <span data-start="979.48" data-end="989.48">And here it's a bit different, here is where you actually get horizontally centered box.</span> <span data-start="989.48" data-end="991.199">Which is your SVG.</span> <span data-start="991.199" data-end="996.019">And, it's also kind of ary site in web development, so you get that for free if you set those</span> <span data-start="996.019" data-end="997.29">attributes.</span> <span data-start="997.29" data-end="1005.16">Okay, but let's dive a little bit more into details, when it comes to mobile data visualization.</span> <span data-start="1005.16" data-end="1011.29">What happens when you actually approach this whole problem from a mobile first design perspective.</span> <span data-start="1011.29" data-end="1013.18">And see what comes up.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1013.18" data-end="1020.569">So, first of all, usually, the person that uses your visualization on the smartphone</span> <span data-start="1020.569" data-end="1023.86">is like this woman here.</span> <span data-start="1023.86" data-end="1029.42">So, they're in the middle of something, they're not in the mid for any of your fancy sha Nan</span> <span data-start="1029.42" data-end="1033.97">gans, they want the data as wick quickly as possible.</span> <span data-start="1033.97" data-end="1040.13">So, I would say always when it comes to mobile interaction design, just going to let that</span> <span data-start="1040.13" data-end="1042.44">loop.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1042.44" data-end="1046.689">When it comes to mobile interaction design, think about what's the task of the person</span> <span data-start="1046.689" data-end="1051.76">that's using your App or visualization or whatever, and try to support that as well</span> <span data-start="1051.76" data-end="1054.05">as possible.</span> <span data-start="1054.05" data-end="1059.75">And what's rally helpful with designing something like that is, sorry, I have to take your picture</span> <span data-start="1059.75" data-end="1062.37">away now, guys.</span> <span data-start="1062.37" data-end="1067.04">What's rally helpful is that you can get certain aspects of the concepts using the new HTML</span> <span data-start="1067.04" data-end="1075.07">5 APIs, when is Geo location, who's used that already if yes, awesome, this one's really</span> <span data-start="1075.07" data-end="1083.61">great, it basically gives you the user's current position, global position in this little amount</span> <span data-start="1083.61" data-end="1088.42">of code, so you just call get current position, you give it a call back and hopefully you</span> <span data-start="1088.42" data-end="1092.23">get some latitude and longitude.</span> <span data-start="1092.23" data-end="1097.72">So we use that as well in the regional well being project, so if you open it up on your</span> <span data-start="1097.72" data-end="1103.73">smartphone our your browser then you get something like this pop up here that asks you if the</span> <span data-start="1103.73" data-end="1109.46">web site is allowed to use the current location.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1109.46" data-end="1114.52">So you can also see that it's actually much more privacy conscious than server base solutions</span> <span data-start="1114.52" data-end="1118.891">that just do it based on your I P address without asking you.</span> <span data-start="1118.891" data-end="1127.02">Once you set that up, you get the visualization starts on your home region or the region that</span> <span data-start="1127.02" data-end="1131.81">you're current live at, so it should show Berlin, right now, if you tried.</span> <span data-start="1131.81" data-end="1135.09">And that's really nice, you adopt have to pick that from a list or anything, jousted</span> <span data-start="1135.09" data-end="1137.61">get it for free.</span> <span data-start="1137.61" data-end="1142.29">Another aspect when developing for mobile is of course per to mans and battery drain.</span> <span data-start="1142.29" data-end="1150.049">So, you want to have fast beautiful graphics, of course, but you also want to be careful</span> <span data-start="1150.049" data-end="1154.39">that you're not actually draining the battery in the process, so there are a couple of graphics</span> <span data-start="1154.39" data-end="1159.52">technologies that you might want to use, so SVG, I already mentioned that it's vector</span> <span data-start="1159.52" data-end="1168.14">based, it's DOM integration, tie certain events to elements, but it's somewhat slower than</span> <span data-start="1168.14" data-end="1170.89">other alternatives I would say.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1170.89" data-end="1177">Faster is canvas, which just gives you a plain canvas and you can draw on that.</span> <span data-start="1177" data-end="1181.11">But, kind of a down side is that it's very low level, so you actually is trough draw</span> <span data-start="1181.11" data-end="1186.33">on your canvas, you don't just say, okay, here's a rectangle and it's going to stay</span> <span data-start="1186.33" data-end="1188.49">there, you have to draw it every time.</span> <span data-start="1188.49" data-end="1195.11">You also don't get a DOM, you have to figure out where the user now tapped.</span> <span data-start="1195.11" data-end="1200.68">It's kind of the same with webGL, which is probably faster than Canvas and able to do</span> <span data-start="1200.68" data-end="1207.971">D, which is awesome, but, again (3 D) it's low level, it has no DOM, so basically, pick</span> <span data-start="1207.971" data-end="1210.76">your poison.</span> <span data-start="1210.76" data-end="1218.13">By now web GM is supported inment iOS 8, so it's viable to use that.</span> <span data-start="1218.13" data-end="1225.039">All right, when we talk about interaction on mobile devices the main problem is probably</span> <span data-start="1225.039" data-end="1230.931">the fat finger problem, which means that you're using those things here to interact with interact</span> <span data-start="1230.931" data-end="1237.09">with anything on your smartphone, most smartphone company recommend minimum size for on screen</span> <span data-start="1237.09" data-end="1244.1">elements, apple says 44 by 44 fix els, but, yeah, it (Pixels) it varies, but it's always</span> <span data-start="1244.1" data-end="1246.13">something in that range.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1246.13" data-end="1251.529">You have to make sure all your interactive elements are big enough so people can interact</span> <span data-start="1251.529" data-end="1253.25">with them.</span> <span data-start="1253.25" data-end="1256.33">Sometimes you can avoid the fat finger problem all together.</span> <span data-start="1256.33" data-end="1263.72">So in the Selfie city project that I did with Manovich, Stefner and a couple of other amazing</span> <span data-start="1263.72" data-end="1264.929">people.</span> <span data-start="1264.929" data-end="1273.64">We looked t a the differences in Selfie taking practices across cities worldwide.</span> <span data-start="1273.64" data-end="1279.21">And part of the project was self exploratory that you can see here, where you can explore</span> <span data-start="1279.21" data-end="1284.89">the data set, you have filters at the top where you can tilter the Selfie collection</span> <span data-start="1284.89" data-end="1292.11">based on head orientations, based on glass, smiles, city and age and stuff like that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1292.11" data-end="1294.73">Then you get the results at bottom.</span> <span data-start="1294.73" data-end="1299.13">And what was good for us was that everything was big enough that you could just use it</span> <span data-start="1299.13" data-end="1304.03">on your finger so it kind of\h‑‑ with your finger so it worked out of the box.</span> <span data-start="1304.03" data-end="1309.74">But, of course, the problem is what do you do when you want to show really high resolution</span> <span data-start="1309.74" data-end="1312.12">visualizations that are still interactive.</span> <span data-start="1312.12" data-end="1315.98">And again there, are a couple of tricks that you can use.</span> <span data-start="1315.98" data-end="1320.86">Probably the most common trick is invisible touch areas.</span> <span data-start="1320.86" data-end="1326.04">So the idea here is that we have to scatter part and we want to have people being able</span> <span data-start="1326.04" data-end="1332.63">to tap on the circles, and of course they're much too small, so we create those not very</span> <span data-start="1332.63" data-end="1339.5">invisible here, circles, the orange ones, so mostly you just set the opacity to zero,</span> <span data-start="1339.5" data-end="1344.919">give them a high Z index so they're on top of everything, and made osituation absolute</span> <span data-start="1344.919" data-end="1351.57">and stuff like that, you add your touch event listener and then, of course, those s have</span> <span data-start="1351.57" data-end="1354.85">to know which part of the data they represent.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1354.85" data-end="1361.2">And based on that, you can then have those things be interactive without actually displaying</span> <span data-start="1361.2" data-end="1362.2">them.</span> <span data-start="1362.2" data-end="1367.779">But, of course, as you can see, it doesn't always work, even here in this very simple</span> <span data-start="1367.779" data-end="1375.22">example we have this overlap between two circles, what happens more often is that you just create</span> <span data-start="1375.22" data-end="1382.39">a full rectangle, another invisible reck tank opacity zero, put it on top of your graph</span> <span data-start="1382.39" data-end="1387.169">and then every time you have a touch vent you try to figure out, okay, which part of</span> <span data-start="1387.169" data-end="1390.429">the data is the finger closest too or something.</span> <span data-start="1390.429" data-end="1396.09">And then I show the tool tip or filter or whatever.</span> <span data-start="1396.09" data-end="1402.69">And talking about tool tips is one of the main problems when it comes to touch‑based</span> <span data-start="1402.69" data-end="1409.39">visualizations, because as I said, we no longer have hovering really with fingers, but tool</span> <span data-start="1409.39" data-end="1413.84">tips are really ubiquitous in visualizations, they're pretty much in everything because</span> <span data-start="1413.84" data-end="1420.57">it's such a nice solution to display details on demand by showing a little tool tip.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1420.57" data-end="1427.75">And, in mobile Safari for example we kind of have hovering, but it's weird and you probably</span> <span data-start="1427.75" data-end="1435.21">already seen that, so if you tap on an element that has some mouse over event defined once,</span> <span data-start="1435.21" data-end="1442.059">it triggers the mouse over event and then when you tap again it's a mouse down.</span> <span data-start="1442.059" data-end="1447.13">And for most people that is just totally confusing because they tapped on something and then</span> <span data-start="1447.13" data-end="1453.149">the tool tip pops up and they're not really sure are they able to tap again or not.</span> <span data-start="1453.149" data-end="1455.23">So I can't really recommend that.</span> <span data-start="1455.23" data-end="1463.85">A better solution is to have always on tool tip, always visible but tied to some type</span> <span data-start="1463.85" data-end="1470.89">of interaction, in this example from the New York Times for example, we have two solutions,</span> <span data-start="1470.89" data-end="1476.26">first we have a little tool tip there that's tied to the slider and you can just move that</span> <span data-start="1476.26" data-end="1478.82">around.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1478.82" data-end="1484.78">And you also have here this banner like thing at the bottom that's always visible and shows</span> <span data-start="1484.78" data-end="1486.51">you information.</span> <span data-start="1486.51" data-end="1492.41">So that's\h‑‑ I would say that's probably a good solution to have something like that.</span> <span data-start="1492.41" data-end="1497.46">Then of course you don't only have down sides you can do ahassing things with multi‑touch</span> <span data-start="1497.46" data-end="1501.419">indigestual interactions, so one idea\h‑‑ gestureal interactions, one idea is to keep</span> <span data-start="1501.419" data-end="1507.47">it on one side and decide what to do with it.</span> <span data-start="1507.47" data-end="1509.65">Rotation scaling.</span> <span data-start="1509.65" data-end="1515.529">Frameworks can help you, two examples from the three, and those handle multi‑touch</span> <span data-start="1515.529" data-end="1519.679">automatically so if you open them on your tablet for example, you can pinch to zoom</span> <span data-start="1519.679" data-end="1525.52">this world map and you can move multiple circles around using multiple fingers, if you want</span> <span data-start="1525.52" data-end="1531.35">to be more fancy about that, you probably want the use some gesture library like codeJ</span> <span data-start="1531.35" data-end="1537.98">or hammer J several, those detect full gestures so you get stuff like swiping, pinching, rotating</span> <span data-start="1537.98" data-end="1541.82">and long press and so on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1541.82" data-end="1545.409">So you can go totally craze crazy with that.</span> <span data-start="1545.409" data-end="1556.23">And if you're building something with touch first in mind, then you can kind of look at</span> <span data-start="1556.23" data-end="1561.53">your visualization as something that's deformidable, some physical object that you can play around</span> <span data-start="1561.53" data-end="1568.52">with, that's what I try to do in this research project here.</span> <span data-start="1568.52" data-end="1577.19">\h‑‑ which isn't playing.</span> <span data-start="1577.19" data-end="1587.99">Here we go, that's touch wave.</span> <span data-start="1587.99" data-end="1596.15">In touch wave we had a screen graph you could just manipulate it using your fingers, as</span> <span data-start="1596.15" data-end="1603.38">you can see you can just stretch it, enlarge it, double tap to change the layout, so we</span> <span data-start="1603.38" data-end="1611.41">went as far with the metaphor as we thought useful.</span> <span data-start="1611.41" data-end="1616.92">And if you really want to do that, so, that project is already two years old, so I had</span> <span data-start="1616.92" data-end="1624.909">to implement it natively.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1624.909" data-end="1635.96">But, by now it should probably even work on the web.</span> <span data-start="1635.96" data-end="1639.74">Okay, here we go.</span> <span data-start="1639.74" data-end="1645.73">All right, something 245 you can do right now is you can use, for example, the device</span> <span data-start="1645.73" data-end="1650.63">orientation events, which is really cool, so those actually give you the orientation</span> <span data-start="1650.63" data-end="1656.07">of the device in space we've already heard about\h‑‑ talked about that yesterday,</span> <span data-start="1656.07" data-end="1657.07">which is really neat.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1657.07" data-end="1662.75">So you can use that for example to build one of those little demos here, you can check</span> <span data-start="1662.75" data-end="1668.96">it out on your smartphone, you this little globe, when you orient your device in a certain</span> <span data-start="1668.96" data-end="1674.38">way, then it spins around, which is a neat effect, you can probably do all kinds of crazy</span> <span data-start="1674.38" data-end="1679.99">things when it comes to visualization, 3 D maybe even though that's somewhat of a four</span> <span data-start="1679.99" data-end="1682.74">letter word in the community.</span> <span data-start="1682.74" data-end="1688.279">Yeah, you can build that right in your browser.</span> <span data-start="1688.279" data-end="1694.47">That's it for me, here are links to some example, on my web site as well.</span> <span data-start="1694.47" data-end="1698.649">Talk to me on Twitter, send me an e‑mail, or talk to me later in person.</span> <span data-start="1698.649" data-end="1699.649">Thank you.</span> </p>
