data-end="517.88">we wanted to be reduced kind of scale up</span> <span data-start="517.88" data-end="519.889">and down nicely but not necessarily</span> <span data-start="519.889" data-end="522.349">proportionally just growing like nuts or</span> <span data-start="522.349" data-end="525.11">getting smaller we wanted to be kind of</span> <span data-start="525.11" data-end="527.54">in control now the problem is following</span> <span data-start="527.54" data-end="528.829">now we could use something like this</span> <span data-start="528.829" data-end="531.079">right okay just set the font size being</span> <span data-start="531.079" data-end="535.16">the calc of 1 M plus 1 plus 1 BW right</span> <span data-start="535.16" data-end="538.339">we we double use of course 1% of the</span> <span data-start="538.339" data-end="540.92">viewport width right now that works but</span> <span data-start="540.92" data-end="542.87">then in that case 1 am why do we</span> <span data-start="542.87" data-end="546.08">it well because we want to have kind of</span> <span data-start="546.08" data-end="548.36">minimum font size right that's okay</span> <span data-start="548.36" data-end="551.36">that helps us but not quite now now we</span> <span data-start="551.36" data-end="553.73">can do something like this when we just</span> <span data-start="553.73" data-end="556.94">included like for VW and for the agent</span> <span data-start="556.94" data-end="558.83">to be mean for example and we'll all</span> <span data-start="558.83" data-end="561.89">scale up and down but what if we're</span> <span data-start="561.89" data-end="564.83">talking about the pro graphics scale we</span> <span data-start="564.83" data-end="566.839">don't just want something to grow we</span> <span data-start="566.839" data-end="568.82">want to have a specific kind of not</span> <span data-start="568.82" data-end="572">breakpoints but specific docking points</span> <span data-start="572" data-end="574.04">where the type will grow to wards so</span> <span data-start="574.04" data-end="577.339">converge towards right so what if we</span> <span data-start="577.339" data-end="579.8">wanted to choose a font size of 16</span> <span data-start="579.8" data-end="581.66">pixels at the screen resolution of 400</span> <span data-start="581.66" data-end="584.029">pixels and then we wanted to transition</span> <span data-start="584.029" data-end="588.05">to 24 pixels at a resolution of 800 can</span> <span data-start="588.05" data-end="595.43">we do it without the break point a lot</span> <span data-start="595.43" data-end="596.9">of excitement in the room oh great all</span> <span data-start="596.9" data-end="598.46">right no but seriously can indeed have</span> <span data-start="598.46" data-end="600.41">any like a problem like this before or</span> <span data-start="600.41" data-end="602.51">design a country wants to have a nice</span> <span data-start="602.51" data-end="605.3">typographic scale like 1/3 or minus 3rd</span> <span data-start="605.3" data-end="609.2">or whatever and you have to build it how</span> <span data-start="609.2" data-end="611.36">would you build it so it scales down and</span> <span data-start="611.36" data-end="620.029">are beautifully everywhere no don't have</span> <span data-start="620.029" data-end="621.589">but no actually it's a bit more</span> <span data-start="621.589" data-end="623.839">complicated I just need to use a little</span> <span data-start="623.839" data-end="627.589">formula to make it work so that a second</span> <span data-start="627.589" data-end="629.779">that's okay that's okay it's going to</span> <span data-start="629.779" data-end="631.58">fun in reality it's not that complicated</span> <span data-start="631.58" data-end="633.8">so of course what do you have again we</span> <span data-start="633.8" data-end="635.54">have a special boundary I say between</span> <span data-start="635.54" data-end="637.85">400 pixels and 800 pixels and you have a</span> <span data-start="637.85" data-end="640.66">specific size like growth between</span> <span data-start="640.66" data-end="643.49">starting font size and final font size</span> <span data-start="643.49" data-end="645.74">right so you just plug it in here you've</span> <span data-start="645.74" data-end="648.44">got kind of the maximum subscreen size</span> <span data-start="648.44" data-end="650">minus minimum screen size where you're</span> <span data-start="650" data-end="651.47">talking about like the spectrum that</span> <span data-start="651.47" data-end="653.72">you're walking at and then here at this</span> <span data-start="653.72" data-end="657.49">point you're kind of subtracting 100%</span> <span data-start="657.49" data-end="661.19">100 PW minus 4 horn pixels at this point</span> <span data-start="661.19" data-end="662.99">you are getting to the area like what is</span> <span data-start="662.99" data-end="665.54">where am I either lower lower boundary</span> <span data-start="665.54" data-end="668">or in the upper boundary right and then</span> <span data-start="668" data-end="669.68">you multiply it with difference between</span> <span data-start="669.68" data-end="671.12">the maximum font size and mean font size</span> <span data-start="671.12" data-end="673.01">and you add the minimum font size and</span> <span data-start="673.01" data-end="676.1">you're done</span> <span data-start="676.11" data-end="679.48">that's really not complicated right so</span> <span data-start="679.48" data-end="680.499">the only thing you have to do is you</span> <span data-start="680.499" data-end="681.999">have to define all these four values</span> <span data-start="681.999" data-end="684.1">you've set them and you're done right</span> <span data-start="684.1" data-end="688.54">and then this is what it looks like so</span> <span data-start="688.54" data-end="690.369">you have your modular scale right</span> <span data-start="690.369" data-end="694.24">and all these headings including</span> <span data-start="694.24" data-end="695.8">typography like the body copy as well</span> <span data-start="695.8" data-end="697.959">are just going to flew it and kind of</span> <span data-start="697.959" data-end="699.879">grow naturally without you having to do</span> <span data-start="699.879" data-end="701.889">anything without even single media query</span> <span data-start="701.889" data-end="703.72">and without flexbox without anything</span> <span data-start="703.72" data-end="705.399">just with one little property that's</span> <span data-start="705.399" data-end="707.949">really cool right we actually published</span> <span data-start="707.949" data-end="709.269">an article about this which you can also</span> <span data-start="709.269" data-end="711.309">read on so in just in case you're</span> <span data-start="711.309" data-end="713.92">wondering calc is really damn good well</span> <span data-start="713.92" data-end="716.47">supported except you know who but we're</span> <span data-start="716.47" data-end="719.05">used to it right but this is not quite</span> <span data-start="719.05" data-end="721.42">what you want sometimes I mean that's</span> <span data-start="721.42" data-end="725.92">cool if you can just grow and and if the</span> <span data-start="725.92" data-end="728.05">font size can grow and actually become</span> <span data-start="728.05" data-end="730.119">smaller but what about the line height</span> <span data-start="730.119" data-end="732.339">because as we know from the Fogg Rafi</span> <span data-start="732.339" data-end="734.23">the smaller the font sizes or the small</span> <span data-start="734.23" data-end="737.35">the line lengths is the small the line</span> <span data-start="737.35" data-end="738.91">height should be as well and the other</span> <span data-start="738.91" data-end="739.449">way around</span> <span data-start="739.449" data-end="742.36">the largest their length is the taller</span> <span data-start="742.36" data-end="744.279">the line height should be as well can we</span> <span data-start="744.279" data-end="745.66">fix that maybe you want to have</span> <span data-start="745.66" data-end="748.839">something like this right automatically</span> <span data-start="748.839" data-end="751.119">without JavaScript without too many you</span> <span data-start="751.119" data-end="752.829">know fancy mate we're breaking points</span> <span data-start="752.829" data-end="754.869">just we want it to be fluid and just</span> <span data-start="754.869" data-end="757.329">right again we have the same problem</span> <span data-start="757.329" data-end="759.04">exactly right we have these two</span> <span data-start="759.04" data-end="761.019">boundaries let's say we have a minimum</span> <span data-start="761.019" data-end="763.179">line height one point free at some point</span> <span data-start="763.179" data-end="765.189">if it's smaller than that it's just not</span> <span data-start="765.189" data-end="767.29">going to work well right and also if</span> <span data-start="767.29" data-end="769.48">you're going to worry above 1.5 it's</span> <span data-start="769.48" data-end="771.49">going to be too wide right so we have</span> <span data-start="771.49" data-end="774.16">this nice boundary between 1.3 and 1 to</span> <span data-start="774.16" data-end="776.049">5 and we just need to define where it's</span> <span data-start="776.049" data-end="777.699">going to operate so it's going to</span> <span data-start="777.699" data-end="779.769">operate maybe in a layout between 21 mm</span> <span data-start="779.769" data-end="781.869">sent to 35 amps you plug it in the</span> <span data-start="781.869" data-end="785.379">formula you do a little bit of math</span> <span data-start="785.379" data-end="787.299">right you plug it's the formula and</span> <span data-start="787.299" data-end="790.149">you're done it's exactly the same story</span> <span data-start="790.149" data-end="792.069">just for the line height we're here</span> <span data-start="792.069" data-end="794.889">we've got we got the full range of</span> <span data-start="794.889" data-end="798.04">paragraph width in here 35 minus 21 then</span> <span data-start="798.04" data-end="800.17">some point in here we we just look at</span> <span data-start="800.17" data-end="801.91">the account we need to open numerator to</span> <span data-start="801.91" data-end="803.709">see how close we are to the upper</span> <span data-start="803.709" data-end="805.569">boundary and then we also need to</span> <span data-start="805.569" data-end="807.16">multiply it with the difference in terms</span> <span data-start="807.16" data-end="808.48">of wine height to get to this proper</span> <span data-start="808.48" data-end="809.11">factor</span> <span data-start="809.11" data-end="811.959">and then we also add the minimum phone</span> <span

data-start="816.43" data-end="818.5">and in the end you get this which</span> <span data-start="818.5" data-end="821.17">without media queries again without</span> <span data-start="821.17" data-end="829.25">flexbox without anything it just works</span> <span data-start="829.26" data-end="831.73">right and if you actually make the</span> <span data-start="831.73" data-end="833.579">window a little bit smaller please</span> <span data-start="833.579" data-end="835.99">whatever yes that's okay we saw it</span> <span data-start="835.99" data-end="836.579">already</span> <span data-start="836.579" data-end="842.49">just move on I'll get the life yes/no or</span> <span data-start="842.49" data-end="844.69">whatever but it will actually work as</span> <span data-start="844.69" data-end="846.51">expected all right here's the next one</span> <span data-start="846.51" data-end="848.709">so how do you make sure that a</span> <span data-start="848.709" data-end="851.38">multi-column table both a row and a</span> <span data-start="851.38" data-end="853.66">column are highlighted on hava and on</span> <span data-start="853.66"

data-end="860.2">about the column this is what we want</span> <span data-start="860.2" data-end="862.45">right we want to be able to kind of tap</span> <span data-start="862.45" data-end="865.41">on

can we do</span> <span data-start="899.74" data-end="901.62">it with two elements without JavaScript</span> <span data-start="901.62" data-end="904.54">all right this is really nasty maybe you</span> <span data-start="904.54" data-end="906.43">should not be using CSS for this but you</span> <span data-start="906.43" data-end="909.279">can write so we can create huge pseudo</span> <span

data-end="2116.74">the perfect vertical reading how do you</span> <span data-start="2116.74" data-end="2118.45">do it how do you make it right there are</span> <span data-start="2118.45" data-end="2119.83">so many great frameworks of course you</span> <span data-start="2119.83" data-end="2121.27">could use but do you have to use them</span> <span data-start="2121.27" data-end="2122.53">because you can actually make it really</span> <span data-start="2122.53" data-end="2124.51">simple now in the answer is one thing</span> <span data-start="2124.51" data-end="2127.84">you just have to keep in mind now if I</span> <span data-start="2127.84" data-end="2129.94">don't know if you can see oh wow they're</span> <span data-start="2129.94" data-end="2131.02">actually supposed to be like a little</span> <span data-start="2131.02" data-end="2133.21">grid behind so it depends really on how</span> <span data-start="2133.21" data-end="2135.25">you implement it now very often if you</span> <span data-start="2135.25" data-end="2136.66">think about the vertical reading you</span> <span data-start="2136.66" data-end="2138.73">think about the lines living between the</span> <span data-start="2138.73" data-end="2140.71">grid lines right so you have this lines</span> <span data-start="2140.71" data-end="2143.41">like the you have agreed and these lines</span> <span data-start="2143.41" data-end="2145.54">of text should be sitting right between</span> <span data-start="2145.54" data-end="2148.39">them right and they're kind of the same</span> <span data-start="2148.39" data-end="2150.22">distance between when they start in</span> <span data-start="2150.22" data-end="2152.26">between when the end or you could do it</span> <span data-start="2152.26" data-end="2154.24">slightly differently where you just put</span> <span data-start="2154.24" data-end="2157.98">the text on that line in the grid and</span> <span data-start="2157.98" data-end="2160.45">it's unlikely that you can see it's to</span> <span data-start="2160.45" data-end="2162.13">be honest but that's okay I will explain</span> <span data-start="2162.13" data-end="2164.95">it anyway so we tend to actually really</span> <span data-start="2164.95" data-end="2167.86">most of the time use just a multiple of</span> <span data-start="2167.86" data-end="2169.63">line height everywhere</span> <span data-start="2169.63" data-end="2171.76">use it for pairings and margins and</span> <span data-start="2171.76" data-end="2173.98">sometimes even border width right but we</span> <span data-start="2173.98" data-end="2176.14">can align to the by base line instead</span> <span data-start="2176.14" data-end="2179.62">right so for this to work we just need</span> <span data-start="2179.62" data-end="2181.42">to calculate the offset and then shave</span> <span data-start="2181.42" data-end="2183.22">the content by that offset so what does</span> <span data-start="2183.22" data-end="2185.02">it mean so let's say we have this lines</span> <span data-start="2185.02" data-end="2187.09">right imagine we have lines we have</span> <span data-start="2187.09" data-end="2190.18">lines everywhere right here right we</span> <span data-start="2190.18" data-end="2192.16">have lines in here everywhere and</span> <span data-start="2192.16" data-end="2194.14">here is a line and here is a line and</span> <span data-start="2194.14" data-end="2196.839">that line is right where the texts it's</span> <span data-start="2196.839" data-end="2201.329">all right right here not in here</span> <span data-start="2201.329" data-end="2204.099">just below it but actually right there</span> <span data-start="2204.099" data-end="2206.74">which I'm really bad at this right where</span> <span data-start="2206.74" data-end="2209.049">it's it's all right in that case this is</span> <span data-start="2209.049" data-end="2212.47">what we can do so by default how does it</span> <span data-start="2212.47" data-end="2214.45">work but default browser center the cap</span> <span data-start="2214.45" data-end="2216.339">height as they define it between the</span> <span data-start="2216.339" data-end="2218.859">grid lines so the height of the cap</span> <span data-start="2218.859" data-end="2220.18">height is the height of a capital letter</span> <span data-start="2220.18" data-end="2222.549">above the baseline again baseline is</span> <span data-start="2222.549" data-end="2225.339">where the text sits so we can shift it</span> <span data-start="2225.339" data-end="2227.53">by half the difference between line</span> <span data-start="2227.53" data-end="2231.73">height and cap height why well because</span> <span data-start="2231.73" data-end="2233.74">the tips text sits right between those</span> <span data-start="2233.74" data-end="2236.079">lines so if we just take half of that</span> <span data-start="2236.079" data-end="2241.15">line for example and we remove the top</span> <span data-start="2241.15" data-end="2242.98">of the line height then we actually have</span> <span data-start="2242.98" data-end="2247.01">the text sitting right on the base line</span> <span data-start="2247.02" data-end="2250.15">okay this didn't go as expected all</span> <span data-start="2250.15" data-end="2253.119">right we just need to determine the cap</span> <span data-start="2253.119" data-end="2255.339">height and then offset the entire thing</span> <span data-start="2255.339" data-end="2257.26">a little bit down and then we have to</span> <span data-start="2257.26" data-end="2259.24">pull it back with margin negative margin</span> <span data-start="2259.24" data-end="2262">at the bottom that's okay just a second</span> <span data-start="2262" data-end="2263.829">so this is how it's going to work so we</span> <span data-start="2263.829" data-end="2265.69">have our line height define power</span> <span data-start="2265.69" data-end="2267.01">formstack we could have different</span> <span data-start="2267.01" data-end="2269.14">typefaces for example right and we have</span> <span data-start="2269.14" data-end="2271.48">different font sizes in the end we're</span> <span data-start="2271.48" data-end="2273.25">doing pixels here we're using pixels</span> <span data-start="2273.25" data-end="2274.9">here but you can of course transform</span> <span data-start="2274.9" data-end="2276.609">them into e/m units later so it's more</span> <span data-start="2276.609" data-end="2279.22">flexible it just for us to be easier it</span> <span data-start="2279.22" data-end="2283.69">kind of to follow easier simpler so we</span> <span data-start="2283.69" data-end="2285.099">have the font sizes and then we just</span> <span data-start="2285.099" data-end="2287.44">have to kind of refine it with cap</span> <span data-start="2287.44" data-end="2289.27">heights a little bit with the formula</span> <span data-start="2289.27" data-end="2290.98">you will see in a second so once we</span> <span data-start="2290.98" data-end="2292.69">define them we just plugged in a formula</span> <span data-start="2292.69" data-end="2294.609">and it works right so how exactly does</span> <span data-start="2294.609" data-end="2296.47">it work in the end we have this little</span> <span data-start="2296.47" data-end="2298.24">sauce mix in where we define the font</span> <span data-start="2298.24" data-end="2299.74">size and cap height an offset and</span> <span data-start="2299.74" data-end="2302.2">returns that actual offset by again</span> <span data-start="2302.2" data-end="2303.369">using that formula which I said before</span> <span data-start="2303.369" data-end="2305.77">where we're kind of using the half of</span> <span data-start="2305.77" data-end="2307.599">the line height minus cap height times</span> <span data-start="2307.599" data-end="2310.39">font size right it will make sense just</span> <span data-start="2310.39" data-end="2311.579">don't have time to explain everything</span> <span data-start="2311.579" data-end="2317.2">right and the only thing we have to do</span> <span data-start="2317.2" data-end="2319">is kind of put that off so once we</span> <span data-start="2319" data-end="2320.829">define the offset calculated the offset</span> <span data-start="2320.829" data-end="2322.029">we just need to push it a little bit</span> <span data-start="2322.029" data-end="2325.72">down so it sits right on the baseline in</span> <span data-start="2325.72" data-end="2326.56">order to do this</span> <span data-start="2326.56" data-end="2329.77">we use we can use this and this is</span> <span data-start="2329.77" data-end="2331">really like a magic trick</span> <span data-start="2331" data-end="2333.16">most front-end developers will will</span> <span data-start="2333.16" data-end="2334.9">freak out at this point because you can</span> <span data-start="2334.9" data-end="2337.33">use margin top and margin bottom and it</span> <span data-start="2337.33" data-end="2339.43">could you know weed here you have you</span> <span data-start="2339.43" data-end="2341.41">have offset so you're pushing all the</span> <span data-start="2341.41" data-end="2343.87">text a little bit down to see it on the</span> <span data-start="2343.87" data-end="2345.82">baseline and design it out of you know</span> <span data-start="2345.82" data-end="2348.07">not to screw up everything you have to</span> <span data-start="2348.07" data-end="2350.08">pull it back with margin bottom for the</span> <span data-start="2350.08" data-end="2353.32">for the when the paragraph ends right</span> <span data-start="2353.32" data-end="2354.61">for example if you have a set the</span> <span data-start="2354.61" data-end="2356.38">paragraphs you want them all to be</span> <span data-start="2356.38" data-end="2359.02">sitting right right so what you have to</span> <span data-start="2359.02" data-end="2361.3">split back so you still have this</span> <span data-start="2361.3" data-end="2363.67">consistence in terms of how the lines</span> <span data-start="2363.67" data-end="2365.8">and how they go so once you have this</span> <span data-start="2365.8" data-end="2367.96">you might be wondering what the hell is</span> <span data-start="2367.96" data-end="2370.03">going on here and you are free to leave</span> <span data-start="2370.03" data-end="2371.5">at this point it's like two minutes left</span> <span data-start="2371.5" data-end="2374.59">so how does it why does it work because</span> <span data-start="2374.59" data-end="2378.55">we have collapsing margins in CSS if you</span> <span data-start="2378.55" data-end="2380.74">look into this back in the evening at</span> <span data-start="2380.74" data-end="2382.87">night you'll be able to find some really</span> <span data-start="2382.87" data-end="2384.91">interesting facts about how it works as</span> <span data-start="2384.91" data-end="2387.07">it turns out collapsing margins are not</span> <span data-start="2387.07" data-end="2389.26">always collapsing margins so they work</span> <span
