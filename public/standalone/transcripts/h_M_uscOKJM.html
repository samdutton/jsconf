<p><span data-start="14.88" data-end="15.88">That was a very kind introduction.</span> <span data-start="15.88" data-end="16.88">Thank you very much.</span> <span data-start="16.88" data-end="17.88">So how is everyone doing at JSConf?</span> <span data-start="17.88" data-end="18.88">I heard I have no competition at the beach.</span> <span data-start="18.88" data-end="19.88">Everyone is here.</span> <span data-start="19.88" data-end="20.88">Full house.</span> <span data-start="20.88" data-end="21.88">Thank you for coming by.</span> <span data-start="21.88" data-end="22.88">So yeah.</span> <span data-start="22.88" data-end="23.88">Like I said, I want to talk to you about concurrency and</span> <span data-start="23.88" data-end="24.88">parallelism in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="24.88" data-end="25.88">Maybe a brief introduction is warranted.</span> <span data-start="25.88" data-end="26.88">I do lead the JS team, and for the last several years, we've been thinking about</span> <span data-start="26.88" data-end="30.59">this, these problems in JavaScript, and how we can address that.</span> <span data-start="30.59" data-end="35.18">I would like to share some of the ways we've come around to improving concurrency</span> <span data-start="35.18" data-end="36.29">and parallelism in JS.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="36.29" data-end="37.29">But before we..</span> <span data-start="37.29" data-end="40.27">The string is a little tight.</span> <span data-start="40.27" data-end="44.89">Before we go down that road, let's actually talk about some definitions.</span> <span data-start="44.89" data-end="49.36">Concurrency and parallelism often come up together but they're not the same thing.</span> <span data-start="49.36" data-end="52.16">The way I think about it is..</span> <span data-start="52.16" data-end="55.19">Concurrency is how do you make an application more usable?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="55.19" data-end="59.4">And here we have two queues of people and a single revolving</span> <span data-start="59.4" data-end="60.62">door.</span> <span data-start="60.62" data-end="65.239">You can come up with some logic to have them take turns going through</span> <span data-start="65.239" data-end="67.009">there, but it doesn't matter what you do.</span> <span data-start="67.009" data-end="70.69">You have one whole queue go through first or have them take turns</span> <span data-start="70.69" data-end="76.6">like that  â€”  some sort of multitasking to utilize the resource and make sure</span> <span data-start="76.6" data-end="77.6">everything happens.</span> <span data-start="77.6" data-end="81.299">And examples inside the running the program or</span> <span data-start="81.299" data-end="87.74">application might be pre-emptive multitasking, Windows 95, or async</span> <span data-start="87.74" data-end="90.799">programming that we're very familiar with.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="90.799" data-end="97.1">Parallelism is all about how you can be faster by leveraging or exploiting</span> <span data-start="97.1" data-end="98.939">hardware availability.</span> <span data-start="98.939" data-end="102.51">So in this case, we now have two revolving doors,</span> <span data-start="102.51" data-end="106.179">and we can theoretically hopefully go twice as fast, because there's</span> <span data-start="106.179" data-end="108.84">no contention and complex in my examples.</span> <span data-start="108.84" data-end="110.78">But the real world is not like that.</span> <span data-start="110.78" data-end="113.679">The real world has complexity, and the reason why concurrency</span> <span data-start="113.679" data-end="119.009">and parallelism are often mixed together is because in the real world, it's</span> <span data-start="119.009" data-end="122.85">really hard to separate the different aspects.</span> <span data-start="122.85" data-end="125.409">And you have to be very sensitive to the way you take care of your</span> <span data-start="125.409" data-end="128.929">application to avoid deadlocks and races.</span> <span data-start="128.929" data-end="133.87">So now that we talked about those definitions, I want to explain why improving</span> <span data-start="133.87" data-end="135.48">this is actually important in JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="135.48" data-end="138.9">And to do that, let's talk about the evolution of the web</span> <span data-start="138.9" data-end="139.9">application.</span> <span data-start="139.9" data-end="144.78">Back in the day, not quite the '80s, but way, way back, we all</span> <span data-start="144.78" data-end="147.15">had a homepage that looked something like this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="147.15" data-end="148.15">I'm sorry.</span> <span data-start="148.15" data-end="150.44">Mine is under construction at the moment, but maybe it will</span> <span data-start="150.44" data-end="152.5">evolve a little.</span> <span data-start="152.5" data-end="156.06">Static html and GIFs can only take us so far.</span> <span data-start="156.06" data-end="158.25">In 1995, though, something really big happened.</span> <span data-start="158.25" data-end="161.83">I think most of us know what this is?</span> <span data-start="161.83" data-end="164.73">Any guesses?</span> <span data-start="164.73" data-end="166.21">I think I heard it.</span> <span data-start="166.21" data-end="167.21">Yes.</span> <span data-start="167.21" data-end="169.27">JavaScript was invented, and it was good.</span> <span data-start="169.27" data-end="170.4">The universe of..</span> <span data-start="170.4" data-end="174.25">I think I came to the right venue to make that</span> <span data-start="174.25" data-end="175.42">comment.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="175.42" data-end="179.64">The universe of the modern interactive web was really born.</span> <span data-start="179.64" data-end="184.45">And homepages were never the same again.</span> <span data-start="184.45" data-end="188.9">So in the next 20 years, I think the home pages and websites</span> <span data-start="188.9" data-end="191.85">have evolved past Windows alert.</span> <span data-start="191.85" data-end="197.12">And now you have desktop applications that have actually gone non-native.</span> <span data-start="197.12" data-end="202.49">Here we have an example of Excel, and most of the Microsoft Office suite is now available</span> <span data-start="202.49" data-end="205.04">as a web application.</span> <span data-start="205.04" data-end="209.26">JavaScript and the web platform is actually capable of supporting even</span> <span data-start="209.26" data-end="210.92">virtual reality technology.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="210.92" data-end="214.12">Here we have a frame or a couple of frames from</span> <span data-start="214.12" data-end="220.62">the Polar Sea Project that MozVR is working on.</span> <span data-start="220.62" data-end="225.69">So today's JavaScript is really vast.</span> <span data-start="225.69" data-end="229.19">We track most of the modern browsers, their performance, and how</span> <span data-start="229.19" data-end="230.41">they're doing over time.</span> <span data-start="230.41" data-end="234.02">And here you can see that we're all getting a lot</span> <span data-start="234.02" data-end="237.43">faster.</span> <span data-start="237.43" data-end="240.061">And that's continued to be true for other factors as well, because</span> <span data-start="240.061" data-end="244.19">we're inventing other technologies, like (inaudible), that allow us</span> <span data-start="244.19" data-end="248.5">to bypass some of the inherent bottle necks in regular JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="248.5" data-end="251.65">In this slide..</span> <span data-start="251.65" data-end="254.04">The bottom line is native.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="254.04" data-end="256.07">C++ compiled code.</span> <span data-start="256.07" data-end="260.13">And JS running on Firefox is only 2X of that.</span> <span data-start="260.13" data-end="262.039">We have techniques in certain workloads that can</span> <span data-start="262.039" data-end="264.58">get much closer to native.</span> <span data-start="264.58" data-end="265.94">1.5X.</span> <span data-start="265.94" data-end="269.66">So if JavaScript is so fast, why do we have a problem?</span> <span data-start="269.66" data-end="276.75">Well, to illustrate that, I have a snapshot here of my Windows desktop.</span> <span data-start="276.75" data-end="282.25">Right now you can see that the desktop doesn't seem to be doing a whole</span> <span data-start="282.25" data-end="283.25">lot.</span> <span data-start="283.25" data-end="287.44">We're running at 5% CPU utilization, and I have a ton of applications</span> <span data-start="287.44" data-end="292.44">open, including Firefox with, I believe, at the moment, 30 tabs.</span> <span data-start="292.44" data-end="295.68">So I open one more tab with a really intensive JavaScript</span> <span data-start="295.68" data-end="297.18">application.</span> <span data-start="297.18" data-end="303.69">And you'll see that the PerfMon seems to be indicating something.</span> <span data-start="303.69" data-end="306.9">Those of you who are not familiar with Windows and PerfMon, each of</span> <span data-start="306.9" data-end="314.09">these squares represents a CPU core and how much work it's doing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="314.09" data-end="319.919">In this illustration, cores three and four  â€”  they're virtual cores, but we'll</span> <span data-start="319.919" data-end="324.78">not worry about that detail  â€”  cores three and four are doing a lot of work,</span> <span data-start="324.78" data-end="328.78">but the rest of the CPU is mostly just sitting there, and overall utilization</span> <span data-start="328.78" data-end="332">is at 24%.</span> <span data-start="332" data-end="333">Out of a possible 100.</span> <span data-start="333" data-end="334">Right?</span> <span data-start="334" data-end="337.59">So the computer is still 75% idle.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="337.59" data-end="339.13">Why does this matter?</span> <span data-start="339.13" data-end="343.27">Well, the gigahertz race is effectively at an end.</span> <span data-start="343.27" data-end="346.49">It's hard to make CPUs faster than they are now.</span> <span data-start="346.49" data-end="350.33">Power and heat have stopped our ability to innovate there.</span> <span data-start="350.33" data-end="353.74">So for future hardware, the way we're scaling is</span> <span data-start="353.74" data-end="357.389">by adding additional cores or execution units.</span> <span data-start="357.389" data-end="360.419">Your modern smartphone typically has two cores.</span> <span data-start="360.419" data-end="364.04">Some of them are even quad-core enabled.</span> <span data-start="364.04" data-end="369.919">Laptops and desktops have four to eight virtual course and workstations can have 4 to 20 cores</span> <span data-start="369.919" data-end="374.66">per CPU, and they may have multiple CPUs on their motherboards.</span> <span data-start="374.66" data-end="379.59">So right here I've only talked about the parallelism aspect, how to do work at the</span> <span data-start="379.59" data-end="381.02">same time.</span> <span data-start="381.02" data-end="383.49">But concurrency has its issues too.</span> <span data-start="383.49" data-end="387.139">We're always waiting on something in a JavaScript application.</span> <span data-start="387.139" data-end="391.35">Waiting on events, on the user, on the cache, and of course</span> <span data-start="391.35" data-end="395.11">always waiting on the internet to do something.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="395.11" data-end="400.66">So improving parallelism and improving concurrency can really make a big</span> <span data-start="400.66" data-end="403.17">difference to a host of applications.</span> <span data-start="403.17" data-end="408.73">Some of the application types are of course games, AI, rendering, code generation,</span> <span data-start="408.73" data-end="413.199">and each of these specific application types have their own domain-specific</span> <span data-start="413.199" data-end="416.29">way of dealing with these constructs.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="416.29" data-end="419.35">But something that  â€”  if we do solve this problem, we want to</span> <span data-start="419.35" data-end="423.18">preserve it, if possible.</span> <span data-start="423.18" data-end="428.21">While looking at this problem and investigating different ways to deal with it, web workers</span> <span data-start="428.21" data-end="429.21">are around.</span> <span data-start="429.21" data-end="430.53">Web workers do promote parallelism.</span> <span data-start="430.53" data-end="432.28">You can do something on a thread.</span> <span data-start="432.28" data-end="435.11">They tend to be very heavy threads.</span> <span data-start="435.11" data-end="436.229">But it works.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="436.229" data-end="441.16">The real issue for saturating a core doesn't seem to be spinning up another thread.</span> <span data-start="441.16" data-end="442.92">It's communication between that.</span> <span data-start="442.92" data-end="446.32">And coordination is really about concurrency.</span> <span data-start="446.32" data-end="448.28">But concurrency does exist on the web today.</span> <span data-start="448.28" data-end="451.13">Exists in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="451.13" data-end="456.01">We've had at this point parallel JavaScript  â€”  post message</span> <span data-start="456.01" data-end="457.01">will always be around.</span> <span data-start="457.01" data-end="458.389">It's very useful.</span> <span data-start="458.389" data-end="461.95">And then the buffered transfer semantics.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="461.95" data-end="464.26">So let's dive into each one of these and see where they</span> <span data-start="464.26" data-end="465.8">may have some limitations.</span> <span data-start="465.8" data-end="471.6">Parallel JS, for those who are not familiar with it, it was an experimental</span> <span data-start="471.6" data-end="475.33">effort to see if we can bring some of the semantics of MapReduce to</span> <span data-start="475.33" data-end="481.139">JavaScript, and enable a whole slew of application types.</span> <span data-start="481.139" data-end="483.699">It was a casual API, but it really took some sophistication to</span> <span data-start="483.699" data-end="487.301">use it, so the average programmer couldn't make that much out of it, and it</span> <span data-start="487.301" data-end="490.77">had some really high implementation costs in the engine, so it was hard to support</span> <span data-start="490.77" data-end="493.36">going forward.</span> <span data-start="493.36" data-end="495.65">PostMessage obviously..</span> <span data-start="495.65" data-end="497.05">Around and incredibly useful.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="497.05" data-end="501.169">But it also has its own set of issues.</span> <span data-start="501.169" data-end="502.389">Dependent on the event loop.</span> <span data-start="502.389" data-end="506.99">The performance, which we'll go into a little bit more later, just isn't there,</span> <span data-start="506.99" data-end="508.39">and you cannot share state.</span> <span data-start="508.39" data-end="510.99">You're transferring state over.</span> <span data-start="510.99" data-end="512.05">Really one at a time.</span> <span data-start="512.05" data-end="515.95">And if you care about the response, you have to transfer a new state back.</span> <span data-start="515.95" data-end="519.63">It's possible with postMessage to transfer a buffer entirely by</span> <span data-start="519.63" data-end="525.009">reference, and that solves some subsets of problems, but you still</span> <span data-start="525.009" data-end="527.65">can't work on the same data at the same time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="527.65" data-end="532.19">This really is a bottleneck, a coordination bottleneck, and it's something</span> <span data-start="532.19" data-end="534.72">that we want to address.</span> <span data-start="534.72" data-end="537.149">So while looking at different possible ways of</span> <span data-start="537.149" data-end="541.61">handling this, it sort of became apparent that obviously native has</span> <span data-start="541.61" data-end="543.149">handled this already.</span> <span data-start="543.149" data-end="547.56">The operating system libraries have a slew of constructs</span> <span data-start="547.56" data-end="550.69">that allow us to solve concurrent problems.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="550.69" data-end="551.69">Solve them well.</span> <span data-start="551.69" data-end="555.85">And solve them in ways that each individual application can tailor for its</span> <span data-start="555.85" data-end="557.19">own needs.</span> <span data-start="557.19" data-end="561.63">So that helped us come up with some design considerations for what our</span> <span data-start="561.63" data-end="563.36">ideal solution may look like.</span> <span data-start="563.36" data-end="565.58">Of course, we want native-like performance.</span> <span data-start="565.58" data-end="567.56">That's the Holy Grail benchmark.</span> <span data-start="567.56" data-end="569.43">Let's be as fast as we can be.</span> <span data-start="569.43" data-end="573.06">We don't want to be dependent on the main event loop, if</span> <span data-start="573.06" data-end="574.39">possible.</span> <span data-start="574.39" data-end="578.66">Because everyone uses the event loop, and that  â€”  as Simon</span> <span data-start="578.66" data-end="582.31">pointed out, can lead to some jankiness.</span> <span data-start="582.31" data-end="583.63">Implementation versatility.</span> <span data-start="583.63" data-end="585.81">What I mean by that is..</span> <span data-start="585.81" data-end="590.95">Every problem has probably an ideal answer.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1833.1" data-end="1836.96">Shared memory is not comparable to a library call that can be emulated or polyfilled.</span> <span data-start="1836.96" data-end="1840.97">I'm sorry for all the people who are asking this question  â€”  can we polyfill this?</span> <span data-start="1840.97" data-end="1841.97">We cannot.</span> <span data-start="1841.97" data-end="1844.15">But it's a fundamental concept of parallel execution</span> <span data-start="1844.15" data-end="1845.15">architectures.</span> <span data-start="1845.15" data-end="1847.98">I'm not sure if it can get any bigger than this.</span> <span data-start="1847.98" data-end="1853.13">He's a very emphatic guy and he's very excited, but I think he really did capture</span> <span data-start="1853.13" data-end="1857.309">the significance of what we accomplished here.</span> <span data-start="1857.309" data-end="1860.7">So what's next for shared memory and for the work</span> <span data-start="1860.7" data-end="1861.7">that we've done here?</span> <span data-start="1861.7" data-end="1863.34">Well, shared memory is in Nightly right now.</span> <span data-start="1863.34" data-end="1866.94">As on JS, for those that are..</span> <span data-start="1866.94" data-end="1872.29">Can I get another show of hands  â€”  are people familiar with (inaudible)</span> <span data-start="1872.29" data-end="1873.29">JS?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1873.29" data-end="1875.08">Most of the room.</span> <span data-start="1875.08" data-end="1878.7">So it's a low level subset of JS that we put together</span> <span data-start="1878.7" data-end="1881.6">that you can really optimize for, and it's fantastic for certain</span> <span data-start="1881.6" data-end="1884.47">workloads, especially cross compilation ones.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1884.47" data-end="1891.97">So it's not going to move out of Nightly, until we standardize it.</span> <span data-start="1891.97" data-end="1893.85">But we are in talks to standardize it.</span> <span data-start="1893.85" data-end="1898.49">The API, the set of documents you saw that Lars put together, still subject</span> <span data-start="1898.49" data-end="1899.49">to change.</span> <span data-start="1899.49" data-end="1901.169">We're getting feedback from a lot of sources inside Mozilla and</span> <span data-start="1901.169" data-end="1902.169">out.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1902.169" data-end="1905.62">But the good news is Google has actually announced fairly recently</span> <span data-start="1905.62" data-end="1907.69">that they're going to start implementing this too.</span> <span data-start="1907.69" data-end="1911.11">So hopefully a year from now we're going to see this in applications</span> <span data-start="1911.11" data-end="1912.65">built against it everywhere.</span> <span data-start="1912.65" data-end="1916.57">I have a bunch of links that nobody can read,</span> <span data-start="1916.57" data-end="1924.09">but I think there'll be some opportunities to share this presentation later.</span> <span data-start="1924.09" data-end="1927.51">So hopefully you can catch up on any details here that you may have.</span> <span data-start="1927.51" data-end="1928.72">And you're always welcome to find me.</span> </p>
