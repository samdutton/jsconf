data-start="1190.48" data-end="1193.63">work so this is the number one what we</span> <span data-start="1193.63" data-end="1196.36">do is we put in the left-hand slot we</span> <span

data-end="1241.33">there you can still see the original</span> <span data-start="1241.33" data-end="1244.24">zero so we have a zero and that's used</span> <span data-start="1244.24" data-end="1245.92">to produce one which then is used to</span> <span data-start="1245.92" data-end="1248.29">produce it too and you would write that</span> <span data-start="1248.29"

data-end="1253.24">going the left slot and the empty set on</span> <span data-start="1253.24" data-end="1255.7">the right and minus two we do the same</span> <span data-start="1255.7"
