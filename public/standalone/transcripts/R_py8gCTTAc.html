<p><span data-start="169.13" data-end="171.2">I'm looking up there yeah design is a</span> <span data-start="171.2" data-end="173.8">process and it's getting to a solution</span> <span data-start="173.8" data-end="176.06">you got a problem you trying to solve it</span> <span data-start="176.06" data-end="178.58">and a lot of times design kind of looks</span> <span data-start="178.58" data-end="180.32">something like this and hopefully you</span> <span data-start="180.32" data-end="183.59">can see the circles they look little dim</span> <span data-start="183.59" data-end="186.019">but anyways you know you do a lot of</span> <span data-start="186.019" data-end="187.19">sketching and do a lot of wireframe</span> <span data-start="187.19" data-end="188.84">getting Photoshop you get in the code</span> <span data-start="188.84" data-end="190.61">and it's like this whole big ordeal it's</span> <span data-start="190.61" data-end="192.62">exhausting design gosh it's supposed to</span> <span data-start="192.62" data-end="194.57">be this uppity like thing right we're</span> <span data-start="194.57" data-end="198.019">all designers and we realize that like</span> <span data-start="198.019" data-end="200.6">really just solving the same problems</span> <span data-start="200.6" data-end="201.769">like over and over again in different</span> <span data-start="201.769" data-end="203.72">fidelity right were you sketching and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="203.72" data-end="204.739">I'm not saying anything I mean this is</span> <span data-start="204.739" data-end="206.36">bad like this is a good good step but</span> <span data-start="206.36" data-end="208.19">when you're sketching like you're trying</span> <span data-start="208.19" data-end="209.33">to solve the problem then you get the</span> <span data-start="209.33" data-end="210.38">wireframes you get a little bit more</span> <span data-start="210.38" data-end="212">context and like you get a little more</span> <span data-start="212" data-end="213.65">handle on the problem you realize that</span> <span data-start="213.65" data-end="214.76">all those decisions you made are</span> <span data-start="214.76" data-end="216.29">probably wrong or like half of them</span> <span data-start="216.29" data-end="217.94">wrong so start making them again and</span> <span data-start="217.94" data-end="219.89">then you get the Photoshop and you spend</span> <span data-start="219.89" data-end="221.63">a lot of time in Photoshop and you're</span> <span data-start="221.63" data-end="223.07">doing that and and then you get into</span> <span data-start="223.07" data-end="224.09">code and you realize all of those</span> <span data-start="224.09" data-end="225.53">decisions were stupid you wasted all</span> <span data-start="225.53" data-end="226.7">your time you have to read make all</span> <span data-start="226.7" data-end="228.26">those decisions as soon as you do things</span> <span data-start="228.26" data-end="229.61">like what Adam was talking about in here</span> <span data-start="229.61" data-end="231.59">you know you have people using the thing</span> <span data-start="231.59" data-end="233.239">and it's a real tangible piece of</span> <span data-start="233.239" data-end="236.39">software that you build and really what</span> <span data-start="236.39" data-end="238.79">it boils down to for us at least and</span> <span data-start="238.79" data-end="241.1">based on our you know the six years</span> <span data-start="241.1" data-end="243.62">we've been together as mark says it</span> <span data-start="243.62" data-end="245">boils down to just working through ideas</span> <span data-start="245" data-end="247.22">and no matter what we do and then moving</span> <span data-start="247.22" data-end="248.27">into CODIS</span> <span data-start="248.27" data-end="249.23">quickly as we can because that's</span> <span data-start="249.23" data-end="251.21">actually where you know we think the</span> <span data-start="251.21" data-end="254.27">best part of design is made and and yeah</span> <span data-start="254.27" data-end="255.98">so I mean this is the point sort of what</span> <span data-start="255.98" data-end="257.78">we're thinking about is that practice</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="257.78" data-end="259.489">I'm greatly improves when you move into</span> <span data-start="259.489" data-end="261.86">code the design process becomes way more</span> <span data-start="261.86" data-end="263.9">clear and focused your decisions become</span> <span data-start="263.9" data-end="266.96">quicker they become clearer and we think</span> <span data-start="266.96" data-end="268.88">they just make for better products and</span> <span data-start="268.88" data-end="270.8">that's why we like HTML and CSS we spend</span> <span data-start="270.8" data-end="273.5">obviously bootstrap we spend a lot of</span> <span data-start="273.5" data-end="279.65">time working with CSS so so why why this</span> <span data-start="279.65" data-end="281.36">code make it better</span> <span data-start="281.36" data-end="283.64">well I think the first thing is that it</span> <span data-start="283.64" data-end="286.82">actually elevates the conversation so I</span> <span data-start="286.82" data-end="288.35">don't know about you guys but I've been</span> <span data-start="288.35" data-end="289.82">in like a lot you know I spent some time</span> <span data-start="289.82" data-end="291.92">doing like contracting work and stuff</span> <span data-start="291.92" data-end="294.37">back in the day or old graphic design</span> <span data-start="294.37" data-end="296.63">boutique firms and things like that and</span> <span data-start="296.63" data-end="298.28">you spent a lot of time like biessing</span> <span data-start="298.28" data-end="300.32">everyone you know like hey look at you</span> <span data-start="300.32" data-end="302.06">know this is the theme and the metaphor</span> <span data-start="302.06" data-end="303.38">we're working with no that's bad I don't</span> <span data-start="303.38" data-end="306.62">mean to like downplay it but a lot of</span> <span data-start="306.62" data-end="307.97">times you end up like looking at a</span> <span data-start="307.97" data-end="310.49">picture of software and that's not very</span> <span data-start="310.49" data-end="313.37">helpful like oh you know design is the</span> <span data-start="313.37" data-end="315.74">thing we're building it's not the file</span> <span data-start="315.74" data-end="317.24">that goes into the trashcan after we're</span> <span data-start="317.24" data-end="320.63">done and and so this conversation we've</span> <span data-start="320.63" data-end="322.1">time and time again and meetings like</span> <span data-start="322.1" data-end="324.14">you're looking at this piece of paper</span> <span data-start="324.14" data-end="325.88">and you're trying to make decisions and</span> <span data-start="325.88" data-end="327.62">what that boils down to is arguments</span> <span data-start="327.62" data-end="329.87">over box-shadow or I guess drop shadow</span> <span data-start="329.87" data-end="331.13">if you're talking in Photoshop terms</span> <span data-start="331.13" data-end="333.29">like whatever like these conversations</span> <span data-start="333.29" data-end="335.42">kind of get stupid so when you're</span> <span data-start="335.42" data-end="337.49">dealing with like code and you can get</span> <span data-start="337.49" data-end="339.98">real data in there and real feels it</span> <span data-start="339.98" data-end="343.13">feels real you know it all sudden your</span> <span data-start="343.13" data-end="345.56">conversation becomes way more focus so</span> <span data-start="345.56" data-end="347.15">that's one reason why you should move in</span> <span data-start="347.15" data-end="349.82">the code quicker your decisions get</span> <span data-start="349.82" data-end="351.23">faster and hopefully your product</span> <span data-start="351.23" data-end="356.38">development cycle is is faster code</span> <span data-start="356.38" data-end="360.5">inherently promotes or ideally promotes</span> <span data-start="360.5" data-end="363.05">systemic design and by systemic design</span> <span data-start="363.05" data-end="365.33">we just mean like design patterns I you</span> <span data-start="365.33" data-end="367.52">know as you're designing things you find</span> <span data-start="367.52" data-end="368.96">that you're building the same thing over</span> <span data-start="368.96" data-end="370.22">and over again well maybe you should</span> <span data-start="370.22" data-end="371.6">simplify that we just got done talking</span> <span data-start="371.6" data-end="373.669">about a a talk that does is talking</span> <span data-start="373.669" data-end="375.2">about this exact same thing but even</span> <span data-start="375.2" data-end="377.99">like on a higher level than just CSS</span> <span data-start="377.99" data-end="379.54">attributes we're talking about like</span> <span data-start="379.54" data-end="381.56">modules on the side like</span> <span data-start="381.56" data-end="384.26">a user card on say a social media site</span> <span data-start="384.26" data-end="386">or something like that like we ended up</span> <span data-start="386" data-end="388.25">making those user cards like 15,000</span> <span data-start="388.25" data-end="390.32">times and they're all different it ends</span> <span data-start="390.32" data-end="391.82">up being like 5,000 lines of code and</span> <span data-start="391.82" data-end="393.23">that's no good</span> <span data-start="393.23" data-end="395.24">and that 5,000 lines of code is off</span> <span data-start="395.24" data-end="397.669">oftentimes like a very good indicator of</span> <span data-start="397.669" data-end="399.95">maybe you need to simplify make it one</span> <span data-start="399.95" data-end="402.02">module that works everywhere and so much</span> <span data-start="402.02" data-end="404.18">simpler amount of code so code allows</span> <span data-start="404.18"
