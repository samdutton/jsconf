consider your</span> <span data-start="167.01" data-end="172.86">audience so we'll have to find out so</span> <span data-start="172.86" data-end="174.3">before we answer that question we're</span> <span data-start="174.3" data-end="175.47">going to do some accessibility</span> <span data-start="175.47" data-end="177.48">background just refresh our memories of</span> <span data-start="177.48" data-end="180.39">what accessibility is about how you can</span> <span data-start="180.39" data-end="183.209">make your projects more accessible we're</span> <span data-start="183.209" data-end="184.77">going to talk about what is the big deal</span> <span data-start="184.77" data-end="186.78">with web components everybody's been</span> <span data-start="186.78" data-end="188.34">talking about them sounds like most of</span> <span data-start="188.34" data-end="190.17">us have heard of it but we'll talk about</span> <span data-start="190.17" data-end="192.93">what that is specifically we're going to</span> <span data-start="192.93" data-end="195.15">talk about shadow Dom which is one part</span> <span data-start="195.15" data-end="197.43">of web components and then we're going</span> <span data-start="197.43" data-end="198.48">to talk about the accessibility</span> <span data-start="198.48" data-end="201.66">situation of web components and then</span> <span data-start="201.66" data-end="203.22">we'll answer that question about if</span> <span data-start="203.22" data-end="208.14">you're a hero or zero so when you're</span> <span data-start="208.14" data-end="210.51">creating things that are accessible or</span> <span data-start="210.51" data-end="212.94">any projects actually who are you</span> <span data-start="212.94" data-end="215.459">building it for I think sometimes we</span> <span data-start="215.459" data-end="217.47">forget that everybody has different</span> <span data-start="217.47" data-end="220.29">ability and it seems like some people</span> <span data-start="220.29" data-end="222.18">aren't actually building projects for</span> <span data-start="222.18" data-end="225.57">people which I find pretty peculiar so I</span> <span data-start="225.57" data-end="228.45">just want to remind us all that we're</span> <span data-start="228.45" data-end="230.19">building things for people and we all</span> <span data-start="230.19" data-end="231.93">have different abilities so it's</span> <span data-start="231.93" data-end="236.22">important to keep that in mind in</span> <span data-start="236.22" data-end="238.019">accessibility there are some traditional</span> <span data-start="238.019" data-end="240.959">groups of people that we talk about and</span> <span data-start="240.959" data-end="242.72">that includes blind and low-vision</span> <span data-start="242.72" data-end="246.299">there's people who they can see but</span> <span data-start="246.299" data-end="248.43">maybe they can't see very far and they</span> <span data-start="248.43" data-end="249.78">look at their phone really close to</span> <span data-start="249.78" data-end="252.87">their face all different kinds of visual</span> <span data-start="252.87" data-end="255.78">impairments deaf or hard of hearing so</span> <span data-start="255.78" data-end="257.22">if you have video you need to provide</span> <span data-start="257.22" data-end="261.66">captions physical disabilities there's a</span> <span data-start="261.66" data-end="263.789">huge range of those as well color</span> <span data-start="263.789" data-end="266.01">blindness which affects a lot of people</span> <span data-start="266.01" data-end="269.18">and then cognitive impairments</span> <span data-start="269.18" data-end="271.71">which are a little more challenging but</span> <span data-start="271.71" data-end="274.68">if you can make the copy in your project</span> <span data-start="274.68" data-end="276.599">read a little more understandably you</span> <span data-start="276.599" data-end="278.37">kind of cut down on the marketing speak</span> <span data-start="278.37" data-end="280.319">you can make something more</span> <span data-start="280.319" data-end="281.879">understandable to someone with a</span> <span data-start="281.879" data-end="285.96">cognitive impairment but really that</span> <span data-start="285.96" data-end="289.53">includes everybody so maybe you broke</span> <span data-start="289.53" data-end="291.449">your arm and you can't use a mouse for a</span> <span data-start="291.449" data-end="295.259">temporary period or maybe you had LASIK</span> <span data-start="295.259" data-end="297.18">eye surgery and you can't see for a</span> <span data-start="297.18" data-end="299.009">little while like we have these</span> <span data-start="299.009" data-end="300.539">different abilities that come and go</span> <span data-start="300.539" data-end="302.069">some people have to live with them</span> <span data-start="302.069" data-end="303.93">forever so it's important to remember</span> <span data-start="303.93" data-end="306.319">that not everybody can use a mouse or</span> <span data-start="306.319" data-end="313.259">see the screen so I wanted to find a</span> <span data-start="313.259" data-end="316.169">persona that we could focus on a little</span> <span data-start="316.169" data-end="319.47">bit and I remember that Stevie Wonder's</span> <span data-start="319.47" data-end="321.599">blind maybe I could find a picture of</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="321.599" data-end="323.31">Stevie Wonder so I went and looked for</span> <span data-start="323.31" data-end="326.009">one and i found this which is a picture</span> <span data-start="326.009" data-end="328.83">of a goat his name is actually Stevie</span> <span data-start="328.83" data-end="331.59">Wonder because he's a blind goat so I</span> <span data-start="331.59" data-end="333.389">went alright I like goats I'm gonna go</span> <span data-start="333.389" data-end="337.13">with that what a pic Stevie Wonder and</span> <span data-start="337.13" data-end="340.02">we're going to look at this graph I have</span> <span data-start="340.02" data-end="342.539">up on the screen that describes the</span> <span data-start="342.539" data-end="345.12">assistive technology process and there</span> <span data-start="345.12" data-end="346.979">are multiple assistive technologies but</span> <span data-start="346.979" data-end="348.99">the one we most commonly talked about is</span> <span data-start="348.99" data-end="352.139">a screen reader so in this diagram we're</span> <span data-start="352.139" data-end="354.69">seeing Stevie Wonder he interacts with a</span> <span data-start="354.69" data-end="356.94">web browser or in the case of our</span> <span data-start="356.94" data-end="359.069">project manager Microsoft Project so</span> <span data-start="359.069" data-end="362.19">some software application that software</span> <span data-start="362.19" data-end="364.949">application then interacts with another</span> <span data-start="364.949" data-end="366.9">application which is a screen reader in</span> <span data-start="366.9" data-end="369.029">this case and they talk back and forth</span> <span data-start="369.029" data-end="372.36">via and accessibility API and there are</span> <span data-start="372.36" data-end="375.18">multiple api's but there are some tricks</span> <span data-start="375.18" data-end="378.27">we can do to make that expanse fur of</span> <span data-start="378.27" data-end="382.08">data more understandable so this graph</span> <span data-start="382.08" data-end="384.719">is just indicating to you that there's</span> <span data-start="384.719" data-end="386.49">some interaction between the web browser</span> <span data-start="386.49" data-end="390.75">and the assistive technology so that was</span> <span data-start="390.75" data-end="392.61">the goal of this but Phoebe wonder</span> <span data-start="392.61" data-end="395.46">relies on his screen reader to tell him</span> <span data-start="395.46" data-end="396.839">what's on the screen because he can't</span> <span data-start="396.839" data-end="402.68">see it so in an ideal world</span> <span data-start="402.68" data-end="404.509">we should have everything work from the</span> <span data-start="404.509" data-end="407.6">keyboard have you ever navigated a</span> <span data-start="407.6" data-end="410.18">website without a mouse and you gave up</span> <span data-start="410.18" data-end="412.22">and started using the mouse because you</span> <span data-start="412.22" data-end="414.32">could you tried using the keyboard</span> <span data-start="414.32" data-end="415.82">you're having through you don't know</span> <span data-start="415.82" data-end="417.56">where you are maybe you got trapped</span> <span data-start="417.56" data-end="420.71">somewhere you gave up because you could</span> <span data-start="420.71" data-end="422.81">but what if you couldn't use a mouse at</span> <span data-start="422.81" data-end="426.74">all part of what makes this better that</span> <span data-start="426.74" data-end="428.03">we should do this is some low-hanging</span> <span data-start="428.03" data-end="430.4">fruit stuff that just applies to any</span> <span data-start="430.4" data-end="433.07">website that you build is that we should</span> <span data-start="433.07" data-end="435.47">provide good visual feedback it's really</span> <span data-start="435.47" data-end="437.78">helpful for everybody if you along with</span> <span data-start="437.78" data-end="439.88">the hover state you define a focus state</span> <span data-start="439.88" data-end="443.21">pretty easy right another thing you</span> <span data-start="443.21" data-end="446.96">consider is a logical tab order if you</span> <span data-start="446.96" data-end="448.849">tab through a web page what is the order</span> <span data-start="448.849" data-end="450.74">of elements that you see as you focus</span> <span data-start="450.74" data-end="452.96">throughout the screen it should go in a</span> <span data-start="452.96" data-end="455.509">linear fashion just no matter what your</span> <span data-start="455.509" data-end="457.94">layout looks like it should be logical</span> <span data-start="457.94" data-end="462.08">it shouldn't jump all over the place so</span> <span data-start="462.08" data-end="463.82">keyboard navigation is pretty important</span> <span data-start="463.82" data-end="465.86">if you have stuff hidden away in a mega</span> <span data-start="465.86" data-end="467.479">menu you should be able to get there</span> <span data-start="467.479" data-end="469.159">from the keyboard you shouldn't prevent</span> <span data-start="469.159" data-end="470.84">people who can't use a mouse from</span> <span data-start="470.84" data-end="475.58">navigating your website so with screen</span> <span data-start="475.58" data-end="478.46">reader access meaningful page structure</span> <span data-start="478.46" data-end="481.46">is really important so you want to</span> <span data-start="481.46" data-end="483.229">consider the outline of your document</span> <span data-start="483.229" data-end="487.13">not just the way it looks you should pay</span> <span data-start="487.13" data-end="489.5">attention to semantics you should use</span> <span data-start="489.5" data-end="492.77">headings you should think about what is</span> <span data-start="492.77" data-end="494.72">this document what am I trying to convey</span> <span data-start="494.72" data-end="497.69">and what is the best HTML that I could</span> <span data-start="497.69" data-end="499.82">use to communicate what is on the screen</span> <span data-start="499.82" data-end="502.43">right now you should have relevant non</span> <span data-start="502.43" data-end="504.71">visual content so if you have images you</span> <span data-start="504.71" data-end="506.84">need to explain what they are especially</span> <span data-start="506.84" data-end="509.36">in the case where we used to embed text</span> <span data-start="509.36" data-end="511.849">into images we have to provide that text</span> <span data-start="511.849" data-end="516.11">off-screen somehow you have to make it</span> <span data-start="516.11" data-end="517.909">usable without seeing basically it's</span> <span data-start="517.909" data-end="519.409">pretty important if you can't see the</span> <span data-start="519.409" data-end="521.75">screen you should know what's on it but</span> <span data-start="521.75" data-end="525.68">we forget that sometimes some general</span> <span data-start="525.68" data-end="527.18">accessibility things that we should</span> <span data-start="527.18" data-end="530.209">remember color contrast that's a huge</span> <span data-start="530.209" data-end="533.209">population of people who can't see some</span> <span data-start="533.209" data-end="535.61">of your texts because it doesn't stand</span> <span data-start="535.61" data-end="536.49">out enough over</span> <span data-start="536.49" data-end="538.8">the background on this
