<p><span data-start="61.35" data-end="62.35">Sure.</span> <span data-start="62.35" data-end="63.35">Why not.</span> <span data-start="63.35" data-end="64.35">But there's only one problem, Mr.†Cohen.</span> <span data-start="64.35" data-end="69.34">He says you speak so powerfully, but the slot is only for two minutes.</span> <span data-start="69.34" data-end="70.5">Two minutes.</span> <span data-start="70.5" data-end="72.07">It's a TV show.</span> <span data-start="72.07" data-end="73.54">It's snippets.</span> <span data-start="73.54" data-end="75.64">And the rabbi says, no problem.</span> <span data-start="75.64" data-end="78.61">I can bring that down to two minutes.</span> <span data-start="78.61" data-end="85.39">And Cohen said if you can do that for the talk show, can you do that every week?</span> <span data-start="85.39" data-end="91.53">I know I'm the penultimate talk before lunch, but I don't know about you, but in my community,</span> <span data-start="91.53" data-end="94.149">food and lunch is a big deal.</span> <span data-start="94.149" data-end="100.68">I understand if your stomach says you're hungry and try to be concise and keep to 25 minutes.</span> <span data-start="100.68" data-end="104.59">Although, a fair warning, rabbis can be a little verbose.</span> <span data-start="104.59" data-end="108.229">We can be a little longwinded, but I will try and keep it down.</span> <span data-start="108.229" data-end="112.869">So, the talk for today is preparing for the technical interview.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="165.47" data-end="169.129">This is from 2000, I think, this website.</span> <span data-start="169.129" data-end="171.39">This was the San Diego 2600 meeting.</span> <span data-start="171.39" data-end="175.63">Does anybody remember 2600 Magazine?</span> <span data-start="175.63" data-end="176.63">I see a hand.</span> <span data-start="176.63" data-end="177.63">2600 Magazine.</span> <span data-start="177.63" data-end="180.98">2600 Magazine was like a hacker magazine.</span> <span data-start="180.98" data-end="184.4">It was cool in the '90s, early 2000s.</span> <span data-start="184.4" data-end="186.67">And they had like meetings throughout the world.</span> <span data-start="186.67" data-end="189.79">I created the San Diego chapter of the 2600 meeting.</span> <span data-start="189.79" data-end="190.79">This was our website.</span> <span data-start="190.79" data-end="193.77">And it just recently got a facelift.</span> <span data-start="193.77" data-end="197.25">Capital W, capital S.

<p><span data-start="284.4" data-end="286.71">But it was $35.</span> <span data-start="286.71" data-end="292.57">And so, after that, from my childhood in San Diego and being a bit involved in computers</span> <span data-start="292.57" data-end="294.49">I moved to New York.</span> <span data-start="294.49" data-end="297.14">So, from the sunny San Diego to New York.</span> <span data-start="297.14" data-end="299.85">And that's what it looks like all year if you have never been there.</span> <span data-start="299.85" data-end="300.85">Believe me.</span> <span data-start="300.85" data-end="301.96">That's New York City.</span> <span data-start="301.96" data-end="308.31">And I went to New York to a small liberal arts Jewish college in Queens.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="396.9" data-end="398.09">Studied that.</span> <span data-start="398.09" data-end="401.57">And once I was a rabbi, I was doing stuff like this.</span> <span data-start="401.57" data-end="404.5">Talking about matzah and holding it up.</span> <span data-start="404.5" data-end="408.71">Every rabbi has this.</span> <span data-start="408.71" data-end="414.25">It was important.</span> <span data-start="414.25" data-end="420.91">I was leading this in Chicago on the topic of gun violence.</span> <span data-start="420.91" data-end="425.93">If you're not from the States, it's regrettably a major issue.</span> <span data-start="425.93" data-end="428.96">I was at that time a community organizer in Chicago.</span> <span data-start="428.96" data-end="431.84">That's what I was actually doing.</span> <span data-start="431.84" data-end="433.87">I wasn't doing anything else.</span> <span data-start="433.87" data-end="436.17">I had actually gone to the school.</span> <span data-start="436.17" data-end="441.89">And fast forward ten years and I decided I wanted to have a change in pace.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="507.62" data-end="509.4">Coding was incredibly technical.</span> <span data-start="509.4" data-end="511.83">It's a highly, highly technical field.</span> <span data-start="511.83" data-end="513.76">It's an incredibly creative field.</span> <span data-start="513.76" data-end="518.76">And for those of us who come from other creative professions, whether it's art or somewhere</span> <span data-start="518.76" data-end="524.01">else, you get to exercise that part of your brain all the time as a programmer.</span> <span data-start="524.01" data-end="527.44">In different ways, in totally different modalities.</span> <span data-start="527.44" data-end="529.089">But you still get to create all the time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="529.089" data-end="532.57">And we also love it because of jobs.</span> <span data-start="532.57" data-end="534.97">There's a lot of jobs as a programmer.</span> <span data-start="534.97" data-end="537.82">New York City, there are tons of programming jobs.</span> <span data-start="537.82" data-end="538.82">It is awesome.</span> <span data-start="538.82" data-end="540.75">When you have a family to support, it's even better.</span> <span data-start="540.75" data-end="543.11">And we love it because of the excitement of learning.</span> <span data-start="543.11" data-end="545.24">You never stop learning as a programmer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="545.24" data-end="546.86">Actually, reminds me of my education.</span> <span data-start="546.86" data-end="554.4">It never ends, every time you see a word, what does it mean?</span> <span data-start="554.4" data-end="557.49">Another JavaScript framework, how can I pick up that?</span> <span data-start="557.49" data-end="558.68">It never stops.</span> <span data-start="558.68" data-end="560.87">And we love it because of jobs.</span> <span data-start="560.87" data-end="562.57">Did I say that already?</span> <span data-start="562.57" data-end="563.93">I think I did.</span> <span data-start="563.93" data-end="566.65">We love the fact that we can make an impact.</span> <span data-start="566.65" data-end="568.61">Working at whatever kind of company you work at.</span> <span data-start="568.61" data-end="574.08">I work at a financial services company, if you work at a nonprofit, you can make a difference.</span> <span data-start="574.08" data-end="580.39">When it's a good day, not every day is a good day, but on a good day, you can say I have</span> <span data-start="580.39" data-end="581.51">done something.</span> </p>
