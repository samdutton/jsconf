<p><span data-start="1.43" data-end="13.6">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="13.6" data-end="21.23">Thank you for the introduction.</span> <span data-start="21.23" data-end="26.58">So, like he said, I want to talk about Javascript tools today.</span> <span data-start="26.58" data-end="33.07">And specifically how you can use type information to help scale your code base. As you add more</span> <span data-start="33.07" data-end="38.76">code and developers, there are areas where it is harder to maintain and evolving and</span> <span data-start="38.76" data-end="40.94">changing.</span> <span data-start="40.94" data-end="44.55">My name is Mark. I'm software engineer at Google.</span> <span data-start="44.55" data-end="48.5">This is the number of lines of JS lines at Google.</span> <span data-start="48.5" data-end="54.78">It is up to the right. It is going at fast pace.</span> <span data-start="54.78" data-end="61">We are adding the size multiple times a year now.</span> <span data-start="61" data-end="68.14">The number of developers are going at that same pace. A bit frightening.</span> <span data-start="68.14" data-end="75.11">With this we have 1 single large codebase. At some point this becomes harder to maintain,</span> <span data-start="75.11" data-end="78.79">change the codebase and keep a high quality part.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="78.79" data-end="87.43">And so, myself and a few others at Google spend time to figure out what we can do to</span> <span data-start="87.43" data-end="93.24">eliviate this problem. To make it easier to keep the codebase.</span> <span data-start="93.24" data-end="99.33">One example challenge. If you want to rename a function.</span> <span data-start="99.33" data-end="101.34">You have a class and define a function.</span> <span data-start="101.34" data-end="103.869">It has a generic name to it.</span> <span data-start="103.869" data-end="109.26">But, because your code is so large, you have 50 other classes that have that name. How</span> <span data-start="109.26" data-end="117.17">do you differentiate between codes, 2 objects of the type. When you want to rename one and</span> <span data-start="117.17" data-end="119.579">not the other one.</span> <span data-start="119.579" data-end="126.99">This and other problems. To help fix these we worked on 2 tools.</span> <span data-start="126.99" data-end="130.14">The first is RefasterJS.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="130.14" data-end="133.329">Tool to make refactoring easy.</span> <span data-start="133.329" data-end="138.319">All the excuses that developer can come up why it is hard to change code.</span> <span data-start="138.319" data-end="144.29">There are too many people to depend on it. It is impossible to fix.</span> <span data-start="144.29" data-end="148.939">This ptool should make this all go away.</span> <span data-start="148.939" data-end="151.999">The second thing is JS conformance.</span> <span data-start="151.999" data-end="159.78">A way to prevent bad code from coming back. It helps developers and your project keep</span> <span data-start="159.78" data-end="161.51">a high code quality.</span> <span data-start="161.51" data-end="166.659">No matter who is submitting the code, you can make sure it is preventing bad code from</span> <span data-start="166.659" data-end="169.349">coming in.</span> <span data-start="169.349" data-end="171.84">To tie everything in.</span> <span data-start="171.84" data-end="177.359">It is important. How do you eliminate Xss issues in your project?</span> <span data-start="177.359" data-end="186.609">It can be costly to the user. Using user data. And the company with lawsuits, privacy. And</span> <span data-start="186.609" data-end="187.609">so forth.</span> <span data-start="187.609" data-end="195.93">And so, using RefasterJS and existing. And how Conformance can prevent from coming back</span> <span data-start="195.93" data-end="200.209">again.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="200.209" data-end="206.83">This example is based on something the Security at Google has worked on over the last year.</span> <span data-start="206.83" data-end="219.439">They call Api hardening. Specifically, they worked on a library,goog.Dom.Safe.</span> <span data-start="219.439" data-end="230.799">The dom Api has a lot of security holes.</span> <span data-start="230.799" data-end="241.459">And important is, if you are assigned to the Hrf window.Location. And the they can execute</span> <span data-start="241.459" data-end="248.23">arbitrary javascript code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="248.23" data-end="254.43">With a very tiny change that anyone could implement, you can rewrite it to a safe set</span> <span data-start="254.43" data-end="262.56">of location. That would sanitize the input. No attack is executed.</span> <span data-start="262.56" data-end="272.07">A colleague of mine published an article on the Acm. On the overall effort and other api's.</span> <span data-start="272.07" data-end="274.59">An interesting read.</span> <span data-start="274.59" data-end="280.77">So, to dive into the first tool I want to talk about is RefasterJS.</span> <span data-start="280.77" data-end="286.52">This i a tool where you write Ravascript.</span> <span data-start="286.52" data-end="290.979">We shouldn't have to write another language or learn something new to try to change a</span> <span data-start="290.979" data-end="291.979">piece of code.</span> <span data-start="291.979" data-end="302.18">We should be able to write and something should make that happen.</span> <span data-start="302.18" data-end="308.15">It is core additional. Type information to pinpoint the code that you want to change.</span> <span data-start="308.15" data-end="313.55">It is not matching too much, and not too little. Just matching what you want.</span> <span data-start="313.55" data-end="319.569">We ran it over the google javascript.</span> <span data-start="319.569" data-end="325.75">It is running in minutes across large sets of code.</span> <span data-start="325.75" data-end="334.64">The core piece of thing you need to provide is a JS file. It looks like this.</span> <span data-start="334.64" data-end="340.93">And there is 2 functions that you provide to the refasterJS tool.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="340.93" data-end="348.21">If you notice, these tools are based on the closure compilor. An open source compiler</span> <span data-start="348.21" data-end="350.11">from Google.</span> <span data-start="350.11" data-end="356.719">Main thing is the ability to process type information and store it and use it at later</span> <span data-start="356.719" data-end="358.74">time to do time checking and optimisations.</span> <span data-start="358.74" data-end="366.789">If you are familiar with that you are familiar with the type annotation syntax.</span> <span data-start="366.789" data-end="377.63">But, the first template shows, what code should be matched. If you pass 100 source files it</span> <span data-start="377.63" data-end="381.99">knows which statements are the ones you want to target.</span> <span data-start="381.99" data-end="386.669">And the second thing is that when you have those matches, how do you apply a fix? How</span> <span data-start="386.669" data-end="390.919">do you transform the code? What should it look like?</span> <span data-start="390.919" data-end="395.879">In this case we want to match any direct assignments to location.href and transform it to use the</span> <span data-start="395.879" data-end="399.409">goog.dom.safe library.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="399.409" data-end="404.659">And so, looking at the matching code, it looks a little bit like this.</span> <span data-start="404.659" data-end="411.999">And this will match the direct assignment where you have the lefthand side window.Location.href</span> <span data-start="411.999" data-end="413.68">equals some string.</span> <span data-start="413.68" data-end="421.599">But also, match the alias, window.Location to local variable.</span> <span data-start="421.599" data-end="428.49">And on the righthandside you have a function that returns. It still knows how to match.</span> <span data-start="428.49" data-end="437.719">This is not of the correct type. This is where the type information comes into play because</span> <span data-start="437.719" data-end="441.909">it knows how to differentiate between these cases.</span> <span data-start="441.909" data-end="444.86">How does it do this?</span> <span data-start="444.86" data-end="449.139">Well, the first thing it needs to do is build an AST.</span> <span data-start="449.139" data-end="451.8">An abstract syntex tree.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="451.8" data-end="458.86">Without going into detail. How does a compiler represent a piece of code?</span> <span data-start="458.86" data-end="464.37">As you see here on the lefthandside is the node structure.</span> <span data-start="464.37" data-end="475.31">An assignment, the lefthandside with property and lefthandside with variable.</span> <span data-start="475.31" data-end="482.27">On the righthandside you can see highlighted, this preserves type information.</span> <span data-start="482.27" data-end="487.34">A lot of other Ast's don't preserve this information.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="487.34" data-end="493.3">They don't know how to infer the type information for code.</span> <span data-start="493.3" data-end="504.55">And looking at a quick demo, there is a webservice tool.</span> <span data-start="504.55" data-end="508.33">Where we can look. That the compiler team provides.</span> <span data-start="508.33" data-end="511.389">We can store a piece of code here.</span> <span data-start="511.389" data-end="514.99">Zooming is not working very well.</span> <span data-start="514.99" data-end="522.449">And then on the righthandside when we compile this, we can see what the Ast looks like.</span> <span data-start="522.449" data-end="526.07">This is exactly the same as what you see on the slides.</span> <span data-start="526.07" data-end="533.449">We have the variable declarations for accessing, storing the Url and the location object into</span> <span data-start="533.449" data-end="535.05">local variables.</span> <span data-start="535.05" data-end="539.88">You see here, it knows the type information.</span> <span data-start="539.88" data-end="547.889">whether it is a string or window object or location object.</span> <span data-start="547.889" data-end="553.329">That's a nifty tool if you want to play around and see what the compiler is doing. And what</span> <span data-start="553.329" data-end="556.05">the Ast, and types look like.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="556.05" data-end="563">Once you have this, then the tool needs to compare structures from the template against</span> <span data-start="563" data-end="564">the source code.</span> <span data-start="564" data-end="569.459">There are a lot of different ways to do it. Depending on the accuracy and what you have</span> <span data-start="569.459" data-end="570.709">available.</span> <span data-start="570.709" data-end="578.35">A naieve approach is this.</span> <span data-start="578.35" data-end="587.01">You take the lefthandside. Which is the structure of the code and make sure that those match.</span> <span data-start="587.01" data-end="593.72">And if you change 1 node in it. You change it from a variable to a string, then it won't</span> <span data-start="593.72" data-end="595.37">match anymore.</span> <span data-start="595.37" data-end="601">This will match things like location.Href = url.</span> <span data-start="601" data-end="607.64">Some randomobject. With somestring. That is the same structure. Even though the types</span> <span data-start="607.64" data-end="611.23">and the names are different.</span> <span data-start="611.23" data-end="613.58">It won't match something like location.Href.</span> <span data-start="613.58" data-end="617.639">They have different structures.</span> <span data-start="617.639" data-end="622.29">You can improve this a little bit. You can use the node structure and the name of the</span> <span data-start="622.29" data-end="624.32">variables.</span> <span data-start="624.32" data-end="629.019">But again if you do that, changing one of the two, the structure or the variable name</span> <span data-start="629.019" data-end="631.38">causes it to break.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="631.38" data-end="638.709">This will match, it will match that.</span> <span data-start="638.709" data-end="644.12">Also matches if you just have a normal object. And it won't match where you change the variable</span> <span data-start="644.12" data-end="649.37">name zozer this is not really what we want. It is not accurate enough.</span> <span data-start="649.37" data-end="656.93">That's where we get to the last matching. It uses the node name instruction. Or the</span> <span data-start="656.93" data-end="658.24">JS type.</span> <span data-start="658.24" data-end="663.66">This is where the type comes in handy to have the flexibility to match different pieces</span> <span data-start="663.66" data-end="665.06">of code.</span> <span data-start="665.06" data-end="672.3">And so, every level in this Ast you can see it is matching on left or righthandside.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="672.3" data-end="675.68">It doesn't have to match both.</span> <span data-start="675.68" data-end="679.85">And the way it knows whether which one it needs to match, you told it.</span> <span data-start="679.85" data-end="683.25">In the template you told it which are the types.</span> <span data-start="683.25" data-end="687.82">And which have to be the exact same thing.</span> <span data-start="687.82" data-end="691.99">The Href property has to be href.</span> <span data-start="691.99" data-end="700.43">Here you see that the boxes correspond, these Ast's are different. They use the same type</span> <span data-start="700.43" data-end="706.92">zozer this is okay. This is what RefasterJs matches.</span> <span data-start="706.92" data-end="720.449">And so with this, we get matching the alias case. Or where we have the whole thing.</span> <span data-start="720.449" data-end="726.589">We don't get, if you just have an object. assign a property on that. It is of a different</span> <span data-start="726.589" data-end="733.44">type. This is looking pretty good. It will match the right set of code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="733.44" data-end="737.949">Once we have that, then we need to take this code and transform it to what the code we</span> <span data-start="737.949" data-end="739.85">wanted to look like.</span> <span data-start="739.85" data-end="745.49">And so, it looks, this function looks similar to the before case. Except the body of the</span> <span data-start="745.49" data-end="753.89">function corresponds to what you want the code to look like.</span> <span data-start="753.89" data-end="759.139">And so, it will take an iexample like the top piece of code and then transform it to</span> <span data-start="759.139" data-end="760.959">something like the bottom piece of code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="760.959" data-end="767.17">Where you preserve the names. The tool doesn't care about that.</span> <span data-start="767.17" data-end="775.709">You can alias window.Location to any name. And it will preserve the right piece of code.</span> <span data-start="775.709" data-end="779.77">It does it because of the matching by type.</span> <span data-start="779.77" data-end="787.661">In a template, theLoc variable should be replaced by the source code from the same type. It</span> <span data-start="787.661" data-end="791.97">can preserve the structure and names.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="791.97" data-end="799.39">And so, taking a look at a demo, back to the handy webserver page.</span> <span data-start="799.39" data-end="809.05">We can see, down here, that the template you can enter in this page the template. As it</span> <span data-start="809.05" data-end="810.05">looks.</span> <span data-start="810.05" data-end="819.3">This is the same as what I had on the slides. Including matching. And then, you can see</span> <span data-start="819.3" data-end="820.329">up top.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="820.329" data-end="823.36">That I have input a lot of sample code.</span> <span data-start="823.36" data-end="825.83">Following differentn JS contracts you might have.</span> <span data-start="825.83" data-end="835.23">A direct assignment. Assigning it to functions. Whatever it may be.</span> <span data-start="835.23" data-end="842.26">And then, when I hit this button and run, I can then see what the tool will transform</span> <span data-start="842.26" data-end="845.459">the code to look like.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="845.459" data-end="850.29">And so here, I can zoom in a little bit.</span> <span data-start="850.29" data-end="858.98">I can see it transforms the statements on the lefthandside to the corresponding function.</span> <span data-start="858.98" data-end="860.779">Preserving the code structure.</span> <span data-start="860.779" data-end="868.42">Whether it is using a string, variable name, function call, or even accepting function</span> <span data-start="868.42" data-end="871.449">parameters and preserving that as well.</span> <span data-start="871.449" data-end="886.45">Again, because it understands type information. It doesn't match location. Like an object.</span> <span data-start="886.45" data-end="893.22">And so, this is pretty handy tool. It can show you how you can debug this. If you have</span> <span data-start="893.22" data-end="898.399">warnings in the code. The code isn't formatted correctly.</span> <span data-start="898.399" data-end="903.52">Also shows you at the bottom, the Ast are the template and source code.</span> <span data-start="903.52" data-end="909.13">If something is not looking torrectly, you can compare these and see whether they should</span> <span data-start="909.13" data-end="917.67">or should not match, based on the type information and node names.</span> <span data-start="917.67" data-end="920.779">Like I said, this was designed for codebases.</span> <span data-start="920.779" data-end="927.79">If it is large enough. You can run it as run as a mapreduce.</span> <span data-start="927.79" data-end="936.47">In a matter of seconds or minutes, run it across hundreds, thousands, millions of files.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="936.47" data-end="941.6">And just in a very short amount of time.</span> <span data-start="941.6" data-end="948.67">In addition to fixing, an important thing to do.</span> <span data-start="948.67" data-end="951.9">How can you keep evolving your codebase?</span> <span data-start="951.9" data-end="957.35">As your code groows, more and more people are depending on core libraries and Api's.</span> <span data-start="957.35" data-end="960.25">It becomes harder and harder to change these.</span> <span data-start="960.25" data-end="966.85">If you wrote it 5 years ago. You may want to change the type signature. How people use</span> <span data-start="966.85" data-end="969.52">it. Migrate to something else.</span> <span data-start="969.52" data-end="977.07">It becomes harder and harder. This can be used to make sure that all the excuses engineers</span> <span data-start="977.07" data-end="984.76">have for not modifying code are eliminated and they can constantly evolve the codebase</span> <span data-start="984.76" data-end="993.279">and hive the highest quality standard. And it is robust and nice to use.</span> <span data-start="993.279" data-end="1000.269">This is how we refactor core libraries inside Google. It is very useful.</span> <span data-start="1000.269" data-end="1005.769">So, common question that burns on people's mind. I don't use type information</span> <span data-start="1005.769" data-end="1008.949">Is this of any use to me?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1008.949" data-end="1014.449">There is good and bad news. Yes, it can be useful.</span> <span data-start="1014.449" data-end="1019.27">But at the same time, the compiler might not have all the information that it needs. You</span> <span data-start="1019.27" data-end="1022.61">may get unexpected results.</span> <span data-start="1022.61" data-end="1031.96">And so, opening this demo, you can see on this righthandside I have a function where</span> <span data-start="1031.96" data-end="1037.01">I take an anchor and assign it to some url.</span> <span data-start="1037.01" data-end="1045.73">So, in the example I gave before, this shouldn't match. You have an anchor tag and not location.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1045.73" data-end="1053.33">Unfortunately, because there is no type information, we have to transform this. You get a lot of</span> <span data-start="1053.33" data-end="1057.08">false positives in this case.</span> <span data-start="1057.08" data-end="1064.431">The good news is that the team does a lot of work trying to improve type imprints. They</span> <span data-start="1064.431" data-end="1070.71">have a major change coming out over the next months. Which will keep improving how much</span> <span data-start="1070.71" data-end="1078.6">type information can be inferred. There is a series of passes that takes information.</span> <span data-start="1078.6" data-end="1086.62">How do you call a function, what variables. and tries to infer the rest of the code. You</span> <span data-start="1086.62" data-end="1089.09">don't have to explicitly type it.</span> <span data-start="1089.09" data-end="1095.83">And so, constantly trying to improve this, the refasterJs tool can become more useful</span> <span data-start="1095.83" data-end="1102.75">for projects that don't use type annotations.</span> <span data-start="1102.75" data-end="1112.45">So, now that you fixed the existing usages in the code. You want to make sure people</span> <span data-start="1112.45" data-end="1121.21">don't introduce new ones. Every new one. Something that your project, you don't want to be submitted</span> <span data-start="1121.21" data-end="1123.42">in your project.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1123.42" data-end="1128.93">As your project grows and your company grows, it is not feasible to make sure somebody keeps</span> <span data-start="1128.93" data-end="1132.34">an eye on the codebase.</span> <span data-start="1132.34" data-end="1143.87">UYou can help make sure it becomes problematic. They never get submitted in the first place.</span> <span data-start="1143.87" data-end="1149.22">So with a few lines of code that you can pass the configuration to the closure compiler,</span> <span data-start="1149.22" data-end="1157.59">you can prevent this from the direct assignment ever coming back. And the user would get a</span> <span data-start="1157.59" data-end="1164.39">nice compiler error saying, this is not allowed. This i a violation. You are not allowed to</span> <span data-start="1164.39" data-end="1172.88">directly assign to location href. But use goog.Dom.Safe instead. With this, the developer</span> <span data-start="1172.88" data-end="1176.63">knows they have to go back and fix their code.</span> <span data-start="1176.63" data-end="1185.32">You have avoided it. Whether it is something else. If you are refactoring api's and so</span> <span data-start="1185.32" data-end="1186.45">forth.</span> <span data-start="1186.45" data-end="1194.57">So, breaking down this configuration, the first thing you want to provide to is the</span> <span data-start="1194.57" data-end="1196.55">type of the conformance.</span> <span data-start="1196.55" data-end="1199.85">Here we are u using a banned property write.</span> <span data-start="1199.85" data-end="1204.81">We want to ban people assigning to a property.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1204.81" data-end="1212.31">There are a lot of other confommance types. Each one is meant to target a specific idiom</span> <span data-start="1212.31" data-end="1222.52">JS developers use. Writing or reading a property. Calling a function. and so forth.</span> <span data-start="1222.52" data-end="1232.64">And as another example, you can ban eval by saying, ban name and specify eval as the value.</span> <span data-start="1232.64" data-end="1240.3">More complicated, you can use the refasterJs syntax for flexible configuration for the</span> <span data-start="1240.3" data-end="1243.33">compiler that matches more complex statements.</span> <span data-start="1243.33" data-end="1252.56">If there is something more complicated than banning a property, you can use this syntax,</span> <span data-start="1252.56" data-end="1261.63">the same as RefasterJs. To create the configuration as well.</span> <span data-start="1261.63" data-end="1267.01">The second thing you need to do is provide which value you want to ban. This depends</span> <span data-start="1267.01" data-end="1273.41">on the type. In this case. We are banning property rights. We want to ban anything that</span> <span data-start="1273.41" data-end="1279.79">is assigned to location prototype href. It can be any object or property name you want.</span> <span data-start="1279.79" data-end="1284.54">in your entire codebase.</span> <span data-start="1284.54" data-end="1288.81">You want to provide a nice error message. This is what developers would see when they</span> <span data-start="1288.81" data-end="1296.46">get a violation. You want to be informative and telling the developer why it is not allowed</span> <span data-start="1296.46" data-end="1299.16">and what they can use instead.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1299.16" data-end="1306.88">When they see this, okay, I have to go back, make a quick change. Use goog.Dom.Safe instead.</span> <span data-start="1306.88" data-end="1314.79">You can use a whitelist. This directory has been approved by the security team. It has</span> <span data-start="1314.79" data-end="1326.81">been heavily audited. This file won't be warned upon when the compiler checks the code.</span> <span data-start="1326.81" data-end="1333.79">Going back to the handy debugger page, that we were at earlier.</span> <span data-start="1333.79" data-end="1342.63">There is a box here, if you want to try this out that contains the conformance configuration.</span> <span data-start="1342.63" data-end="1350.11">You can see that this configuration is the same as what you saw on the slides earlier.</span> <span data-start="1350.11" data-end="1356.55">And then you can again go up to the box here. And insert some javascript. Whatever you want</span> <span data-start="1356.55" data-end="1360.36">to test.</span> <span data-start="1360.36" data-end="1371.91">When you hit compile, you can see here that the compiler in this warning box shows you</span> <span data-start="1371.91" data-end="1377.93">the violation.</span> <span data-start="1377.93" data-end="1393.46">If I change the piece of code to say again, I want to change the type. If I alias the</span> <span data-start="1393.46" data-end="1397.5">variable. And hit compile.</span> <span data-start="1397.5" data-end="1403.491">It knows the code structure and type information. And this statement is still not allowed. If</span> <span data-start="1403.491" data-end="1414.75">you alias local variables. Do whatever magic you want. It is able to warn.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1414.75" data-end="1422.22">And only warn on the cases where it is actually a violation.</span> <span data-start="1422.22" data-end="1430.53">So, just like refasterJs. There is a number of possibilities you can do this.</span> <span data-start="1430.53" data-end="1437.22">It is similar that you can do. But because it knows type information, you can take it</span> <span data-start="1437.22" data-end="1446.02">1 step further. And more different problems that you find in your code base. Including</span> <span data-start="1446.02" data-end="1454.85">eval, html. Document.Write. And so forth.</span> <span data-start="1454.85" data-end="1463.43">You can also use it as part of the core library team. For restrict api calls. From one api</span> <span data-start="1463.43" data-end="1470.6">to another. You want people to prevent using the old one if you migrate.</span> <span data-start="1470.6" data-end="1483.98">If you migrate to promises, banning your old, whatever there might be, would be a good use.</span> <span data-start="1483.98" data-end="1491.66">You can also specify any team or project specific concerns that you have. The framework is flexible.</span> <span data-start="1491.66" data-end="1501.1">So, all these tools are now available open source on the closure-compiler page.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1501.1" data-end="1508.47">I hope that.. Oh, oh..</span> <span data-start="1508.47" data-end="1518.95">Computer is freaking out.</span> <span data-start="1518.95" data-end="1524.75">Okay.</span> <span data-start="1524.75" data-end="1526.67">So these tools are available open source.</span> <span data-start="1526.67" data-end="1530.61">All the debugging are available.</span> <span data-start="1530.61" data-end="1536.07">You can use them to take a look of the tools. And see if they are useful.</span> <span data-start="1536.07" data-end="1542.07">I hope that by trying to utilize type information..</span> <span data-start="1542.07" data-end="1547.65">i'm going to..</span> <span data-start="1547.65" data-end="1552.98">That you can try to take a codebase one step further. And it scales as it grows with the</span> <span data-start="1552.98" data-end="1556.12">number of code.</span> <span data-start="1556.12" data-end="1561.94">You can keep it secure performant and highest code quality that you can</span> <span data-start="1561.94" data-end="1565.88">And so please take a look and provide feedback. Definitely interested in hearing how it can</span> <span data-start="1565.88" data-end="1567.86">be used externally. Thank you.</span> </p>
