<p><span data-start="0.62" data-end="11.93">One, two, three, you hear me.</span> <span data-start="11.93" data-end="23.66">Good afternoon, it's a pleasure to be here the day, we oar very excited to introduce</span> <span data-start="23.66" data-end="32.23">a new technology that developed in the past 12 months using JavaScript and some with WiFi</span> <span data-start="32.23" data-end="39.19">and blue tooth connectivity that allow us to have the IOT connected with the JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="39.19" data-end="45.84">I just make a quick introduction about myself, May name is Frederico, I'm planning a global\h‑‑</span> <span data-start="45.84" data-end="55.559">called dog Hunter, the little guys on the hon train with my two daughters, we have a</span> <span data-start="55.559" data-end="64.309">global start up based in US\h‑‑ we build WiFi modules.</span> <span data-start="64.309" data-end="74.53">We are here today to explain a little bit about our Open Sourcability prop named Linieo,</span> <span data-start="74.53" data-end="84.87">the philosophy behind the Linio project is basically to bring the hacker community and</span> <span data-start="84.87" data-end="86.88">the maker community all together.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="86.88" data-end="94.84">So we're building a gateway that allow the hackers that try apps on the web to talk with</span> <span data-start="94.84" data-end="100.85">the makers community that usually write software for the real things.</span> <span data-start="100.85" data-end="105.2">Switch, Light Controllers stuff like that.</span> <span data-start="105.2" data-end="106.22">What is Linio,.</span> <span data-start="106.22" data-end="112.36">It's an Open Source project based on an echo system.</span> <span data-start="112.36" data-end="120.61">So we build hardware, we build WiFi and blue tooth modules, we write open software that</span> <span data-start="120.61" data-end="127.4">allow us to use JavaScript to interact with micro controller, we write also the open Cloud</span> <span data-start="127.4" data-end="134.079">software that allows the user to interact with the Cloud.</span> <span data-start="134.079" data-end="146.069">We call this project Lin Io, we have Lino.OS, IO and J S, we call it Linux for IoT.</span> <span data-start="146.069" data-end="153.519">What we're trying to do is we build a server module, sever hardware, one of the module</span> <span data-start="153.519" data-end="162.659">is a Chiwawa, a small lodge yule of Linux built in, and we built this module in any</span> <span data-start="162.659" data-end="170.459">devices that has an MCU, so basically we bring the powerful Linux inside the MCU.</span> <span data-start="170.459" data-end="179.219">As you can see here, we have full Linux OO is package manager, WiFi connectivity, and</span> <span data-start="179.219" data-end="189.459">we build this module inside free scale MCU, At mel,SM any generic MC um, we transform</span> <span data-start="189.459" data-end="196.459">the dam devises into something we call smart devices connected all together with WiFi and</span> <span data-start="196.459" data-end="197.799">blue tooth.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="197.799" data-end="211.659">So, how do we do that? The classic approach is basically to write code for the MCU and</span> <span data-start="211.659" data-end="218.019">then to find the library or gateway that allow the Linux to talk with MCU.</span> <span data-start="218.019" data-end="219.939">We build something different.</span> <span data-start="219.939" data-end="229.04">We basically took the MCU directly inside the Linux part, and then all the features</span> <span data-start="229.04" data-end="238.97">of the MCU that should be analog devices GPIO, PWM, SPSPI is part of the Linux part, it's</span> <span data-start="238.97" data-end="248.239">all together in just one core (SPI, UART\h‑‑ what we're able to do here is to keep the</span> <span data-start="248.239" data-end="257.75">MPU for Apache, JavaScript, and OGS and still use the MCU for the real‑time application.</span> <span data-start="257.75" data-end="263.83">And, we do that not only on the wireless space but also\h‑‑ not only in the wired space,</span> <span data-start="263.83" data-end="269.65">but also the wireless, any module that is connected on our network exsport the features</span> <span data-start="269.65" data-end="275.849">of the Linux OS, and we're able to see all these features just in the file system.</span> <span data-start="275.849" data-end="284.09">So, basically, we can control devices, just\h‑‑ that's a very simple example that I have here,</span> <span data-start="284.09" data-end="292.889">using switch on or switch off and basically what happen when I use this devices everything</span> <span data-start="292.889" data-end="297.9">is on the file system, so I can see the results of my devices directly in the file system.</span> <span data-start="297.9" data-end="302.681">The sample that I have here, I can change the PWM value just changing a value in the</span> <span data-start="302.681" data-end="315.18">file system, as you can see in the Sys/Class/Mcuio\h‑‑ I can do the ADP and the GIO in the classical</span> <span data-start="315.18" data-end="320.68">application you have to write your application in the MCU, you need to write your application</span> <span data-start="320.68" data-end="325.69">in the Linux, and then you need to use some API some bridge to talk together.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="325.69" data-end="331.08">With this solution you don't have to do that, but just to use the file system, so whatever</span> <span data-start="331.08" data-end="335.669">happened on the MCU would be exported on this file system here.</span> <span data-start="335.669" data-end="345.659">So, we build bunch of hardware modules that have already this technology.</span> <span data-start="345.659" data-end="357.009">One very famous is that Arduino Yun, we build this module last September and as you can</span> <span data-start="357.009" data-end="363.312">see we build basically an MCU from Atmil and we build the Linux part and we bring it all</span> <span data-start="363.312" data-end="365.41">together.</span> <span data-start="365.41" data-end="372.83">We have other modules like something we call lightening OI, the same stuff we did with</span> <span data-start="372.83" data-end="380.77">Rrdin Yun\h‑‑ just a different form factor.</span> <span data-start="380.77" data-end="388.27">We build also some modules LJ module we call Chiwawa, it's for mass production, same thing</span> <span data-start="388.27" data-end="396.57">you can use with Yun other Yun one but a small module you can bring on your project.</span> <span data-start="396.57" data-end="403.639">And then we have some other module that are available today to $2 .4 and 5 gig hearts,</span> <span data-start="403.639" data-end="409.34">we have a free scale MCU, because very important part that e with build this technology as</span> <span data-start="409.34" data-end="416.169">a cross platform technology, so we can use, basically an ATML MCU, and new MCment that</span> <span data-start="416.169" data-end="418.27">you are working right now.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="418.27" data-end="423.689">And, of course, we also build some shield, so with the sensor that allow you to control</span> <span data-start="423.689" data-end="425.479">stuff.</span> <span data-start="425.479" data-end="429.8">So let me talk a little bit about the software modules.</span> <span data-start="429.8" data-end="436.379">And, talk a little bit about open stack and then show you some sample we did and we are</span> <span data-start="436.379" data-end="439.569">able to show you in the back stage.</span> <span data-start="439.569" data-end="447.189">So, basically we have two modules the hardware that is the Linux part and the MCU part, and</span> <span data-start="447.189" data-end="455">in this sample here we have a Mips Mpu, we have our Linux up and running, and then we</span> <span data-start="455" data-end="462.699">have the Linio that is another small operating system that is up and running on MCU, and</span> <span data-start="462.699" data-end="467.55">we are able to export all features directly on the file system on the Linux machine, doesn't</span> <span data-start="467.55" data-end="473.25">matter if the Linux machine is on my desk or is somewhere else, like Boston, Chicago,</span> <span data-start="473.25" data-end="478.069">time able to control everything as native application on my desk.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="478.069" data-end="487.55">So, this Linio operating system, we're yourselfing right now open WRT, and we building top of</span> <span data-start="487.55" data-end="497.05">that Linio using the Linux card modules and on top of that we is the NOGS for embedded</span> <span data-start="497.05" data-end="505.31">development or we can use just the shell scripting Java, Lua, Python, and of course, on top of</span> <span data-start="505.31" data-end="511.27">everything, we have the application wrote in JavaScript for mobile application or Cloud</span> <span data-start="511.27" data-end="514.57">applications.</span> <span data-start="514.57" data-end="521.979">To keep simple we build a small ID that runs directly on the module, you don't need external</span> <span data-start="521.979" data-end="531.57">application, external tools, you can use our ID Linio that is built directly inside the</span> <span data-start="531.57" data-end="532.72">module.</span> <span data-start="532.72" data-end="538.66">As you can see, you can definitely use no node JS to write your application as a sever</span> <span data-start="538.66" data-end="539.779">label.</span> <span data-start="539.779" data-end="550.079">This is a screen shop of Ideino, we have the mile manager, everything is Open Source, everything</span> <span data-start="550.079" data-end="555.04">is available directly inside the module.</span> <span data-start="555.04" data-end="562.04">We made a couple slides now that we are trying to show you a real scenario, so the first</span> <span data-start="562.04" data-end="571.61">is mood Cue basically a node.js software that we build inside the module, we have several</span> <span data-start="571.61" data-end="577.87">modules that we bring here, then we made another demo using mobile control, so basically iPhone,</span> <span data-start="577.87" data-end="580.69">and everything has been done using JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="580.69" data-end="582.95">So let's show the first one.</span> <span data-start="582.95" data-end="588.49">The first one uses one of our module, everything is Open Source, open hardware, we build open</span> <span data-start="588.49" data-end="595.43">module, someone else could make it and we put some little switch that allow us to control</span> <span data-start="595.43" data-end="597.41">the motor.</span> <span data-start="597.41" data-end="605.81">The code that you need to write on the node.js side is the one that you see here, we import</span> <span data-start="605.81" data-end="616.399">our library, from node.js, we connect to analog port zero and then we basically use a call</span> <span data-start="616.399" data-end="620.13">back to set the digital 9 to the very mode.</span> <span data-start="620.13" data-end="628.31">What happened is when we turn the switch on and off, we're able to move the RO that show</span> <span data-start="628.31" data-end="632.56">us our mode.</span> <span data-start="632.56" data-end="640.529">I'm using a small demo here, I'm using Ideno, I write my code directly on my computer.</span> <span data-start="640.529" data-end="651.57">When is done, I start run, and transfer the control over my little CPU, as you can see,</span> <span data-start="651.57" data-end="661.11">there is an initiallization procedure, and then I move the RO directly with the switch.</span> <span data-start="661.11" data-end="668.17">And is done directly on the board, so I don't need to use any library, any bridge.</span> <span data-start="668.17" data-end="674.19">Everything is done inside the JavaScript environment as I showed you before.</span> <span data-start="674.19" data-end="681.209">We build another application, a little more complex that I will be happy to show you in</span> <span data-start="681.209" data-end="687.029">the back stage, if you want, that basically control an LED, a very easy one, something</span> <span data-start="687.029" data-end="690.37">we call the hello world for the MCment.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="690.37" data-end="702.04">So, in that case, we made a small application on HTML 5 using our library, again, an Open</span> <span data-start="702.04" data-end="709.3">Source library that you can use on the mobile control, so, in JavaScript and jQuery, what</span> <span data-start="709.3" data-end="719.8">we build inside the small devise in the lines of code, we import the Lin eo board, the HTML</span> <span data-start="719.8" data-end="730.44">board and import the GTO\h‑‑ we are using tool in this case, we're using Intel X D K</span> <span data-start="730.44" data-end="738.17">tool to be able to control over the phone my device, and the code that I have to write</span> <span data-start="738.17" data-end="741.899">on these tools is basically what you can see here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="741.899" data-end="748.199">So, some initiallization code, and then event when I press the button on my mobile.</span> <span data-start="748.199" data-end="753.78">And this is the demo.</span> <span data-start="753.78" data-end="756.69">Again, I'm using any.</span> <span data-start="756.69" data-end="765.92">deno, inside the board, press the code, press run, transfer the control, now to my mobile</span> <span data-start="765.92" data-end="770.8">application that will be able to control my device.</span> <span data-start="770.8" data-end="778.66">The one that we're using right now is Lineo, but we can use Lineo 1, but use any other</span> <span data-start="778.66" data-end="779.66">module.</span> <span data-start="779.66" data-end="786.66">It's Open Source, so we can put this code to any other Linux platform or TP link router</span> <span data-start="786.66" data-end="788.769">whatever.</span> <span data-start="788.769" data-end="793.699">The software that you're viewing now is an Intel X D K that allowstous have an application</span> <span data-start="793.699" data-end="799.67">from an iPhone in an easy way, we don't need to apply to put our application in the apple</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="799.67" data-end="807.02">App store, that's why we use this, it's an Intel XDK, it was a company that was recently</span> <span data-start="807.02" data-end="810.2">acquired by Intel.</span> <span data-start="810.2" data-end="811.39">Very easy stuff.</span> <span data-start="811.39" data-end="817.2">Now, this is very, very simple application, you can say, hey, we saw that, many, many</span> <span data-start="817.2" data-end="818.2">times.</span> <span data-start="818.2" data-end="821.899">The difference is, I don't need to take care of the micro controller, the only thing I</span> <span data-start="821.899" data-end="827.24">need do is write the JavaScript application that will play with the Java file system.</span> <span data-start="827.24" data-end="834.37">You can see it on the desk, but it can be run remotely.</span> <span data-start="834.37" data-end="839.47">The last part of our software structure is the Cloud, and that is something that we're</span> <span data-start="839.47" data-end="844.13">going to announce in the next week in New York.</span> <span data-start="844.13" data-end="848.899">And basically we're building a system provisioning platform that allows us to have control over</span> <span data-start="848.899" data-end="849.899">the Cloud.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="849.899" data-end="856.97">Everything is Open Source, so you can eventually build your own Cloud to control your hardware.</span> <span data-start="856.97" data-end="864.19">The provisioning platform, we are working to build a special MPN library just for Lineo</span> <span data-start="864.19" data-end="871.13">(NPM) we're using Mips technology now, sometime we need to recompile the library, in our small</span> <span data-start="871.13" data-end="877.08">module we don't have the power enough to do that so we're doing it directly in our serverrers,</span> <span data-start="877.08" data-end="883.779">we oar working to have an e quo system to take all the modules and connect it together,</span> <span data-start="883.779" data-end="893.209">and of course, we're bringing this technology, also to other devices, Raspberry Pive, BeagleBone,</span> <span data-start="893.209" data-end="900.16">or call come,\h‑‑ it is one I don't know if you're familiar with this (Qualcomm) it</span> <span data-start="900.16" data-end="904.67">was a very short introduction, I hope you enjoyed.</span> <span data-start="904.67" data-end="910.06">I hope if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to show you in more details</span> <span data-start="910.06" data-end="915.69">what we've done, and I just want to say thank you for your time and your patients today.</span> </p>
