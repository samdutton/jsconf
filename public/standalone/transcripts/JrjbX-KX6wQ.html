<p><span data-start="96.49" data-end="99.78">That's kind of illegal — it tends to be.</span> <span data-start="99.78" data-end="105.679">So they say, okay, try to understand the brain, by using a proxy, which is language.</span> <span data-start="105.679" data-end="115.21">And they found out that metaphor isn't just a matter of poetry, like rhetoric al flourish.</span> <span data-start="115.21" data-end="125.399">Metaphors dictate how we think, behave, how we perceive, and how our conceptual system</span> <span data-start="125.399" data-end="128.05">is built.</span> <span data-start="128.05" data-end="134.37">To give you an example, the first from their book, they say argument is war.</span> <span data-start="134.37" data-end="137.97">War is a metaphor in which we frame argument.</span> <span data-start="137.97" data-end="141.58">I think this is kind of in line with the previous talk.</span> <span data-start="141.58" data-end="145.26">Why people have these flame wars on the internet?</span> <span data-start="145.26" data-end="152.58">If we think of argument as war, we will say things like, "Your claims are indefensible."</span> <span data-start="152.58" data-end="157.37">"He attacked every weak point in my argument.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="157.37" data-end="160.11">I demolished his argument.</span> <span data-start="160.11" data-end="163.28">I never won an argument with him.</span> <span data-start="163.28" data-end="166.42">His criticisms were right on target."</span> <span data-start="166.42" data-end="173.63">The point being, because of this framing of as a war, we literally tried to destroy the</span> <span data-start="173.63" data-end="175.26">other person.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="175.26" data-end="180.962">And they ask in this book, asked like what if argument will be dance which is a kind</span> <span data-start="180.962" data-end="188.09">of metaphor using, and then thinking about arguments, because we need to collaborate</span> <span data-start="188.09" data-end="192.74">together to reach a common goal, and then maybe a metaphor would be you should not be</span> <span data-start="192.74" data-end="195.69">stepping on my toes or something like that.</span> <span data-start="195.69" data-end="198.69">It will be a more collaborative thing.</span> <span data-start="198.69" data-end="201.86">But I can see your favourites that you're not convinced.</span> <span data-start="201.86" data-end="206.68">When people are not convinced, we talk about politics, right?</span> <span data-start="206.68" data-end="214.11">There was a really nice article from the BBC called How metaphors Shape Women's Lives,</span> <span data-start="214.11" data-end="222.21">but but it talked about all this glass-ceiling metaphor, what not, how you're stopped from</span> <span data-start="222.21" data-end="227.01">progressing at companies, but for me, even more interesting in that article, was this</span> <span data-start="227.01" data-end="234.48">research done where they grabbed a group of student, and they tell them there is a wild</span> <span data-start="234.48" data-end="237.26">beast preying on the city.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="237.26" data-end="240.26">Crime is a wild beet preying on the city.</span> <span data-start="240.26" data-end="244.7">The other they say that a virus is infecting the city.</span> <span data-start="244.7" data-end="248.21">Both groups get the same data, statistics and so on.</span> <span data-start="248.21" data-end="251.01">They have a different framing metaphor.</span> <span data-start="251.01" data-end="262.23">When people are asked what are the solutions they propose, 75 per cent of the beast students,</span> <span data-start="262.23" data-end="266.56">they wanted to put people in jail and do strong punishments.</span> <span data-start="266.56" data-end="273.1">The people in the virus case wanted to help the other and help them, improve, progress,</span> <span data-start="273.1" data-end="274.1">and so on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="274.1" data-end="277.96">When they asked them why did you choose that kind of punishment, or why do you want to</span> <span data-start="277.96" data-end="280.91">kill people, get better, and so on?</span> <span data-start="280.91" data-end="283.87">They say, "Because the data says so."</span> <span data-start="283.87" data-end="288.36">None of them realised they were primed with a particular metaphor.</span> <span data-start="288.36" data-end="298.24">There is also a book from the 1980s called Feminism Confronts Technology, and it's really</span> <span data-start="298.24" data-end="304.43">good if you want to have a deep dive into feminist point of view into technology.</span> <span data-start="304.43" data-end="310.84">And it is like how the words "hard" and "soft "have been changing across the history of</span> <span data-start="310.84" data-end="312.78">technology.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="312.78" data-end="319">At some point, intellectual work was not considered interesting, whatever, and the machos out</span> <span data-start="319" data-end="326.96">there deemed the work soft, and suddenly, we have computers, so all this macho mentality</span> <span data-start="326.96" data-end="334.81">brought the "hard" word into programming with these aggressive metaphors, like you need</span> <span data-start="334.81" data-end="344.83">to be coding 24/7, pushing for that release, about your stamina, and so on.</span> <span data-start="344.83" data-end="356.09">She said no matter how masculinity is defined, it always construes women as ill-suited to</span> <span data-start="356.09" data-end="357.87">technological pursuits.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="357.87" data-end="366.61">Language is also important, even if how we approach different groups if you want to make,</span> <span data-start="366.61" data-end="371.04">for example, technology frame there for women, friendly for women or other groups like in</span> <span data-start="371.04" data-end="374.44">Latin America, for example.</span> <span data-start="374.44" data-end="377.26">Still not convinced?</span> <span data-start="377.26" data-end="380.29">Human resource management.</span> <span data-start="380.29" data-end="385.22">If you think with this metaphor, you will think that the same way that you replace a</span> <span data-start="385.22" data-end="391.12">hard drive on a server, you replace a programmer on your team, and there are many managers</span> <span data-start="391.12" data-end="398.12">that think this way, but we need to understand that people are not resources, like we are</span> <span data-start="398.12" data-end="404.37">not here .. [Cheering].</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="404.37" data-end="410.46">We bring more to the world that can be replaced.</span> <span data-start="410.46" data-end="416.7">We build interpersonal relationships, organise things to happen in certain times, and so</span> <span data-start="416.7" data-end="417.7">on.</span> <span data-start="417.7" data-end="424.32">We are very rich living beings.</span> <span data-start="424.32" data-end="430.34">Finally, giving platform to racist people.</span> <span data-start="430.34" data-end="435.919">There is a conference in the United States, I won't name them, that they like to have</span> <span data-start="435.919" data-end="438.9">keynoters, like racist people.</span> <span data-start="438.9" data-end="444.1">Last year, the keynoter, was one that considered women to be inferior, and so on.</span> <span data-start="444.1" data-end="450.199">When the community came against this conference, and they criticised them for having a racist</span> <span data-start="450.199" data-end="459.68">person as a keynoter, they wrote a blog post, and it was called "wrestling with inclusion"</span> <span data-start="459.68" data-end="464.9">at whatever the name of that conf.</span> <span data-start="464.9" data-end="467.26">I wonder "wrestling".</span> <span data-start="467.26" data-end="470.09">Why do you need to wrestle with inclusion?</span> <span data-start="470.09" data-end="476.32">Why can't you have a dialogue or talk with people involved in these communities?</span> <span data-start="476.32" data-end="483.94">No, they decided to wrestle very, "I'm going to beat you down", right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="483.94" data-end="489.47">I guess you're here to talk about computers, right?</span> <span data-start="489.47" data-end="496.302">So computers: have you seen the movie "hidden figures" where this astronaut from the States,</span> <span data-start="496.302" data-end="503.76">this the black women helped put a man, an American in space, the Russians had done that</span> <span data-start="503.76" data-end="508.51">already?</span> <span data-start="508.51" data-end="509.79">They were doing calculation.</span> <span data-start="509.79" data-end="513.37">They were doing computing by hand.</span> <span data-start="513.37" data-end="517.62">So these women were called computers.</span> <span data-start="517.62" data-end="526.029">But at some point, we had this very fast electronic machine that was doing what they were doing</span> <span data-start="526.029" data-end="532.66">really fast, so how do we call those things that do what these people are already doing,</span> <span data-start="532.66" data-end="533.66">okay?</span> <span data-start="533.66" data-end="534.66">Automatic computers.</span> <span data-start="534.66" data-end="540.22">The automatic word was dropped, and now we just call them computers.</span> <span data-start="540.22" data-end="541.22">Why is this?</span> <span data-start="541.22" data-end="544.62">Because metaphors, they enable understanding.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="544.62" data-end="550.86">When we don't know how to talk about something, we probably will use some sort of a metaphor.</span> <span data-start="550.86" data-end="559.72">I don't remember yesterday if you give me a second, I was watching a talk here about</span> <span data-start="559.72" data-end="573.749">simulation for blind people, he said additional screen real estate that you account for.</span> <span data-start="573.749" data-end="578.129">Now there is real estate that we account for.</span> <span data-start="578.129" data-end="583.85">This is a metaphorical way of understanding what is going on that is just the screen is</span> <span data-start="583.85" data-end="587.69">bigger and we need to do something with that bigger screen.</span> <span data-start="587.69" data-end="595.66">But when I say the metaphor to enable understanding, the typical metaphor is from Shakespeare,</span> <span data-start="595.66" data-end="599.49">that says Juliet is like the sun.</span> <span data-start="599.49" data-end="604.97">And we need to understand that metaphors aren't a one-to-one mapping between source domain</span> <span data-start="604.97" data-end="607.149">and target domain.</span> <span data-start="607.149" data-end="613.91">Metaphors just illuminate some areas so we understand what is meant but Juliet means</span> <span data-start="613.91" data-end="617.95">for Romeo in this case, his life depends on her.</span> <span data-start="617.95" data-end="622.259">He resolves around her all day, he thought, whatever.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="622.259" data-end="624.29">She is the light of his life.</span> <span data-start="624.29" data-end="631.639">We don't think Juliet gave him skin cancer because we are smart enough to understand</span> <span data-start="631.639" data-end="637.91">that metaphors are not a one-to-one mapping, like Juliet is not an atomic bomb walking</span> <span data-start="637.91" data-end="640.3">around Italy, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="640.3" data-end="651.24">There is a book by a guy I think from either the Netherlands or Belgium, called the Geometry</span> <span data-start="651.24" data-end="654.809">of Meaning, semantics based on conceptual spaces.</span> <span data-start="654.809" data-end="663.639">Long story short: somebody got paid in Europe for doing geometry research of language.</span> <span data-start="663.639" data-end="665.56">These things in South America don't happen.</span> <span data-start="665.56" data-end="671.94">We try to make sure that our cows make better meat, basically!</span> <span data-start="671.94" data-end="676.889">In that book, it is really interesting because he said that metaphorical mappings preserve</span> <span data-start="676.889" data-end="682.42">the cognitive topology of the source domain in a way that is consistent with inherent</span> <span data-start="682.42" data-end="689.929">structure of the target domain, so, source, sun, target, Juliet.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="689.929" data-end="696">Metaphor transfers information from one conceptual domain to another, and what is transferred</span> <span data-start="696" data-end="699.45">is a pattern rather than domain-specific information.</span> <span data-start="699.45" data-end="705.689">Juliet is not giving you cancer, and a metaphor can thus be used to identify structure in</span> <span data-start="705.689" data-end="709.529">a domain that will not have been discovered otherwise.</span> <span data-start="709.529" data-end="715.139">So that is the power that metaphor brings us when we need to understand how the world</span> <span data-start="715.139" data-end="716.3">actually works.</span> <span data-start="716.3" data-end="723.8">And, for me, I stole this animation from that link town there, this is what we are doing</span> <span data-start="723.8" data-end="725.709">in a way with our brain, with metaphors.</span> <span data-start="725.709" data-end="731.94">We're doing like a problem that we solve constantly when we're able to apply a method in a context</span> <span data-start="731.94" data-end="734.259">that has nothing to do with it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="734.259" data-end="740.72">This is how metaphors create new knowledge.</span> <span data-start="740.72" data-end="746.829">But the problem with metaphors is that they also obscure understanding.</span> <span data-start="746.829" data-end="754.699">Back in the 18th century when they tried to create the telegraph, the metaphor was the</span> <span data-start="754.699" data-end="757.199">"far writing" tele graph.</span> <span data-start="757.199" data-end="761.399">Because of this metaphor, they were so tied to the metaphor, this they would create a</span> <span data-start="761.399" data-end="766.86">device that would write remotely instead of [unclear] having something like Morse code</span> <span data-start="766.86" data-end="776.279">or whatever, because Morse code was not a thing, thanks to — they started encoding</span> <span data-start="776.279" data-end="783.269">on language, our language, in a different code that is not the one that we use for speaking,</span> <span data-start="783.269" data-end="789.319">humanity realised like okay, we can trust that we talk in a different way before Morse</span> <span data-start="789.319" data-end="797.37">code, before telegraph, we hadn't realised as a species or society that we could do these</span> <span data-start="797.37" data-end="800.16">things with language.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="800.16" data-end="811.17">In this book The Shadows said sometimes our tools do what we tell them to, but otherwise,</span> <span data-start="811.17" data-end="815.259">we adapt ourselves to our tool's requirements.</span> <span data-start="815.259" data-end="816.749">We need to be careful with this.</span> <span data-start="816.749" data-end="823.11">We're today adapted to having a phone and Twitter every day, let's say.</span> <span data-start="823.11" data-end="826.98">Or back in the day when people invented this in Switzerland.</span> <span data-start="826.98" data-end="831.41">I'm sure it wasn't invented in Switzerland but I live there so I need to say these kinds</span> <span data-start="831.41" data-end="833.279">of things!</span> <span data-start="833.279" data-end="839.589">Before people didn't live by the second or the minute, whenever the church bell rang</span> <span data-start="839.589" data-end="844.879">before the going to mass, or whatever this be , they knew they had to gather at the town</span> <span data-start="844.879" data-end="851.43">square, or something like that, but it wasn't like they were clocking every single thing.</span> <span data-start="851.43" data-end="857.089">This is also, for example, I learned in London, like this is why they know the exact locations</span> <span data-start="857.089" data-end="861.18">when Jack the Ripper was doing things because there are so many churches in London, that</span> <span data-start="861.18" data-end="865.929">they were hearing the bells, so after this many bells, Jack the Ripper did something</span> <span data-start="865.929" data-end="866.929">somewhere.</span> <span data-start="866.929" data-end="869.399">That was a way of tracking time back then.</span> </p>
