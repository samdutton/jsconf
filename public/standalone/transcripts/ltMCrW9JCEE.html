<p><span data-start="21.09" data-end="23.29">Hi everyone.</span> <span data-start="23.29" data-end="28.94">Today I'll tell you how to grow your own Babel Fish.</span> <span data-start="28.94" data-end="33.91">So it turns out that the metaphor is not really that original, especially if you've</span> <span data-start="33.91" data-end="41.57">seen Sam stock from IBM Watson, but I'll briefly describe</span> <span data-start="41.57" data-end="44">what the Babel Fish is.</span> <span data-start="44" data-end="48.1">Babel Fish is unfortunately a fictional animal from Hitchhiker's Guide</span> <span data-start="48.1" data-end="52.78">to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, and according to the author</span> <span data-start="52.78" data-end="56.39">it is a small yellow leech-like, and probably the</span> <span data-start="56.39" data-end="57.989">oddest thing in the universe.</span> <span data-start="57.989" data-end="66.38">It feeds on brainwave energy and long story short, it is a universal translator.</span> <span data-start="66.38" data-end="68.71">The main problem is you actually have to stick one</span> <span data-start="68.71" data-end="72.46">into your ear to make it work, but once you do it, you'll</span> <span data-start="72.46" data-end="76.42">understand anything that is said to you in any language.</span> <span data-start="76.42" data-end="78.72">If you haven't read the book, I really recommend</span> <span data-start="78.72" data-end="80.95">you do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="80.95" data-end="84.06">Okay, so moving on.</span> <span data-start="84.06" data-end="88.2">About two years ago I become interested in WebRTC.</span> <span data-start="88.2" data-end="93.84">Thomas will give a talk later today, so I'll describe it really briefly.</span> <span data-start="93.84" data-end="96.56">It is an API that allows you to create peer-to-peer connections</span> <span data-start="96.56" data-end="100.59">between devices, not necessarily just browsers, and you</span> <span data-start="100.59" data-end="103.1">can basically send anything you want through such</span> <span data-start="103.1" data-end="107.619">a connection: audio, video, or data.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="107.619" data-end="110.49">About a year ago I get a talk about interesting applications</span> <span data-start="110.49" data-end="114.02">of WebRTC which was basically showing what stuff you</span> <span data-start="114.02" data-end="118.819">can build with it, and I was looking for some applications</span> <span data-start="118.819" data-end="121.43">to show, and the thing is that for data, there</span> <span data-start="121.43" data-end="123.479">are lots of really interesting applications.</span> <span data-start="123.479" data-end="128.929">I mean, WebRTC doesn't  â€”  I mean the protocol is not based</span> <span data-start="128.929" data-end="133.91">on TCP, but rather UDP, so we can do very low working,</span> <span data-start="133.91" data-end="136.24">you can do file sharing because you have a direct connection</span> <span data-start="136.24" data-end="140.739">between two devices, you don't have to send a file like</span> <span data-start="140.739" data-end="142.57">for example in Dropbox.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="142.57" data-end="146.99">Maybe some of you have even heard my application called shadrock(?) which</span> <span data-start="146.99" data-end="151.629">is like airdrop, which ironically doesn't work on</span> <span data-start="151.629" data-end="157.81">safari, but you can actually do crazy stuff with the data</span> <span data-start="157.81" data-end="161.599">translator, like implement protocol in JavaScript, which</span> <span data-start="161.599" data-end="167.469">works in browser, and that's exactly what WebRTC does.</span> <span data-start="167.469" data-end="171.09">But in the case of audio and video, things are boring.</span> <span data-start="171.09" data-end="176.299">We have Skype for actually quite some time, and, you</span> <span data-start="176.299" data-end="179.989">know, WebRTC does exactly the same but it is not really</span> <span data-start="179.989" data-end="182.75">that interesting, right, so I didn't have anything to</span> <span data-start="182.75" data-end="186.049">show and I decided to write my own application with a</span> <span data-start="186.049" data-end="189.95">small technical twist, and that's what I'd like to show</span> <span data-start="189.95" data-end="190.95">you today.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="190.95" data-end="191.95">Okay.</span> <span data-start="191.95" data-end="192.95">So it is time for the demo.</span> <span data-start="192.95" data-end="202.439">So just sit back, relax and enjoy.</span> <span data-start="202.439" data-end="248.54">demo played) Okay, so</span> <span data-start="248.54" data-end="275.2">that's it.</span> <span data-start="275.2" data-end="301.87">[applause].</span> <span data-start="301.87" data-end="303.25">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="303.25" data-end="307.83">So as you can see it is basically a universal translator as well, just like Babel</span> <span data-start="307.83" data-end="309.199">Fish.</span> <span data-start="309.199" data-end="311.43">The thing is that on the left-hand side of your</span> <span data-start="311.43" data-end="315.83">video, yeah, left, you can select the language you're speaking.</span> <span data-start="315.83" data-end="318.3">On the right-hand side you can see what the language</span> <span data-start="318.3" data-end="320.75">the other person speaks, in and there is one picture</span> <span data-start="320.75" data-end="323.099">that I haven't really shown, is that if the speech</span> <span data-start="323.099" data-end="325.65">recognition is completely messed up you can type the message</span> <span data-start="325.65" data-end="328.09">here and it will also be translated and sent to</span> <span data-start="328.09" data-end="330.66">the other person.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="330.66" data-end="333.699">So it looks like kind of cool, right, but it is</span> <span data-start="333.699" data-end="334.699">actually nothing new.</span> <span data-start="334.699" data-end="339.91">This is a screenshot from a Skype translator by Microsoft.</span> <span data-start="339.91" data-end="344.57">It was released in December last year and it does exact the same thing.</span> <span data-start="344.57" data-end="347.781">It does it even better because in my application you</span> <span data-start="347.781" data-end="350.44">have to press the button to turn the speech recognition</span> <span data-start="350.44" data-end="352.29">on.</span> <span data-start="352.29" data-end="355.36">I later describe why it is necessary.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="355.36" data-end="358.02">In this application you can just speak all the time,</span> <span data-start="358.02" data-end="363.509">and it will all the time recognise what you're saying.</span> <span data-start="363.509" data-end="366.32">There are some advantages over Skype.</span> <span data-start="366.32" data-end="370.099">The most obvious one is that it works in the browser.</span> <span data-start="370.099" data-end="373.05">The Skype application is obviously an application that</span> <span data-start="373.05" data-end="376.27">works only on windows.</span> <span data-start="376.27" data-end="383.44">It uses open standards for WebRTC, Skype is some proprietary protocols, but to be fair,</span> <span data-start="383.44" data-end="385.5">Microsoft is currently working on a version of Skype that</span> <span data-start="385.5" data-end="388.479">will work in the browser it will use in the next version</span> <span data-start="388.479" data-end="392.099">of WebRTC, I'm not sure about Skype translator,</span> <span data-start="392.099" data-end="395.22">but at least a normal version of Skype should work</span> <span data-start="395.22" data-end="397.27">in the browser.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="397.27" data-end="399.59">But the most important thing I want to say is</span> <span data-start="399.59" data-end="404.18">that really, the first working version of it took one</span> <span data-start="404.18" data-end="405.919">day to write.</span> <span data-start="405.919" data-end="412.83">And it really shows how powerful today's browsers are and how powerful the APIs are.</span> <span data-start="412.83" data-end="416.169">And it is really not that hard to write something like</span> <span data-start="416.169" data-end="417.169">that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="417.169" data-end="421.91">So hopefully you're all wondering how it works.</span> <span data-start="421.91" data-end="424.55">So I'll go over it step by step, warning there will be</span> <span data-start="424.55" data-end="428.34">some code ahead, but not much fortunately so the first</span> <span data-start="428.34" data-end="431.1">thing is obviously send audio and video, and it is</span> <span data-start="431.1" data-end="436.419">done via WebRTC, so it is unfortunately not the simplest</span> <span data-start="436.419" data-end="439.65">and easiest API, so I am using a library to make</span> <span data-start="439.65" data-end="441.25">it easier.</span> <span data-start="441.25" data-end="445.37">The library at the time is called simple WebRTC, and</span> <span data-start="445.37" data-end="448.169">using it looks like this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="448.169" data-end="452.61">So that's like less than ten lines of code and that's all you actually</span> <span data-start="452.61" data-end="457.56">need to make your own Skype, or very basic version of Skype</span> <span data-start="457.56" data-end="459.45">application.</span> <span data-start="459.45" data-end="461.099">So I'll go it quickly.</span> <span data-start="461.099" data-end="466.9">First, you need to instantiate it, then you just pass IDs of</span> <span data-start="466.9" data-end="471.12">DOM elements where you want to display your video, and</span> <span data-start="471.12" data-end="474.659">video for other people.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="474.659" data-end="479.319">You wait for ready to call event, which is when your browser gets access to your camera</span> <span data-start="479.319" data-end="484.25">and microphone, and then you have to call to join</span> <span data-start="484.25" data-end="485.99">the room, which will connect you to all the other peers</span> <span data-start="485.99" data-end="486.99">in the same room.</span> <span data-start="486.99" data-end="489.3">That's actually the most complicated part if</span> <span data-start="489.3" data-end="494.24">you'll use WebRTC directly, and that's just one call in</span> <span data-start="494.24" data-end="496.569">simple WebRTC library.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="496.569" data-end="497.96">Yeah, that's it.</span> <span data-start="497.96" data-end="500.759">We're actually down to the audio and video part.</span> <span data-start="500.759" data-end="506.5">So, moving on to a bit more interesting part, that is speech recognition.</span> <span data-start="506.5" data-end="511.439">It is done using web speech recognition API, and using it looks</span> <span data-start="511.439" data-end="513.469">very similar to the code that we've just seen.</span> <span data-start="513.469" data-end="517.27">Again, you have to instantiate an object, you wait for a result</span> <span data-start="517.27" data-end="520.55">event which will be triggered whenever the speech recognition</span> <span data-start="520.55" data-end="524.44">actually has some results, and finally you go to the</span> <span data-start="524.44" data-end="528.5">start that will ask for your microphone and start speech</span> <span data-start="528.5" data-end="530.53">recognition.</span> <span data-start="530.53" data-end="537.09">Okay, so the next step is that speech recognition gives us a transcript of what</span> <span data-start="537.09" data-end="540.2">you just said, so we need to send it to Google Translate</span> <span data-start="540.2" data-end="541.2">to actually translate it.</span> <span data-start="541.2" data-end="543.78">It is just done using plain code.</span> <span data-start="543.78" data-end="548.21">So no closed here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="548.21" data-end="551.89">Once you have the original transcript and it is translation, you can send it to the</span> <span data-start="551.89" data-end="553.2">other person.</span> <span data-start="553.2" data-end="555.251">And the cool thing is that there is WebRTC data transfer</span> <span data-start="555.251" data-end="560.08">for that, so you don't need any servers, so normally</span> <span data-start="560.08" data-end="563.04">you'd send it using Ajax or web sockets or something</span> <span data-start="563.04" data-end="566.22">like that, but in the case of WebRTC you have direct</span> <span data-start="566.22" data-end="567.94">connection with the other person.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="567.94" data-end="571.53">We don't need any server for that.</span> <span data-start="571.53" data-end="576.13">So, using the data channels, this is really easy.</span> <span data-start="576.13" data-end="581.08">You have just one to send directly to all, you specific the channel name, payload name</span> <span data-start="581.08" data-end="583.41">which is basically what you're sending, and the data</span> <span data-start="583.41" data-end="584.41">itself.</span> <span data-start="584.41" data-end="589.02">Yeah, that's it.</span> <span data-start="589.02" data-end="594.51">So the last step is, so we already have the original end translator transcript</span> <span data-start="594.51" data-end="597.62">on the other side, and now it is time to read it out loud</span> <span data-start="597.62" data-end="601.26">and we use again API for that.</span> <span data-start="601.26" data-end="605.32">It is called synth API, it looks like that.</span> <span data-start="605.32" data-end="612.6">You have this really strange object, I just have to instantiate, the language, the message</span> <span data-start="612.6" data-end="618.58">itself, and then you have this, and then you have</span> <span data-start="618.58" data-end="622.58">this speak method where you have to just pass this object</span> <span data-start="622.58" data-end="628.59">to, and that's actually, as you can see, hopefully</span> <span data-start="628.59" data-end="633.37">the individual steps of it are really simple,</span> <span data-start="633.37" data-end="634.951">in the real application there is a bit more code, for</span> <span data-start="634.951" data-end="637.9">example, for call handling for handling language switches</span> <span data-start="637.9" data-end="642.08">and so on, but yeah, that's actually the core of it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="642.08" data-end="644.85">There is not really that much code in the application.</span> <span data-start="644.85" data-end="648.33">If anyone is interested in the actual code, I'll give the</span> <span data-start="648.33" data-end="654.011">link to the code at the end of the talk.</span> <span data-start="654.011" data-end="658.48">The second part, I'd like to give you a very brief introduction into</span> <span data-start="658.48" data-end="663.19">web speech API, I just actually wanted to mention two</span> <span data-start="663.19" data-end="664.78">things.</span> <span data-start="664.78" data-end="667.17">So the first thing is that web speech API recognition</span> <span data-start="667.17" data-end="669.17">has two modes, the first one is one shot, and</span> <span data-start="669.17" data-end="671.64">the second one is continuous.</span> <span data-start="671.64" data-end="675.07">In the one shot mode, in the speech recognition, the algorhythmic will stop when</span> <span data-start="675.07" data-end="681.8">you want, which is great for giving commands and that's</span> <span data-start="681.8" data-end="684.64">the mode used in my application.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="684.64" data-end="689.42">The other mode, which is more interesting, is the continuous mode and basically</span> <span data-start="689.42" data-end="691.43">it will even if you make a pause, it will just</span> <span data-start="691.43" data-end="694.24">continue to work, at least in theory.</span> <span data-start="694.24" data-end="698.45">So this one is great for dictating stuff, or for my application, with</span> <span data-start="698.45" data-end="702.57">me at least, where users  â€”  two users have a conversation.</span> <span data-start="702.57" data-end="706.38">Unfortunately it doesn't really work that well.</span> <span data-start="706.38" data-end="709.88">And I'll tell why really soon.</span> <span data-start="709.88" data-end="714.69">The second thing is that according to the spec, the API itself is like</span> <span data-start="714.69" data-end="719.42">agnostic of the underlying speech recognition implementation,</span> <span data-start="719.42" data-end="721.69">so it basically doesn't implement  â€”  it doesn't</span> <span data-start="721.69" data-end="724.66">specify how the speech recognition should work.</span> <span data-start="724.66" data-end="728.49">And you can have speech recognition on server, or on the client.</span> <span data-start="728.49" data-end="731.67">So in Chrome, it uses Google services, so it is</span> <span data-start="731.67" data-end="737.18">on the server, but it could be done locally.</span> <span data-start="737.18" data-end="743">So while the speech API is really awesome, it has some issues.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="743" data-end="748.42">So if you'd like to experiment with it, I'll just, you know,</span> <span data-start="748.42" data-end="751.19">briefly describe what the issues are, so at least</span> <span data-start="751.19" data-end="754.54">you know what to expect.</span> <span data-start="754.54" data-end="758.67">So the first issue is that the speech recognition will stop if you talk for too</span> <span data-start="758.67" data-end="761.7">long, I'm not sure what the exact limit is, but if you talk</span> <span data-start="761.7" data-end="766.97">for a minute or over a minute, it will stop.</span> <span data-start="766.97" data-end="771.79">You'll get abort event, and yeah, that's actually  â€”  the second</span> <span data-start="771.79" data-end="775.26">issue is actually quite the opposite.</span> <span data-start="775.26" data-end="778.3">It will stop if you don't talk for as long.</span> <span data-start="778.3" data-end="783">I'm talking about the continuous mode which should handle pauses, but if you will</span> <span data-start="783" data-end="785.92">make long enough pause, it will just stop.</span> <span data-start="785.92" data-end="788.77">Again, you'll get abort event, and there is a work around these</span> <span data-start="788.77" data-end="789.77">issues.</span> <span data-start="789.77" data-end="792.04">I mean, you can wait for the abort event and</span> <span data-start="792.04" data-end="796.41">just call start again, but unfortunately, in some cases,</span> <span data-start="796.41" data-end="799.38">after you call start, it will abort again and it will</span> <span data-start="799.38" data-end="803.87">end up with this, which makes the application unstable</span> <span data-start="803.87" data-end="806.55">and actually that's the reason why my application doesn't</span> <span data-start="806.55" data-end="810.59">use the continuous mode.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="810.59" data-end="812.96">So the most important issue, I think, is that web</span> <span data-start="812.96" data-end="815.74">speech API doesn't work with WebRTC media streams, so</span> <span data-start="815.74" data-end="820.05">the thing is the specification was created probably</span> <span data-start="820.05" data-end="823.37">before WebRTC application, so that's why it doesn't</span> <span data-start="823.37" data-end="826.97">mention anything about media streams, and it means that</span> <span data-start="826.97" data-end="830.52">the web speech API can only recognise input from your</span> <span data-start="830.52" data-end="834.48">own mic, nothing else, really, and that causes a lot of</span> <span data-start="834.48" data-end="835.48">issues.</span> <span data-start="835.48" data-end="837.5">So the first thing is that, for example, in my</span> <span data-start="837.5" data-end="840.8">application, which is WebRTC, and web speech recognition</span> <span data-start="840.8" data-end="843.69">API, it will ask you twice for your mic, which is really</span> <span data-start="843.69" data-end="845.08">confusing for users.</span> <span data-start="845.08" data-end="849.92">So once it will ask for WebRTC, the second time with the web speech RPI, but</span> <span data-start="849.92" data-end="852.99">the most important thing is, like I said, it can only</span> <span data-start="852.99" data-end="854.79">recognise what you're saying.</span> <span data-start="854.79" data-end="861.59">You can't get remote audio stream from another person and just pass it into</span> <span data-start="861.59" data-end="864.71">web speech recognition object, right.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="864.71" data-end="869.99">So if you could do it, you could basically just write an extension or</span> <span data-start="869.99" data-end="874.17">plug into any web application and perform the whole recognition</span> <span data-start="874.17" data-end="877.68">of whatever any other person has said on your</span> <span data-start="877.68" data-end="879.58">computer, which would be really cool.</span> <span data-start="879.58" data-end="882.54">Another thing is I'm not sure if you're aware, but using WebRTC you</span> <span data-start="882.54" data-end="885.11">can actually make phone calls or make or receive phone</span> <span data-start="885.11" data-end="886.23">calls.</span> <span data-start="886.23" data-end="891.72">You have to use gateway service, but it is possible,</span> <span data-start="891.72" data-end="894.69">and if you could pass like remote audio to speech</span> <span data-start="894.69" data-end="898.05">recognition, you could actually, for example, make an application</span> <span data-start="898.05" data-end="901.41">where you just call somebody, take audio from them and</span> <span data-start="901.41" data-end="903.83">just pass it for speech recognition locally.</span> <span data-start="903.83" data-end="907.28">So it will be pretty good for, for example, people with</span> <span data-start="907.28" data-end="909.39">hearing loss, which could basically create a transcript</span> <span data-start="909.39" data-end="912.03">on the phone call on the fly.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="912.03" data-end="917.74">So yeah, unfortunately it doesn't work, but like I said, this web speech</span> <span data-start="917.74" data-end="919.69">spec doesn't really mention anything about it,</span> <span data-start="919.69" data-end="924">but actually it would be really easy to extend the specification</span> <span data-start="924" data-end="925.89">without breaking it down.</span> <span data-start="925.89" data-end="927.69">That's it.</span> <span data-start="927.69" data-end="932.81">You just have to pass audio stream to this speech recognition</span> <span data-start="932.81" data-end="936.07">object and it could just work.</span> <span data-start="936.07" data-end="938.45">So that's actually what Firefox is doing right now.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="938.45" data-end="944.18">They're extending, it has been at least, extending this API a bit without breaking</span> <span data-start="944.18" data-end="949.7">it actually, I just was told that it should work</span> <span data-start="949.7" data-end="954.68">in Firefox 2.5, so hopefully it will sync soon.</span> <span data-start="954.68" data-end="957.4">And like the most obvious reason why this API is not really</span> <span data-start="957.4" data-end="959.93">more popular, it works only in Chrome.</span> <span data-start="959.93" data-end="965.87">And the issue is that it is not even like all chrome, desktop and mobile.</span> <span data-start="965.87" data-end="968.88">The issue is that for example there is a small bug in</span> <span data-start="968.88" data-end="971.36">mobile version of Chrome which doesn't allow you</span> <span data-start="971.36" data-end="975.57">to use speech recognition if you're WebRTC at the same time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="975.57" data-end="980.2">So unfortunately my app won't work on android.</span> <span data-start="980.2" data-end="983.15">But what can we do about these issues?</span> <span data-start="983.15" data-end="986.85">I mean, the first is we can ask them nicely to update</span> <span data-start="986.85" data-end="991.57">the spec, ask Google to fix the implementation, or we could</span> <span data-start="991.57" data-end="994.22">ask another browser mender to actually implement</span> <span data-start="994.22" data-end="995.73">the API.</span> <span data-start="995.73" data-end="998.31">And while the speech recognition itself is really</span> <span data-start="998.31" data-end="1001.57">complicated problem, the technology is not really an</span> <span data-start="1001.57" data-end="1004.14">issue here.</span> <span data-start="1004.14" data-end="1009.61">Personal assistance or virtual assistance is really popular lately, and it turns other</span> <span data-start="1009.61" data-end="1012.54">that every browser actually has some implementation of</span> <span data-start="1012.54" data-end="1013.6">it.</span> <span data-start="1013.6" data-end="1019.19">So Google obviously has Google Now, Apple has</span> <span data-start="1019.19" data-end="1024.2">Siri, Firefox actually doesn't have anything, but they are</span> <span data-start="1024.2" data-end="1028.94">using a library called Pocket Sphinx, which does speech</span> <span data-start="1028.94" data-end="1032.99">recognition locally on the device.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1032.99" data-end="1036.5">But there is also another way.</span> <span data-start="1036.5" data-end="1043.14">We don't really need to wait for a browser vendors, so you probably remember this one.</span> <span data-start="1043.14" data-end="1044.14">Right?</span> <span data-start="1044.14" data-end="1046.66">So all the time I'm talking about making implementation</span> <span data-start="1046.66" data-end="1050.61">of the API, but it is actually possible to create</span> <span data-start="1050.61" data-end="1053.59">a virtual library that will have exactly the same API</span> <span data-start="1053.59" data-end="1059.039">as web speech API and just would use some third-party</span> <span data-start="1059.039" data-end="1063.029">service to perform the speech recognition, or do it</span> <span data-start="1063.029" data-end="1064.029">locally.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1064.029" data-end="1065.809">So again, like I said, the speech recognition</span> <span data-start="1065.809" data-end="1069.59">is like really complex and hard problem, but again,</span> <span data-start="1069.59" data-end="1071.72">as it turns out, there are plenty of companies that are</span> <span data-start="1071.72" data-end="1074.36">actually happy to write.</span> <span data-start="1074.36" data-end="1080.769">So Facebook has recently announced Facebook M assistant, yet another  â€”  they</span> <span data-start="1080.769" data-end="1083.779">also obviously have technology for speech recognition.</span> <span data-start="1083.779" data-end="1087.629">There is another assistant called hound by SoundHound.</span> <span data-start="1087.629" data-end="1090.41">I'm not sure if you have heard about it but it looks</span> <span data-start="1090.41" data-end="1097.279">promising, BaiDu has announced one recently, there are</span> <span data-start="1097.279" data-end="1102.879">some other companies that do speech recognition, obviously,</span> <span data-start="1102.879" data-end="1107.01">and there is also we've just seen a demo, there</span> <span data-start="1107.01" data-end="1110.2">is IBM Watson which also has API performing speech</span> <span data-start="1110.2" data-end="1111.2">recognition.</span> <span data-start="1111.2" data-end="1115.629">Finally, there is an interesting project called Pocket</span> <span data-start="1115.629" data-end="1120.2">Sphinx JS which actually uses the library that is used</span> <span data-start="1120.2" data-end="1125.08">by Firefox and it compiles it using scripts into</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1125.08" data-end="1128.61">JavaScript and this actually provides the fully</span> <span data-start="1128.61" data-end="1132.659">functional speech recognition library in your browser</span> <span data-start="1132.659" data-end="1135.14">and actually in any browser that supports WebRTC.</span> <span data-start="1135.14" data-end="1141.759">It doesn't have to support speech recognition.</span> <span data-start="1141.759" data-end="1145.72">So that's actually it.</span> <span data-start="1145.72" data-end="1151.61">I kind of hope that you saw that, you know, the whole implementation wasn't</span> <span data-start="1151.61" data-end="1152.809">really that hard.</span> <span data-start="1152.809" data-end="1154.429">Each step was really easy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1154.429" data-end="1158.299">You can see we have today's browsers are really powerful</span> <span data-start="1158.299" data-end="1160.96">and I strongly encourage you to maybe instead of writing</span> <span data-start="1160.96" data-end="1165.75">yet another framework just try to experiment with them.</span> <span data-start="1165.75" data-end="1169.73">Also I kind of hope that once Firefox actually releases</span> <span data-start="1169.73" data-end="1173.49">a version that of their browser that has a web speech</span> <span data-start="1173.49" data-end="1182.45">implementation API, I mean web speech API implementation, it will just become more popular.</span> <span data-start="1182.45" data-end="1186.559">My name is size a Szymon and I work with these</span> <span data-start="1186.559" data-end="1187.559">companies.</span> <span data-start="1187.559" data-end="1188.559">That's all.</span> </p>
