<p><span data-start="272.23" data-end="277.56">With 3 billion people on the Internet today, that number will only grow.</span> <span data-start="277.56" data-end="281.53">They are using tools like Facebook, Instagram and WeChat welcome.</span> <span data-start="281.53" data-end="282.93">awesome.</span> <span data-start="282.93" data-end="288.78">We saw on a scale that the connection between people was once unimaginable.</span> <span data-start="288.78" data-end="292.86">But I think it's fair to say that most of these people will never go</span> <span data-start="292.86" data-end="296.819">Engage these tools beyond the boundaries of the network.</span> <span data-start="296.819" data-end="302.08">Post tweets, share life updates on Facebook, or show photos of Berlin Street</span> <span data-start="302.08" data-end="309.33">Cats on Instagram, but they will never make an HTML page, and never for their fan site</span> </p>

It's too complicated.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="346.389" data-end="350.74">I mean, think about it: if you know the web, you can spend months and months packing</span> <span data-start="350.74" data-end="356.539">Latest on how to write HTML pages, vertical center divs or navigation</span> <span data-start="356.539" data-end="358.449">JavaScript framework.</span> <span data-start="358.449" data-end="362.99">After all, you have your own support, you have some confidence, maybe it was built</span> <span data-start="362.99" data-end="364.46">You are proud of something.</span> <span data-start="364.46" data-end="367.849">You still need to figure out the server.</span> <span data-start="367.849" data-end="369.3">I just think the web can do better.</span> <span data-start="369.3" data-end="373.27">In fact, I think it's vital that the web do better.</span> <span data-start="373.27" data-end="376.22">Because barriers to entry remain-if barriers to entry remain high, I</span> <span data-start="376.22" data-end="381.33">Hate thinking about the web for ten or two decades.</span> <span data-start="381.33" data-end="386.43">Keep in mind that the web has been around since 1990, and we have seen early</span> <span data-start="386.43" data-end="392.819">What happens when most people use a few platforms is involved.</span> <span data-start="392.819" data-end="394.33">So how does this work for a long time?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="394.33" data-end="401.259">If 28 years from today, what it will look like, most people are still using tools like Facebook,</span> <span data-start="401.259" data-end="404.97">Or WeChat, or Instagram.</span> <span data-start="404.97" data-end="411.69">Is it still the web or does the provider shape it into something completely different?</span> <span data-start="411.69" data-end="416.93">I do n’t know, but it seems to make sense, but I do n’t think this is a risk we should be willing to take</span> <span data-start="416.93" data-end="418.69">take.</span> <span data-start="418.69" data-end="419.99">The network is too precious.</span> <span data-start="419.99" data-end="425.69">This is a weird social experiment that establishes a global language for building things.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="547.1" data-end="551.57">I would like to ask if the server shares a website if we don't need it?</span> <span data-start="551.57" data-end="557.22">What if we can press the button in the browser and, with one click, create a new web page?</span> <span data-start="557.22" data-end="562.64">That would be great but how can we pull it down the world?</span> <span data-start="562.64" data-end="564.26">We have these very powerful devices.</span> <span data-start="564.26" data-end="567.779">We have mobile phones, laptops, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="567.779" data-end="570.42">Maybe we can turn them into servers?</span> <span data-start="570.42" data-end="573.18">Sadly, this is not easy.</span> <span data-start="573.18" data-end="578.89">There are many problems with this idea, but in short, our personal devices</span> <span data-start="578.89" data-end="581.55">It's just not the server.</span> <span data-start="581.55" data-end="584.68">First, we sometimes close them, is it because we are asleep</span> <span data-start="584.68" data-end="586.45">Or the battery is broken.</span> <span data-start="586.45" data-end="591.23">They do not always have dedicated IP addresses, and they are not built at all for processing</span> <span data-start="591.23" data-end="594.2">The kind of traffic the server does.</span> <span data-start="594.2" data-end="597.519">Imagine publishing a video computer from your personal to make it viral.</span> <span data-start="597.519" data-end="602.44">Your computer will be overwhelmed by millions of requests, and your home network may</span> <span data-start="602.44" data-end="604.9">He fell down after a few minutes.</span> <span data-start="604.9" data-end="610.49">Well, if this one-click publishing idea is to work, we have to think outside</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="610.49" data-end="615.92">Server box, because, again, our personal device is just not a server.</span> <span data-start="615.92" data-end="622.18">Fortunately, some smart people have solved this problem on its head and have found a regular way</span> <span data-start="622.18" data-end="628.32">A device doesn't need to be a server to do various things of the server.</span> <span data-start="628.32" data-end="635.1">BitTorrent was created in the early 2000s and you call it a peer-to-peer network.</span> <span data-start="635.1" data-end="642.3">The key innovation is asking if instead one computer, one server, handles all</span> <span data-start="642.3" data-end="647.7">What is the responsibility of hosting files if we share this responsibility</span> <span data-start="647.7" data-end="652.88">A network of a bunch of different computers so that any device can jump to the network</span> <span data-start="652.88" data-end="655.44">And contribute some bandwidth?</span> <span data-start="655.44" data-end="660.39">Maybe some of these devices are similar to those that the server undoubtedly exists in the cloud</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="660.39" data-end="667.63">Sometimes some devices go offline, but the big idea is that regular devices can help</span> <span data-start="667.63" data-end="670.529">Contribute a network of resources to hosted files?</span> <span data-start="670.529" data-end="673.39">This is really a big problem.</span> <span data-start="673.39" data-end="678.04">Now, I believe most people know BitTorrent because of its shame.</span> <span data-start="678.04" data-end="684.519">It is mainly used for downloading movies and illegal music and other media, but I</span> <span data-start="684.519" data-end="689.88">I want to point out that it is incredible with a lot of legal and other innovations</span> <span data-start="689.88" data-end="692.74">Legal use case.</span> <span data-start="692.74" data-end="697.3">The most important thing is that it makes it possible for ordinary people with regular equipment</span> <span data-start="697.3" data-end="701.97">Being able to host files, I just thought it was pretty cool.</span> <span data-start="701.97" data-end="706.47">So what if we take this approach and we apply it online?</span> <span data-start="706.47" data-end="709.61">Websites are just files after all.</span> <span data-start="709.61" data-end="714.94">If the website is just a collection of files, then if we can use peer-to-peer</span> <span data-start="714.94" data-end="718.8">To get a website from one computer to another?</span> <span data-start="718.8" data-end="724.62">It turns out you can, I'm really excited to tell you more about it.</span> </p>
