look out for it so I'm well aware</span> <span data-start="73.96" data-end="76.119">that this is a JavaScript conference and</span> <span data-start="76.119" data-end="78.64">I love JavaScript don't get me wrong but</span> <span data-start="78.64" data-end="81.25">this this talk is more about how you</span> <span data-start="81.25" data-end="82.599">don't need to use JavaScript for</span> <span data-start="82.599" data-end="85.42">everything because sometimes it's it</span> <span data-start="85.42" data-end="88.36">results to more maintainable code and</span> <span data-start="88.36" data-end="90.819">less code to use CSS for some things one</span> <span data-start="90.819" data-end="92.53">of those things is transitions and</span> <span data-start="92.53" data-end="96.489">animations so in the olden days which is</span> <span data-start="96.489" data-end="99.39">for some people it's still the present</span> <span data-start="99.39" data-end="102.55">when when we used CSS to change</span> <span data-start="102.55" data-end="105.369">something the transitions were abrupt</span> <span data-start="105.369" data-end="107.619">for example here when I hover over this</span> <span data-start="107.619" data-end="109.569">button its background changes and also</span> <span data-start="109.569" data-end="111.58">something appears you can see the</span> <span data-start="111.58" data-end="114.61">relevant CSS code on the side and you</span> <span data-start="114.61" data-end="115.66">can see that there's no transition</span> <span data-start="115.66" data-end="117.61">everything just magically appears out of</span> <span data-start="117.61" data-end="121.06">nowhere this is bad user experience we</span> <span data-start="121.06" data-end="122.619">might not notice it because we're used</span> <span data-start="122.619" data-end="127.119">to understanding how stuff works but for</span> <span data-start="127.119" data-end="131.14">people that aren't as used to computers</span> <span data-start="131.14" data-end="133.03">as much as we are it might be very</span> <span data-start="133.03" data-end="135.25">confusing for example my favorite</span> <span data-start="135.25" data-end="137.83">example of this is the the the</span> <span data-start="137.83" data-end="140.98">minimizing effect that OSX has if you've</span> <span data-start="140.98" data-end="143.2">ever used Mac OS you're probably</span> <span data-start="143.2" data-end="144.79">familiar with it he'll when you

data-end="150.379">just magically disappear out of the</span> <span data-start="150.379" data-end="157.36">screen the reason this happens is that</span> <span data-start="157.36" data-end="159.89">it's not just Apple's way of showing us</span> <span data-start="159.89" data-end="161.36">that they're cool and they can do nice</span> <span data-start="161.36" data-end="163.879">animations it actually serves a purpose</span> <span data-start="163.879" data-end="165.739">for people that aren't very tech savvy</span> <span data-start="165.739" data-end="168.29">it shows them where the window went we</span> <span data-start="168.29" data-end="169.73">might not often think about that because</span> <span data-start="169.73" data-end="171.2">obviously we know where the window when</span> <span data-start="171.2" data-end="173.09">it's on the dock we can find it it's</span> <span data-start="173.09" data-end="175.19">pretty obvious stuff right but it's not</span> <span data-start="175.19" data-end="177.14">obvious for everybody so this helps</span> <span data-start="177.14" data-end="178.7">people that aren't as accustomed to</span> <span data-start="178.7" data-end="182.269">using new eyes to know where where it</span> <span data-start="182.269" data-end="184.819">went on how to bring it back of course</span> <span data-start="184.819" data-end="186.98">sometimes delays are even worse I'm not</span> <span data-start="186.98" data-end="188.9">saying you should after this talk you</span> <span data-start="188.9" data-end="190.849">should go to every CSS code you've</span> <span data-start="190.849" data-end="192.44">written not tons of transitions that's</span> <span data-start="192.44" data-end="195.17">horrible it's even worse especially for</span> <span data-start="195.17" data-end="196.97">advanced users if you are delaying them</span> <span data-start="196.97" data-end="198.349">with the transition that serves no</span> <span data-start="198.349" data-end="199.67">purpose because they know what's going</span> <span data-start="199.67" data-end="203.329">on it's it's much worse than everything</span> <span data-start="203.329" data-end="206.54">being abrupt for example when I'm the</span> <span data-start="206.54" data-end="208.4">text editor I like to use is called</span> <span data-start="208.4" data-end="210.41">espresso not many people use it but I</span> <span data-start="210.41" data-end="213.23">kind of like it so even though it has</span> <span data-start="213.23" data-end="216.56">lots of nice features there is something</span> <span data-start="216.56" data-end="218.239">that really bothers me when you press</span> <span data-start="218.239" data-end="220.25">command and L to go to a specific line</span> <span data-start="220.25" data-end="223.37">in your code there is this very long</span> <span data-start="223.37" data-end="226.37">animation for the window to appear that</span> <span data-start="226.37" data-end="228.019">lets you type here the line you want to</span> <span data-start="228.019" data-end="230.03">go to that really bugs me every time it</span> <span data-start="230.03" data-end="231.56">bugs me so much that I end up not even</span> <span data-start="231.56" data-end="233.63">using this feature just manually looking</span> <span data-start="233.63" data-end="235.519">for the line of code I want to go there</span> <span data-start="235.519" data-end="238.97">because usually when you want to go to a</span> <span data-start="238.97" data-end="241.1">specific line of code you don't want to</span> <span data-start="241.1" data-end="243.23">go you don't just sit around thinking oh</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="243.23" data-end="245.6">I gonna go to line 120 I think it's a</span> <span data-start="245.6" data-end="248.299">cool line usually it's because you're</span> <span data-start="248.299" data-end="249.56">debugging something you saw an error</span> <span data-start="249.56" data-end="253.069">message type error or not on line 120</span> <span data-start="253.069" data-end="255.049">and you're frustrated what the hell did</span> <span data-start="255.049" data-end="256.789">I screw up this time so you're gonna go</span> <span data-start="256.789" data-end="259.039">there and see what what what what went</span> <span data-start="259.039" data-end="261.789">wrong you don't want to be delayed with</span> <span data-start="261.789" data-end="263.81">animations you know where the window</span> <span data-start="263.81" data-end="265.789">came out from you know what's going on</span> <span data-start="265.789" data-end="269.96">you're a developer for fuck's sake so</span> <span data-start="269.96" data-end="273.53">yeah don't piss off your users you</span> <span data-start="273.53" data-end="275.09">should you should take it on a</span> <span data-start="275.09" data-end="277.25">case-by-case basis do I need to use a</span> <span data-start="277.25" data-end="279.02">transition here would it help it's</span> <span data-start="279.02" data-end="280.31">always a trade-off it's a trade-off</span> <span data-start="280.31" data-end="281.14">between the</span> <span data-start="281.14" data-end="283.63">and making your UI more understandable</span> <span data-start="283.63" data-end="286.81">and the more advanced your users the</span> <span data-start="286.81" data-end="288.34">less transitions you should probably use</span> <span data-start="288.34" data-end="290.26">and the or the or the quickest you</span> <span data-start="290.26" data-end="293.95">should make them anyway so let's assume</span> <span data-start="293.95" data-end="295.54">we want to animate the background color</span> <span data-start="295.54" data-end="297.73">of an element in the past we would</span> <span data-start="297.73" data-end="299.89">probably include like a huge library for</span> <span data-start="299.89" data-end="302.32">example jQuery and sometimes we might</span> <span data-start="302.32" data-end="306.34">even need to include an extra plugin and</span> <span data-start="306.34" data-end="308.62">then we would have to write JavaScript</span> <span data-start="308.62" data-end="311.17">to do something like this this is just</span> <span data-start="311.17" data-end="312.4">an example I know it could be done</span> <span data-start="312.4" data-end="315.55">better so in this case we've included a</span> <span data-start="315.55" data-end="319.23">total of 93 kilobytes minified for now</span> <span data-start="319.23" data-end="321.97">just to do a transition how many of you</span> <span data-start="321.97" data-end="324.22">have included a library any like any</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="324.22" data-end="326.53">JavaScript library in your page just to</span> <span data-start="326.53" data-end="333.02">be able to do transitions or animations</span> <span data-start="333.03" data-end="337.969">be honest</span> <span data-start="337.979" data-end="343.509">so this is pretty horrible we don't</span> <span data-start="343.509" data-end="346.569">really need to do this anymore because</span> <span data-start="346.569" data-end="350.5">we have CSS transitions now so I'm not</span> <span data-start="350.5" data-end="354.52">gonna dwell on the basics but for</span> <span data-start="354.52" data-end="355.96">example in this in this very simple</span> <span data-start="355.96" data-end="357.729">example you have a button it changes its</span> <span data-start="357.729" data-end="360.009">color when you hover over it and it</span> <span data-start="360.009" data-end="362.879">happens abruptly like CSS 2.1 used to be</span> <span data-start="362.879" data-end="367.21">if the the the way to use a very very</span> <span data-start="367.21" data-end="369.789">simple transition is to write something</span> <span data-start="369.789" data-end="373.06">like this this tells the browser any</span> <span data-start="373.06" data-end="375.039">property you can possibly transition</span> <span data-start="375.039" data-end="376.9">please transition it and make it last</span> <span data-start="376.9" data-end="379.93">one second so now when I hover over it</span> <span data-start="379.93" data-end="382.33">or out of it it happens smoothly and it</span> <span data-start="382.33" data-end="386.229">takes one second you can even have</span> <span data-start="386.229" data-end="391.129">different transitions on the hover State</span> <span data-start="391.139" data-end="396.31">for example if I specify zero seconds</span> <span data-start="396.31" data-end="397.93">here when I hover all the button it</span> <span data-start="397.93" data-end="400.539">happens immediately but when I hover out</span> <span data-start="400.539" data-end="402.19">of it it happens smoothly this might be</span> <span data-start="402.19" data-end="403.93">useful for example when you want to do</span> <span data-start="403.93" data-end="405.699">something and the user is in a rush and</span> <span data-start="405.699" data-end="407.889">you don't want to delay them with fancy</span> <span data-start="407.889" data-end="410.409">transitions but when on the out state</span> <span data-start="410.409" data-end="412.24">you have more time to do a nice</span> <span data-start="412.24" data-end="416.71">transition so this is like the simplest</span> <span data-start="416.71" data-end="421.21">possible way to do a CSS transition but</span> <span data-start="421.21" data-end="423.49">before I move on to other examples I</span> <span data-start="423.49" data-end="425.77">know what many of you are thinking yeah</span> <span data-start="425.77" data-end="428.289">this is cool stuff but come on I can't</span> <span data-start="428.289" data-end="430.419">use it yet because come on won't</span> <span data-start="430.419" data-end="432.55">somebody think of the browsers the</span> <span data-start="432.55" data-end="434.409">browser support for this is terrible I</span> <span data-start="434.409" data-end="437.469">can't use it in my projects today so</span> <span data-start="437.469" data-end="439.319">let's get this out of the way first</span> <span data-start="439.319" data-end="441.219">because I don't want you to be thinking</span> <span data-start="441.219" data-end="443.919">about this throughout my talk I want you</span> <span data-start="443.919" data-end="447.25">to be focusing on the code so this is</span> <span data-start="447.25" data-end="448.9">the browser support for transitions and</span> <span data-start="448.9" data-end="452.05">animations today basically they're</span> <span data-start="452.05" data-end="454.63">supported by almost every browser in use</span> <span data-start="454.63" data-end="459.219">today except I 9 and below this means</span> <span data-start="459.219" data-end="462.219">that worldwide at least I know in Asia</span> <span data-start="462.219" data-end="464.919">the the numbers are slightly worse but</span> <span data-start="464.919" data-end="467.919">worldwide this is about 80% of your</span> <span data-start="467.919" data-end="468.599">users</span> <span data-start="468.599" data-end="470.849">and I know you might be thinking what</span> <span data-start="470.849" data-end="473.309">about the the other 20% I don't want my</span> <span data-start="473.309" data-end="475.199">website to break for one out of five</span> <span data-start="475.199" data-end="477.99">people well the thing is these features</span> <span data-start="477.99" data-end="479.639">are designed in such a way that your</span> <span data-start="479.639" data-end="481.619">website won't break for the right foot</span> <span data-start="481.619" data-end="483.869">for the people who use old browsers</span> <span data-start="483.869" data-end="485.999">there just won't be an effect there just</span> <span data-start="485.999" data-end="488.759">won't be a transition it won't be as</span> <span data-start="488.759" data-end="491.58">easy to use but it will still work</span> <span data-start="491.58" data-end="493.83">everything will would still work if you</span> <span data-start="493.83" data-end="496.529">write your code properly if you if you</span> <span data-start="496.529" data-end="497.849">write your code with graceful</span> <span data-start="497.849" data-end="500.399">degradation in mind this shouldn't be a</span> <span data-start="500.399" data-end="503.249">problem and the time you save by doing</span> <span data-start="503.249" data-end="504.689">it with CSS transitions and animations</span> <span data-start="504.689"
