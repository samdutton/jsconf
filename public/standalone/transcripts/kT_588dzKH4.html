data-end="212.2">different API Z may be good we already</span> <span data-start="212.2" data-end="213.64">have code that's written with all this</span> <span data-start="213.64" data-end="216.16">stuff that that we can actually use it</span> <span data-start="216.16" data-end="219.79">today on the server side with the way</span> <span data-start="219.79" data-end="223.15">that node with Yui the way that Yui</span> <span data-start="223.15" data-end="226.209">works on node today we also have a</span> <span data-start="226.209"

<span data-start="248.459" data-end="255.58">first of all as of Yui 3 10 we we are</span> <span data-start="255.58" data-end="260.1">exporting the Yui object where we're</span> <span data-start="260.1" data-end="262.63">basically complying with the specs so</span> <span data-start="262.63" data-end="264.55">that any implementation that's going</span> <span data-start="264.55" data-end="266.77">against common J's bakit it should just</span> <span data-start="266.77" data-end="270.1">work at least the core part of the</span> <span data-start="270.1" data-end="272.05">library the rest of our modules are used</span> <span data-start="272.05" data-end="273.1">are marginal</span> <span data-start="273.1" data-end="275.35">module format Yui knows how to load</span> <span data-start="275.35" data-end="278.17">those modules but we don't have explicit</span> <span data-start="278.17" data-end="282.79">exports for each one of those modules so</span> <span data-start="282.79" data-end="285.43">once we did it pretty much worked but we</span> <span data-start="285.43" data-end="286.81">didn't really know what it was doing so</span> <span data-start="286.81" data-end="289.99">what we what we did is we configured Yui</span> <span data-start="289.99" data-end="294.07">to use a no GS way of actually</span> <span data-start="294.07" data-end="297.16">outputting whatever log messages that</span> <span data-start="297.16" data-end="300.25">are coming out of the Yui system Yui has</span> <span data-start="300.25" data-end="302.17">a bit built in log or that will do the</span> <span data-start="302.17" data-end="307.26">will log to the browser console but it</span> <span data-start="307.26" data-end="310.51">but in this case we can pass this this</span> <span data-start="310.51" data-end="312.04">configuration attribute to make its</span> <span data-start="312.04" data-end="314.26">biggest so that we can see what it's</span> <span data-start="314.26" data-end="318.55">doing and we can do a simple program I</span> <span data-start="318.55" data-end="321.82">know it's boring but this is how this is</span> <span data-start="321.82" data-end="324.22">how we get why you I running there's a</span> <span data-start="324.22" data-end="329.59">project called node node J s hyphen Yui</span> <span data-start="329.59" data-end="333.46">3 and that that projects available on</span> <span data-start="333.46" data-end="337.99">github under Dave glasses account and by</span> <span data-start="337.99" data-end="341.11">the way you can both nodejs and Yui 3</span> <span data-start="341.11" data-end="345.67">can support SHANY so you can chain it if</span> <span data-start="345.67" data-end="347.38">you like that kind of thing that first</span> <span data-start="347.38" data-end="350.47">line is is actually not required just</span> <span data-start="350.47" data-end="353.41">makes it simple more simple to execute</span> <span data-start="353.41" data-end="356.56">the program so this program can be</span> <span data-start="356.56" data-end="360.7">written in one line but then it works</span> <span data-start="360.7" data-end="363.13">does what you expect it to if we execute</span> <span data-start="363.13" data-end="368.02">it and and so that's cool but it doesn't</span> <span data-start="368.02" data-end="369.67">really do anything with the rest of the</span> <span data-start="369.67" data-end="374.32">library so the next part was to get the</span> <span data-start="374.32" data-end="375.88">loader to work and so the way that</span> <span data-start="375.88" data-end="379">loader works in a browser is it goes out</span> <span data-start="379" data-end="380.8">fetches remote well it calculates the</span> <span data-start="380.8" data-end="382.96">dependencies Fitch's remote resources</span> <span data-start="382.96" data-end="387.1">and and insert script nodes into the</span> <span data-start="387.1" data-end="391.18">document and then sets everything up so</span> <span data-start="391.18" data-end="393.04">all we had to do is replace the</span> <span data-start="393.04" data-end="395.11">transport that Yui normally uses to</span> <span data-start="395.11" data-end="399.3">something that is more that that
