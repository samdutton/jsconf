data-start="416.46" data-end="420.45">2600 and to my knowledge the first time</span> <span data-start="420.45" data-end="422.49">it was used was in the background of a</span> <span data-start="422.49" data-end="424.29">Devo video so I figured I'd show it to</span> <span data-start="424.29" data-end="441.549">you</span> <span data-start="441.559" data-end="446.099">so basically the Atari video music works</span> <span data-start="446.099" data-end="447.99">by it takes audio signals and then it</span> <span data-start="447.99" data-end="449.819">kind of it's it's a little black box but</span> <span data-start="449.819" data-end="452.49">it it makes these diamond patterns and</span> <span data-start="452.49" data-end="454.199">weird squiggly and this was a good</span> <span data-start="454.199" data-end="455.729">example because some of the stuff can be</span> <span data-start="455.729" data-end="458.21">super flashy I didn't want to show that</span> <span data-start="458.21" data-end="460.379">but there are a few parameters you can</span> <span data-start="460.379" data-end="463.729">tweak to them modify how that works so</span> <span data-start="463.729" data-end="465.93">all this stuff is really cool I love a</span> <span data-start="465.93" data-end="468.449">lot and it's very kind of this VHS low</span> <span data-start="468.449" data-end="471.089">fine 90s 80s kind of thing but I also</span> <span data-start="471.089" data-end="475.05">like very digital type of aesthetics so</span> <span data-start="475.05" data-end="480.909">here's two examples of some of that</span> <span data-start="480.919" data-end="492.16">hopefully</span> <span data-start="492.17" data-end="504.87">that's one and then here's the other so</span> <span data-start="504.87" data-end="506.91">as you can see that's kind of reacting</span> <span data-start="506.91" data-end="508.59">to the audio it's very purposely built</span> <span data-start="508.59" data-end="513.21">to do that but that got me thinking it'd</span> <span data-start="513.21" data-end="514.59">be really cool to be able to create</span> <span data-start="514.59" data-end="516.45">these videos live as I was performing</span> <span data-start="516.45" data-end="519.3">music and they're simple to the point</span> <span data-start="519.3" data-end="521.669">that at least graphically wise they're</span> <span data-start="521.669" data-end="522.84">simple so that I could totally make</span> <span data-start="522.84" data-end="524.79">these with like a canvas or SVG</span> <span data-start="524.79" data-end="528.51">application and then going with that</span> <span data-start="528.51" data-end="530.91">it's crazy how much again with the power</span> <span data-start="530.91" data-end="533.94">of the browser we have CSS animations 2d</span> <span data-start="533.94" data-end="535.77">3d graphics you have SVG we have video</span> <span data-start="535.77" data-end="538.77">we have awesome libraries like 3GS pics</span> <span data-start="538.77" data-end="540.36">ejs and this is obviously just — and a</span> <span data-start="540.36" data-end="542.7">huge multitude of libraries and we have</span> <span data-start="542.7" data-end="544.14">all these api's and some of the talks</span> <span data-start="544.14" data-end="546.24">that you've seen here talk about some of</span> <span data-start="546.24" data-end="549.3">these cool api's so why don't we harness</span> <span data-start="549.3" data-end="552.8">this technology and so that's the idea</span> <span data-start="552.8" data-end="559.83">so let's see oh right this is this is</span> <span data-start="559.83" data-end="561.72">not my app yet this is another site okay</span> <span data-start="561.72" data-end="564.09">so and then the idea here is that we</span> <span data-start="564.09" data-end="568.14">have all this types of hardware and all</span> <span data-start="568.14" data-end="570.27">this Hardware sends different signals so</span> <span data-start="570.27" data-end="573.78">here I have a ps4 a gamepad you can see</span> <span data-start="573.78" data-end="577.77">that and the mouse audio this is like</span> <span data-start="577.77" data-end="580.59">reading the audio level from the MacBook</span> <span data-start="580.59" data-end="586.59">and then those are many messages so</span> <span data-start="586.59" data-end="588.3">would it be cool if we could then</span> <span data-start="588.3" data-end="591.06">harness all of those kind of as a signal</span> <span data-start="591.06" data-end="593.16">kind of like drawing inspiration from</span> <span data-start="593.16" data-end="596.88">the video modular synth and each of</span> <span data-start="596.88" data-end="598.11">these can be harnessed through different</span> <span data-start="598.11" data-end="600.03">api's so gamepad is gamepad API</span> <span data-start="600.03" data-end="602.64">obviously media capture and streams here</span> <span data-start="602.64" data-end="604.11">is just for audio but you can also do</span> <span data-start="604.11" data-end="605.16">video which I'll show you in a little</span> <span data-start="605.16" data-end="605.55">bit</span> <span data-start="605.55" data-end="609.96">and then those can send signals over to</span> <span data-start="609.96" data-end="611.34">some sort of application that</span> <span data-start="611.34" data-end="613.53">application can harness those libraries</span> <span data-start="613.53" data-end="616.26">and those web api s but what we could</span> <span data-start="616.26" data-end="618.96">also do is that we could at least the</span> <span data-start="618.96" data-end="621.18">idea is to remap those live so we could</span> <span data-start="621.18" data-end="623.73">change the configuration and then change</span> <span data-start="623.73" data-end="627.63">the visualization as a result</span> <span data-start="627.64" data-end="631.76">so let's get into that so this is</span> <span data-start="631.76" data-end="632.84">probably built it's an application</span> <span data-start="632.84" data-end="636.23">called bit kid let me see if I can make</span> <span data-start="636.23" data-end="639.32">it bigger the idea is that we have kind</span> <span data-start="639.32" data-end="642.08">of a software version of a visual sense</span> <span data-start="642.08" data-end="644.51">so here we have the mouse node that's</span> <span data-start="644.51" data-end="646.28">reading the Dom events from the mouse</span> <span data-start="646.28" data-end="648.38">and then as I move back and forth it's</span> <span data-start="648.38" data-end="651.29">changing these x and y-values and those</span> <span data-start="651.29"

data-start="1285.33" data-end="1286.68">it's going to say hey you've played</span> <span data-start="1286.68" data-end="1289.8">middle C and then you play a lower note</span> <span data-start="1289.8" data-end="1294.81">and hey you've played F and I don't want</span> <span data-start="1294.81" data-end="1297.18">to go super in-depth into it but the</span> <span data-start="1297.18" data-end="1299.34">message is it's just data</span> <span data-start="1299.34" data-end="1301.56">it describes like you press note on</span> <span data-start="1301.56" data-end="1303.69">that's the type Channel there can be 16</span> <span data-start="1303.69" data-end="1305.64">channels how hard you pressed it and</span> <span data-start="1305.64" data-end="1309.06">that's just binary and there's tons of</span> <span data-start="1309.06" data-end="1310.35">different messages I don't want to cover</span> <span data-start="1310.35" data-end="1313.41">them all but like knobs and clock and</span> <span data-start="1313.41" data-end="1315">tempo and that thing that's all there</span> <span data-start="1315" data-end="1317.25">but what's great is that you can connect</span> <span data-start="1317.25" data-end="1319.35">to that see web MIDI and what that looks</span> <span data-start="1319.35" data-end="1320.97">like is you request many acts</span> <span data-start="1320.97" data-end="1324.51">then you get the mini access and then</span> <span data-start="1324.51" data-end="1327.15">for each of the inputs you can just</span> <span data-start="1327.15" data-end="1330.36">listen for a mini message and then you</span> <span data-start="1330.36" data-end="1332.22">get back event that data is just a</span> <span data-start="1332.22" data-end="1334.049">special array that has the three bytes</span> <span data-start="1334.049" data-end="1335.13">that I showed you on the previous slide</span> <span data-start="1335.13" data-end="1337.98">and that's it it's super low level it's</span> <span data-start="1337.98" data-end="1341.309">great oh I forgot I forgot to show you</span> <span data-start="1341.309" data-end="1345.63">the gamepad demo actually maybe you do</span> <span data-start="1345.63" data-end="1353.82">that okay okay and so here I have the</span> <span data-start="1353.82" data-end="1360.61">gamepad mapped I saw it for a second</span> <span data-start="1360.62" data-end="1363.659">there we go okay so I have this gamepad</span> <span data-start="1363.659" data-end="1364.919">here this is just a PlayStation 4</span> <span data-start="1364.919" data-end="1366.63">controller and I have the axis here to</span> <span data-start="1366.63" data-end="1370.59">find to then set the background probably</span> <span data-start="1370.59" data-end="1371.669">isn't important to show you that but I</span> <span data-start="1371.669" data-end="1381.45">did I remember this part all right yeah</span> <span data-start="1381.45" data-end="1383.46">so how that works is you can just listen</span> <span data-start="1383.46" data-end="1386.37">for gamepad connected you can get the</span> <span data-start="1386.37" data-end="1387.84">index because there's basically I think</span> <span data-start="1387.84" data-end="1389.01">at least on Chrome there's kind of four</span> <span data-start="1389.01" data-end="1392.34">slots of those game pads go go into and</span> <span data-start="1392.34" data-end="1395.37">then you can requestanimationframe you</span> <span data-start="1395.37" data-end="1398.07">basically are gonna pull for the values</span> <span data-start="1398.07" data-end="1401.309">that's that so here you can get the game</span> <span data-start="1401.309" data-end="1404.34">as you do that each time and then you</span> <span data-start="1404.34" data-end="1407.49">can log out the values of that the axes</span> <span data-start="1407.49" data-end="1409.26">or the buttons just a number from</span> <span data-start="1409.26" data-end="1411.63">negative one to one and then you just</span> <span data-start="1411.63" data-end="1415.38">keep pulling it so it's super easy</span> <span data-start="1415.38" data-end="1422.309">next is video in canvas I've never had</span> <span data-start="1422.309" data-end="1424.669">that happen before</span> <span data-start="1424.669" data-end="1428.28">let me try connecting this to another</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1428.28" data-end="1444.409">USB port and maybe that was</span> <span data-start="1444.419" data-end="1448.779">that seems promising sweet okay all</span> <span data-start="1448.779" data-end="1452.74">right so I'll show you this what this is</span> <span data-start="1452.74" data-end="1456.97">is this is just reading my webcam but</span> <span data-start="1456.97" data-end="1459.1">there's a layer on top that is you say</span> <span data-start="1459.1" data-end="1460.84">it's putting it to canvas and then on</span> <span data-start="1460.84" data-end="1463.27">canvas it's reading the pixel values and</span> <span data-start="1463.27" data-end="1465.1">then just summing up the color of that</span> <span data-start="1465.1" data-end="1467.529">pixel just because why not it looks cool</span> <span data-start="1467.529" data-end="1475.48">so hello Jay has come can't make you</span> <span data-start="1475.48" data-end="1478.809">guys out so yeah that's what this looks</span> <span data-start="1478.809" data-end="1482.289">like to show you the code behind that to</span> <span data-start="1482.289" data-end="1484.72">grab the webcam is also pretty easy</span> <span data-start="1484.72" data-end="1487.84">you ask for user media you ask for video</span> <span data-start="1487.84" data-end="1490.63">you get a stream back you can dump that</span> <span data-start="1490.63" data-end="1492.669">into a video element and just tell it to</span> <span data-start="1492.669" data-end="1494.77">play and it works and then of course</span> <span data-start="1494.77" data-end="1498.12">error callback which you saw right demo</span> <span data-start="1498.12" data-end="1501.669">canvas is easy as well I'm sure canvas</span> <span data-start="1501.669" data-end="1503.08">has been out for a while so you've</span> <span data-start="1503.08" data-end="1504.1">probably messed with it but just in case</span> <span data-start="1504.1" data-end="1505.96">you have it you can make a canvas</span> <span data-start="1505.96" data-end="1507.07">element you can get to make a video</span> <span data-start="1507.07" data-end="1509.799">element you get the context is how you</span> <span data-start="1509.799" data-end="1512.409">work with canvas and then you can draw</span> <span data-start="1512.409" data-end="1514.72">on to the context which draws with the</span> <span data-start="1514.72" data-end="1517.149">canvas an image and that first attribute</span> <span data-start="1517.149" data-end="1519.07">is our video tag so that's what I'm</span> <span data-start="1519.07" data-end="1520.96">dumping the webcam into and I'm just</span> <span data-start="1520.96" data-end="1523.24">reading it back off of that and then I</span> <span data-start="1523.24" data-end="1525.25">can do whatever I want so here's just an</span> <span data-start="1525.25" data-end="1527.83">example of how to grab the color of a</span> <span data-start="1527.83" data-end="1533.95">single pixel and here's another video</span> <span data-start="1533.95" data-end="1539.08">example and this one should work with me</span> <span data-start="1539.08" data-end="1545.28">so let's try it</span> <span data-start="1545.29" data-end="1548.7">okay so what this does is when it hits a</span> <span data-start="1548.7" data-end="1551.77">kick drum it's gonna splash the screen</span> <span data-start="1551.77" data-end="1554.02">but when it gets that chord sound it's</span> <span data-start="1554.02" data-end="1556.78">gonna randomly rotate with a rotate why</span> <span data-start="1556.78" data-end="1559.48">a CSS transition the whole thing and on</span> <span data-start="1559.48" data-end="1561.85">top of that is my pixel canvas and I'm</span> <span data-start="1561.85" data-end="1564.37">kind of changing the height based on</span> <span data-start="1564.37" data-end="1583.94">perspective where that is and hopefully</span> <span data-start="1583.95" data-end="1589.66">thank you so thanks for being here in</span> <span data-start="1589.66" data-end="1593.2">the first year scoff music video all</span> <span data-start="1593.2" data-end="1595.419">right so what are the problems with this</span> <span data-start="1595.419" data-end="1598.66">approach I don't want to get too into it</span> <span data-start="1598.66" data-end="1600.309">because it's nasty and annoying but</span> <span data-start="1600.309" data-end="1602.23">putting a web component in a reactor is</span> <span data-start="1602.23" data-end="1605.89">a terrible idea the virtual DOM and the</span> <span data-start="1605.89" data-end="1607.36">way we act works I think it somehow</span> <span data-start="1607.36" data-end="1608.59">triggers those connected and</span> <span data-start="1608.59" data-end="1610.84">disconnected callbacks all the time</span> <span data-start="1610.84" data-end="1613.179">so I just can't use them I try to get</span> <span data-start="1613.179" data-end="1615.13">around it for a couple of days and I run</span> <span data-start="1615.13" data-end="1616.72">out of time is like okay I'm just not</span> <span data-start="1616.72" data-end="1620.35">going to use it so instead you yeah</span> <span data-start="1620.35" data-end="1622.12">sorry then you just don't use them</span> <span data-start="1622.12" data-end="1624.85">another problem is that the nodes are</span> <span data-start="1624.85" data-end="1627.039">all evil if you edit a node and then</span> <span
