<p><span data-start="17.03" data-end="20.32">Welcome to my talk, recreating retro computer Art with JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="20.32" data-end="22.78">And my name is Sher Minn.</span> <span data-start="22.78" data-end="28.98">It's a little bit of an unusual name.</span> <span data-start="28.98" data-end="32.93">Downside is online forums don't like it when you have a space in your name.</span> <span data-start="32.93" data-end="37.53">I'll be here working on clientside validation, keep that in mind.</span> <span data-start="37.53" data-end="40.47">On the bright side, my SEO is really great.</span> <span data-start="40.47" data-end="44.32">If you look up my name, it's the first result and I didn't have to do anything.</span> <span data-start="44.32" data-end="46.4">So, life is good.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="46.4" data-end="50.88">I am from a small country in southeast Asia called Malaysia.</span> <span data-start="50.88" data-end="52.62">And yeah.</span> <span data-start="52.62" data-end="57.239">We have actually another Malaysian in the house here that was on the stage at CSSconf.</span> <span data-start="57.239" data-end="59.93">Proud to represent my country.</span> <span data-start="59.93" data-end="65.35">And I live in New York right now where I initially moved to attend something called the recurse</span> <span data-start="65.35" data-end="66.35">Center.</span> <span data-start="66.35" data-end="68.67">RC in the house.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="68.67" data-end="77.23">For those who don't know what the recurse Center, it's based in New York City for programmers.</span> <span data-start="77.23" data-end="83.9">6, 8 or 12 weeks and you can rediscover can the joy in programming.</span> <span data-start="83.9" data-end="88.2">If you want to take time to learn something you have been meaning to learn, this is a</span> <span data-start="88.2" data-end="90.13">great place to do it.</span> <span data-start="90.13" data-end="94.85">And I plug it because this is the reason why I'm giving this talk here today.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="94.85" data-end="100.43">Everything they have provided me has enabled me to pursue creative programming.</span> <span data-start="100.43" data-end="103.22">Creative programming.</span> <span data-start="103.22" data-end="106.06">I like art a lot.</span> <span data-start="106.06" data-end="109.509">I learned thousand draw before I learned how to code.</span> <span data-start="109.509" data-end="112.52">Here are some of the pieces of work that I've made in the past year.</span> <span data-start="112.52" data-end="115.97">And I really enjoy using programming to create code.</span> <span data-start="115.97" data-end="120.02">And most recently I have been really inspired by retro computer art.</span> <span data-start="120.02" data-end="126.979">So, what happened was that I discovered this magazine from 1976 to 1978.</span> <span data-start="126.979" data-end="132.639">And it was edited by a computer artist, Gracie Hertlein based in California in the United</span> <span data-start="132.639" data-end="133.639">States.</span> <span data-start="133.639" data-end="138.12">This was the first ever computer magazine entirely dedicated to computer graphics and</span> <span data-start="138.12" data-end="139.12">art.</span> <span data-start="139.12" data-end="146.26">You can see the title, inexpensive graphics in the storage category, really dates it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="146.26" data-end="150.2">And I got these images from a website called the recode project.com.</span> <span data-start="150.2" data-end="151.93">The site is no longer up.</span> <span data-start="151.93" data-end="157.659">But it was a great resource to look through what was cutting edge graphics back then.</span> <span data-start="157.659" data-end="162.34">And as you can see, it's mostly black and white, textbased, lines, geometric shapes.</span> <span data-start="162.34" data-end="166.709">Today we would call it minimalist or Lofi as an esthetic.</span> <span data-start="166.709" data-end="174.599">It was fun to look at and think about because most of the times the work published is just</span> <span data-start="174.599" data-end="176.26">the artwork itself.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="176.26" data-end="178.4">There wasn't a lot of algorithms.</span> <span data-start="178.4" data-end="182.739">Most of the time there would be some description of the technology used and maybe some of the</span> <span data-start="182.739" data-end="184.559">techniques, but no actual algorithms.</span> <span data-start="184.559" data-end="189.879">So, the whole purpose of the website that posted this magazine, the archive for this</span> <span data-start="189.879" data-end="193.54">magazine were like, can we try to reverse engineer it.</span> <span data-start="193.54" data-end="198.529">Can we look at a piece and figure out how it was made?</span> <span data-start="198.529" data-end="202.629">And so, this exactly what I sort of fell into.</span> <span data-start="202.629" data-end="209.069">And so, this entire talk will be about the research that I did and also some of the attempts</span> <span data-start="209.069" data-end="211.959">at recreating these works.</span> <span data-start="211.959" data-end="213.459">Let's first talk about computer art.</span> <span data-start="213.459" data-end="214.529">What is computer art?</span> <span data-start="214.529" data-end="218.089">A lot of us have an idea what have computer art is.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="218.089" data-end="219.379">It's probably right.</span> <span data-start="219.379" data-end="231.129">In my definition, computer art is the art that computers play a part in the creation</span> <span data-start="231.129" data-end="233.2">of the artwork.</span> <span data-start="233.2" data-end="242.159">That's using Photoshop or Illustrator or 3D graphics, AR, VR, the latest hottest thing,</span> <span data-start="242.159" data-end="244.9">deep learning art, AI art.</span> <span data-start="244.9" data-end="247.339">But we're not talking about that today.</span> <span data-start="247.339" data-end="251.709">We're going it be talking about the really, really early years of computer graphics.</span> <span data-start="251.709" data-end="258.169">This is when computer graphics became accessible and it will be about how people took those</span> <span data-start="258.169" data-end="261.009">technologies and used it to make art.</span> <span data-start="261.009" data-end="265.37">So, the decade I'm focusing on is the 1950s it 1970s.</span> <span data-start="265.37" data-end="270.56">This was really the crucial part where computer art was just becoming a thing.</span> <span data-start="270.56" data-end="273.58">So, everything's in black and white.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="273.58" data-end="279.09">So, to talk about retro computer art, we first need to talk about what computers were like</span> <span data-start="279.09" data-end="280.82">back then.</span> <span data-start="280.82" data-end="284.979">The reason being that context really matter when is you're talking about history.</span> <span data-start="284.979" data-end="289.49">And if you understand the tools and the techniques that are available to people at the time,</span> <span data-start="289.49" data-end="294.52">you can understand why certain pieces had a certain esthetic or, you know, why was it</span> <span data-start="294.52" data-end="295.52">done that way.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="295.52" data-end="300.47">It helps you appreciate a lot of the work a little bit better.</span> <span data-start="300.47" data-end="303.699">Here is a computer that was introduced in 1959.</span> <span data-start="303.699" data-end="307.08">This is the IBM7099 data processing system.</span> <span data-start="307.08" data-end="309.03">Not just a computer, a data processing system.</span> <span data-start="309.03" data-end="310.05">Really fancy.</span> <span data-start="310.05" data-end="311.289">It would take up the entire room.</span> <span data-start="311.289" data-end="317.15">You can see the magnetic tape readers at the back, console and punch card readers.</span> <span data-start="317.15" data-end="322.36">And it was introduced at a really cool price of $3 million.</span> <span data-start="322.36" data-end="323.37">Back then.</span> <span data-start="323.37" data-end="328.729">If you converted it to currency today counting for inflation it would be something like $19</span> <span data-start="328.729" data-end="333.639">million US which is really, really expensive.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="333.639" data-end="336.86">What this meant was that computer were really difficult to come by.</span> <span data-start="336.86" data-end="343.449">The people who could afford it were in universities, research labs, the military, government agencies.</span> <span data-start="343.449" data-end="346.389">They are very scarce as a resource.</span> <span data-start="346.389" data-end="351.68">Can you imagine calling IBM up and saying I would like to buy a computer for $19 million.</span> <span data-start="351.68" data-end="353.62">I'll write you a check, you know?</span> <span data-start="353.62" data-end="359.77">And most of the time people wouldn't interface with the computer.</span> <span data-start="359.77" data-end="365.96">They would write programs for it using a punch card writing like a typewriter.</span> <span data-start="365.96" data-end="369.599">And you punch the code and punch it into a punch card.</span> <span data-start="369.599" data-end="375.25">Take the stack of punch cards and hand it to a little old man behind the door and you</span> <span data-start="375.25" data-end="377.35">would get the results back five minutes later.</span> <span data-start="377.35" data-end="381.93">If you get impatient waiting for Webpack to building with think of this.</span> <span data-start="381.93" data-end="387.31">It takes a lot of time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="387.31" data-end="392.58">And there were many uses for scientific and mathematical applications mostly by scientists</span> <span data-start="392.58" data-end="395.4">or mathematicians in research labs or, you know, universities.</span> <span data-start="395.4" data-end="402.24">So, I want to show you some examples of companies that really converted to the field of computer</span> <span data-start="402.24" data-end="403.24">graphics.</span> <span data-start="403.24" data-end="408.199">The first coined the term computer graphics and they were one of the first few people</span> <span data-start="408.199" data-end="411.49">to use computer graphics in design work.</span> <span data-start="411.49" data-end="418.09">They used it to design cockpits to animate the different reaches of the limbs for the</span> <span data-start="418.09" data-end="419.27">pilot in the cockpit.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="419.27" data-end="420.27">Simulations.</span> <span data-start="420.27" data-end="426.15">Here was the first airport that was made using computer graphics, the Seattle Tacoma Airport</span> <span data-start="426.15" data-end="428.74">in the United States.</span> <span data-start="428.74" data-end="438.909">And Bell Labs in the US, they made one of the first ever computergenerated films.</span> <span data-start="438.909" data-end="444.61">First what that might look like and then I'm going to show it to you.</span> <span data-start="444.61" data-end="452.09">Here it is, it is a simulation of a control system from 1963.</span> <span data-start="452.09" data-end="453.789">And it's supercute.</span> <span data-start="453.789" data-end="458.099">It's a satellite revolving around a planet.</span> <span data-start="458.099" data-end="464.28">The early graphics were mostly designed to model or maybe just, you know, demonstrate</span> <span data-start="464.28" data-end="465.28">some diagrams.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="465.28" data-end="469.529">And so, like this really simple graph of straight lines, geometric shapes, black and white,</span> <span data-start="469.529" data-end="472.21">that was sufficient for their purposes.</span> <span data-start="472.21" data-end="473.759">This is wonderful.</span> <span data-start="473.759" data-end="478.169">No fancy colors or gradients or anything like that.</span> <span data-start="478.169" data-end="479.759">And yet, you know, art happened anyway.</span> <span data-start="479.759" data-end="483.62">People look the limited technology they had and did something really wonderful with it.</span> <span data-start="483.62" data-end="487.68">So, I'm going to talk about three different types of art.</span> <span data-start="487.68" data-end="491.669">I just chose examples from each category.</span> <span data-start="491.669" data-end="497.629">And I'll show you some oscilloscope art, some graphics and some textbased art and my attempts</span> <span data-start="497.629" data-end="498.699">at recreating them.</span> <span data-start="498.699" data-end="501.18">Let's start with oscilloscope art.</span> <span data-start="501.18" data-end="503.439">So, cathode ray oscilloscopes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="503.439" data-end="508.009">If you have been in a lab or school, played with one.</span> <span data-start="508.009" data-end="513.36">And this is what an oscilloscope is, or this is what it looked like in the 1950s.</span> <span data-start="513.36" data-end="520.071">It is a device that takes electrical signals and converts them into a visual over here.</span> <span data-start="520.071" data-end="524.61">So, here we have an example of a sine wave on an oscilloscope.</span> <span data-start="524.61" data-end="528.63">This is like a little bit before, you know, the IBM7090.</span> <span data-start="528.63" data-end="535.99">And here on the left is a picture of Ben Laposky, credited to be one of the first few people</span> <span data-start="535.99" data-end="539.96">who created electronic graphics.</span> <span data-start="539.96" data-end="545.55">And so, what I mean by that is he would plot interesting patterns on so the oscilloscope</span> <span data-start="545.55" data-end="550.14">and he would then photograph them and here is some of his works.</span> <span data-start="550.14" data-end="553.71">And what's really interesting about them is they look really ghostly.</span> <span data-start="553.71" data-end="554.87">Really kind of organic a way.</span> <span data-start="554.87" data-end="558.23">But you can sort of tell they had this sort of mathematical quality to it.</span> <span data-start="558.23" data-end="561.199">A few more.</span> <span data-start="561.199" data-end="567.339">Around the same time actually in Europe also there was a movement getting started in computer</span> <span data-start="567.339" data-end="568.339">art.</span> <span data-start="568.339" data-end="573.26">Herbert W. Franke, we created his own electronic artwork using oscilloscopes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="573.26" data-end="575.02">Here is some of his work.</span> <span data-start="575.02" data-end="580.61">So, the interesting thing to note about this, oscilloscopes don't have a screenshot button.</span> <span data-start="580.61" data-end="583.269">You don't press screenshot, and this is going to come out.</span> <span data-start="583.269" data-end="588.92">So, in order to capture these images, what they would do is set the camera in front of</span> <span data-start="588.92" data-end="592.98">the screen and leave it on long exposure.</span> <span data-start="592.98" data-end="597.73">It captures the movement of lines and graphics on the screen.</span> <span data-start="597.73" data-end="600.18">What you're seeing here is not just a single snapshot.</span> <span data-start="600.18" data-end="605.79">It is a combination of events on a screen over time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="605.79" data-end="610.19">And so, here actually is an example of the same like event, but two different phases</span> <span data-start="610.19" data-end="612.37">of it.</span> <span data-start="612.37" data-end="616.279">And I think it looks really beautiful like a ghostly jelly fish.</span> <span data-start="616.279" data-end="620.209">And more works by him.</span> <span data-start="620.209" data-end="628.48">And how to do this, draw sine waves on an oscilloscope.</span> <span data-start="628.48" data-end="631.519">But how to get from that to that?</span> <span data-start="631.519" data-end="641.5">There was a little bit of an explanation in recreational math mat irks and he used the</span> <span data-start="641.5" data-end="647.98">sine waves and others in combination.</span> <span data-start="647.98" data-end="652.75">Applying operations to create composite waves that had really interesting patterns.</span> <span data-start="652.75" data-end="657.92">Here is an example of the work that makes is really obvious that there is a bit of a</span> <span data-start="657.92" data-end="661.36">sine wave thing going on.</span> <span data-start="661.36" data-end="663.41">And I was like, how okay.</span> <span data-start="663.41" data-end="666.17">I get it.</span> <span data-start="666.17" data-end="669.63">But how well, how are these really made?</span> <span data-start="669.63" data-end="671.07">I attempted to create it.</span> <span data-start="671.07" data-end="677.23">I'm going to show you a demo here of creation of Lapsoky's Oscillons.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="801.04" data-end="804.04">And draw the ellipse over here.</span> <span data-start="804.04" data-end="809.32">And I can draw a line between those two points, and you get kind of that, but not quite still</span> <span data-start="809.32" data-end="810.949">because this overlaps.</span> <span data-start="810.949" data-end="813.639">And it keeps on getting brighter and brighter.</span> <span data-start="813.639" data-end="819.23">So, what you can do is that whoops.</span> <span data-start="819.23" data-end="821.93">You can fade out the lines as they're being drawn.</span> <span data-start="821.93" data-end="826.389">And this, I imagine, would be what that might look like on the oscilloscope screen.</span> <span data-start="826.389" data-end="828.43">A close approximation of it.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="865.42" data-end="866.6">Next, vector graphics.</span> <span data-start="866.6" data-end="869.3">Vector graphics has a special place in my heart.</span> <span data-start="869.3" data-end="871.25">I really enjoy working with it.</span> <span data-start="871.25" data-end="877.759">To understand why vector graphics are really important and they're mostly lines and geometric</span> <span data-start="877.759" data-end="885.35">shapes, we need to understand the output available in the computers.</span> <span data-start="885.35" data-end="887.319">This was before laser printers.</span> <span data-start="887.319" data-end="892.25">You couldn't print a highdefinition image really easily like we do now.</span> <span data-start="892.25" data-end="896.81">In order to create really detailed images, people would use mechanical plotters.</span> <span data-start="896.81" data-end="900.04">Think of it as a drawing robot.</span> <span data-start="900.04" data-end="907.449">It has a pen and can move on the Y or X axis across the surface of the paper and draw on</span> <span data-start="907.449" data-end="908.449">it.</span> <span data-start="908.449" data-end="909.449">This is a drum printer.</span> <span data-start="909.449" data-end="914.54">It moves the Y which is paper and the X which is the pen.</span> <span data-start="914.54" data-end="919.8">And so, the limitation with plotters is that all you have is literally a robot arm that</span> <span data-start="919.8" data-end="921.06">draws lines.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="921.06" data-end="923.949">And so, you had to describe your graphics in terms of vectors.</span> <span data-start="923.949" data-end="926.82">So, you had to provide coordinates in which to move around.</span> <span data-start="926.82" data-end="930.67">Can't do colors or gradients or fancy things.</span> <span data-start="930.67" data-end="936.73">So, a lot of the esthetic back then had to do with lines, especially close together to</span> <span data-start="936.73" data-end="938.48">have the effects.</span> <span data-start="938.48" data-end="942.459">Here is one I saw a lot of.</span> <span data-start="942.459" data-end="950.199">The basic idea is you take a geometric shape and nest it and get the cool, swirly effect.</span> <span data-start="950.199" data-end="951.199">Okay.</span> <span data-start="951.199" data-end="952.199">Interesting.</span> <span data-start="952.199" data-end="956.1">Like it's just nested squares, whatever.</span> <span data-start="956.1" data-end="960.829">And in fact, it was so popular that it was the esthetic for cybernetic serendipity which</span> <span data-start="960.829" data-end="968.529">is the first ever computer exhibition that focused on computer art and held in the institute</span> <span data-start="968.529" data-end="970.98">of contemporary arts in London.</span> <span data-start="970.98" data-end="973.62">It was a really big deal at the time.</span> <span data-start="973.62" data-end="978.019">And the fact that they chose this for the graphics, I guess it must be really popular.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1065.97" data-end="1067.87">And I also added pretty gradients.</span> <span data-start="1067.87" data-end="1071.63">Here is some video just in case the demo didn't work.</span> <span data-start="1071.63" data-end="1074.3">You know, got to be prepared.</span> <span data-start="1074.3" data-end="1079.13">And I found out that you could do this not just with four, but with three flies or five</span> <span data-start="1079.13" data-end="1080.13">or six.</span> <span data-start="1080.13" data-end="1083.82">And because of I have a computer that runs really fast and I can cue up for it, I can</span> <span data-start="1083.82" data-end="1086.07">run it as many times as I want.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1447.23" data-end="1452.91">Like the way that you color the background of the characters, sometimes it's a little</span> <span data-start="1452.91" data-end="1456.8">out of sync, but I like that effect.</span> <span data-start="1456.8" data-end="1458.47">So, yeah, use what you have.</span> <span data-start="1458.47" data-end="1460.28">I used Unicode.</span> <span data-start="1460.28" data-end="1467.04">Not quite SDR, but Unicode art and that was fun to play with.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1467.04" data-end="1469.26">This just skims the surface.</span> <span data-start="1469.26" data-end="1474.97">There's way, way, way so much more history in computer graphics and computer art.</span> <span data-start="1474.97" data-end="1480.66">In Europe alone, I tailored this talk for Europe because a lot of the history came out.</span> <span data-start="1480.66" data-end="1487.07">And Frieder Nake and Georg Nees, prolific computer artist in the '70s.</span> <span data-start="1487.07" data-end="1493.22">And from Hungary, making computer drawings before computer were a thing and also when</span> <span data-start="1493.22" data-end="1494.25">they were a thing.</span> <span data-start="1494.25" data-end="1503.34">And not to forget the new tendencies movement in what was once Yugoslavia and now Croatia.</span> <span data-start="1503.34" data-end="1505.27">And there's an 800page book on this.</span> <span data-start="1505.27" data-end="1510.539">If you want to look it up, the title is over here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1510.539" data-end="1515.42">This is an interesting movement because they celebrate the modular or procedural art.</span> <span data-start="1515.42" data-end="1518.28">Even before computers were used for it.</span> <span data-start="1518.28" data-end="1523.36">And as computers became more and more known, they also became a part of this movement.</span> <span data-start="1523.36" data-end="1525.23">So, yeah.</span> <span data-start="1525.23" data-end="1528.27">Before I end I just want to talk a little bit about why?</span> <span data-start="1528.27" data-end="1532.93">Why go through all this research like looking at things from 60 years ago?</span> <span data-start="1532.93" data-end="1540.46">So, a thing that I noticed, especially in the web world, is that we are always looking</span> <span data-start="1540.46" data-end="1543.28">at, you know, what's new and what's shiny.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1543.28" data-end="1545.43">What can I do next?</span> <span data-start="1545.43" data-end="1550.96">And we don't take a lot of time to step back and to look at what has already been done.</span> <span data-start="1550.96" data-end="1555.47">But it's important to understand that we didn't all get here just on our own.</span> <span data-start="1555.47" data-end="1561.32">We really, you know, were built on the we really stand on the shoulders of giants.</span> <span data-start="1561.32" data-end="1564.26">It's really important to know where you came from.</span> <span data-start="1564.26" data-end="1568.73">Because if you don't know what has already been done, you don't know how to make something</span> <span data-start="1568.73" data-end="1569.74">new.</span> <span data-start="1569.74" data-end="1571.77">So, yeah.</span> <span data-start="1571.77" data-end="1574.76">This has given me a lot of appreciation for the technology we have today.</span> <span data-start="1574.76" data-end="1580.1">And, of course, there is no shame in finding inspiration from the past.</span> <span data-start="1580.1" data-end="1584.08">You can pick what has already been done and make it your own, refine it.</span> <span data-start="1584.08" data-end="1589.49">Learn from all these people who have put in all the work and creativity to get us where</span> <span data-start="1589.49" data-end="1591.14">we are here today.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1591.14" data-end="1593.12">And that's all I have for you.</span> <span data-start="1593.12" data-end="1594.84">I have a blog.</span> <span data-start="1594.84" data-end="1597.23">I write about this stuff if you're interested.</span> <span data-start="1597.23" data-end="1598.23">But, yeah.</span> <span data-start="1598.23" data-end="1602.77">It was such a pleasure.</span> </p>
