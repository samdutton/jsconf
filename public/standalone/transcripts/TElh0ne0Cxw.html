data-end="160.29">networks</span> <span data-start="160.29" data-end="162.87">combined together I think that these two</span> <span data-start="162.87" data-end="165.569">concepts are a big reason of why I'm</span> <span data-start="165.569" data-end="168.06">into programming and I'm into web</span> <span data-start="168.06" data-end="170.79">programming and probably a lot of you</span> <span data-start="170.79" data-end="181.65">are as well so so one software is tools</span> <span data-start="181.65" data-end="184.68">for getting things done and this is a</span> <span data-start="184.68" data-end="186.9">picture of my grandpa and grandma in</span> <span data-start="186.9" data-end="192.72">1945 and she has been doing oil painting</span> <span data-start="192.72" data-end="194.76">and it was his job to make the frames</span> <span data-start="194.76" data-end="197.359">he's a carpenter he was making frames</span> <span data-start="197.359" data-end="203.97">but he also got into computer and his</span> <span data-start="203.97" data-end="207.419">job there was to arrange the photos of</span> <span data-start="207.419" data-end="209.73">the paintings on the page so that they</span> <span data-start="209.73" data-end="212.28">could be folded and made into a greeting</span> <span data-start="212.28" data-end="217.349">card and he showed me his workflow for</span> <span data-start="217.349" data-end="220.049">for doing that and it was incredible he</span> <span data-start="220.049" data-end="222.09">doesn't have photoshop or anything like</span> <span data-start="222.09" data-end="225.269">that like he used ms paint and something</span> <span data-start="225.269" data-end="227.909">crazy that came with the printer he was</span> <span data-start="227.909" data-end="230.519">totally bending these tools to do what</span> <span data-start="230.519" data-end="232.229">he wanted them to do even though they're</span> <span data-start="232.229" data-end="234.51">completely not designed for that so I</span> <span data-start="234.51" data-end="236.099">think that's a it's a good example of</span> <span data-start="236.099" data-end="238.29">somebody who came to computing very late</span> <span data-start="238.29" data-end="240.81">late in life but figured it out and</span> <span data-start="240.81" data-end="242.519">figured out the tools that he had and</span> <span data-start="242.519" data-end="245.489">getting them to do what he wanted them</span> <span data-start="245.489" data-end="249">to do and I think that this is a big</span> <span data-start="249" data-end="250.979">part of how he learned to use the</span> <span data-start="250.979" data-end="252.15">computer how you learned to interface</span> <span data-start="252.15" data-end="254.28">with it I don't know if this was</span> <span data-start="254.28" data-end="257.039">intentional for Microsoft to include</span> <span data-start="257.039" data-end="259.82">solitaire as practice for mouth</span> <span data-start="259.82" data-end="262.86">manipulation so you have clicking you</span> <span data-start="262.86" data-end="265.68">have drag and drop and and basically</span> <span data-start="265.68" data-end="269.13">like that that gives you the basics of</span> <span data-start="269.13" data-end="270.33">how to use the mouse how to interact</span> <span data-start="270.33" data-end="273.21">with a computer for somebody that that</span> <span data-start="273.21" data-end="275.61">didn't use a computer for 75 years and</span> <span data-start="275.61" data-end="279.21">then coming to it that late he used he</span> <span data-start="279.21" data-end="280.59">is this to learn how to interact with a</span> <span data-start="280.59" data-end="283.15">computer</span> <span data-start="283.16" data-end="288.2">and but now we have touchscreens and you</span> <span data-start="288.2" data-end="290.93">can interact with with media just by by</span> <span data-start="290.93" data-end="293.9">swiping like this so one year olds can</span> <span data-start="293.9" data-end="296.39">can look through photos on ipad or</span> <span data-start="296.39" data-end="300.08">iphone and they do all the time and it's</span> <span data-start="300.08" data-end="302.78">completely natural to them so this UX</span> <span data-start="302.78" data-end="304.97">design is kind of bringing bringing</span> <span data-start="304.97" data-end="310.43">people closer to the media and and also</span> <span data-start="310.43" data-end="314.06">making it easier and more accessible so</span> <span data-start="314.06" data-end="316.46">if with touchscreens it's it's closer</span> <span data-start="316.46" data-end="318.35">than with the mouse it's closer than</span> <span data-start="318.35" data-end="321.26">with the command line interface like</span> <span data-start="321.26" data-end="325.52">when I started on computers I had to</span> <span data-start="325.52" data-end="328.7">learn how to use das in order to call up</span> <span data-start="328.7" data-end="333.26">commander keen into Newcomb and play the</span> <span data-start="333.26" data-end="336.98">game said I wanted to play but encode</span> <span data-start="336.98" data-end="339.29">we're still very much in this this text</span> <span data-start="339.29" data-end="341.54">based world and so I'm thinking of ways</span> <span data-start="341.54" data-end="345.41">that that we can apply this UX design of</span> <span data-start="345.41" data-end="348.91">more direct manipulation of logical</span> <span data-start="348.91" data-end="355.46">ideas so this is designed not for hack</span> <span data-start="355.46" data-end="359.93">ability the the icons iOS icons now</span> <span data-start="359.93" data-end="361.52">they're flat but they were these kind of</span> <span data-start="361.52" data-end="365.03">gemstone things that they can't they</span> <span data-start="365.03" data-end="366.53">don't really invite you to take them</span> <span data-start="366.53" data-end="369.59">apart and it's the same as the smart</span> <span data-start="369.59" data-end="371.87">phones they're like if you take them</span> <span data-start="371.87" data-end="373.97">apart then you can see the components</span> <span data-start="373.97" data-end="375.41">maybe know what they do but you're not</span> <span data-start="375.41" data-end="377.59">going to be able to do much with them</span> <span data-start="377.59" data-end="382.49">after that so so I wanted to make a</span> <span data-start="382.49" data-end="384.23">different metaphor for a software when</span> <span data-start="384.23" data-end="385.79">you take it apart you can see the pieces</span> <span data-start="385.79" data-end="389.48">and how they're communicating and then</span> <span data-start="389.48" data-end="396.11">actually do something with it so so this</span> <span data-start="396.11" data-end="400.16">is the Libra website and we have a</span> <span data-start="400.16" data-end="402.23">gallery of apps that you can start with</span> <span data-start="402.23" data-end="405.65">but how many people have done dataflow</span> <span data-start="405.65" data-end="409.31">programming and in some context like can</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="409.31" data-end="412.03">I see like vvvv</span> <span data-start="412.03" data-end="418.56">anybody quartz composer pure data max</span> <span data-start="418.56" data-end="426.01">LabVIEW anybody okay then nice so the</span> <span data-start="426.01" data-end="429.76">basic concept is you have at least here</span> <span data-start="429.76" data-end="432.04">you have this library of components and</span> <span data-start="432.04" data-end="434.23">you drag them out here and then to</span> <span data-start="434.23" data-end="436.51">connect them you you pull a wire from</span> <span data-start="436.51" data-end="440.53">here so go from the output to the input</span> <span data-start="440.53" data-end="443.23">and then you said when you send signals</span> <span data-start="443.23" data-end="446.62">they they travel along these wires and</span> <span data-start="446.62" data-end="449.47">basically under under the hood all of</span> <span data-start="449.47" data-end="453.67">these all of these modules are our</span> <span data-start="453.67" data-end="456.33">classes and all the wires represents</span> <span data-start="456.33" data-end="459.67">event listeners so the outputs like</span> <span data-start="459.67" data-end="462.64">events and the event listeners send that</span> <span data-start="462.64" data-end="469.88">data to the inputs of the other modules</span> <span data-start="469.89" data-end="473.35">so that's kind of the this is the</span> <span data-start="473.35" data-end="475.57">representation of what I what I want to</span> <span data-start="475.57" data-end="478.12">wear I want to take apps like I want to</span> <span data-start="478.12" data-end="480.46">have this this interface that when you</span> <span data-start="480.46" data-end="482.47">open it up you can see the the boxes</span> <span data-start="482.47" data-end="485.59">inside and how they how they're</span> <span data-start="485.59" data-end="490.84">connected how they're communicating so</span> <span data-start="490.84" data-end="494.53">this was a animation that I made with my</span> <span data-start="494.53" data-end="497.08">baby when she was a couple months old</span> <span data-start="497.08" data-end="499.51">and I noticed that when i left the room</span> <span data-start="499.51" data-end="501.43">she would be in a different position</span> <span data-start="501.43" data-end="503.2">when i came back and she moved really</span> <span data-start="503.2" data-end="507.75">slowly but so i made a stop motion</span> <span data-start="507.75" data-end="510.84">application are a time-lapse application</span> <span data-start="510.84" data-end="515.92">here so i can show how how easy that</span> <span data-start="515.92" data-end="519.21">would be so i have a camera module and</span> <span data-start="519.21" data-end="526.36">an animation module and i'll use a</span> <span data-start="526.36" data-end="528.28">countdown and and there are different</span> <span data-start="528.28" data-end="535.3">ways of doing this allow camera so this</span> <span data-start="535.3" data-end="539">is the get user media camera</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="539" data-end="541.23">I'll just leave the duration at three</span> <span data-start="541.23" data-end="547.529">seconds and so every 33 seconds then at</span> <span data-start="547.529" data-end="550.769">the countdown will tell the camera to</span> <span data-start="550.769" data-end="554.07">send send an image and then I'll touch</span> <span data-start="554.07" data-end="556.62">that to the animation which is just a</span> <span data-start="556.62" data-end="560.579">collection of those images and once i</span> <span data-start="560.579" data-end="562.98">have a few that it'll start to make an</span> <span data-start="562.98" data-end="566.61">animation so i explained with stop</span> <span data-start="566.61" data-end="569.82">motion first but then when I had that</span> <span data-start="569.82" data-end="571.529">question like what is she doing when I'm</span> <span data-start="571.529" data-end="573.99">out of the room I was able to just add</span> <span data-start="573.99" data-end="577.019">this another module and and then like</span> <span data-start="577.019" data-end="588.269">see this time-lapse view of her this was</span> <span data-start="588.269" data-end="590.37">my introduction to media creation</span> <span data-start="590.37" data-end="594.51">digital media creation and if anybody</span> <span data-start="594.51" data-end="597.36">recognizes that the kinetics quick can</span> <span data-start="597.36" data-end="601.25">it plugged into the printer port and</span> <span data-start="601.25" data-end="604.02">whatever that is for for power from the</span> <span data-start="604.02" data-end="608.67">keyboard and it was really it was really</span> <span data-start="608.67" data-end="610.11">kind of clergy to put all these pieces</span> <span data-start="610.11" data-end="611.94">together like I wanted to make</span> <span data-start="611.94" data-end="615.779">animations of Legos and Plato and I</span> <span data-start="615.779" data-end="618.06">figured it out but I had to use a lot of</span> <span data-start="618.06" data-end="620.97">different tools in the same way that my</span> <span data-start="620.97" data-end="622.41">grandpa did like tools that weren't</span> <span data-start="622.41" data-end="624.54">designed for stop-motion but putting</span> <span data-start="624.54" data-end="627.18">them together and figuring them out so</span> <span data-start="627.18" data-end="632.49">they could be that so my hope is that if</span> <span data-start="632.49" data-end="635.42">somebody's looking for stop motion or</span> <span data-start="635.42" data-end="640.05">four for whatever whatever problem</span> <span data-start="640.05" data-end="641.85">they're trying to solve if I can find</span> <span data-start="641.85" data-end="646.02">this kind of system and see an app that</span> <span data-start="646.02" data-end="647.579">somebody's already made to solve the</span> <span data-start="647.579" data-end="649.77">problem if it doesn't quite solve it and</span> <span data-start="649.77" data-end="651.18">they can open it up and change how it</span> <span data-start="651.18" data-end="655.649">works so I I want to design to give</span> <span data-start="655.649" data-end="660.979">everybody that</span> <span data-start="660.989" data-end="664.72">demos I started talk from a designer</span> <span data-start="664.72" data-end="666.749">that does really cool generative stuff</span> <span data-start="666.749" data-end="670.54">using processing making us svgs but he</span> <span data-start="670.54" data-end="673.269">showed his process for extracting a</span> <span data-start="673.269" data-end="676.72">color palette from an image which is</span> <span data-start="676.72" data-end="678.879">nice you can use that to make generative</span> <span data-start="678.879" data-end="680.35">stuff so the image in the background</span> <span data-start="680.35" data-end="684.399">here was was generated from the colors</span> <span data-start="684.399" data-end="688.509">in this image and his process involved</span> <span data-start="688.509" data-end="692.579">going into Photoshop and exporting to</span> <span data-start="692.579" data-end="696.399">jiff and reducing the colors and then</span> <span data-start="696.399" data-end="699.509">somehow getting that colors out of there</span> <span data-start="699.509" data-end="702.309">so as he was explaining this process I</span> <span data-start="702.309" data-end="703.989">was thinking I could just put this into</span> <span data-start="703.989" data-end="705.91">one module and then any time that I</span> <span data-start="705.91" data-end="708.85">wanted to do that I could I could do</span> <span data-start="708.85" data-end="710.86">that in the same the same kind of flow</span> <span data-start="710.86" data-end="713.499">and get however many colors I want from</span> <span data-start="713.499" data-end="718.959">the image i made this
