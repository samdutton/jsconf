this does is on IE</span> <span data-start="607.329" data-end="609.19">it uses an event called on before</span> <span data-start="609.19" data-end="609.939">activate</span> <span data-start="609.939" data-end="611.829">which fires before any other event and</span> <span data-start="611.829" data-end="614.47">for the other browsers I use focus with</span> <span data-start="614.47" data-end="616.869">a capture face so it's it's triggered</span> <span data-start="616.869" data-end="619.749">before the other bubbling events and</span> <span data-start="619.749" data-end="622.089">what I do there is I inspect the event</span> <span data-start="622.089" data-end="623.859">target so the element that you're just</span> <span data-start="623.859" data-end="625.329">about to interact with our that you've</span> <span data-start="625.329" data-end="627.249">just interacted with either clicking on</span> <span data-start="627.249" data-end="629.709">it or about to change something or</span> <span data-start="629.709" data-end="632.289">submit something and when you do that it</span> <span data-start="632.289" data-end="634.479">goes and it says hey is this element a</span> <span data-start="634.479" data-end="636.159">problem element does this element have</span> <span data-start="636.159" data-end="638.829">events that need to bubble but don't</span> <span data-start="638.829" data-end="641.229">bubble and it goes yes and so what I do</span> <span data-start="641.229" data-end="644.349">is I then flag the event system and tell</span> <span data-start="644.349" data-end="646.689">it to manually bubble whenever that</span> <span data-start="646.689" data-end="648.759">event is triggered and I if that element</span> <span data-start="648.759" data-end="651.039">if that target doesn't have a dispatcher</span> <span data-start="651.039" data-end="652.989">on it or a mechanism to trigger those</span> <span data-start="652.989" data-end="655.779">events I add one listener to it and then</span> <span data-start="655.779" data-end="657.669">whenever it's triggered it knows to</span> <span data-start="657.669" data-end="659.679">manually bubble afterwards so it's not</span> <span data-start="659.679" data-end="661.599">guessing that something happened it</span> <span data-start="661.599" data-end="663.579">actually responds to the real event that</span> <span data-start="663.579" data-end="665.019">happened and then just tells the event</span> <span data-start="665.019" data-end="667.509">system to simulate bubbling so it fixes</span> <span data-start="667.509" data-end="669.339">the bubbling issue without having to do</span> <span data-start="669.339" data-end="671.889">a lot of guessing and so you get a lot</span> <span data-start="671.889" data-end="676.479">smaller code and it works it just works</span> <span data-start="676.479" data-end="678.639">without all these complex conditions and</span> <span data-start="678.639" data-end="680.259">like race conditions about click and</span> <span data-start="680.259" data-end="682.899">change and all of that so that's event</span> <span data-start="682.899" data-end="687.97">delegation with bubble I support on what</span> <span data-start="687.97" data-end="691.419">is this I support clone with more robust</span> <span data-start="691.419" data-end="695.409">options so mootools jQuery prototype all</span> <span data-start="695.409" data-end="698.199">do element cloning and what cloning</span> <span data-start="698.199" data-end="700.389">allows you to do is take an element and</span> <span data-start="700.389" data-end="702.939">basically clone it and copy all of its</span> <span data-start="702.939" data-end="705.039">children if you want you can use it's</span> <span data-start="705.039" data-end="707.589">called a deep clone but then on top of</span> <span data-start="707.589" data-end="709.269">that there's cross browser issues with</span> <span data-start="709.269" data-end="711.639">like ie which copies over the events too</span> <span data-start="711.639" data-end="714.22">and you don't want that necessarily so</span> <span data-start="714.22" data-end="716.169">what jQuery does is they allow you to</span> <span data-start="716.169" data-end="718.209">say well no don't copy the events or do</span> <span data-start="718.209" data-end="720.069">copy the events but I take it a step</span> <span data-start="720.069" data-end="723.009">further and I say that you can copy the</span> <span data-start="723.009" data-end="725.619">events you can copy the data which is</span> <span data-start="725.619" data-end="727.359">the data per element if you've used the</span> <span data-start="727.359" data-end="728.799">jQuery data method you know you can</span> <span data-start="728.799" data-end="730.809">store data per element so you can clone</span> <span data-start="730.809" data-end="732.819">the data but then you can also tell it</span> <span data-start="732.819" data-end="735.429">to exclude certain attributes so let's</span> <span data-start="735.429" data-end="737.499">say your cloning a chunk of elements but</span> <span data-start="737.499" data-end="739.239">you don't want to clone their IDs</span> <span data-start="739.239" data-end="741.279">because IDs are unique and so if you're</span> <span data-start="741.279" data-end="742.4">about to inject those and</span> <span data-start="742.4" data-end="744.38">to another chunk of your HTML you don't</span> <span data-start="744.38" data-end="745.91">want to have duplicate IDs you can tell</span> <span data-start="745.91" data-end="748.13">it to exclude specific IDs and that's</span> <span data-start="748.13" data-end="750.71">taken from mootools so I've combined the</span> <span data-start="750.71" data-end="752.3">mootools approach with the jQuery</span> <span data-start="752.3" data-end="755.09">approach to get a better more robust</span> <span data-start="755.09" data-end="759.1">option there so that's element climbing</span> <span data-start="759.1" data-end="761.66">ok and I have what's if you'll notice</span> <span data-start="761.66" data-end="764.75">this is fused object dot clone instead</span> <span data-start="764.75" data-end="767.6">of window object clone and that's</span> <span data-start="767.6" data-end="769.31">because I use what's called sandbox</span> <span data-start="769.31" data-end="772.37">natives I gave a little talk about this</span> <span data-start="772.37" data-end="775.61">at j s conf in april i also have slides</span> <span data-start="775.61" data-end="778.43">up that i'll be linking to at the end of</span> <span data-start="778.43" data-end="779.81">the presentation so you can get like</span> <span data-start="779.81" data-end="781.97">screencast about sandbox natives and how</span> <span data-start="781.97" data-end="783.8">they work but basically what it allows</span> <span data-start="783.8" data-end="785.69">me to do is have multiple instances of</span> <span data-start="785.69" data-end="789.47">native constructors on a page so i can</span> <span data-start="789.47" data-end="791.63">extend those native constructors without</span> <span data-start="791.63" data-end="793.76">dealing with the window object or window</span> <span data-start="793.76" data-end="795.95">array or window dot string or date or</span> <span data-start="795.95" data-end="797.53">math or you know or all of these things</span> <span data-start="797.53" data-end="800.81">and so it for the in this example i'm</span> <span data-start="800.81" data-end="804.26">actually extending the another instance</span> <span data-start="804.26" data-end="805.94">of the object constructed there and</span> <span data-start="805.94" data-end="808.22">giving it a clone method but what's nice</span> <span data-start="808.22" data-end="810.77">about this is that it also clones other</span> <span data-start="810.77" data-end="812.78">objects like arrays and dates and reg</span> <span data-start="812.78" data-end="815.03">axes which some of them some other</span> <span data-start="815.03" data-end="816.44">frameworks don't do that and so I've</span> <span data-start="816.44" data-end="818.95">gone and taken it a step further and</span> <span data-start="818.95" data-end="822.59">given at that also I address issues with</span> <span data-start="822.59" data-end="824.45">for in and cross browser issues with</span> <span data-start="824.45" data-end="826.97">that IE has issues where it may not</span> <span data-start="826.97" data-end="831.32">iterate over shadowed properties of the</span> <span data-start="831.32" data-end="833.63">of the better exists on the prototype so</span> <span data-start="833.63" data-end="835.04">like if you if you have a two-string</span> <span data-start="835.04" data-end="837.44">method on your object whenever you do a</span> <span data-start="837.44" data-end="839.27">four in it's not going to see that so I</span> <span data-start="839.27" data-end="840.95">address cross browser issues with that</span> <span data-start="840.95" data-end="842.84">because there's also bugs with Safari</span> <span data-start="842.84" data-end="847.73">and other issues there so I I handle all</span> <span data-start="847.73" data-end="850.48">of that for you so you can do a very</span> <span data-start="850.48" data-end="853.64">accurate each in that which goes over</span> <span data-start="853.64" data-end="858.38">each and every own property of a object</span> <span data-start="858.38" data-end="861.17">so if it's if it's their own property it</span> <span data-start="861.17" data-end="862.61">will literate over that in the for in</span> <span data-start="862.61" data-end="867.56">loop all right I also do I took a little</span> <span data-start="867.56" data-end="869.9">bit of stuff from mootools here and I</span> <span data-start="869.9" data-end="870.499">have</span> <span data-start="870.499" data-end="873.709">class mix-ins basically they're like</span> <span data-start="873.709" data-end="876.919">plugins or extending the prototype</span> <span data-start="876.919" data-end="880.809">except they don't add in the super sugar</span> <span data-start="880.809" data-end="882.979">and they're able to be passed around</span> <span data-start="882.979" data-end="886.459">from class to class and mixing them in</span> <span data-start="886.459" data-end="889.969">for example I use class a class mixing</span> <span data-start="889.969" data-end="893.709">for events for classes so your your</span> <span data-start="893.709" data-end="897.289">class sugar can have and observe and</span> <span data-start="897.289" data-end="899.809">stop observing on your your your</span> <span data-start="899.809" data-end="901.669">constructs for like your factory method</span> <span data-start="901.669" data-end="904.519">or your your your widget that you have</span> <span data-start="904.519" data-end="905.989">in your page you can you can trigger</span> <span data-start="905.989" data-end="908.299">events for them for your classes so</span> <span data-start="908.299" data-end="911.209">that's mix-ins I also do which leads</span> <span data-start="911.209" data-end="913.429">into class events and then here's</span> <span data-start="913.429" data-end="914.509">something that's that's really neat</span> <span data-start="914.509" data-end="917.539">debug mode with that allows errors</span> <span data-start="917.539" data-end="919.929">without halting the event handler loops</span> <span data-start="919.929" data-end="922.819">crockford talked about the event loop</span> <span data-start="922.819" data-end="924.649">and one of his slides and I noticed it</span> <span data-start="924.649" data-end="926.119">was that he said that you can have a</span> <span data-start="926.119" data-end="928.519">chunk of code fail and it won't stop the</span> <span data-start="928.519" data-end="930.499">rest of your stuff from from executing</span> <span data-start="930.499" data-end="932.929">and that's true in a in a browser</span> <span data-start="932.929" data-end="935.569">whenever you have event handlers if one</span> <span data-start="935.569" data-end="937.729">air is it will still execute the next</span> <span data-start="937.729" data-end="941.689">one in line and so frameworks that kind</span> <span data-start="941.689" data-end="943.699">of man handle this and take over this</span> <span data-start="943.699" data-end="947.329">this the the event execution will</span> <span data-start="947.329" data-end="949.009">actually go through there in a for loop</span> <span data-start="949.009" data-end="951.529">and if it errors it will actually fail</span> <span data-start="951.529" data-end="953.119">instantly and so you lose that</span> <span data-start="953.119" data-end="956.419">relationship jquery does this mootools</span> <span data-start="956.419" data-end="959.599">does this um it's some people say well</span> <span data-start="959.599" data-end="961.549">if it errors you know I it's best that I</span> <span data-start="961.549" data-end="963.879">know about it but if you're picky I've</span> <span data-start="963.879" data-end="967.329">put in a mode a debug mode so if you put</span> <span data-start="967.329" data-end="970.879">fuse underscore debug in the URL and</span> <span data-start="970.879" data-end="972.259">there's also a variation in the source</span> <span data-start="972.259" data-end="974.899">tag it will run in debug mode and that</span> <span data-start="974.899" data-end="976.759">means that that gives me the potential</span> <span data-start="976.759" data-end="979.729">to later give you errors and error</span> <span data-start="979.729" data-end="980.929">messages and things like that in the</span> <span data-start="980.929" data-end="983.029">code but what it also does is it allows</span> <span data-start="983.029" data-end="985.669">me to run a switch modes in my event</span> <span data-start="985.669" data-end="988.099">handler loops and actually use script</span> <span data-start="988.099" data-end="990.949">injection to create a different context</span> <span data-start="990.949" data-end="993.859">so I can actually execute these handlers</span> <span data-start="993.859"

data-end="1238.61">was a really good addition so props to</span> <span data-start="1238.61" data-end="1243.139">jQuery for that another nice thing is</span> <span data-start="1243.139" data-end="1247.1">that there's the mark again that you can</span> <span data-start="1247.1" data-end="1248.96">create elements just like jQuery that</span> <span data-start="1248.96" data-end="1251.87">really easy fantastic syntax of just</span> <span data-start="1251.87" data-end="1254.6">fuse and then your HTML there and then</span> <span data-start="1254.6" data-end="1257.24">you could then go like a pin to body or</span> <span data-start="1257.24" data-end="1258.919">whatever and then it would upend it it</span> <span data-start="1258.919"

data-start="1281.48" data-end="1285.08">to the query result and so this actually</span> <span data-start="1285.08" data-end="1287.57">works with the dot hide in the dot show</span> <span

data-end="1332.84">pattern with that is if you have the</span> <span data-start="1332.84" data-end="1334.34">arguments object and you want to convert</span> <span data-start="1334.34" data-end="1336.77">it to an array you do slice well you do</span> <span data-start="1336.77" data-end="1339.08">a ray prototype sliced call and you slap</span> <span data-start="1339.08" data-end="1341.09">the arguments object in there and it</span> <span data-start="1341.09" data-end="1342.83">converts it to an array but a lot of</span> <span data-start="1342.83" data-end="1344.63">frameworks when they when they add their</span> <span data-start="1344.63" data-end="1346.13">array methods they don't make it this</span> <span data-start="1346.13" data-end="1347.81">generic so you can't do that with their</span> <span data-start="1347.81" data-end="1349.43">methods so I went ahead and made sure</span> <span data-start="1349.43" data-end="1352.9">that all of my stuff follows es5 and</span> <span data-start="1352.9" data-end="1356.53">that's that's taking it up a notch there</span> <span data-start="1356.53" data-end="1360.01">my event wrappers are optimized for</span> <span data-start="1360.01" data-end="1363.05">execution so going along with this thing</span> <span data-start="1363.05"

data-end="1391.94">they have to do something like debounce</span> <span data-start="1391.94" data-end="1393.2">the balancing</span> <span data-start="1393.2" data-end="1394.97">something it's where

is</span> <span data-start="1399.23" data-end="1401.419">slow this allows it to actually be</span> <span data-start="1401.419" data-end="1402.59">optimized so you don't have to worry</span> <span data-start="1402.59" data-end="1412.25">about that one moment Oh better so</span> <span data-start="1412.25" data-end="1413.63">basically what i do is instead of</span> <span data-start="1413.63" data-end="1417.169">properties i have methods that you call</span> <span data-start="1417.169" data-end="1419.179">so you can say get target get current</span> <span data-start="1419.179"

data-end="1430.549">super cool here it's actually lazy</span> <span data-start="1430.549" data-end="1434">defining so it's it's actually not</span> <span data-start="1434" data-end="1438.08">forking based on features until it's not</span> <span data-start="1438.08" data-end="1440.179">working based on features until you call</span> <span data-start="1440.179" data-end="1442.399">it the first time and then if you call</span> <span data-start="1442.399" data-end="1445.519">it and then it actually stores the</span> <span data-start="1445.519" data-end="1449.51">result on the instance of the

<span data-start="1453.83" data-end="1455.299">time you call that function so it</span> <span data-start="1455.299" data-end="1457.51">actually stores the results afterwards</span> <span data-start="1457.51" data-end="1460.399">which creates a highly optimized ivette</span> <span data-start="1460.399" data-end="1462.169">wrapper which is great for like mouse</span> <span

data-start="1477.169" data-end="1483.98">you'll see there when I explain it this</span> <span data-start="1483.98" data-end="1485.6">means that whenever you create a new</span> <span

data-start="1502.94" data-end="1505.01">looks like prototype or mootools and so</span> <span data-start="1505.01" data-end="1506.929">this is this will work just like that</span> <span data-start="1506.929" data-end="1509.24">but it's using wrappers instead so it's</span> <span data-start="1509.24" data-end="1515.299">a familiar syntax something else cool as</span> </p>
