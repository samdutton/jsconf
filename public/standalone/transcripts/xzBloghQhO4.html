<p><span data-start="27.439" data-end="34.48">Hi, everyone, today I'm going to tell you about JavaScript in near space. It's actually</span> <span data-start="34.48" data-end="38.989">based on a project some friends of mine and I have been toddling around with for about</span> <span data-start="38.989" data-end="46.07">a year. On and off. And I was just reminded that it's actually yesterday was the anniversary</span> <span data-start="46.07" data-end="54.329">of the first balloon my friends attempted to launch, it actually met an untamely death</span> <span data-start="54.329" data-end="64.47">four feet off the ground on a stray beard hair, just FYI.Fully name is Pawel Szymczykowski.</span> <span data-start="64.47" data-end="69.67">If you're not familiar with the pronunciation of Polish names, I've provided a visual pronunciation</span> <span data-start="69.67" data-end="79.59">guide there for you. If you can say Paul bell ship check coffee ski, we'll call it close</span> <span data-start="79.59" data-end="91.069">enough (Applause) I'm from Las Vegas. I work for a small company called Wegi res that does</span> <span data-start="91.069" data-end="96.5">on‑line pooling, I'm atmakenai on Twitter, but adopt follow me, don't tweet anything</span> <span data-start="96.5" data-end="105.33">interesting. If you've heard of me at all it's probably for this guy here it's Sumobot</span> <span data-start="105.33" data-end="113.77">yup your, an Open Source design kit that I designed. It pucked up steam and started popping</span> <span data-start="113.77" data-end="121.8">up at a bunch of Nodebots all over the world, and eventually movement used it for their</span> <span data-start="121.8" data-end="128.78">build event last year to demonstrate windows 10 orneriest berry pie the which was cool</span> <span data-start="128.78" data-end="141.48">but weird\h‑‑ Rasberri Pie. I cented to this book here JavaScript robotics, among</span> <span data-start="141.48" data-end="148.23">much dueler people than I am, some of who are here today. I did a chapter on delta robots.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="148.23" data-end="155.78">It's kind of like on the cover there. So why space? Why indeed. For a lot of us the answer</span> <span data-start="155.78" data-end="163.33">is like yeah, Fuck yeah, space is awesome. But for others maybe I'll try to quantify</span> <span data-start="163.33" data-end="172.911">my reasoning. So space is just this sort of like vast endless thing that holds all of</span> <span data-start="172.911" data-end="179.48">these mysterious secrets, literally like no place on this earth. And I think as a species</span> <span data-start="179.48" data-end="186.73">we just kind of yearn to explore the unknown, you know, it's space, it probably holds like</span> <span data-start="186.73" data-end="192.88">the mysteries to lay itself, who knows. \h‑‑ mysteries to life itself. I probably watched too much</span> <span data-start="192.88" data-end="204.32">Star Trek next generation as  a kid. When office kid there wasn't a ton</span> <span data-start="204.32" data-end="210.29">of things going on, shuttles were pretty common and Ronald Reagan was trying to build massive</span> <span data-start="210.29" data-end="231.88">space weapon, not cool, TNG was can\h‑‑ I don't know if you've seen a lot of these</span> <span data-start="231.88" data-end="238.03">before, the first one there is Nodebots, those are like the wheeled ones then node boats,</span> <span data-start="238.03" data-end="250.62">really popular at JSCofn in Florida. We have node powered submersibles, open ROV is a remotely</span> <span data-start="250.62" data-end="262.03">operated vehicle that you can power with a node web server. node Copters, I think it's</span> <span data-start="262.03" data-end="272.27">time for JavaScript in near space, more achievable than outer space. And finally, I think just</span> <span data-start="272.27" data-end="277.77">because it's a challenging and interesting problem, it's hard and there's a reason why</span> <span data-start="277.77" data-end="285.26">it's kind of the domain of countries and well funded private companies like space X or virgin</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="285.26" data-end="290.23">Galatic. This is a side project, on a totally different scale, still hard, it takes a lot</span> <span data-start="290.23" data-end="297.81">of different disciplines, lot of different areas, it includes electronics and programming</span> <span data-start="297.81" data-end="305.99">and building things and radio operations and like car chases and all sorts of things, a</span> <span data-start="305.99" data-end="311.88">lot of things can go wrong and they often do, and take a long time to figure out. But</span> <span data-start="311.88" data-end="317.63">that's what makes it interesting to work on. Yeah, that said, I do think it's definitely</span> <span data-start="317.63" data-end="328.04">a possible thing to do. As long as you've set realistic goals and pretty persistent.</span> <span data-start="328.04" data-end="335.09">Speaking of goals, let's figure out what those are, at least for me and my group. Step one,</span> <span data-start="335.09" data-end="340.93">kind of a no brainer so to get really high up in the air. There are a lot of things that</span> <span data-start="340.93" data-end="347.72">go up in the air, drones are one of them, they don't quite go high fluff to be interesting,</span> <span data-start="347.72" data-end="350.76">some of\h‑‑ hey enough to be interesting, some of the commercial oneless, at least in</span> <span data-start="350.76" data-end="356.949">the United States, we're not allowed to fly them maybe higher than 120‑meters. There</span> <span data-start="356.949" data-end="363.68">are industrial, not industrial, really, but like high‑end model rockets. I'm talking</span> <span data-start="363.68" data-end="369.32">about not the SD kits you can get in card board tubes but 20‑foot ones that have massive</span> <span data-start="369.32" data-end="375.07">homemade engines, shoot up and they go really far, they're not in the sky very long they</span> <span data-start="375.07" data-end="383.83">go really fast and tend to explode, so it's not really in my comfort zone. What about</span> <span data-start="383.83" data-end="389.919">balloons, turns out in the United States, sorry, I don't know about regulations in other</span> <span data-start="389.919" data-end="395.46">countries, I know there's a lot of different countries represented here, but in the United</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="395.46" data-end="404.49">States, we have a federal guide of regulations, including FAA guidelines and there's specifically</span> <span data-start="404.49" data-end="413.78">a section there about mer Moarded and unMoard for photography and science oexperiments,</span> <span data-start="413.78" data-end="420.15">there's regulations but notary sufficient, pretty reasonable compared to things like</span> <span data-start="420.15" data-end="425.52">drones right now which are new and scary, high altitude balloons have been around since</span> <span data-start="425.52" data-end="431.52">the 1700, so they're kind of lax. They have things in there like don't launch your boo</span> <span data-start="431.52" data-end="438.71">line over city or near an airport, kind of a no brainer. Don't launch on a day with low</span> <span data-start="438.71" data-end="443.889">visibility, so airplanes know where you're launching from, so they don't run into the</span> <span data-start="443.889" data-end="449.18">thing. Not really a problem in Las Vegas, there's hardly ever Cloud in the sky, just</span> <span data-start="449.18" data-end="454.74">very dry and blue all the time. Things like don't trail anything for longer than fifty</span> <span data-start="454.74" data-end="466.61">feet from your, balloon. Make sure whatever's trailing with break less than 50‑pounds</span> <span data-start="466.61" data-end="481.6">of force in case an airplane runs into it. You also have to alert the air traffic controller</span> <span data-start="481.6" data-end="486.651">about a two hour launch window where and when you intend to launch. Finally you have to</span> <span data-start="486.651" data-end="493.9">have two ways of getting the balloon down, one of them went too high and it came down,</span> <span data-start="493.9" data-end="500.37">so that's kind of in the bag. Pretty reasonable. However, do they go high enough that we can</span> <span data-start="500.37" data-end="515.12">say that we've gone to space? In fact,\h‑‑ in fact, yes. Wrong slide, sorry. So these</span> <span data-start="515.12" data-end="521.06">high altitude balloons or weather Baloos they're also called can go up to 37‑kilometers,</span> <span data-start="521.06" data-end="530.811">there's an area called near space starting at between 20 and 100‑kilometers. At that</span> <span data-start="530.811" data-end="535.92">point you can start to see the curvature of the earth. It's really interesting, right</span> <span data-start="535.92" data-end="542.83">at that 20‑kilometers up, there's a zone known as Armstrong's limit. At which point</span> <span data-start="542.83" data-end="548.29">humans can't safely go up without a pressure suit, because the pressure is so low that</span> <span data-start="548.29" data-end="555.36">water will start to boil at body temperature. It's exactly what I'm looking for, something</span> <span data-start="555.36" data-end="562.08">alien, strange that you can't see hear, and it looks beautiful. By the way, it's not named</span> <span data-start="562.08" data-end="569.16">after Neil Armstrong the astronaut, another Armstrong, hairy Armstrong, an airforce doctor</span> <span data-start="569.16" data-end="579.121">who discovered this (Harry) so obviously the best thing to do would be if you could go</span> <span data-start="579.121" data-end="584.601">up there yourself and experience it. But that would probably take a lot of balloons, and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="584.601" data-end="589.18">I don't is there a pressure suit or even like a pressed business suit. So that one's out</span> <span data-start="589.18" data-end="594.38">(Laughing) the next best thing might be to send up some sort of sensors and collect interesting</span> <span data-start="594.38" data-end="600.22">data to see what it's like up there, poke around, essentially build a probe and experience</span> <span data-start="600.22" data-end="608.2">it. Have a sort of out of body experience, so that's what we'll do. And we'll use JavaScript</span> <span data-start="608.2" data-end="614.97">NY\h‑‑ why JavaScript, A, it's a JavaScript conference, I wouldn't give the talk if it</span> <span data-start="614.97" data-end="620.51">wasn't JavaScript. A lot of it has to do with this piece of software here, Johnny‑Five.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="620.51" data-end="630.37">It is a fantastic piece of software for controlling hardware using JavaScript. It's written by</span> <span data-start="630.37" data-end="637.23">a man named Rick Waldron. I credit it for me getting into JavaScript development at</span> <span data-start="637.23" data-end="647.17">all before that I was puddling along happily with Java and Ruby, and I thought, this is</span> <span data-start="647.17" data-end="656.94">what I'm going to do now. For a very long time, or pretty long time, I guess, Johnny‑Five</span> <span data-start="656.94" data-end="663.64">only worked with Arduinos, then one day, that's fine, but maybe not so good for application</span> <span data-start="663.64" data-end="670.339">here, you'd have to tether the Arduino to your laptop using like a USB cable and you</span> <span data-start="670.339" data-end="676.1">probably don't want to launch that up into the air. (Laughing) but then, one day, I think</span> <span data-start="676.1" data-end="681.34">it was maybe two years ago or so, Johnny‑Five got support for plugble I/O module and could</span> <span data-start="681.34" data-end="689.18">support any hardware anyone was willing to write a driver for. And then a man named brine</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="689.18" data-end="697.63">Hughs and wrote this Raspi‑IO package to support Johnny‑Five ton Rasberry pie, it</span> <span data-start="697.63" data-end="704.76">would run stand alone, you could do pretty much all the things you could to with Johnny‑Five,</span> <span data-start="704.76" data-end="709.85">but it was suddenly untethered and you could run it on this little computer. This is a</span> <span data-start="709.85" data-end="715.8">model, I believe it's an A plus, small, uses less power than some other ones, perfect for</span> <span data-start="715.8" data-end="723.51">the task. Oddly enough Brian Hubhs is next door is giving a talk on JavaScript community,</span> <span data-start="723.51" data-end="732.86">not robots but he's equally capable of both. If you've done any work with Arduino's or</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="732.86" data-end="737.709">Johnny‑Five before, you might B. especially if you poke around a little bit, you might</span> <span data-start="737.709" data-end="743.081">be familiar with sensors that hook up using maybe two leads, one is like a ground and</span> <span data-start="743.081" data-end="751.54">one is a power. The sensor pictured here is an MPU 5060, it's actually6 access exceller</span> <span data-start="751.54" data-end="756.98">rheometer and gyroscope, so at the minimum if we were going to hook up in the traditional</span> <span data-start="756.98" data-end="762.579">way you would need six signal pin and a ground pin, but there's other sensors on here as</span> <span data-start="762.579" data-end="767.7">well. That can quickly get out of hand if you wanted to add support for more things.</span> <span data-start="767.7" data-end="773.019">Luckily, this particular sensor and a lot of the more complicated sensors have an interface</span> <span data-start="773.019" data-end="780.019">known as I squared C that only uses four pins, just the first four on that right side (I</span> <span data-start="780.019" data-end="786.86">2C) and I 2C devises are addressable so you can chain them together and only use four</span> <span data-start="786.86" data-end="796.399">pins, very useful for this purpose. You don't need to know anything special to use I2C devices</span> <span data-start="796.399" data-end="804.61">using Johnny‑Five you declare them and set up a listener for data events. You don't have</span> <span data-start="804.61" data-end="810.11">to look up the I2C device address yourself as you normally would if you're home ruling</span> <span data-start="810.11" data-end="818.72">Johnny‑Five will look thaw for you. And once we get that data, we'll probably want</span> <span data-start="818.72" data-end="824.91">to store it someplace useful so we can look it up later and reference it as a lacy web</span> <span data-start="824.91" data-end="831.77">developer, I tend to want\h‑‑ as a lay city web developer I want to use tools that</span> <span data-start="831.77" data-end="838.76">are already there (Lazy) you might be familiar W. it's actually a logging framework. That</span> <span data-start="838.76" data-end="843.47">supports different log levels you normally use it to logger reports and debug statements</span> <span data-start="843.47" data-end="850.81">from your Webapp. One interesting thing it supports is JSON logging, you just set that</span> <span data-start="850.81" data-end="857.16">flag of JSON to true and you get nice JSON objects that you can parse pretty easily later</span> <span data-start="857.16" data-end="863.501">on. And all we have in the bottom line there is an interval to every half second. Look</span> <span data-start="863.501" data-end="871.16">at the status of the current data Blog we were setting and just log that. This is a</span> <span data-start="871.16" data-end="876.42">sample of what that might look like, this is from a drone test flight I did a couple</span> <span data-start="876.42" data-end="883.07">of weeks back, I believe, or maybe just, no, not that long ago. And so this is one line</span> <span data-start="883.07" data-end="887.82">that has all the data for the three sensors. Oh, the ones that I had chained up there were</span> <span data-start="887.82" data-end="894.529">a thermometer, sorry, a parameter for temperature and pressure data and electric come pus for</span> <span data-start="894.529" data-end="904.13">heading and the exceller rheometer itself (Compas) it's simple and very science tiff</span> <span data-start="904.13" data-end="913.8">looking data logger, I guess. (Baramat rer) another piece of data we might want on there</span> <span data-start="913.8" data-end="918.55">is visuals. Using raspberry pie camera for this, this is kind of no brainer, it's very</span> <span data-start="918.55" data-end="926.76">light, it's very cheap, it's about maybe 30‑dollars US or something and there are modules for</span> <span data-start="926.76" data-end="936.74">it as well, they just wrap the native modules on the Raspberry Pi Pi,\h‑‑ time stamps</span> <span data-start="936.74" data-end="942.279">on the data and the pictures or video will be insink automatically because they're U.S.ing</span> <span data-start="942.279" data-end="953.839">the same clock. (Raspberry Pi) then step three is probably the hardest one, it's getting</span> <span data-start="953.839" data-end="964.45">everything back safely. Because if you don't get your balloon back, you get a ten second</span> <span data-start="964.45" data-end="973.781">show as you watch your balloon float away forever. That goes up must come down (Your</span> <span data-start="973.781" data-end="982.66">balloon) but it won't come down as softly as you'd like. That's something that has a</span> <span data-start="982.66" data-end="989.67">lot to do with planning. The trajectory of your your balloon will likely take depends</span> <span data-start="989.67" data-end="1001.22">ton weather er, time of year and weight of the balloon, luckily the folks at HAB.org</span> <span data-start="1001.22" data-end="1009.35">high altitude balloon hub have created a calculator to make it a lot easier. Essentially you figure</span> <span data-start="1009.35" data-end="1013.98">out how much your payload weighs, payload is a fancy term for the box that's on the</span> <span data-start="1013.98" data-end="1024.13">bottom of the balloon. How much you're trying to lift up. How large your your balloon. They're</span> <span data-start="1024.13" data-end="1031.569">latex Baloons, they're very thin. Which is why beard hair could pop it. Normally you</span> <span data-start="1031.569" data-end="1038.149">wear gloves and they come in different sizes. But rather than selling them in diameters</span> <span data-start="1038.149" data-end="1042.88">they sell them in weights, so that's just how much the balloon itself weighs. Still</span> <span data-start="1042.88" data-end="1049.6">applies that a 650‑gram balloon will hold more gas than 250 program. You can fill them</span> <span data-start="1049.6" data-end="1055.531">with helium or hydrogen. Hydrogen is more exblowtive, helium is less expensive and there's</span> <span data-start="1055.531" data-end="1070.059">world shortage chose it because it's less explosive\h‑‑ how much gas and how much</span> <span data-start="1070.059" data-end="1084.32">lifting force, once you have the rate of acceleration and the\h‑‑ you can put it into the bottom</span> <span data-start="1084.32" data-end="1091.269">boxes there and pinpoint starting point on the map and it'll graph out where it thinks</span> <span data-start="1091.269" data-end="1096.519">your balloon will go, at which point it will explode in the sky, that's the red dot in</span> <span data-start="1096.519" data-end="1103.259">the middle. You'll want to, before that day preplan where you launch your balloon where</span> <span data-start="1103.259" data-end="1110.269">it end up hopefully not on top of a mountain or secret military base. Do that before you</span> <span data-start="1110.269" data-end="1119.46">launch. Of course that's not foolproof because, I mean, it's kind of an educated guess weather</span> <span data-start="1119.46" data-end="1124.59">patterns change. It won't cover the case where a giant bird on ducts your balloon and it's</span> <span data-start="1124.59" data-end="1134.341">miles off course. An ideal would be to add a G.PS tracker (Your balloon) you still need</span> <span data-start="1134.341" data-end="1147.549">to get the data to yourself, you're on the ground watching a Balloo float away. WiFi,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1147.549" data-end="1158.83">RF modules don't really have the range (Wifi) it in fact has a specific protocol for this</span> <span data-start="1158.83" data-end="1166.779">called APRS. APRS is stands for something\h‑‑ automatic package\h‑‑ something\h‑‑</span> <span data-start="1166.779" data-end="1175.7">something, any way it tracks things and sends their positions over short wave radio signal.</span> <span data-start="1175.7" data-end="1182.14">It does this by short wave radio the Ham radios, usually the people who hang out in their basements</span> <span data-start="1182.14" data-end="1185.54">and they're talking to people and talking their signal off the iOSphers trying to figure</span> <span data-start="1185.54" data-end="1196.01">out if they can get to Iceland from Idaho. Those guys. It does that by\h‑‑ the APRS</span> <span data-start="1196.01" data-end="1204.34">uses kind of a\h‑‑ an encoding called AFSK, audio frequency shift keying that encodes</span> <span data-start="1204.34" data-end="1210.84">the data as\h‑‑ if anybody's old enough to remember using a dial up modem\h‑‑</span> <span data-start="1210.84" data-end="1219.769">that type of thing. And there's another protocol underneath that that's like TCPIP. It's called,</span> <span data-start="1219.769" data-end="1225.85">I believe it's\h‑‑ yeah, I don't remember the name of it exactly. There's a routeing</span> <span data-start="1225.85" data-end="1233.019">protocol and then it sends bits of information. It could be theoretically possible to rewrite</span> <span data-start="1233.019" data-end="1238.549">that. On top of\h‑‑ in JavaScript using Johnny‑Five adding support for the GPS radio</span> <span data-start="1238.549" data-end="1244.549">adding support for a transmitter module. It would take a bit of effort though. And there's</span> <span data-start="1244.549" data-end="1250.22">already a really nice schematic an Open Source software we called track, we know it's made</span> <span data-start="1250.22" data-end="1259.08">for Arduino, figured I'd add that and talk to it over serial to the raspberry pie so</span> <span data-start="1259.08" data-end="1265.369">we can still get location data from it. You'll notice there's a call sign there, because</span> <span data-start="1265.369" data-end="1272.33">short wave, the APRS frequency is regulated, you do need a Ham license to operate on the</span> <span data-start="1272.33" data-end="1278.84">signal and to broadcast on it. So, my friends and I will just sort of cram for the technician</span> <span data-start="1278.84" data-end="1287.399">class radio exam and maybe a week or so cram and all passed. It wasn't hard, the exams</span> <span data-start="1287.399" data-end="1292.409">are all available on‑line, but we walked away knowing really nothing useful about Ham</span> <span data-start="1292.409" data-end="1299.799">radio and how to use it, but we had call signs and that's all we really needed. And the way</span> <span data-start="1299.799" data-end="1308.159">this APRS works it broadcasts this blip out on this frequency. And it arrives at a special</span> <span data-start="1308.159" data-end="1313.05">type of station, these stations are all over, called digital repeaters, they will listen</span> <span data-start="1313.05" data-end="1322.45">for things that are addressed to APRS. There's a sample packet there below. KG 7 OXY my call</span> <span data-start="1322.45" data-end="1329.879">sign, these digital repeaters will route it through the internet where a servicelike APRS.FI</span> <span data-start="1329.879" data-end="1335.33">will pick it up and plot it on a map. This is the area around my home in Vegas, the dots</span> <span data-start="1335.33" data-end="1343.509">are stations moving cars or I don't think there's balloons, some repeaters on there</span> <span data-start="1343.509" data-end="1351.36">as well. If you have that and internet signal you can launch your your Balloon, grab some</span> <span data-start="1351.36" data-end="1361.779">hiking boots and go to where you think it is and hike the rest of the way. And then</span> <span data-start="1361.779" data-end="1372.44">goal number 4 is actually doing it. (Laughing) so that's the tough part, like a lot of things</span> <span data-start="1372.44" data-end="1377.7">that are involved space are usually behind schedule and over budget, and this one is</span> <span data-start="1377.7" data-end="1384.55">no exception. We haven't successfully launched this thing yet. But we're working on it. This</span> <span data-start="1384.55" data-end="1388.61">is what the completed payload looks like. It's got all of the senators there, the raspberry</span> <span data-start="1388.61" data-end="1399.179">pie, the raspberry pie camera, the track Adr oaryno, the Open Source kit and there's the</span> <span data-start="1399.179" data-end="1404.63">antenna and the USB power thing right there. This is almost a complete. There's some issues</span> <span data-start="1404.63" data-end="1411.6">still with talking between the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino. A little bit of conversation</span> <span data-start="1411.6" data-end="1420.299">about that with brine yesterday. And there's also the worry about the antenna reaching</span> <span data-start="1420.299" data-end="1432.33">digital repeaters, which it's high enough we'll see. It's good to test how the things</span> <span data-start="1432.33" data-end="1440.539">will hold up. Once they're up there especially as far as the radio, it's a good way of testing</span> <span data-start="1440.539" data-end="1446.84">it. We're still working on this, the next launch window we're looking at. This is like</span> <span data-start="1446.84" data-end="1451.999">weekends, a lot of us, actually one of us lives in a different city now, we all work</span> <span data-start="1451.999" data-end="1458.159">in different places, but we're looking at October\h23rd for the next one. So, let's</span> <span data-start="1458.159" data-end="1466.909">see how it goes, there might be a sequel to this talk at Thunderplains JS where hopefully</span> <span data-start="1466.909" data-end="1473.119">there'll be a section about well what do you do with all that data once you have it. Maybe</span> <span data-start="1473.119" data-end="1479.671">see Thunderplains. And that's all I have, thank you, these are my friends working on</span> <span data-start="1479.671" data-end="1480.671">this with me. (Applause) and I have Nasa JS and ECMA stickers, if you'd like one of those,</span> </p>
