data-start="1314.459" data-end="1316.519">a very fast lightning style fashion</span> <span data-start="1316.519" data-end="1319.739">which is how important it is to have one</span> <span data-start="1319.739" data-end="1321.269">of your visions and pin it on your wall</span> <span data-start="1321.269" data-end="1322.979">and make it visible so that everything</span> <span

data-start="1334.229" data-end="1337.169">you think about your features I want you</span> <span data-start="1337.169" data-end="1339.989">to think about wireframing I want you to</span> <span data-start="1339.989" data-end="1341.609">think about getting the functionality of</span> <span data-start="1341.609" data-end="1342.809">what you're trying to do right make sure</span> <span data-start="1342.809" data-end="1344.759">all the steps in place if you need to</span> <span data-start="1344.759" data-end="1346.649">think about the edge cases please do but</span> <span data-start="1346.649" data-end="1348.179">make it work for the eighty percent of</span> <span data-start="1348.179" data-end="1350.399">your users first and then the last</span> <span data-start="1350.399" data-end="1351.989">twenty percent you can make work with</span> <span data-start="1351.989" data-end="1355.049">the edge cases how to make a throwaway</span> <span data-start="1355.049" data-end="1358.469">prototype which is use those wireframes</span> <span data-start="1358.469" data-end="1361.199">uses paper reuse them and actually make</span> <span

data-start="1367.079" data-end="1369.239">take a step back and really think about</span> <span data-start="1369.239" data-end="1371.839">your user and f it fits their needs and</span> <span data-start="1371.839" data-end="1374.309">finally when you need to scrap it which</span> <span data-start="1374.309" data-end="1376.259">is after the evaluation process if it</span> <span data-start="1376.259" data-end="1378.239">didn't go well you need to really think</span> <span data-start="1378.239" data-end="1382.619">about whether you should carry on so so</span> <span data-start="1382.619" data-end="1384.449">long and thanks for all the fish I will</span> <span data-start="1384.449" data-end="1386.789">be taking questions so I think I did</span> <span data-start="1386.789" data-end="1388.889">that in super fast time so I'm free for</span> <span data-start="1388.889" data-end="1392.999">some questions or not yes okay couple of</span> <span

okay</span> <span data-start="1431.83" data-end="1434.33">okay so what you're saying to me is that</span> <span data-start="1434.33" data-end="1436.88">whenever someone you're saying that</span> <span data-start="1436.88" data-end="1439.7">clients need to see something of a high</span> <span data-start="1439.7" data-end="1441.91">fidelity or kindly to see low fidelity</span> <span data-start="1441.91" data-end="1444.86">because then they understand it's going</span> <span data-start="1444.86" data-end="1455.51">to take longer to build see that that</span> <span data-start="1455.51" data-end="1457.7">sent like a workaround for a different</span> <span data-start="1457.7" data-end="1459.35">problem that's someone showing low</span> <span data-start="1459.35"

data-end="1463.58">actually build so that sounds more like</span> <span data-start="1463.58" data-end="1465.44">a communication problem than what you</span> <span data-start="1465.44" data-end="1466.7">should actually do with your user</span> <span data-start="1466.7" data-end="1469.07">experience but when it comes to little</span> <span data-start="1469.07" data-end="1471.23">fidelity the benefits of our that it's</span> <span data-start="1471.23" data-end="1473.06">throw away and it's fast high fidelity</span> <span data-start="1473.06" data-end="1475.55">takes longer to do so whenever you do</span> <span data-start="1475.55" data-end="1477.59">things a higher level of design is ready</span> <span data-start="1477.59" data-end="1479.48">to be built is ready to pastor developer</span> <span data-start="1479.48" data-end="1481.16">but you should be getting that feedback</span> <span data-start="1481.16"

data-end="1496.58">actually think that's what they're going</span> <span data-start="1496.58" data-end="1498.23">to get because the design hasn't touched</span> <span data-start="1498.23" data-end="1500.06">it yet that something is what you end up</span> <span data-start="1500.06" data-end="1502.4">building but my advice would always be</span> <span data-start="1502.4" data-end="1505.58">and what I just stated which is used a</span> <span data-start="1505.58" data-end="1507.89">little fidelity internally use it for</span> <span data-start="1507.89" data-end="1509.78">yourself it's not for shoes to other</span> <span data-start="1509.78" data-end="1512.12">people when you get to a medium or</span> <span data-start="1512.12"
