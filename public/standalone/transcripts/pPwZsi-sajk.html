<p><span data-start="63.57" data-end="65.37">JavaScript a lab technology so it's you</span> <span data-start="65.37" data-end="66.65">know for this conference pretty relevant</span> <span data-start="66.65" data-end="70.89">so um I have a little cold to excuse my</span> <span data-start="70.89" data-end="74.76">um like small breaks in between so the</span> <span data-start="74.76" data-end="76.799">reason why I like one of the reasons why</span> <span data-start="76.799" data-end="78.81">I believe every mobile app should be</span> <span data-start="78.81" data-end="81.06">tested through automation is the fact</span> <span data-start="81.06" data-end="83.07">that there's a paradigm shift going on</span> <span data-start="83.07" data-end="86.28">right now especially like consumers like</span> <span data-start="86.28" data-end="87.75">people that are not professionals that</span> <span data-start="87.75" data-end="90.39">use can be like that not use they're not</span> <span data-start="90.39" data-end="92.01">using a computer on a daily basis to</span> <span data-start="92.01" data-end="95.19">detail work the increasingly using more</span> <span data-start="95.19" data-end="97.98">mobile devices to you know use the</span> <span data-start="97.98" data-end="99.33">internet and like whatever is out there</span> <span data-start="99.33" data-end="102.06">so there's a shift from like the</span> <span data-start="102.06" data-end="105.57">old-school desktop browser based app to</span> <span data-start="105.57" data-end="108.78">mobile apps and you know like mobile</span> <span data-start="108.78" data-end="110.7">devices like smartphones are getting</span> <span data-start="110.7" data-end="112.29">increasingly more popular cheaper</span> <span data-start="112.29" data-end="114.75">because technology you know evolves and</span> <span data-start="114.75" data-end="117.06">you know it's only it's only progressing</span> <span data-start="117.06" data-end="120.33">it's only getting more that is great</span> <span data-start="120.33" data-end="122.79">because it also opens up a lot you know</span> <span data-start="122.79" data-end="125.07">new opportunities business wise and just</span> <span data-start="125.07" data-end="127.95">you know building awesome stuff so one</span> <span data-start="127.95" data-end="129.629">of the examples are obviously Instagram</span> <span data-start="129.629" data-end="131.97">very popular I mean it would found it a</span> <span data-start="131.97" data-end="133.65">couple of years ago and blew up in like</span> <span data-start="133.65" data-end="136.59">no time another good example is like</span> <span data-start="136.59" data-end="138.33">lyft or any of those transportation</span> <span data-start="138.33" data-end="141.629">companies that use the fact that a</span> <span data-start="141.629" data-end="143.069">mobile devices so much more in the</span> <span data-start="143.069" data-end="145.23">context of a real life because it's more</span> <span data-start="145.23" data-end="149.43">like a person carries it with him or her</span> <span data-start="149.43" data-end="151.44">whatever they go it's not like you're</span> <span data-start="151.44" data-end="153.359">going to a computer in your room like</span> <span data-start="153.359" data-end="155.34">you always bring in the phone so you</span> <span data-start="155.34" data-end="157.65">have the advantage of having the device</span> <span data-start="157.65" data-end="159.11">embedded in the car</span> <span data-start="159.11" data-end="161.6">text of a person's life meaning it knows</span> <span data-start="161.6" data-end="163.61">the location and it has all kinds of</span> <span data-start="163.61" data-end="165.68">other like information available that</span> <span data-start="165.68" data-end="167.42">you just don't get out of a browser or</span> <span data-start="167.42" data-end="169.79">like all of a desktop browser and a</span> <span data-start="169.79" data-end="171.47">really good example also is like</span> <span data-start="171.47" data-end="175.55">variables like the Nike FuelBand you</span> <span data-start="175.55" data-end="179.12">know I get it actually uses information</span> <span data-start="179.12" data-end="181.25">that it collects throughout the day and</span> <span data-start="181.25" data-end="183.14">then sings the W mobile phone and like</span> <span data-start="183.14" data-end="184.4">presents to you what you've been up to</span> <span data-start="184.4" data-end="185.9">like activity wise and all that kind of</span> <span data-start="185.9" data-end="187.459">stuff that's just I would necessarily</span> <span data-start="187.459" data-end="189.8">say it's impossible on a computer but</span> <span data-start="189.8" data-end="192.68">the entry barriers way lower for mobile</span> <span data-start="192.68" data-end="196.61">devices and mobile apps to do that so um</span> <span data-start="196.61" data-end="198.86">it's great that we get new opportunities</span> <span data-start="198.86" data-end="200.3">and all that but like opportunities also</span> <span data-start="200.3" data-end="204.38">come with challenges so that's kind of</span> <span data-start="204.38" data-end="206.45">exciting but it also can be very</span> <span data-start="206.45" data-end="208.22">frustrating and you know one of the</span> <span data-start="208.22" data-end="209.93">challenges obviously that there's not</span> <span data-start="209.93" data-end="211.82">just one mobile phone and there's not</span> <span data-start="211.82" data-end="213.709">just one operating system out there and</span> <span data-start="213.709" data-end="216.08">in particular for for the mobile world</span> <span data-start="216.08" data-end="218.2">you know the contenders are like iOS</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="218.2" data-end="222.44">Android Blackberry Windows Phone and</span> <span data-start="222.44" data-end="224.57">maybe symbian not so much anymore but</span> <span data-start="224.57" data-end="226.549">you get it it's just like there's like a</span> <span data-start="226.549" data-end="229.64">multitude of platforms another problem</span> <span data-start="229.64" data-end="231.23">is that these platforms run on like all</span> <span data-start="231.23" data-end="233.78">kinds of devices so it's not a standard</span> <span data-start="233.78" data-end="235.13">device everyone has the same one</span> <span data-start="235.13" data-end="236.45">everyone has an iphone they're like</span> <span data-start="236.45" data-end="238.37">plenty of devices this is like a chart</span> <span data-start="238.37" data-end="241.16">that I took from a blog post and it's</span> <span data-start="241.16" data-end="245.15">the data of July 2012 and it shows you</span> <span data-start="245.15" data-end="248.51">how popular certain devices are and um I</span> <span data-start="248.51" data-end="250.07">can't really show this right now because</span> <span data-start="250.07" data-end="252.47">it's not in the active but the way they</span> <span data-start="252.47" data-end="254.51">did that is like they show how it</span> <span data-start="254.51" data-end="255.65">progressed all the time and then it</span> <span data-start="255.65" data-end="257.81">moves around really fast so you know the</span> <span data-start="257.81" data-end="259.1">sudden your phone comes out and like</span> <span data-start="259.1" data-end="261.38">it's tossed into the mix and the problem</span> <span data-start="261.38" data-end="263.3">is it you know as very different screen</span> <span data-start="263.3" data-end="266.63">sizes this is a chart that basically</span> <span data-start="266.63" data-end="268.7">kind of shows you how many different</span> <span data-start="268.7" data-end="270.83">screen sizes there are like obviously</span> <span data-start="270.83" data-end="273.169">like more in a symbolic way not like you</span> <span data-start="273.169" data-end="276.35">know at scale the other interesting</span> <span data-start="276.35" data-end="277.669">thing or like the other thing that's</span> <span data-start="277.669" data-end="279.44">very challenging is that like most of</span> <span data-start="279.44" data-end="280.669">these devices have different memory</span> <span data-start="280.669" data-end="283.88">different CPUs you know different</span> <span data-start="283.88" data-end="286.04">technology so it's not that easy to like</span> <span data-start="286.04" data-end="288.56">provide a unified experience to all</span> <span data-start="288.56" data-end="290.85">users</span> <span data-start="290.86" data-end="294.509">using you know just a single technology</span> <span data-start="294.509" data-end="297.009">and not a really big problem that brings</span> <span data-start="297.009" data-end="299.319">back to this test automation statement</span> <span data-start="299.319" data-end="302.139">that I made is the way you distribute</span> <span data-start="302.139" data-end="304.75">apps is very different from like</span> <span data-start="304.75" data-end="306.159">deploying a website and using a browser</span> <span data-start="306.159" data-end="308.53">and like hitting it it's like these days</span> <span data-start="308.53" data-end="309.939">they are like you know app stores you</span> <span data-start="309.939" data-end="312.189">submit an app to app store and it's the</span> <span data-start="312.189" data-end="313.81">way people find your app discover it and</span> <span data-start="313.81" data-end="316.06">download and use it the problem with</span> <span data-start="316.06" data-end="318.43">that is I mean it's great it's not</span> <span data-start="318.43" data-end="319.87">really a problem it's great because it</span> <span data-start="319.87" data-end="322.539">is a unified way for non-technical</span> <span data-start="322.539" data-end="324.25">people to get hold of you know great</span> <span data-start="324.25" data-end="326.469">apps that provide great open create</span> <span data-start="326.469" data-end="329.11">experiences and great services the</span> <span data-start="329.11" data-end="330.24">problem that comes with that is</span> <span data-start="330.24" data-end="333.099">particularly for a certain platform you</span> <span data-start="333.099" data-end="334.569">have to submit your app and if you're</span> <span data-start="334.569" data-end="336.43">lucky it actually makes it into the app</span> <span data-start="336.43" data-end="339.49">store in like a two weeks time so but it</span> <span data-start="339.49" data-end="341.74">can sometimes be like you know a month</span> <span data-start="341.74" data-end="344.439">or five because there's a review process</span> <span data-start="344.439" data-end="346.24">attached to it like they want to make</span> <span data-start="346.24" data-end="347.8">sure that you don't steal data from the</span> <span data-start="347.8" data-end="349.509">users and they're using the platform in</span> <span data-start="349.509" data-end="353.56">a in a let's say like regulated way like</span> <span data-start="353.56" data-end="357.009">in a sandboxed way and the way that</span> <span data-start="357.009" data-end="359.199">works is like you make a change you want</span> <span data-start="359.199" data-end="360.46">to get out there you have to submit it</span> <span data-start="360.46" data-end="361.539">to the App Store and go through all this</span> <span data-start="361.539" data-end="365.68">process so essentially it's not as easy</span> <span data-start="365.68" data-end="367.779">as like running a website where you can</span> <span data-start="367.779" data-end="370.27">deploy at will because it's your service</span> <span data-start="370.27" data-end="371.83">you're running at people hit it from</span> <span data-start="371.83" data-end="374.169">their desktop browsers it's more like</span> <span data-start="374.169" data-end="376.18">you make a change and then you have one</span> <span data-start="376.18" data-end="377.979">shot and then like you have to wait two</span> <span data-start="377.979" data-end="380.11">weeks or cancel it and like you</span> <span data-start="380.11" data-end="381.639">definitely have to wait a time until it</span> <span data-start="381.639" data-end="382.93">actually hits the App Store and people</span> <span data-start="382.93" data-end="384.58">updated and then it's also after the</span> <span data-start="384.58" data-end="386.439">people actually update or upgrade to the</span> <span data-start="386.439" data-end="389.469">latest version so one thing that really</span> <span data-start="389.469" data-end="391.719">you know is key here is quality</span> <span data-start="391.719" data-end="393.159">assurance right so when you have one</span> <span data-start="393.159" data-end="394.629">shot you want to be you know you want to</span> <span data-start="394.629" data-end="396.819">be sure that when you actually you know</span> <span data-start="396.819" data-end="398.469">go ahead and you're submitting the app</span> <span data-start="398.469" data-end="401.139">to the app store that um you know</span> <span data-start="401.139" data-end="404.919">essentially this app is is buck free at</span> <span data-start="404.919" data-end="406.389">least the functionality that you want to</span> <span data-start="406.389" data-end="408.37">provide any users you have a confidence</span> <span data-start="408.37" data-end="410.62">that it's working and there's a really</span> <span data-start="410.62" data-end="413.379">common way of doing this which is called</span> <span data-start="413.379" data-end="416.74">dog fooding so companies go ahead and</span> <span data-start="416.74" data-end="418.629">like serve a development version to the</span> <span data-start="418.629" data-end="420.669">employees like I think Facebook does</span> <span data-start="420.669" data-end="421.779">that because I have a lot of employees</span> <span data-start="421.779" data-end="424">and everyone kind of has to use Facebook</span> <span data-start="424" data-end="424.569">in the way even</span> <span data-start="424.569" data-end="428.61">big a fan on Twitter but the thing is</span> <span data-start="428.61" data-end="431.589">the kind of like dependent on like</span> <span data-start="431.589" data-end="433.059">people using it hitting boxing and</span> <span data-start="433.059" data-end="434.83">finding reports to actually get some</span> <span data-start="434.83" data-end="437.319">sort of QA process in there but it's</span> <span data-start="437.319" data-end="438.669">kind of up to coincidence it's not</span> <span data-start="438.669" data-end="440.529">really systematical and it's definitely</span> <span data-start="440.529" data-end="442.899">not automated at least the testing part</span> <span data-start="442.899" data-end="446.199">of it another thing is like you can't</span> <span data-start="446.199" data-end="448.779">really execute some sort of test case</span> <span data-start="448.779" data-end="450.58">repetitively because you like the way</span> <span data-start="450.58" data-end="452.8">just kind of probing the ad like people</span> <span data-start="452.8" data-end="454.569">just use it it's not there's no system</span> <span data-start="454.569" data-end="456.729">to there's no there's no test plan to it</span> <span data-start="456.729" data-end="459.61">and even if there were one it's really</span> <span data-start="459.61" data-end="461.86">you know hard to repeat that on a</span> <span data-start="461.86" data-end="465.33">frequent basis and you know quickly</span> <span data-start="465.33" data-end="467.11">obviously you want to find bucks before</span> <span data-start="467.11" data-end="468.699">you use the students kind of like the</span> <span data-start="468.699" data-end="473.199">bottom line of all then so um you know</span> <span data-start="473.199" data-end="475.059">like that all that said and all these</span> <span data-start="475.059" data-end="477.039">variety of platforms and screen size and</span> <span data-start="477.039" data-end="479.889">all that there's like this this</span> <span data-start="479.889" data-end="482.319">initiative in this you know app</span> <span data-start="482.319" data-end="485.11">development world which goes in the area</span> <span data-start="485.11" data-end="486.729">that like instead of like using some</span> <span data-start="486.729" data-end="488.169">native programming language like</span> <span data-start="488.169" data-end="490.479">objective CEO like Android why not just</span> <span data-start="490.479" data-end="492.039">using you know web technologies to build</span> <span data-start="492.039" data-end="494.68">apps you can see all you know most of us</span> <span data-start="494.68" data-end="496.509">in the room here probably uh are either</span> <span data-start="496.509" data-end="498.939">you know building websites already we</span> <span data-start="498.939"

for</span> <span data-start="818.85" data-end="822.81">to get that into the w3c spec so it</span> <span data-start="822.81" data-end="824.82">becomes legit web you know technology</span> <span

data-start="829.05" data-end="830.7">since and you know I highly recommend to</span> <span data-start="830.7" data-end="832.05">like take a look if you guys working on</span> <span data-start="832.05" data-end="836.16">mobile apps and and I'm going to use an</span> <span data-start="836.16" data-end="838.56">emulator and a simulator they kind of</span> <span data-start="838.56"

want to see</span> <span data-start="852.03" data-end="853.35">how that works I can show you later I</span> <span data-start="853.35" data-end="856.68">just don't have the time today alright</span> <span data-start="856.68" data-end="860.43">so code over is this um this framework</span> <span data-start="860.43" data-end="862.65">that wraps a webview which basically</span> <span data-start="862.65" data-end="864.84">like you know fullscreen browser in a</span> <span data-start="864.84" data-end="866.55">native app right and that's the way it</span> <span data-start="866.55" data-end="868.23">deploys or like it gets the</span> <span data-start="868.23" data-end="870.45">functionality out to all the different</span> <span data-start="870.45" data-end="872.79">platforms and the great thing about that</span> <span data-start="872.79" data-end="876.21">is that if we talked into a website this</span> <span data-start="876.21" data-end="879.3">whole automation you know process is</span> <span data-start="879.3" data-end="881.46">basically unified because always web</span> <span data-start="881.46" data-end="882.78">technology is always the same across the</span> <span data-start="882.78" data-end="884.67">platforms supposedly it's the same I</span> <span data-start="884.67" data-end="886.44">mean it relies on the idea that like</span> <span data-start="886.44" data-end="887.88">everybody implements a standard right</span> <span data-start="887.88" data-end="890.12">which day which they do most of the time</span> <span data-start="890.12" data-end="892.35">but it's not it's not as different as</span> <span data-start="892.35" data-end="893.91">like you know you have android and iOS</span> <span data-start="893.91" data-end="895.77">and you're very different framework so</span> <span data-start="895.77" data-end="897.75">like very different ap is so that's</span> <span data-start="897.75" data-end="902.55">great um also emiem supports talking to</span> <span data-start="902.55" data-end="904.59">the native part of the app we're talking</span> <span data-start="904.59" data-end="906.03">to the webview part so the different</span> <span data-start="906.03" data-end="908.37">contexts the context and you can switch</span> <span data-start="908.37" data-end="909.9">back and forth between them so you can</span> <span data-start="909.9" data-end="911.7">automate the web part of the app which</span> <span data-start="911.7" data-end="913.8">is the web view which is forked over the</span> <span data-start="913.8" data-end="915.54">actual app but there are things that you</span> <span data-start="915.54" data-end="918.03">you know you can test to the web app if</span> <span data-start="918.03" data-end="919.83">you hooking like if you have events</span> <span data-start="919.83" data-end="921.66">hooked up to some native API that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="921.66" data-end="923.85">JavaScript exposes fuka dola so</span> <span data-start="923.85" data-end="925.74">sometimes you have to switch from the</span> <span data-start="925.74"

data-end="934.83">then switch back so the great thing is</span> <span data-start="934.83" data-end="935.82">that you're actually using the same</span> <span data-start="935.82" data-end="938.1">exact

other way</span> <span data-start="941.58" data-end="942.72">you're talking to the webview part which</span> <span data-start="942.72" data-end="945.63">is you know web technologies the way</span> <span data-start="945.63" data-end="948.72">that looks like is I try to make it a</span> <span data-start="948.72" data-end="950.43">little bit clearer by providing a code</span> <span data-start="950.43" data-end="952.47">example so the top one here is talking</span> <span data-start="952.47" data-end="954.96">to native codes as you can see it uses</span> <span data-start="954.96" data-end="957.6">like a kind of familiar Dom type of like</span> <span data-start="957.6" data-end="959.88">look up get elements by tag name but in</span> <span data-start="959.88"

data-start="1006.62" data-end="1010.76">the webview part okay um without all</span> <span data-start="1010.76" data-end="1013.19">thriller do let's just run the tests so</span> <span data-start="1013.19" data-end="1014.09">what I'm going to do here is I'm going</span> <span data-start="1014.09" data-end="1021.5">to run the tests on iOS first bringing</span> <span data-start="1021.5" data-end="1024.35">up the simulator I dropped some delays</span> <span data-start="1024.35" data-end="1025.73">in there so a little execute a little</span> <span data-start="1025.73" data-end="1027.11">bit slower so we can actually see how it</span> <span data-start="1027.11" data-end="1031.13">you know does it's magic and like on the</span> <span data-start="1031.13" data-end="1033.14">side here's mocha as a test runner and</span> <span data-start="1033.14" data-end="1035.99">it will just do the BDD style interface</span> <span data-start="1035.99" data-end="1038.089">and you know show you what tests are</span> <span data-start="1038.089" data-end="1040.01">executing at the moment it gets a little</span> <span data-start="1040.01" data-end="1045.689">bit more exciting towards the end so</span> <span data-start="1045.699" data-end="1047.99">like the setup face is usually a little</span> <span data-start="1047.99" data-end="1051.38">bit slow so this one is really</span> <span data-start="1051.38" data-end="1052.79">interesting I'm like switching to the</span> <span data-start="1052.79" data-end="1053.78">native for you at the end and I'm</span> <span data-start="1053.78" data-end="1055.7">scrolling up I do a flick up which you</span> <span data-start="1055.7" data-end="1057.68">can't do through the web automation or</span> <span data-start="1057.68" data-end="1060.32">like the web context part of it so you</span> <span data-start="1060.32" data-end="1064.94">can see here so I mean this is this is</span> <span data-start="1064.94" data-end="1067.04">pretty cool stuff but it gets even</span> <span data-start="1067.04" data-end="1068.69">better because i'm using the same exact</span> <span data-start="1068.69" data-end="1070.31">code and run the same tests on android</span> <span data-start="1070.31" data-end="1071.99">without changing anything so you</span> <span data-start="1071.99" data-end="1074.15">basically can automate cross-platform</span> <span data-start="1074.15" data-end="1076.07">but you use the same exact test cases</span> <span data-start="1076.07" data-end="1077.9">like you don't have to implement like</span> <span data-start="1077.9" data-end="1082.39">very different code to like do the tests</span> <span data-start="1082.4" data-end="1084.72">here there wasn't like a dialog box like</span> <span data-start="1084.72" data-end="1085.95">a modal dialogue that i clicked it's</span> <span data-start="1085.95" data-end="1089.79">also a native you know api that gets</span> <span data-start="1089.79" data-end="1090.81">called and i'm going to show you the</span> <span data-start="1090.81" data-end="1092.25">code on how that works and how you can</span> <span data-start="1092.25" data-end="1094.41">switch in into the native context from</span> <span data-start="1094.41" data-end="1096.87">the webview context but before we do</span> <span data-start="1096.87" data-end="1098.19">that i'm going to kick off the android</span> <span data-start="1098.19" data-end="1100.95">test so you can see that it does the</span> <span data-start="1100.95" data-end="1104.91">same thing for android so this is the</span> <span data-start="1104.91" data-end="1109.47">android simulator emulator and hopefully</span> <span data-start="1109.47" data-end="1113.52">it'll bring up the app you can see it's</span> <span data-start="1113.52" data-end="1120.8">running and let's move it a little bit</span> <span data-start="1120.8" data-end="1123.18">on the right side you okay you can see</span> <span data-start="1123.18" data-end="1126.87">how it executes the tests so yeah that's</span> <span data-start="1126.87" data-end="1128.04">the excitement Zach saying it's a little</span> <span data-start="1128.04" data-end="1129.12">bit done in two like watch it all</span> <span data-start="1129.12" data-end="1132.36">happening because it takes a while let's</span> <span data-start="1132.36" data-end="1135.81">go back to the presentation so my test</span> <span data-start="1135.81" data-end="1137.13">implementation i kinda like you're going</span> <span data-start="1137.13" data-end="1138.12">to dive into a little bit of code here</span> <span data-start="1138.12" data-end="1140.49">it's based on it's all you know it's all</span> <span data-start="1140.49" data-end="1143.82">node it's JavaScript the bleeding edge</span> <span data-start="1143.82" data-end="1146.91">part here is that I'm using node 0 dots</span> <span data-start="1146.91" data-end="1149.76">point 11 that comes with like years 6</span> <span data-start="1149.76" data-end="1152.85">and harmony and i'm using a part of it</span> <span data-start="1152.85" data-end="1154.47">or like a part of the specification</span> <span data-start="1154.47" data-end="1157.74">which is generators test code is</span> <span data-start="1157.74" data-end="1159.72">fundamentally sync because you know user</span> <span data-start="1159.72" data-end="1161.55">interaction is you know i use i can only</span> <span data-start="1161.55" data-end="1163.2">do so much and it's usually like one</span> <span data-start="1163.2" data-end="1166.29">thing at a time so using callbacks as</span> <span data-start="1166.29" data-end="1168.09">much as I don't have a problem with call</span> <span data-start="1168.09" data-end="1170.16">bags like the code just grows to the</span> <span data-start="1170.16" data-end="1171.36">right unless you break it up in</span> <span data-start="1171.36" data-end="1173.94">functions but and it's not a square and</span> <span data-start="1173.94" data-end="1176.76">so my coworker Jonathan the he build a</span> <span data-start="1176.76" data-end="1181.11">library called monocle which is a port</span> <span data-start="1181.11" data-end="1183.15">from a Python equally on that basically</span> <span data-start="1183.15" data-end="1185.55">uses generators to make this API a</span> <span data-start="1185.55" data-end="1188.73">little bit nicer and like what it does</span> <span data-start="1188.73" data-end="1191.64">is like yield callbacks here as you can</span> <span data-start="1191.64" data-end="1193.98">see here and it will unwrap them and</span> <span data-start="1193.98" data-end="1196.89">return the value for you so up here</span> <span data-start="1196.89" data-end="1199.05">that's a better example it yields a</span> <span data-start="1199.05" data-end="1201.15">selector and it returns the value and</span> <span data-start="1201.15" data-end="1204.42">when you hit a yield note won't move on</span> <span data-start="1204.42" data-end="1206.34">it will like a like pause execution</span> <span data-start="1206.34" data-end="1209.1">right there and then later on when the</span> <span data-start="1209.1" data-end="1210.36">value comes back and returns the value</span> <span data-start="1210.36" data-end="1213.24">and keeps going so this is a very short</span> <span data-start="1213.24" data-end="1213.99">example but as</span> <span data-start="1213.99" data-end="1216.09">see it's all like nicely lined up and</span> <span data-start="1216.09" data-end="1218.429">it's from a from a test authoring point</span> <span data-start="1218.429" data-end="1220.41">of view it's just nice and read in my in</span> <span data-start="1220.41" data-end="1225.9">my opinion um all right let's look at</span> <span data-start="1225.9" data-end="1231.51">the code so um so I spent a lot of time</span> <span data-start="1231.51" data-end="1233.28">on actually like creating a nice API on</span> <span data-start="1233.28" data-end="1235.47">top of mocha and like that basically</span> <span data-start="1235.47" data-end="1237.63">takes care of like getting your app like</span> <span data-start="1237.63" data-end="1239.34">set up on the on the simulator which</span> <span data-start="1239.34" data-end="1240.96">mostly at me I'm dust but I kind of want</span> <span data-start="1240.96" data-end="1242.76">to abstract that away from the user like</span> <span data-start="1242.76" data-end="1244.29">from the from the developer and in that</span> <span data-start="1244.29" data-end="1246.48">sense so I created like a nice API where</span> <span data-start="1246.48" data-end="1248.76">you can basically just drop in like the</span> <span data-start="1248.76" data-end="1250.32">package name and the action name which</span> <span data-start="1250.32" data-end="1252.15">is you know some like stuff that you</span> <span data-start="1252.15" data-end="1254.85">need to specify when you create a code /</span> <span data-start="1254.85" data-end="1256.2">app it's always basically the same thing</span> <span data-start="1256.2" data-end="1258.03">but and then you can basically just</span> <span data-start="1258.03" data-end="1259.32">start coding tests you don't have to</span> <span data-start="1259.32" data-end="1261.809">worry about Android or iOS you set that</span> <span data-start="1261.809" data-end="1263.309">through environment variable that the</span> <span data-start="1263.309" data-end="1266.52">test runner picks up on so it's a BDD</span> <span data-start="1266.52" data-end="1268.95">style interface that i coded against and</span> <span data-start="1268.95" data-end="1270.3">as you can see here there's a describe</span> <span data-start="1270.3" data-end="1274.47">block and and I'm like basically calling</span> <span data-start="1274.47" data-end="1277.23">this before each method that will just</span> <span data-start="1277.23" data-end="1278.7">activate the webview and then I just</span> <span data-start="1278.7" data-end="1280.83">write my test code without going into</span> <span data-start="1280.83" data-end="1282.48">much detail here the thing that I wanted</span> <span data-start="1282.48" data-end="1283.559">to highlight is like this here is the</span> <span data-start="1283.559" data-end="1286.11">actual tests like the the yet statement</span> <span data-start="1286.11" data-end="1288.929">it's a yield it I just made me i shorten</span> <span data-start="1288.929" data-end="1292.53">it and it's basically just the sequence</span> <span data-start="1292.53" data-end="1294.059">of steps it's really easy to read i'm</span> <span data-start="1294.059" data-end="1295.98">using CSS selectors mostly to get hold</span> <span data-start="1295.98" data-end="1297.66">of elements and click on them and like</span> <span data-start="1297.66" data-end="1300.24">retried values and then use like acid in</span> <span data-start="1300.24" data-end="1301.8">this assertion framework to just make</span> <span data-start="1301.8" data-end="1303.54">sure that you know what i'm expecting is</span> <span data-start="1303.54" data-end="1306.27">actually happening what's really</span> <span data-start="1306.27" data-end="1307.98">interesting here is that that part down</span> <span data-start="1307.98" data-end="1311.01">here I built this method like this</span> <span data-start="1311.01" data-end="1312.929">function it's actually a generator but</span> <span data-start="1312.929" data-end="1315.15">it's wrapped in a in a in a function</span> <span data-start="1315.15" data-end="1316.8">that is called native sequence and then</span> <span data-start="1316.8" data-end="1318.63">let's see whatever you put in there will</span> <span data-start="1318.63" data-end="1320.97">x will be executed in the native context</span> <span data-start="1320.97" data-end="1324.24">and not in the webview context so the</span> <span data-start="1324.24" data-end="1325.92">interesting thing is I'm dismissing a</span> <span data-start="1325.92" data-end="1328.11">modal dialogue here and as you can see</span> <span data-start="1328.11" data-end="1329.88">up here this is the the function</span> <span data-start="1329.88" data-end="1332.55">definition will actually generator this</span> <span data-start="1332.55" data-end="1334.47">is obviously different because iOS and</span> </p>
