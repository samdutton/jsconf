<p><span data-start="18.85" data-end="21.05">I'm gonna talk about optimizing for</span> <span data-start="21.05" data-end="22.64">developer delight I am NOT going to talk</span> <span data-start="22.64" data-end="23.96">about there's no right answer because</span> <span data-start="23.96" data-end="25.97">Pete and Andrew kinda already did that</span> <span data-start="25.97" data-end="29.75">justice earlier today and I just worked</span> <span data-start="29.75" data-end="31.369">on that talk for a month and it wasn't</span> <span data-start="31.369" data-end="32.92">going anywhere so I wrote this instead</span> <span data-start="32.92" data-end="36.26">these days i work at bazaarvoice i'm a</span> <span data-start="36.26" data-end="37.64">senior software engineer at bazaarvoice</span> <span data-start="37.64" data-end="40.19">where alex is working for another little</span> <span data-start="40.19" data-end="43.37">bit so i said the whole currently thing</span> <span data-start="43.37" data-end="46.01">and i work on the client-side framework</span> <span data-start="46.01" data-end="49.1">that powers the ratings and reviews and</span> <span data-start="49.1" data-end="51.65">lots of other applications of our core</span> <span data-start="51.65" data-end="53.68">application is a ratings and reviews</span> <span data-start="53.68" data-end="56.239">third-party javascript widget so if you</span> <span data-start="56.239" data-end="60.11">are big retailer then and you want to</span> <span data-start="60.11" data-end="63.35">have reviews on your site then you might</span> <span data-start="63.35" data-end="65.059">use the Bazaarvoice ratings and reviews</span> <span data-start="65.059" data-end="67.46">product in order to get reviews on your</span> <span data-start="67.46" data-end="68.78">site without you having to write all</span> <span data-start="68.78" data-end="71.72">that code yourself and i'm working on</span> <span data-start="71.72" data-end="74.18">the framework that underlies the new</span> <span data-start="74.18" data-end="78.229">version of this system of the software</span> <span data-start="78.229" data-end="80.81">and there's a huge motivation to get our</span> <span data-start="80.81" data-end="83.42">customers switched over to this new</span> <span data-start="83.42" data-end="86.659">version the legacy version long story</span> <span data-start="86.659" data-end="88.67">short kind of requires a lot more effort</span> <span data-start="88.67" data-end="92.45">on our part I could talk about that and</span> <span data-start="92.45" data-end="95.689">the 4000 XML tag options that you can</span> <span data-start="95.689" data-end="98.18">set in the old version but it won't of</span> <span data-start="98.18" data-end="99.71">its didja law or effort that goes into</span> <span data-start="99.71" data-end="102.56">configuring the old legacy version of</span> <span data-start="102.56" data-end="104.539">the software and the new version of the</span> <span data-start="104.539" data-end="107.24">software is configurable by the client</span> <span data-start="107.24" data-end="109.429">rather than by us and so long story</span> <span data-start="109.429" data-end="112.219">short we want clients on it because that</span> <span data-start="112.219" data-end="114.56">means less work for the same amount of</span> <span data-start="114.56" data-end="116.899">money that's pretty cool so of course</span> <span data-start="116.899" data-end="118.429">customers don't want to switch to the</span> <span data-start="118.429" data-end="120.799">new version of the software until the</span> <span data-start="120.799" data-end="122.869">new version has all the same features as</span> <span data-start="122.869" data-end="125.24">the old version has and you know word</span> <span data-start="125.24" data-end="126.74">we're negotiating on some of that but</span> <span data-start="126.74" data-end="128.119">they're still our features that we need</span> <span data-start="128.119" data-end="131.06">to build out because they existed in the</span> <span data-start="131.06" data-end="132.95">old software they were important to</span> <span data-start="132.95" data-end="135.23">clients in the old software and before</span> <span data-start="135.23" data-end="136.16">they're willing to sign on the dotted</span> <span data-start="136.16" data-end="138.319">line to switch over the new version they</span> <span data-start="138.319" data-end="140.21">need those features there and said</span> <span data-start="140.21" data-end="145.18">bottom line the easier I can make it for</span> <span data-start="145.18" data-end="148.37">developers to create new features on top</span> <span data-start="148.37" data-end="151.01">of this framework in the new system the</span> <span data-start="151.01" data-end="151.94">easier I can make it</span> <span data-start="151.94" data-end="153.8">them to do that the more money we make</span> <span data-start="153.8" data-end="156.2">faster so that's kind of the point of</span> <span data-start="156.2" data-end="158.06">this talk today and to give you a sense</span> <span data-start="158.06" data-end="160.13">of scale of the framework and the</span> <span data-start="160.13" data-end="162.71">application we're talking about kind of</span> <span data-start="162.71" data-end="165.32">about twenty five thousand lines of code</span> <span data-start="165.32" data-end="167.6">for the core application and framework</span> <span data-start="167.6" data-end="171.26">another 10,000 or so lines of tests unit</span> <span data-start="171.26" data-end="173.24">tests and functional tests and if you</span> <span data-start="173.24" data-end="174.74">throw in all the vendor libraries and</span> <span data-start="174.74" data-end="176.75">templates and tooling the development</span> <span data-start="176.75" data-end="179.15">server and all these other pieces then</span> <span data-start="179.15" data-end="180.56">you get up to about ninety thousand</span> <span data-start="180.56" data-end="183.35">lines of code so this isn't enormous</span> <span data-start="183.35" data-end="187.73">like this is not gmail but it's big it's</span> <span data-start="187.73" data-end="189.56">probably the biggest application that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="189.56" data-end="191.9">I've had the opportunity to work on so</span> <span data-start="191.9" data-end="193.7">it's big enough and there are some</span> <span data-start="193.7" data-end="197.54">issues that arise when you have a piece</span> <span data-start="197.54" data-end="199.97">of software that's this big being worked</span> <span data-start="199.97" data-end="202.64">on this by this many developers and</span> <span data-start="202.64" data-end="204.83">being worked on by developers of</span> <span data-start="204.83" data-end="206.63">different JavaScript skill levels</span> <span data-start="206.63" data-end="208.16">everyone is our voice is really smart</span> <span data-start="208.16" data-end="210.29">but some of them came from Java some of</span> <span data-start="210.29" data-end="212.27">them came from Python some of them came</span> <span data-start="212.27" data-end="214.04">from who knows where I like to make fun</span> <span data-start="214.04" data-end="215.33">of the job of people but they're still</span> <span data-start="215.33" data-end="218.959">nice to me so I appreciate that and and</span> <span data-start="218.959" data-end="220.55">so a whole bunch of different people a</span> <span data-start="220.55" data-end="221.42">whole bunch of different JavaScript</span> <span data-start="221.42" data-end="223.85">skill levels and of course also doing</span> <span data-start="223.85" data-end="225.56">this all under the pressure of deadlines</span> <span data-start="225.56" data-end="228.62">and we had a particularly large deadline</span> <span data-start="228.62" data-end="229.94">before I started working there in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="229.94" data-end="232.22">November and I sort of come here in</span> <span data-start="232.22" data-end="233.66">February the deadline was in November</span> <span data-start="233.66" data-end="236.709">and a whole lot of stuff happened that</span> <span data-start="236.709" data-end="238.94">some people may not be particularly</span> <span data-start="238.94" data-end="241.01">proud of in hindsight but we've all been</span> <span data-start="241.01" data-end="242.78">there too so I want to make clear that</span> <span data-start="242.78" data-end="244.64">none of this talk is like oh those dumb</span> <span data-start="244.64" data-end="246.59">people are our voice I had to go fix all</span> <span data-start="246.59" data-end="249.47">their no um they wrote good code</span> <span data-start="249.47" data-end="250.76">but they did a lot they did a lot of</span> <span data-start="250.76" data-end="253.57">this under pressure and so decent site</span> <span data-start="253.57" data-end="256.22">decent-sized code bases with lots of</span> <span data-start="256.22" data-end="258.019">developers working on them are</span> <span data-start="258.019" data-end="260.03">definitely interesting creatures because</span> <span data-start="260.03" data-end="261.44">even if you have a whole bunch of really</span> <span data-start="261.44" data-end="263.9">smart people working on them you still</span> <span data-start="263.9" data-end="266.24">can end up with people making decisions</span> <span data-start="266.24" data-end="268.88">that are in the interest of the feature</span> <span data-start="268.88" data-end="271.31">that they're working on today and not</span> <span data-start="271.31" data-end="275.18">making decisions based on the interests</span> <span data-start="275.18" data-end="276.89">of the code base as a whole or the</span> <span data-start="276.89" data-end="278.06">developer who's going to be working on</span> <span data-start="278.06" data-end="280.52">another feature tomorrow or next week or</span> <span data-start="280.52" data-end="283.49">next month and so even really smart</span> <span data-start="283.49" data-end="284.52">people can may</span> <span data-start="284.52" data-end="288.96">decisions that are good in the narrow</span> <span data-start="288.96" data-end="291.69">case but cause problems down the road</span> <span data-start="291.69" data-end="293.97">for other people and so what I want to</span> <span data-start="293.97" data-end="295.409">talk about today is this idea of</span> <span data-start="295.409" data-end="297.3">developer delight which is probably</span> <span data-start="297.3" data-end="299.55">overstating it a little bit I don't know</span> <span data-start="299.55" data-end="301.47">that anyways like yay I get to work with</span> <span data-start="301.47" data-end="304.11">this code I am I'm pretty excited about</span> <span data-start="304.11" data-end="305.4">working with this code but I might be</span> <span data-start="305.4" data-end="308.669">weird so developer delight developer</span> <span data-start="308.669" data-end="310.83">happiness there are lots of things that</span> <span data-start="310.83" data-end="315.87">make us happy money is one and time off</span> <span data-start="315.87" data-end="317.13">and you know there's lots of things that</span> <span data-start="317.13" data-end="318.3">are out of my control that make</span> <span data-start="318.3" data-end="320.46">developers happy but the things that are</span> <span data-start="320.46" data-end="323.52">in my control in this code base and in</span> <span data-start="323.52" data-end="326.039">this job number one getting a clear path</span> <span data-start="326.039" data-end="328.319">for getting people up to speed that was</span> <span data-start="328.319" data-end="329.759">one of the first things that I focused</span> <span data-start="329.759" data-end="331.919">on when i started at bazaarvoice was i</span> <span data-start="331.919" data-end="334.229">don't know where to start how do i make</span> <span data-start="334.229" data-end="336.509">this easier for the next person how do i</span> <span data-start="336.509" data-end="338.569">make it so that Alex doesn't that the</span> <span data-start="338.569" data-end="341.219">onboarding process isn't alex sitting in</span> <span data-start="341.219" data-end="342.81">our room with me for three hours</span> <span data-start="342.81" data-end="344.46">explaining everything that i need to</span> <span data-start="344.46" data-end="346.409">know how do we make the onboarding</span> <span data-start="346.409" data-end="349.37">process for this framework more more</span> <span data-start="349.37" data-end="353.639">automated more more self-serve kind of</span> <span data-start="353.639" data-end="355.199">thing number two how do we make sure</span> <span data-start="355.199" data-end="358.74">that we don't need all senior software</span> <span data-start="358.74" data-end="361.05">engineers working on developing features</span> <span data-start="361.05" data-end="363.09">because you there's probably a lot of</span> <span data-start="363.09" data-end="364.8">senior senior software engineers in this</span> <span data-start="364.8" data-end="366.99">room you know how many recruiting emails</span> <span data-start="366.99" data-end="368.759">you're getting there aren't enough of us</span> <span data-start="368.759" data-end="371.13">we can't that can't be our answer is Oh</span> <span data-start="371.13" data-end="373.08">we'll just find isn't matter we're</span> <span data-start="373.08" data-end="375.889">willing to pay we can't find them and</span> <span data-start="375.889" data-end="377.969">number three we want to make sure there</span> <span data-start="377.969" data-end="380.099">is few surprises as possible we want the</span> <span data-start="380.099" data-end="382.62">it just works we don't want there to be</span> <span data-start="382.62" data-end="385.409">any well I tried this nut didn't work</span> <span data-start="385.409" data-end="387.599">and then I put this variable here and or</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="387.599" data-end="388.949">I put this argument here and then</span> <span data-start="388.949" data-end="390.24">suddenly it worked so i'm just going to</span> <span data-start="390.24" data-end="392.43">commit that move on wait a lot of that</span> <span data-start="392.43" data-end="393.99">and we're trying to get away from that</span> <span data-start="393.99" data-end="396.029">we want to isolate complexity so you</span> <span data-start="396.029" data-end="398.19">don't have to understand the crazy</span> <span data-start="398.19" data-end="400.199">mechanisms that we use in order to do</span> <span data-start="400.199" data-end="403.169">our event binding which is a whole other</span> <span data-start="403.169" data-end="405.24">talk that andrew de pont could give</span> <span data-start="405.24" data-end="406.409">because he wrote all that for us</span> <span data-start="406.409" data-end="408.24">recently we don't want to have you</span> <span data-start="408.24" data-end="409.529">wouldn't want developers to have to</span> <span data-start="409.529" data-end="411.24">understand the complex purchase the</span> <span data-start="411.24" data-end="412.919">framework we want to make it really easy</span> <span data-start="412.919" data-end="416.07">so they can develop features we want the</span> <span data-start="416.07" data-end="417.48">development process to be</span> <span data-start="417.48" data-end="419.73">is seamless and for them to have the</span> <span data-start="419.73" data-end="421.14">information that they need they don't we</span> <span data-start="421.14" data-end="422.25">don't want them to have to go digging</span> <span data-start="422.25" data-end="424.65">for it and finally nothing should be</span> <span data-start="424.65" data-end="427.56">more difficult than it should be you</span> <span data-start="427.56" data-end="430.44">know we can't make everything easy but</span> <span data-start="430.44" data-end="432.36">we can make it so that nothing is harder</span> <span data-start="432.36" data-end="435.15">than it needs to be and so those are</span> <span data-start="435.15" data-end="438.21">kind of the goals that I set out for</span> <span data-start="438.21" data-end="439.92">myself when I joined in February my job</span> <span data-start="439.92" data-end="442.11">like I said or maybe I didn't save my</span> <span data-start="442.11" data-end="443.73">job when I joined was not to develop</span> <span data-start="443.73" data-end="446.22">features not to fix bugs but was to</span> <span data-start="446.22" data-end="448.71">focus on making this a better experience</span> <span data-start="448.71" data-end="450.21">for people and that's what I want to</span> <span data-start="450.21" data-end="451.5">talk about today is kind of what I've</span> <span data-start="451.5" data-end="454.02">done and things that I think are</span> <span data-start="454.02" data-end="456.03">generally applicable not just to our</span> <span data-start="456.03" data-end="457.77">code base that we're working on but to</span> <span data-start="457.77" data-end="460.89">any large project that has a number of</span> <span data-start="460.89" data-end="462.51">developers of different skill levels</span> <span data-start="462.51" data-end="465.03">working on it and deadlines like the</span> <span data-start="465.03" data-end="466.29">deadline part kind of goes without</span> <span data-start="466.29" data-end="468.15">saying there's always pressure there's</span> <span data-start="468.15" data-end="470.43">always deadlines so that's why I want to</span> <span data-start="470.43" data-end="471.6">talk about some of the things that I'm</span> <span data-start="471.6" data-end="474.45">going to talk about are so simple that</span> <span data-start="474.45" data-end="476.55">you might not think to do them because</span> <span data-start="476.55" data-end="478.35">they're so easy and some of them are a</span> <span data-start="478.35" data-end="480.75">little bit more complex so i just gotta</span> <span data-start="480.75" data-end="483.45">you know 22 minutes left so let's dive</span> <span data-start="483.45" data-end="488.58">in and one of the simplest things that</span> <span data-start="488.58" data-end="492.3">we did was to add assertions to the</span> <span data-start="492.3" data-end="497.28">framework so simply to say i expect this</span> <span

<span data-start="624.07" data-end="626.92">going on is a huge win when I showed up</span> <span data-start="626.92" data-end="629.68">this is what I saw in the console when</span> <span

data-end="673.72">if you if you want to find out what was</span> <span data-start="673.72" data-end="676.9">going on then it was up to you to put</span> <span data-start="676.9" data-end="678.91">those logs in to take them out and then</span> <span data-start="678.91" data-end="680.52">the next developer who came around with</span> <span data-start="680.52" data-end="681.84">we gonna put it in exactly those same</span> <span data-start="681.84" data-end="684.54">hugs to figure out was going on and then</span> <span data-start="684.54" data-end="686.1">have to take them out and it's</span> <span data-start="686.1" data-end="687.75">especially hard to understand what's</span> <span data-start="687.75" data-end="688.8">going on when you're dealing with an</span> <span data-start="688.8" data-end="690.36">asynchronous system where things are</span> <span data-start="690.36" data-end="693.78">happening later and you know there isn't</span> <span data-start="693.78" data-end="696.44">just a clear procedural chain of events</span> <span data-start="696.44" data-end="699.42">so we added lifecycle logging and</span> <span data-start="699.42" data-end="701.01">especially probably the most exciting</span> <span data-start="701.01" data-end="703.02">thing is these groups that we added</span> <span data-start="703.02" data-end="706.35">chrome devtools has console group and</span> <span data-start="706.35" data-end="708.99">console group end I other devtools may</span> <span data-start="708.99" data-end="711.42">have it as well we wrote this so that if</span> <span data-start="711.42" data-end="713.01">it doesn't find console group and</span> <span data-start="713.01" data-end="714.42">console group end then I'll just fall</span> <span data-start="714.42" data-end="716.82">back to normal console.log but what this</span> <span data-start="716.82" data-end="720.09">gives us is a nested view of everything</span> <span data-start="720.09" data-end="721.71">that's happening and so when we're</span> <span data-start="721.71" data-end="724.29">building this really complex view</span> <span data-start="724.29" data-end="727.71">hierarchy we can see exactly how that</span> <span data-start="727.71" data-end="729.21">happens and we're build it and you</span> <span data-start="729.21" data-end="731.64">anything that happens kind of in groups</span> <span data-start="731.64" data-end="734.25">we can see when that starts and when</span> <span data-start="734.25" data-end="737.67">that ends and so now when you are trying</span> <span data-start="737.67" data-end="738.96">to figure out where something's going</span> <span data-start="738.96" data-end="741.71">wrong you can put in one console log and</span> <span data-start="741.71" data-end="744.66">you can see exactly where that's</span> <span data-start="744.66" data-end="746.45">happening in the whole chain of events</span> <span data-start="746.45" data-end="749.01">and we also set up different log levels</span> <span data-start="749.01" data-end="750.84">so that if you don't want to see this</span> <span data-start="750.84" data-end="752.39">much detail this is actually an</span> <span data-start="752.39" data-end="755.85">abnormally high level of detail if you</span> <span data-start="755.85" data-end="757.05">don't want to see this much detail you</span> <span data-start="757.05" data-end="759.54">don't have to and so in a more normal</span> <span data-start="759.54" data-end="761.91">log level you would see more basic and</span> <span data-start="761.91" data-end="764.73">important information and again this is</span> <span data-start="764.73" data-end="766.71">really great for newcomers because when</span> <span data-start="766.71" data-end="768.21">they press when they get that server</span> <span data-start="768.21" data-end="769.8">running for the first time and see the</span> <span data-start="769.8" data-end="771.24">application running for the first time</span> <span data-start="771.24" data-end="775.5">they can see exactly what's happening be</span> <span data-start="775.5" data-end="777.09">like huh let me go look at that code</span> <span data-start="777.09" data-end="779.31">that does that it's also great for</span> <span data-start="779.31" data-end="781.95">debugging because as someone who knows</span> <span data-start="781.95" data-end="784.08">the framework you kind of learn what you</span> <span data-start="784.08" data-end="786.54">learn what this flow looks like you put</span> <span data-start="786.54" data-end="788.16">in your log message and you immediately</span> <span data-start="788.16" data-end="792.75">know where or something broke liga Tory</span> <span data-start="792.75" data-end="797.63">sniffle this one's a bit more complex</span> <span data-start="797.63" data-end="802.11">it's kind of a hard concept to explain</span> <span data-start="802.11" data-end="804.33">its kind of the more you do this the</span> <span data-start="804.33" data-end="806.72">more you know what this means that</span> <span data-start="806.72" data-end="809.22">eliminating temptation again you've got</span> <span data-start="809.22" data-end="811.68">lots of different developers possibly of</span> <span data-start="811.68" data-end="814.14">different skill levels working against a</span> <span data-start="814.14" data-end="816.42">deadline you want to eliminate</span> <span data-start="816.42" data-end="818.43">opportunities for them to make bad</span> <span data-start="818.43" data-end="821.73">decisions now in our case there are</span> <span data-start="821.73" data-end="822.87">probably lots of different kinds of</span> <span data-start="822.87" data-end="824.43">temptations but in our case our</span> <span data-start="824.43" data-end="828.36">particular temptation was a global it</span> <span data-start="828.36" data-end="830.37">was this you know we use AMD so there</span> <span data-start="830.37" data-end="832.709">aren't really any Global's well there</span> <span data-start="832.709" data-end="834.87">are but that's a whole thing there</span> <span data-start="834.87" data-end="836.19">aren't really any Global's but we had</span> <span data-start="836.19" data-end="840.06">this thing called env capital to make</span> <span data-start="840.06" data-end="841.38">you know that it was really important</span> <span data-start="841.38" data-end="845.01">and it was a dependency in just about</span> <span data-start="845.01" data-end="848.43">every single file in the entire code</span> <span data-start="848.43" data-end="850.32">base some files didn't actually use it</span> <span data-start="850.32" data-end="851.94">we actually we have scaffolding a</span> <span data-start="851.94" data-end="853.589">scaffolding tool like when you need a</span> <span data-start="853.589" data-end="854.61">new feature when you want to make a new</span> <span data-start="854.61" data-end="856.56">feature you see me a new feature and it</span> <span data-start="856.56" data-end="858.029">would automatically just be like you're</span> <span data-start="858.029" data-end="859.709">probably going to need env so I'm just</span> <span data-start="859.709" data-end="862.26">going to put it there for you it turns</span> <span data-start="862.26" data-end="863.7">out that this is really a bad idea</span> <span data-start="863.7" data-end="867.959">because if you give this global to</span> <span data-start="867.959" data-end="870.779">people they will find all kinds of ways</span> <span data-start="870.779" data-end="874.529">to take advantage of it in a really bad</span> <span data-start="874.529" data-end="876.42">way and so the next thing you know the</span> <span data-start="876.42" data-end="878.279">solution become this is this global kind</span> <span data-start="878.279" data-end="879.69">of becomes the solution for everything</span> <span data-start="879.69" data-end="884.399">so it was a global event bus for us okay</span> <span data-start="884.399" data-end="886.38">it was an error aggregator so whenever</span> <span data-start="886.38" data-end="887.64">there was an error we would fire another</span> <span data-start="887.64" data-end="889.529">event and that did something else we'd</span> <span data-start="889.529" data-end="892.29">send the error along to it was also how</span> <span data-start="892.29" data-end="893.88">we pass through analytics stuff that was</span> <span data-start="893.88" data-end="897.27">going on yeah cool um anything that we</span> <span data-start="897.27" data-end="898.35">couldn't figure out a better place to</span> <span data-start="898.35" data-end="900.72">put it and be seems like a good place</span> <span data-start="900.72" data-end="903.899">for it it was also this magical third</span> <span data-start="903.899" data-end="907.89">argument to on trigger set and get and I</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="907.89" data-end="910.5">I don't know that there's any what I can</span> <span data-start="910.5" data-end="912.899">tell you now what that did but when I</span> <span data-start="912.899" data-end="914.43">showed up I don't know if there's anyone</span> <span data-start="914.43" data-end="916.86">who could like any single person who</span> <span data-start="916.86" data-end="919.56">could tell you exactly what that did of</span> <span data-start="919.56" data-end="920.579">course there were no test for it either</span> <span data-start="920.579" data-end="923.97">so so we one of the things that I did I</span> <span data-start="923.97" data-end="926.279">saw this envy is just like the scourge</span> <span data-start="926.279" data-end="929.39">on the code base and I spent months</span> <span data-start="929.39" data-end="931.22">I finally got rid of almost all of the</span> <span data-start="931.22" data-end="935.21">env s just last week I spent months the</span> <span data-start="935.21" data-end="937.76">last few months trying to eliminate this</span> <span data-start="937.76" data-end="939.74">from the code base and so maybe you</span> <span data-start="939.74" data-end="942.38">implement things via a global but that</span> <span data-start="942.38" data-end="943.58">doesn't mean you need to expose the</span> <span data-start="943.58" data-end="947.75">global to every single every single</span> <span data-start="947.75" data-end="950.36">module every single piece of code so now</span> <span data-start="950.36" data-end="952.61">instead of saying envy trigger show</span> <span data-start="952.61" data-end="955.07">loading we have a loading overlay object</span> <span data-start="955.07" data-end="958.55">that we say hey show yourself now and it</span> <span data-start="958.55" data-end="961.43">may be implemented through envy trigger</span> <span data-start="961.43" data-end="963.05">show loading maybe it doesn't I don't</span> <span data-start="963.05" data-end="965.66">remember doesn't matter to that</span> <span data-start="965.66" data-end="968.81">temptation of env isn't there anymore we</span> <span data-start="968.81" data-end="972.17">create a BD tracker object that has an</span> <span data-start="972.17" data-end="974.03">error method and a conversion method a</span> <span data-start="974.03" data-end="975.32">bunch of other things so any time that</span> <span data-start="975.32" data-end="976.94">we want to track that something has</span> <span data-start="976.94" data-end="979.91">happened we now do that in the code</span> <span data-start="979.91" data-end="983.66">through BB tracker we eliminated the</span> <span data-start="983.66" data-end="986.09">magical envy arc which is a whole long</span> <span data-start="986.09" data-end="989.39">story basically it was a weird pub</span> <span data-start="989.39" data-end="991.73">subsystem and so we said hey let's make</span> <span data-start="991.73" data-end="993.71">methods called publish and subscribe and</span> <span data-start="993.71" data-end="996.68">they achieve that same thing but hide</span> <span data-start="996.68" data-end="997.88">the fact that they're doing it they're</span> <span data-start="997.88" data-end="1000.28">not doing it through env anymore but</span> <span data-start="1000.28" data-end="1001.9">even when they were doing it through env</span> <span data-start="1001.9" data-end="1003.91">they hid that inside of the methods so</span> <span data-start="1003.91" data-end="1006.22">that developers weren't kind of having</span> <span data-start="1006.22" data-end="1009.43">to figure out what this magical env as</span> <span data-start="1009.43" data-end="1012.19">the last argument meant or what it did</span> <span data-start="1012.19" data-end="1014.11">we gave them a method that was what it</span> <span data-start="1014.11" data-end="1020.08">did and you one isolated that complexity</span> <span data-start="1020.08" data-end="1022.9">and to eliminate that temptation of oh</span> <span data-start="1022.9" data-end="1026.16">and these here let me just use it</span> <span data-start="1026.16" data-end="1031">another thing that we did was to another</span> <span data-start="1031" data-end="1033.43">kind of rule that I'm trying to enforce</span> <span data-start="1033.43" data-end="1035.5">on the code base is this idea of having</span> <span data-start="1035.5" data-end="1039.22">code for every concept and so if there's</span> <span data-start="1039.22" data-end="1042.82">a concept that you talked about that you</span> <span data-start="1042.82" data-end="1044.829">use when you describe how your</span> <span data-start="1044.829" data-end="1047.05">application works to another developer</span> <span data-start="1047.05" data-end="1049.81">they ought to be able to go in the code</span> <span data-start="1049.81" data-end="1054.49">and see the code for that concept and so</span> <span data-start="1054.49" data-end="1056.47">we saw this just a second ago with BB</span> <span data-start="1056.47" data-end="1058.09">tracker where we have this concept of</span> <span data-start="1058.09" data-end="1060.04">tracking when a user does something and</span> <span data-start="1060.04" data-end="1061">tracking when there's an</span> <span data-start="1061" data-end="1063.37">her and so before there was no one place</span> <span data-start="1063.37" data-end="1064.66">where they could go and see all the</span> <span data-start="1064.66" data-end="1066.13">different things that we could track and</span> <span data-start="1066.13" data-end="1067.48">how we track them and what the signature</span> <span data-start="1067.48" data-end="1069.52">was to do it and all that now we have</span> <span data-start="1069.52" data-end="1072.34">this BB tracker object which is where a</span> <span data-start="1072.34" data-end="1074.38">developer can go and learn about this</span> <span data-start="1074.38" data-end="1076.54">and now there are tests so we know that</span> <span data-start="1076.54" data-end="1079.36">it works and so having a code for this</span> <span data-start="1079.36" data-end="1082.21">concept of tracking makes it easier to</span> <span data-start="1082.21" data-end="1084.1">understand and makes it so you don't</span> <span data-start="1084.1" data-end="1085.69">need to know so much about how it works</span> <span data-start="1085.69" data-end="1089.62">under the hood in our application we use</span> <span data-start="1089.62" data-end="1091.81">these configurable components so this is</span> <span data-start="1091.81" data-end="1094.51">an example of a portion of a component</span> <span data-start="1094.51" data-end="1097.84">configuration for a review content list</span> <span data-start="1097.84" data-end="1102.67">and in when I showed up we had we were</span> <span data-start="1102.67" data-end="1107.17">passing around these raw objects so when</span> <span data-start="1107.17" data-end="1110.74">we needed to you know initialize a view</span> <span data-start="1110.74" data-end="1114.82">for a component we had this in it object</span> <span data-start="1114.82" data-end="1117.97">that had an annuity vez raw component</span> <span data-start="1117.97" data-end="1121.06">object and use that to initialize the</span> <span data-start="1121.06" data-end="1122.74">view of course we stored all these are</span> <span data-start="1122.74" data-end="1127.33">all component objects on env shocker and</span> <span data-start="1127.33" data-end="1130.84">and so we when I should have not want to</span> <span data-start="1130.84" data-end="1133.03">know like what is a component like what</span> <span data-start="1133.03" data-end="1134.89">does that mean how do we use them how do</span> <span data-start="1134.89" data-end="1137.62">they is this a component or is this like</span> <span data-start="1137.62" data-end="1139.69">part of a component I don't understand I</span> <span data-start="1139.69" data-end="1143.17">was really really confused and we were</span> <span data-start="1143.17" data-end="1145.3">using this term all the time to talk</span> <span data-start="1145.3" data-end="1147.31">about how our application worked you</span> <span data-start="1147.31" data-end="1148.39">know the Alex would say we have</span> <span data-start="1148.39" data-end="1149.8">components and they have features that</span> <span data-start="1149.8" data-end="1152.14">but I couldn't go into the code and see</span> <span data-start="1152.14" data-end="1153.79">what the heck of component was I just</span> <span data-start="1153.79" data-end="1155.76">saw these objects being passed around</span> <span data-start="1155.76" data-end="1158.74">and then and at but they there was no</span> <span data-start="1158.74" data-end="1162.76">thing that was a component and so a huge</span> <span data-start="1162.76" data-end="1164.08">part of the time that I've spent is</span> <span data-start="1164.08" data-end="1166.36">actually making this component be a</span> <span data-start="1166.36" data-end="1169.96">thing be a documented thing be a tested</span> <span data-start="1169.96" data-end="1171.94">thing so that now when you're a new</span> <span data-start="1171.94" data-end="1173.47">developer you can go see when we're</span> <span data-start="1173.47" data-end="1174.94">talking about components you can go see</span> <span data-start="1174.94" data-end="1178.9">the code that is making that whole</span> <span data-start="1178.9" data-end="1181.12">system that is the underpinning of our</span> <span data-start="1181.12" data-end="1183.04">framework we can see the code that's</span> <span data-start="1183.04" data-end="1185.95">making that work and so now we iterate</span> <span data-start="1185.95" data-end="1188.35">over the array of component objects and</span> <span data-start="1188.35" data-end="1191.26">we make a new component and then we tell</span> <span data-start="1191.26" data-end="1193.29">the component to an it it's</span> <span data-start="1193.29" data-end="1195.51">you rather than having this view</span> <span data-start="1195.51" data-end="1197.85">function that might be totally separated</span> <span data-start="1197.85" data-end="1199.11">from something else that we do with</span> <span data-start="1199.11" data-end="1200.7">components now everything that we do</span> <span data-start="1200.7" data-end="1204.36">with components is a method on the</span> <span data-start="1204.36" data-end="1211.54">component class dirty words sorry</span> <span data-start="1211.55" data-end="1214.32">another thing that we've done that I</span> <span data-start="1214.32" data-end="1217.05">can't emphasize enough is to automate</span> <span data-start="1217.05" data-end="1219.66">everything no matter what this XKCD</span> <span data-start="1219.66" data-end="1221.67">comic says automate everything</span> <span data-start="1221.67" data-end="1223.26">especially when you're working with a</span> <span data-start="1223.26" data-end="1226.35">large team large code base with a bunch</span> <span data-start="1226.35" data-end="1230.93">of developers of different skills we are</span> <span data-start="1230.93" data-end="1232.86">most of the people in this room are</span> <span data-start="1232.86" data-end="1234.18">probably really good troubleshooters</span> <span data-start="1234.18" data-end="1235.83">you're probably really good at figuring</span> <span data-start="1235.83" data-end="1237.36">it when something doesn't work on the</span> <span data-start="1237.36" data-end="1239.67">command line you might be pretty good at</span> <span data-start="1239.67" data-end="1243.18">figuring out why that is people of all</span> <span data-start="1243.18" data-end="1245.4">different skills will have strengths in</span> <span data-start="1245.4" data-end="1248.16">some areas not in others and so the more</span> <span data-start="1248.16" data-end="1251.22">you can automate these wrote tasks the</span> <span data-start="1251.22" data-end="1253.32">better off you'll be so one thing that</span> <span data-start="1253.32" data-end="1255.87">we have is this internal tool I can't</span> <span data-start="1255.87" data-end="1258.81">emphasize enough make one of these make</span> <span data-start="1258.81" data-end="1261.63">an internal tool that you throw in a</span> <span data-start="1261.63"

data-end="1273.09">site using development code whatever so</span> <span data-start="1273.09" data-end="1274.14">we have this tool and the great thing</span> <span data-start="1274.14" data-end="1275.82">about having this tool that automates</span> <span data-start="1275.82" data-end="1278.28">these tasks that otherwise they would be</span> <span data-start="1278.28" data-end="1281.37">going into the new admin tool clicking</span> <span data-start="1281.37" data-end="1283.41">on this including the old process for</span> <span data-start="1283.41" data-end="1285">doing some of the things on this page</span> <span data-start="1285" data-end="1287.64">was like a lot of clicking and now</span> <span data-start="1287.64" data-end="1289.02">there's not so much clicking you just</span> <span data-start="1289.02" data-end="1290.79">type something in boom you have we need</span> <span data-start="1290.79" data-end="1293.28">on the page very developer focused</span> <span data-start="1293.28" data-end="1296.55">rather than end user focused or customer</span> <span data-start="1296.55" data-end="1298.92">focused or non technical person focused</span> <span data-start="1298.92" data-end="1300.6">like this is a developer focus tool is a</span> <span data-start="1300.6" data-end="1302.13">tool focused on making it easier for</span> <span data-start="1302.13" data-end="1305.01">developers to do their job and the great</span> <span data-start="1305.01" data-end="1306.48">thing is that once you have a tool like</span> <span data-start="1306.48" data-end="1309.03">this you won't think twice about adding</span> <span data-start="1309.03" data-end="1310.77">more things to it so once you go through</span> <span

data-end="1574.44">like you can measure attrition but</span> <span data-start="1574.44" data-end="1577.44">that's kind of a terrible way to find</span> <span data-start="1577.44" data-end="1580.05">out that you didn't do a good job it's</span> <span data-start="1580.05" data-end="1581.85">really hard to quantify the speed of</span> <span data-start="1581.85"

data-end="1645.9">that we're doing is keeping an eye I</span> <span data-start="1645.9" data-end="1648">have no idea what this little jag is at</span> <span data-start="1648" data-end="1649.05">the beginning I kinda need to figure</span> <span data-start="1649.05" data-end="1651.84">that out because that's bad but it's</span> <span data-start="1651.84" data-end="1653.28">going back down so that's good so you</span> <span data-start="1653.28" data-end="1656.25">can you can keep an eye on how your how</span> <span data-start="1656.25" data-end="1657.48">these changes are affecting the</span> <span data-start="1657.48" data-end="1659.49">performance of your code but probably</span> <span data-start="1659.49" data-end="1662.58">the best measurement I have of whether</span> <span

data-end="1690.33">about listening to people listening to</span> <span data-start="1690.33" data-end="1691.92">people when they say nice things and</span> <span data-start="1691.92" data-end="1693.179">listening to what they're complaining</span> <span data-start="1693.179" data-end="1695.61">about and going and fixing it and I</span> <span data-start="1695.61"
