the</span> <span data-start="590.17" data-end="592.45">one way is to use this in Fletcher's</span> <span data-start="592.45" data-end="597.94">library by ms and now is zoom oh yeah</span> <span

data-end="605.86">it works very well but it takes too long</span> <span data-start="605.86" data-end="609.67">time so it tooks for a 32 kilobyte</span> <span data-start="609.67" data-end="612.28">compressed data about 150 milliseconds</span> <span data-start="612.28" data-end="615.58">that's tested in the v8 and step that</span> <span data-start="615.58" data-end="622.24">that is tell me too long and yeah the</span> <span data-start="622.24" data-end="625.33">aromatic and go on implements its own</span> <span data-start="625.33" data-end="628.3">set

the other one</span> <span data-start="634.36" data-end="638.62">how how how yeah how Gordon did it is</span> <span data-start="638.62" data-end="641.5">could be really interesting because it's</span> <span data-start="641.5" data-end="646.83">yeah some kind of odd because I'm</span> <span data-start="646.83" data-end="649.45">imagine you have a set lip compressed</span> <span data-start="649.45" data-end="652.36">data string and you want to decompress</span> <span data-start="652.36" data-end="657.37">it in the browser so so what I did is I</span> <span data-start="657.37" data-end="661.99">remember that the PNG file format also</span> <span data-start="661.99" data-end="666.34">compress this image data and what I do</span> <span data-start="666.34" data-end="669.12">is
