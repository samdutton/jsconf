<p><span data-start="1.43" data-end="12.91">Hey!</span> <span data-start="12.91" data-end="31.07">So, change the title a little bit, Pimp up your workflow.</span> <span data-start="31.07" data-end="34.66">How do we get to understand how programs work?</span> <span data-start="34.66" data-end="44.1">One way is to read the code, top to bottom, read all the files.</span> <span data-start="44.1" data-end="45.42">Execute it in your head.</span> <span data-start="45.42" data-end="50.899">Keep the stack in mind.</span> <span data-start="50.899" data-end="54.86">Well, it might work for small projects.</span> <span data-start="54.86" data-end="62.739">When you have something big, it would take a while.</span> <span data-start="62.739" data-end="66.9">Say, imagine you have a project.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="66.9" data-end="69.54">With hundreds of files.</span> <span data-start="69.54" data-end="73.07">And hundred thousands of lines of Js code.</span> <span data-start="73.07" data-end="82.31">Are you going to read all of it before you start to work on a feature or fix a bug?</span> <span data-start="82.31" data-end="87.689">How do you start?</span> <span data-start="87.689" data-end="90.07">The project is so big.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="90.07" data-end="94.32">You don't know which file you would need.</span> <span data-start="94.32" data-end="103.92">One way of understanding how a program works is console statements everywhere.</span> <span data-start="103.92" data-end="110.7">So, you open, find some function.</span> <span data-start="110.7" data-end="113.92">Put some console .Log statements.</span> <span data-start="113.92" data-end="117.34">You open the browser.</span> <span data-start="117.34" data-end="120.11">See what is in the console.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="120.11" data-end="127.159">If it is not what you expect it, you do the same over again.</span> <span data-start="127.159" data-end="129.259">Another way is to use the debugger.</span> <span data-start="129.259" data-end="132.809">And insert breakpoints.</span> <span data-start="132.809" data-end="136.109">Breakpoints are great.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="136.109" data-end="143.39">Because you can insert them without the page.</span> <span data-start="143.39" data-end="147.73">You can disable them too.</span> <span data-start="147.73" data-end="152.19">But one problem with breakpoints is that they block.</span> <span data-start="152.19" data-end="155.169">Imagine you are debugging.</span> <span data-start="155.169" data-end="158.9">And you have 2 function competing.</span> <span data-start="158.9" data-end="163.669">When you step on a breakpoint it blocks the execution.</span> <span data-start="163.669" data-end="169.949">Breakpoints are not the best tool for that kind of task.</span> <span data-start="169.949" data-end="174.939">So, today I'm going to be showing a few other tools.</span> <span data-start="174.939" data-end="178.45">That I believe not so popular.</span> <span data-start="178.45" data-end="187.159">And I think they're great for understanding how programs run and how they work.</span> <span data-start="187.159" data-end="196.589">And they actually allow you to see actual states of the program.</span> <span data-start="196.589" data-end="202.599">So, the first one is lighttable.</span> <span data-start="202.599" data-end="208.359">One cool feature I like is inline Watchers.</span> <span data-start="208.359" data-end="215.76">When we read the code we don't really know what's inside the variable.</span> <span data-start="215.76" data-end="225.449">And lighttable allows to watch, to select some code and start watching it.</span> <span data-start="225.449" data-end="227.449">It will show the value in realtime.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="227.449" data-end="230.299">As the program ran.</span> <span data-start="230.299" data-end="236.369">So, I'm going to run some demo.</span> <span data-start="236.369" data-end="245.37">On the rightside there is a demo.</span> <span data-start="245.37" data-end="248.159">Processing library in Javascript.</span> <span data-start="248.159" data-end="249.719">On the leftside the code.</span> <span data-start="249.719" data-end="251.739">I see the variables but I don't know what it is.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="251.739" data-end="253.859">What is Other?</span> <span data-start="253.859" data-end="258.289">Is it a number?</span> <span data-start="258.289" data-end="260.47">Undefined on first click.</span> <span data-start="260.47" data-end="262.41">And some object on the second click.</span> <span data-start="262.41" data-end="268.87">You can see, Lighttable is updating in realtime.</span> <span data-start="268.87" data-end="276.73">Here is some velocity property.</span> <span data-start="276.73" data-end="277.73">I don't know what it is.</span> <span data-start="277.73" data-end="285.15">It is a vector.</span> <span data-start="285.15" data-end="293">And it updates in realtime as you play around in your code.</span> <span data-start="293" data-end="301.87">There is some drag property.</span> <span data-start="301.87" data-end="308.389">I don't know what it is.</span> <span data-start="308.389" data-end="320.93">So, what was it..</span> <span data-start="320.93" data-end="328.53">Watch expression.</span> <span data-start="328.53" data-end="333.03">Another cool tool is inline eval.</span> <span data-start="333.03" data-end="339.56">So, it works like this.</span> <span data-start="339.56" data-end="342.939">You select some code and press command enter.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="342.939" data-end="345.909">It should the last.</span> <span data-start="345.909" data-end="346.909">Right in the code.</span> <span data-start="346.909" data-end="348.78">Not in a console.</span> <span data-start="348.78" data-end="354.2">But right there.</span> <span data-start="354.2" data-end="364.37">So, those were 2 features of Lighttable that I really like.</span> <span data-start="364.37" data-end="369.63">If you don't use Lighttable, maybe you should check it out.</span> <span data-start="369.63" data-end="378.889">If you work on some tools, maybe you should implement some of those features in your favourite</span> <span data-start="378.889" data-end="381.719">tool.</span> <span data-start="381.719" data-end="390.659">Timeline is available in Chrome tools.</span> <span data-start="390.659" data-end="394.43">Firefox dev tools.</span> <span data-start="394.43" data-end="398.74">When people talk about Timeline they talk about profiling, measurements zhozer i'm going</span> <span data-start="398.74" data-end="402.159">to use it different.</span> <span data-start="402.159" data-end="403.159">So, here is a demo.</span> <span data-start="403.159" data-end="424.46">It is the same webpage.</span> <span data-start="424.46" data-end="427.759">To record the events.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="427.759" data-end="434.87">I want to know, I want to find the function responsible for mouse down events.</span> <span data-start="434.87" data-end="436.02">Or click.</span> <span data-start="436.02" data-end="437.02">I don't know where it is.</span> <span data-start="437.02" data-end="440.889">I don't know how many files I have.</span> <span data-start="440.889" data-end="443.979">I can see all the timers.</span> <span data-start="443.979" data-end="448.849">All the mouse events.</span> <span data-start="448.849" data-end="449.849">There are too many.</span> <span data-start="449.849" data-end="465.66">I filter down to mouse.</span> <span data-start="465.66" data-end="474.379">From there I can jump right to the function that was executed on mousedown.</span> <span data-start="474.379" data-end="480.469">I didn't read any code before that.</span> <span data-start="480.469" data-end="489.77">So, this is a good tool to give you an overview of how your program works.</span> <span data-start="489.77" data-end="495.349">When you see a program for the first time.</span> <span data-start="495.349" data-end="497.77">You don't know where to start.</span> <span data-start="497.77" data-end="504.49">You can play around and see what gets executed.</span> <span data-start="504.49" data-end="517.3">But, and from there you can jump to the files and functions that you want to edit.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="517.3" data-end="525.48">So, another tool is Adobe Brakets Theseus.</span> <span data-start="525.48" data-end="534.97">It is actually an extention to Adobe Braket.</span> <span data-start="534.97" data-end="537.62">Which is a..</span> <span data-start="537.62" data-end="548.37">I am going to play another demo.</span> <span data-start="548.37" data-end="559.22">I have a game.</span> <span data-start="559.22" data-end="577.63">It is just a webpage in Javascript.</span> <span data-start="577.63" data-end="586.38">And in the editor you can see there are 21 calls, 24 calls.</span> <span data-start="586.38" data-end="597.96">So, it is logging all the function calls that are happening on the webpage.</span> <span data-start="597.96" data-end="601.18">You can see what is running at this time.</span> <span data-start="601.18" data-end="603.44">You can see which functions are not used.</span> <span data-start="603.44" data-end="611.87">And which ones are used.</span> <span data-start="611.87" data-end="613.209">And you can narrow it down.</span> <span data-start="613.209" data-end="620.07">You can see all the function names and the arguments.</span> <span data-start="620.07" data-end="622.85">They are all there.</span> <span data-start="622.85" data-end="637.29">You don't need to insert hundreds of console.Logs.</span> <span data-start="637.29" data-end="644.18">From there you can see that from keyboard input manager all those callbacks were called.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="644.18" data-end="649.44">You can see call stack.</span> <span data-start="649.44" data-end="665.74">You can go up.</span> <span data-start="665.74" data-end="681.79">Okay.</span> <span data-start="681.79" data-end="687.18">That was adobe brakets theseus.</span> <span data-start="687.18" data-end="691.1">Another tool is in the webstore.</span> <span data-start="691.1" data-end="695.07">It is an ID.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="695.07" data-end="699.43">It has a feature Spyjs.</span> <span data-start="699.43" data-end="704.699">It is similar to Braket theseus.</span> <span data-start="704.699" data-end="713.23">But it has slightly different user interface.</span> <span data-start="713.23" data-end="734.209">I'm going to show you.</span> <span data-start="734.209" data-end="746.8">Where am I?</span> <span data-start="746.8" data-end="751">Hm..</span> <span data-start="751" data-end="759.399">Maybe not.</span> <span data-start="759.399" data-end="774.069">Maybe I'm not going to show you.</span> <span data-start="774.069" data-end="776.5">Okay.</span> <span data-start="776.5" data-end="781.37">Ignore that.</span> <span data-start="781.37" data-end="790.19">It logs all events on the left column.</span> <span data-start="790.19" data-end="806.759">I speed it up a little bit.</span> <span data-start="806.759" data-end="815.95">It highlights in light green background the pieces of code that ran.</span> <span data-start="815.95" data-end="818.33">There is a conditional here.</span> <span data-start="818.33" data-end="819.839">It didn't run.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="819.839" data-end="821.7">Because it doesn't have a background.</span> <span data-start="821.7" data-end="826.26">You can see which parts got executed.</span> <span data-start="826.26" data-end="841.29">There are a lot of events there.</span> <span data-start="841.29" data-end="857.74">The same as Adobe Brakets you can see argument values.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="857.74" data-end="863.16">That was SpyJs.</span> <span data-start="863.16" data-end="874.449">So, I think it is all cool.</span> <span data-start="874.449" data-end="875.449">What would be better I think.</span> <span data-start="875.449" data-end="884.37">What if I just could play it back?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="884.37" data-end="889.24">So, oops.</span> <span data-start="889.24" data-end="891.67">Okay.</span> <span data-start="891.67" data-end="902.48">So, about 1,5 years ago I was playing around with one tool.</span> <span data-start="902.48" data-end="904.769">Called it Rewind.</span> <span data-start="904.769" data-end="909.54">I do some Dom operations.</span> <span data-start="909.54" data-end="915.839">And what if I played it back?</span> <span data-start="915.839" data-end="918.51">And forward.</span> <span data-start="921.18" data-end="931.31">And so I was working on a tool that captures all the Dom manipulations.</span> <span data-start="931.31" data-end="933.649">Allows to rewind them.</span> <span data-start="933.649" data-end="936.62">Eventually I realised it is not practical.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="936.62" data-end="940.05">I only captured Dom.</span> <span data-start="940.05" data-end="942.98">Not Js events.</span> <span data-start="942.98" data-end="943.98">Input.</span> <span data-start="943.98" data-end="947.5">If there is something going on in an interval.</span> <span data-start="947.5" data-end="950.699">And tries to access the dom.</span> <span data-start="950.699" data-end="953.25">And I rewind it.</span> <span data-start="953.25" data-end="958.41">It will try to do something with an element that is no longer there.</span> <span data-start="958.41" data-end="959.81">So.</span> <span data-start="959.81" data-end="967.959">I kept it as a project.</span> <span data-start="967.959" data-end="974.51">Hopefully, fortunately..</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="974.51" data-end="984.329">Some other tool.</span> <span data-start="984.329" data-end="987.44">Tools out here.</span> <span data-start="987.44" data-end="998.41">So, this is Timeline again in Web Inspector.</span> <span data-start="998.41" data-end="1003.449">I have a hidden feature.</span> <span data-start="1003.449" data-end="1004.449">Web replay.</span> <span data-start="1004.449" data-end="1012.829">At this stage it doesn't do that much.</span> <span data-start="1012.829" data-end="1028.57">But you'll see.</span> <span data-start="1028.57" data-end="1042">So, I basically played it back as it was.</span> <span data-start="1042" data-end="1048.51">It captured all the values such as random.</span> <span data-start="1048.51" data-end="1049.51">And information.</span> <span data-start="1049.51" data-end="1076.85">And played exactly the same as it was.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1076.85" data-end="1083.19">For now, wouldn't it be amazing rewind back.</span> <span data-start="1083.19" data-end="1085.96">Play some code.</span> <span data-start="1085.96" data-end="1092.35">Loop some animation and tweak around with values and just play.</span> <span data-start="1092.35" data-end="1096.74">And you don't need to hit refresh all the time.</span> <span data-start="1096.74" data-end="1106.89">So, this was a current implementation in the webkit nightly.</span> <span data-start="1106.89" data-end="1162.14">I'd like to finish with</span> <span data-start="1162.14" data-end="1177.33">a video.</span> <span data-start="1177.33" data-end="1196.97">Isn't it amazing.</span> <span data-start="1196.97" data-end="1233.94">I</span> <span data-start="1233.94" data-end="1238.62">hope at some point you'll be able to rewind back and play it again.</span> <span data-start="1238.62" data-end="1241.81">And change some value.</span> <span data-start="1241.81" data-end="1246.39">We hit refresh all day long.</span> <span data-start="1246.39" data-end="1252.15">And I think it is not necessary.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1252.15" data-end="1255.13">Timelapse is now called Webreplay.</span> <span data-start="1255.13" data-end="1261.58">And it doesn't allow you to rewind as I showed you.</span> <span data-start="1261.58" data-end="1264.19">I hope will get there eventually.</span> <span data-start="1264.19" data-end="1270.77">I hope, Web replay will change the way we develop web apps.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1270.77" data-end="1272.51">Thank you.</span> </p>
