data-start="12.599" data-end="17.46">story in this story is Jake Jake's the</span> <span data-start="17.46" data-end="20.039">software engineer and he's currently</span> <span data-start="20.039" data-end="21.51">working on an ambitious new web</span> <span data-start="21.51" data-end="23.07">application and he and his team are</span> <span data-start="23.07" data-end="26.46">super excited about the project however</span> <span data-start="26.46" data-end="28.74">as often happens it's a few weeks behind</span> <span data-start="28.74" data-end="30.48">schedule and they just had to spend a</span> <span data-start="30.48" data-end="32.809">long week wrapping up the key feature</span> <span data-start="32.809" data-end="36.899">now it's a Monday and Jake is feeling</span> <span data-start="36.899" data-end="38.489">extra worn out because he had to deal</span> <span data-start="38.489" data-end="39.6">with some family problems over the</span> <span data-start="39.6" data-end="42.09">weekend he would really like a day off</span> <span data-start="42.09" data-end="44.07">but he doesn't have any PTO when he</span> <span data-start="44.07" data-end="45.45">knows that the rest of his team is hard</span> <span data-start="45.45" data-end="47.579">at work so he decides to tough it out</span> <span data-start="47.579" data-end="50.55">and head into the office the first thing</span> <span data-start="50.55" data-end="52.02">he does when he gets there is check on</span> <span data-start="52.02" data-end="53.309">that poll work less you up and on Friday</span> <span data-start="53.309" data-end="56.34">he sees he got a review and wants to</span> <span data-start="56.34" data-end="58.59">check the comments on it but it turns</span> <span data-start="58.59" data-end="60">out there was only one comment and it</span> <span data-start="60" data-end="61.32">was left by a senior engineer on his</span> <span data-start="61.32" data-end="64.769">team and it says this won't work that's</span> <span data-start="64.769" data-end="68.82">it nothing else so then since he started</span> <span data-start="68.82" data-end="69.99">out pretty tired Jake's already</span> <span data-start="69.99" data-end="71.46">beginning to feel some frustration he's</span> <span data-start="71.46" data-end="73.89">thinking to himself well why won't this</span> <span data-start="73.89" data-end="76.08">work it is what was asked in I worked</span> <span data-start="76.08" data-end="80.28">hard on it but he moves on he has a</span> <span data-start="80.28" data-end="82.11">meeting coming up it's his first meeting</span> <span data-start="82.11" data-end="83.4">of the day and it's a one-on-one with</span> <span data-start="83.4" data-end="85.83">his manager he gets to the meeting a bit</span> <span data-start="85.83" data-end="87.299">early hoping that he'd be able to have</span> <span data-start="87.299" data-end="89.31">some time to talk about his frustrations</span> <span data-start="89.31" data-end="90.57">and some problems going on with the</span> <span data-start="90.57" data-end="93.06">project but as soon as his manager gets</span> <span data-start="93.06" data-end="95.79">to the door he asks Sam have you</span> <span data-start="95.79" data-end="98.07">finished feature X this feature was</span> <span data-start="98.07" data-end="99.27">supposed to be delivered last week but</span> <span data-start="99.27" data-end="101.729">due to issues with other teams he was</span> <span data-start="101.729" data-end="104.13">then able to finish it on time and so</span> <span data-start="104.13" data-end="105.27">they spend their whole time discussing</span> <span data-start="105.27" data-end="105.95">that</span> <span data-start="105.95" data-end="108.06">so when Jake leaves this meeting he's</span> <span data-start="108.06" data-end="110.43">thinking to himself no it's not finished</span> <span data-start="110.43" data-end="112.11">but that's not what I wanted to talk</span> <span data-start="112.11" data-end="115.979">about so it's about lunchtime now and he</span> <span data-start="115.979" data-end="119.34">heads to lunch with his teammates since</span> <span data-start="119.34" data-end="120.63">his meeting ran a bit long though by the</span> <span data-start="120.63" data-end="122.52">time he gets to the lunch table they're</span> <span data-start="122.52" data-end="124.74">already in conversation Jake's hoping</span> <span data-start="124.74" data-end="125.79">that they could talk about something</span> <span data-start="125.79" data-end="127.439">other than tech for a little bit and</span> <span data-start="127.439" data-end="128.97">seeing as it is on Monday he's hoping</span> <span data-start="128.97" data-end="130.08">that maybe they have some weekend</span> <span data-start="130.08" data-end="132.4">stories that they could share</span> <span data-start="132.4" data-end="134.42">however they're already in conversation</span> <span data-start="134.42" data-end="135.62">and they're talking about the

<p><span data-start="335.169" data-end="343.33">I respect my limitations but I don't use</span> <span data-start="343.33" data-end="345.7">them as an excuse and what I mean by</span> <span data-start="345.7" data-end="347.53">this is I know that I'm gonna have to</span> <span data-start="347.53" data-end="349.45">put in a little extra bit of effort in</span> <span data-start="349.45" data-end="351.25">order to be more caring and supportive</span> <span data-start="351.25" data-end="352.66">of my teammates but that's no reason for</span> <span data-start="352.66" data-end="355.419">me not to do it we're all humans first</span> <span data-start="355.419" data-end="357.64">in developers second and I definitely</span> <span data-start="357.64" data-end="359.77">put in lots of effort and energy towards</span> <span data-start="359.77" data-end="361.9">being a better developer so it's only</span> <span data-start="361.9" data-end="363.039">reasonable that I can put in at least</span> <span data-start="363.039" data-end="364.21">some effort towards being a better</span> <span data-start="364.21" data-end="367.84">person and a more caring teammate so</span> <span data-start="367.84" data-end="369.46">with that in mind let's look at some</span> <span data-start="369.46" data-end="371.62">practical ways that we can get better at</span> <span data-start="371.62" data-end="373.5">caring together</span> <span data-start="373.5" data-end="378.24">so first up code reviews whether it's</span> <span data-start="378.24" data-end="381.28">product reviews code reviews or design</span> <span data-start="381.28" data-end="384.729">reviews the process of soliciting</span> <span data-start="384.729" data-end="386.71">feedback about decisions and then</span> <span data-start="386.71" data-end="387.82">incorporating that feedback is a</span> <span data-start="387.82" data-end="389.56">relatively regular part of most</span> <span data-start="389.56" data-end="393.159">developers work now there's a lot that</span> <span data-start="393.159" data-end="393.99">we can say</span> <span data-start="393.99" data-end="399.09">about how to make code reviews more more</span> <span data-start="399.09" data-end="400.83">caring how we can be more caring in</span> <span data-start="400.83" data-end="404.19">those actions invited he covered a lot</span> <span data-start="404.19" data-end="406.11">of that in our talk earlier but I really</span> <span data-start="406.11" data-end="408.36">just want to focus on one area that is</span> <span data-start="408.36" data-end="411.36">the emotional and interpersonal aspects</span> <span data-start="411.36" data-end="414.75">of these review processes in a written</span> <span data-start="414.75" data-end="416.43">version of her talk she groups these</span> <span data-start="416.43" data-end="418.83">under a header called the harder things</span> <span data-start="418.83" data-end="421.56">but the most important which leaves us</span> <span data-start="421.56" data-end="422.52">with the question why are these the</span> <span data-start="422.52" data-end="423.96">harder things and why are they the most</span> <span data-start="423.96" data-end="426.36">important things it's because they're</span> <span data-start="426.36" data-end="428.91">almost entirely of all about people or</span> <span data-start="428.91" data-end="430.2">more specifically they're about people</span> <span data-start="430.2" data-end="434.22">and communication and so whether it's</span> <span data-start="434.22" data-end="436.59">communication in the form of feedback or</span> <span data-start="436.59" data-end="438.72">critiques or even just a discussion</span> <span data-start="438.72" data-end="440.54">about the way something was done</span> <span

data-end="450.75">looks good to me that doesn't really</span> <span data-start="450.75" data-end="452.52">tell you a whole lot right like what's</span> <span data-start="452.52" data-end="454.2">good about it or did you even really</span> <span data-start="454.2" data-end="455.61">look at it like if you don't have</span> <span data-start="455.61" data-end="458.1">anything specific to say how do I know</span> <span data-start="458.1" data-end="463.25">that you actually looked at it and so</span> <span data-start="463.25" data-end="466.35">with this in mind how can we incorporate</span> <span

data-end="550.57">members of this m4 team could come</span> <span data-start="550.57" data-end="552.13">across as a bit condescending or aloof</span> <span data-start="552.13"

data-end="704.44">is rationale so this approach to several</span> <span data-start="704.44" data-end="706.39">things first it acknowledges that Jake's</span> <span data-start="706.39" data-end="708.88">a rational and logical and intelligent</span> <span data-start="708.88" data-end="711.399">person he likely had reasons for why he</span> <span data-start="711.399" data-end="712.779">chose to approach the problem the way</span> <span data-start="712.779" data-end="716.17">that he did second it gives an</span> <span data-start="716.17" data-end="717.82">opportunity for the reviewer to share</span> <span data-start="717.82" data-end="719.92">context that Jake might be missing as to</span> <span data-start="719.92"

data-end="744.55">the only real drawback here is that I</span> <span data-start="744.55" data-end="745.66">will have taken the review or slightly</span> <span data-start="745.66"

bit of time is the bare necessity</span> <span data-start="751.959" data-end="753.16">that we should be asking of someone</span> <span data-start="753.16" data-end="755.05">reviewing code that is

<p><span data-start="764.829" data-end="767.17">I'll end this section with one more tip</span> <span data-start="767.17" data-end="770.41">about improving their tone and that is</span> <span data-start="770.41" data-end="773.02">make opportunities for praise what I</span> <span data-start="773.02" data-end="775.54">mean by this is there are chances for</span> <span data-start="775.54" data-end="777.79">you to encourage and support and be</span> <span data-start="777.79" data-end="779.35">positive even when you have to provide</span> <span data-start="779.35"

data-end="791.44">time to time a little bit of positivity</span> <span data-start="791.44" data-end="793.209">can go a long way</span> <span data-start="793.209" data-end="794.37">constant barrage</span> <span data-start="794.37" data-end="796.95">of technical comments in critiques and</span> <span data-start="796.95" data-end="798.87">feedback can be really draining to</span> <span data-start="798.87" data-end="801">everyone involved but sending some</span> <span data-start="801" data-end="803.43">positivity can really help restore that</span> <span data-start="803.43" data-end="804.99">energy for someone that's having to be</span> <span data-start="804.99" data-end="807.93">reviewed this goes doubly so if you're a</span> <span data-start="807.93" data-end="810.029">senior or a lead engineer because that</span> <span data-start="810.029" data-end="811.47">means there is probably someone looking</span> <span data-start="811.47" data-end="814.32">up to you and as such you should be</span> <span data-start="814.32" data-end="816.089">setting an example for how to be</span> <span data-start="816.089" data-end="818.27">supportive of your teammates</span> <span data-start="818.27" data-end="821.64">so moving on Jake had a slightly less</span> <span data-start="821.64" data-end="823.56">than stellar encounter in a one-on-one</span> <span data-start="823.56" data-end="825.96">meeting with his manager now this</span> <span data-start="825.96" data-end="827.4">meeting didn't necessarily need to

data-start="832.62" data-end="834.15">really but the fact that it was his</span> <span data-start="834.15" data-end="835.74">manager carried extra weight for Jake</span> <span data-start="835.74" data-end="839.13">but we also have to remember that Jake's</span> <span data-start="839.13" data-end="840.81">manager probably wasn't trying to be</span> <span data-start="840.81" data-end="841.62">malicious here</span> <span data-start="841.62" data-end="844.29">he just wanted a status update and given</span> <span data-start="844.29" data-end="845.67">the circumstances he was

data-start="855.12" data-end="859.589">someone else well the first thing that</span> <span data-start="859.589" data-end="862.17">we should do is try to be flexible with</span> <span

acknowledge that you're meeting with</span> <span data-start="872.07" data-end="873.839">someone else and so while you may be</span> <span data-start="873.839" data-end="876.14">coming to this meeting

data-end="892.56">you should practice being flexible with</span> <span data-start="892.56" data-end="894.6">your time if they have something</span> <span data-start="894.6" data-end="896.49">important

critical</span> <span data-start="901.5" data-end="902.91">that needs to be discussed with them</span> <span data-start="902.91" data-end="904.44">though perhaps that should be another</span> <span

before try taking a walk</span> <span data-start="1200.91" data-end="1204.09">during our one-on-ones anecdotally</span> <span data-start="1204.09" data-end="1205.17">speaking they can feel a lot more</span> <span data-start="1205.17" data-end="1207.36">relaxed and laid-back than sitting in a</span> <span data-start="1207.36" data-end="1209.18">cold conference room across from someone</span> <span data-start="1209.18" data-end="1211.02">and especially if you have something</span> <span data-start="1211.02" data-end="1212.82">difficult to discuss it can be a lot</span> <span data-start="1212.82" data-end="1214.38">easier to do that while you're looking</span> <span data-start="1214.38" data-end="1216.57">at your feet or looking at the beautiful</span> <span data-start="1216.57" data-end="1219.33">scenery around you instead of sitting in</span> <span data-start="1219.33" data-end="1220.59">a cold conference room staring into</span> <span data-start="1220.59" data-end="1225.93">someone's eyes that said make sure that</span> <span data-start="1225.93" data-end="1227.04">you take into account the person you're</span> <span data-start="1227.04" data-end="1228.18">meeting with this won't work for</span> <span data-start="1228.18" data-end="1230.25">everyone and so you should communicate</span> <span data-start="1230.25" data-end="1231.93">with each other to find a structure that</span> <span data-start="1231.93" data-end="1236.45">is effective and useful for both of you</span> <span data-start="1236.45" data-end="1238.94">so we've now talked about two specific</span> <span data-start="1238.94" data-end="1243.99">work-related tasks that come up but what</span> <span data-start="1243.99" data-end="1245.46">about other day-to-day activities if</span> <span data-start="1245.46" data-end="1246.66">you're a developer chances are you don't</span> <span data-start="1246.66" data-end="1248.28">spend your whole day in meetings or</span> <span data-start="1248.28" data-end="1250.5">doing code reviews well at least I</span> <span data-start="1250.5" data-end="1252.81">should hope not so how do you care for</span> <span data-start="1252.81" data-end="1254.22">your teammates if you're just getting</span> <span data-start="1254.22" data-end="1257.01">lunch or chatting about tech or simply</span> <span data-start="1257.01" data-end="1259.61">doing a lull in the day at your desks</span> <span data-start="1259.61" data-end="1262.08">well my first tip here is to close the</span> <span data-start="1262.08" data-end="1265.71">shop as high-performing and really</span> <span data-start="1265.71" data-end="1267.33">motivated individuals it can be really</span> <span data-start="1267.33" data-end="1269.01">easy for us to want to talk about work</span> <span data-start="1269.01" data-end="1273.03">or talk shop all the time and especially</span> <span data-start="1273.03" data-end="1274.59">in the tech industry I've met tons of</span> <span data-start="1274.59" data-end="1276.24">people especially at conferences like</span> <span data-start="1276.24" data-end="1278.13">this that love what they do and love</span> <span data-start="1278.13" data-end="1280.23">their jobs and that is fantastic I'm</span> <span data-start="1280.23" data-end="1283.32">super happy about that but if that's all</span> <span data-start="1283.32" data-end="1285.96">that I ever know about people then I'm</span> <span data-start="1285.96" data-end="1287.61">missing out on critical opportunities to</span> <span data-start="1287.61" data-end="1289.68">build memories and stronger bonds and</span> <span data-start="1289.68" data-end="1291.2">connections with my teammates</span> <span data-start="1291.2" data-end="1293.37">that means we're missing out on chances</span> <span data-start="1293.37" data-end="1295.35">to build more collaborative teams that</span> <span data-start="1295.35" data-end="1297.06">can work more effectively together and</span> <span data-start="1297.06" data-end="1299.07">therefore deliver better products in the</span> <span data-start="1299.07" data-end="1302.04">end so we should inquire about family</span> <span data-start="1302.04" data-end="1304.47">and friends ask about their hobbies talk</span> <span data-start="1304.47" data-end="1305.97">about local events or maybe even ask</span> <span data-start="1305.97" data-end="1307.25">them about their favorite Netflix series</span> <span data-start="1307.25" data-end="1309.69">the possibilities really are almost</span> <span data-start="1309.69" data-end="1315.3">endless so if we think about Jake's</span> <span data-start="1315.3" data-end="1318.24">earlier lunch conversation what if</span> <span data-start="1318.24" data-end="1319.71">instead of say talking about new thing</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1319.71" data-end="1321.75">JSL lunches co-workers opened up by</span> <span data-start="1321.75" data-end="1323.16">talking about know what everyone had</span> <span data-start="1323.16" data-end="1325.95">done over the weekend maybe jake would</span> <span data-start="1325.95" data-end="1327.3">have a chance to open up about how he's</span> <span

data-end="1333.45">way they can commiserate about it or if</span> <span data-start="1333.45" data-end="1334.95">he feels that's too personal he can</span> <span data-start="1334.95" data-end="1336.66">always sit back and hear about what's</span> <span data-start="1336.66" data-end="1338.309">going on in the lives of his co-workers</span> <span data-start="1338.309" data-end="1340.41">and find a way to connect with him that</span> <span data-start="1340.41" data-end="1343.83">way now this isn't to say that you</span> <span data-start="1343.83"

data-end="1357.87">and then so I guess more accurately</span> <span data-start="1357.87" data-end="1359.28">instead of closing the shop close the</span> <span data-start="1359.28" data-end="1361.47">shop occasionally don't shut it down</span> <span data-start="1361.47" data-end="1364.5">permanently and I think you'll be</span> <span data-start="1364.5"

data-end="1377.49">workplace because it's letting your</span> <span data-start="1377.49" data-end="1379.679">co-workers know that hey you have value</span> <span data-start="1379.679"

data-end="1395.49">caring and effective team but that's not</span> <span data-start="1395.49" data-end="1397.89">really the goal my goal in this talk is</span> <span data-start="1397.89" data-end="1400.71">to provide examples examples of how we</span> <span data-start="1400.71" data-end="1403.049">translate this amorphous concept of</span> <span data-start="1403.049"

data-end="1431.159">it's not really so much about a specific</span> <span data-start="1431.159" data-end="1435.23">moment or a location in time it's about</span> <span data-start="1435.23"
