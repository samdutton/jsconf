<p><span data-start="70.17" data-end="76.64">We're fully open source non-profit dedicated to advance humanity in our interactions with</span> <span data-start="76.64" data-end="77.64">computers.</span> <span data-start="77.64" data-end="80.47">Today, I'm here to talk about us.</span> <span data-start="80.47" data-end="81.47">All of us.</span> <span data-start="81.47" data-end="85.06">And about our history-building software for human beings.</span> <span data-start="85.06" data-end="90.37">By the end of this talk I hopefully will have done two things.</span> <span data-start="90.37" data-end="95.39">While the web flourishes with incredible ideas, we have a great many lessons to learn from</span> <span data-start="95.39" data-end="97.09">our past.</span> <span data-start="97.09" data-end="101.45">The second one is that was perhaps I will have compelled some of you to challenge the</span> <span data-start="101.45" data-end="108.78">way we build web applications, both at a technical level but also philosophically.</span> <span data-start="108.78" data-end="109.78">So let us begin.</span> <span data-start="109.78" data-end="112.83">And in the spirit of fun, let's play a gale.</span> <span data-start="112.83" data-end="116.86">I will describe a programme and some of the features it has, and you will try to guess</span> <span data-start="116.86" data-end="117.86">out loud its name.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="117.86" data-end="119.51">Are you up for it?</span> <span data-start="119.51" data-end="120.51">Yeah?</span> <span data-start="120.51" data-end="121.51">Cool.</span> <span data-start="121.51" data-end="123.96">I know we are tired, the last day, but please, bear with me.</span> <span data-start="123.96" data-end="131.239">Can you think of a programme that lets you draw maybe free handed, and then you can resize</span> <span data-start="131.239" data-end="133.489">your shapes at will?</span> <span data-start="133.489" data-end="138.15">Does this programme let you set constraints for those shapes and say that they will be</span> <span data-start="138.15" data-end="142.069">centred, parallel to something else?</span> <span data-start="142.069" data-end="144.34">Can you make copies of those shapes?</span> <span data-start="144.34" data-end="149.98">And if you make a copy and update the regional, does the copy update as well?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="149.98" data-end="150.98">Anybody any guesses?</span> <span data-start="150.98" data-end="151.98">Photoshop?</span> <span data-start="151.98" data-end="152.98">Anyone else?</span> <span data-start="152.98" data-end="159.049">All right, I was hoping would actually say "Sketch".</span> <span data-start="159.049" data-end="166.829">These are some of the features in Sketch but I was referring to subscribers sketch Pad,</span> <span data-start="166.829" data-end="172.189">a programme developed back in 1963, and yet this is this old.</span> <span data-start="172.189" data-end="174.829">This is really over 50 years old.</span> <span data-start="174.829" data-end="181.78">So I want to show you a little bit of what Sketch Pad looks like.</span> <span data-start="181.78" data-end="186.469">We can see that something on screen, right.</span> <span data-start="186.469" data-end="190.819">It looks like a rivet or maybe some sort of square with a base.</span> <span data-start="190.819" data-end="195.749">He has a crossbar, and the centre of the crossbar now to draw an arc.</span> <span data-start="195.749" data-end="201.389">Then he's going to point to the different edges of the drawing and ask the programme</span> <span data-start="201.389" data-end="203.62">to make them mutually perpendicular.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="203.62" data-end="213.329">As the problem solves the constraints, it forces the arc to change.</span> <span data-start="213.329" data-end="217.55">Then he shows that no matter how you distort it, it comes up with a symmetrical solution,</span> <span data-start="217.55" data-end="219.049">which is pretty cool.</span> <span data-start="219.049" data-end="223.689">These constraints could have been more complicated, could have been ratios between lines, and</span> <span data-start="223.689" data-end="224.689">other drawings.</span> <span data-start="224.689" data-end="233.139">We will see a last example there.</span> <span data-start="233.139" data-end="234.139">Turns it on.</span> <span data-start="234.139" data-end="236.55">There you go.</span> <span data-start="236.55" data-end="239.569">Perfectly symmetrical rivet.</span> <span data-start="239.569" data-end="244.469">Another important idea we will see here, and the first time it is shown, is the idea of</span> <span data-start="244.469" data-end="248.14">a master and an instance, right?</span> <span data-start="248.14" data-end="252.469">He was working before on this master drawing, and now he has an instance of it on screen</span> <span data-start="252.469" data-end="255.18">that is completely independent from the master.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="255.18" data-end="260.2">You can see that he's rotating it, trying to fit it into the plank.</span> <span data-start="260.2" data-end="261.2">It's a tedious process.</span> <span data-start="261.2" data-end="262.96">It takes a little bit of time.</span> <span data-start="262.96" data-end="267.61">This flickers because it's not actually a display, it's an oscilloscope.</span> <span data-start="267.61" data-end="271.289">They did not have displays back then.</span> <span data-start="271.289" data-end="273.33">Perfect.</span> <span data-start="273.33" data-end="279.43">There you go.</span> <span data-start="279.43" data-end="282.52">We can relate now to this pattern using different names.</span> <span data-start="282.52" data-end="287.909">Perhaps we think of components and elements in React or classed as an object in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="287.909" data-end="290.889">He creates a few more instances, and then he goes back to the master, and you can see</span> <span data-start="290.889" data-end="296.31">that he will just remove some of the crossbar lines, and, when he goes back, lo and behold,</span> <span data-start="296.31" data-end="301.479">the copies, the instance was be the elements have been updated.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="301.479" data-end="303.58">Yes.</span> <span data-start="303.58" data-end="309.56">This is the work of Ivan Sutherland who, in 1963, published his seminal work on Sketch</span> <span data-start="309.56" data-end="311.04">Pad.</span> <span data-start="311.04" data-end="313.33">It's pretty intense.</span> <span data-start="313.33" data-end="314.88">It's on line.</span> <span data-start="314.88" data-end="321.42">This development during the thesis, all by himself, and when Alan Okay one of his students,</span> <span data-start="321.42" data-end="327.15">asked him how did he manage to create this first object-orientated system, and the first</span> <span data-start="327.15" data-end="333.27">graphical interface system all within one year by himself, the guy just replied he didn't</span> <span data-start="333.27" data-end="335.97">know it was hard.</span> <span data-start="335.97" data-end="338.169">Which is interesting.</span> <span data-start="338.169" data-end="343.75">Either way, Ivan really set the bar high for a people that came after him, right?</span> <span data-start="343.75" data-end="348.84">He set the direction for the likes of Douglas Engelberg, the fellow who created the first</span> <span data-start="348.84" data-end="351.96">computer mouse.</span> <span data-start="351.96" data-end="358.61">They developed through a span of ten years a system that is kind of incredible.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="358.61" data-end="361.639">I can't quite grasp that it has existed.</span> <span data-start="361.639" data-end="367.8">This is the online system for historical reasons that I'm not going to get into, and it was</span> <span data-start="367.8" data-end="370.909">first made publicly in 1968.</span> <span data-start="370.909" data-end="374.889">In dates a long time ago as well.</span> <span data-start="374.889" data-end="378.53">This has been dubbed "the mother of all demos".</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="378.53" data-end="380.31">Let's look at why.</span> <span data-start="380.31" data-end="383.469">And this is audio, so hopefully, you will be able to see it.</span> <span data-start="383.469" data-end="386.889"Audience member: [Video]: I would like to see you while I'm working on it.</span> <span data-start="386.889" data-end="387.979">Oops.</span> <span data-start="387.979" data-end="390.18">The kind of display.</span> <span data-start="390.18" data-end="393.11">I would like to see you while I'm working on it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="393.11" data-end="399.02">So before I can do that, I have to set up my display in a certain way.</span> <span data-start="399.02" data-end="402.77"Audience member: We can hear Douglas doing the live stream of the computer.</span> <span data-start="402.77" data-end="406.55"Audience member: [Video]: It leaves a corner up there.</span> <span data-start="406.55" data-end="412.349">[Voices speak all at once].</span> <span data-start="412.349" data-end="425.24"Audience member: You can see my work, I can point on the at it, and we can talk.</span> <span data-start="425.24" data-end="427.339">Let's do some collaborating.</span> <span data-start="427.339" data-end="429.979"Audience member: That is video conferencing 1968.</span> <span data-start="429.979" data-end="437.699"Audience member: There is nobody here but a large audience, Bill.</span> <span data-start="437.699" data-end="442.65">Let's talk about information retrieval, and a lot of things I've been showing them jumping</span> <span data-start="442.65" data-end="443.65">around and finding your way.</span> <span data-start="443.65" data-end="446.889"Audience member: Can we lower the volume on the video, please?</span> <span data-start="446.889" data-end="452.99"Audience member: "An instrument, complex data structures, it shows them how we can get around and find</span> <span data-start="452.99" data-end="453.99">things.</span> <span data-start="453.99" data-end="456.93">I showed them the content analysers .." >> They're discussing some matters of the</span> <span data-start="456.93" data-end="461.58">presentation they were doing there, and then they proceeded to link work spaces to the</span> <span data-start="461.58" data-end="464.509">point that they are essentially doing live-coding.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="518.03" data-end="522.82">It's a language that is designed to fade into the background fast and let you express yourself,</span> <span data-start="522.82" data-end="526">sort of like a musical instrument would.</span> <span data-start="526" data-end="530.261">It offers the programmers two core capabilities: the first one is classes and objects, which</span> <span data-start="530.261" data-end="535.95">are used to represent things, right, and processes, and the second one is message-passing.</span> <span data-start="535.95" data-end="541.31">That provides the communication layer, a way for the objects to talk to each other.</span> <span data-start="541.31" data-end="546">Something worth noting is that Alan Okay has repeatedly said that when he invented object-orientated</span> <span data-start="546" data-end="551.75">programming, the important part was not the objects themselves but the messages.</span> <span data-start="551.75" data-end="554.68">It was the communication that he really cared about.</span> <span data-start="554.68" data-end="558.38">Let's look at an example of this system.</span> <span data-start="558.38" data-end="563.59">We can see here an animation of a bowl in what appears to be a static website.</span> <span data-start="563.59" data-end="566.87">In reality, the animation is being programmed as objects.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="566.87" data-end="568.83">We can stop it, step through it.</span> <span data-start="568.83" data-end="572.9">It's going to go through until it finds the right frame.</span> <span data-start="572.9" data-end="579.04">He opens up a browser, and this browser lets you see the messages that this object in particular</span> <span data-start="579.04" data-end="581.06">can receive, right?</span> <span data-start="581.06" data-end="582.46">That you can send to it.</span> <span data-start="582.46" data-end="587.99">After finding the right message, he is kind of going to the painter tool and doing the</span> <span data-start="587.99" data-end="592.34">same thing, and finding that, okay, we have the current frame message on the top, and</span> <span data-start="592.34" data-end="595.6">we need to find a message to link the current frame into the painting tool.</span> <span data-start="595.6" data-end="598.72">So it's going to look for the picture arrow.</span> <span data-start="598.72" data-end="602.931">It's going to then sort of sketch an arrow, and the system will recognise that you have</span> <span data-start="602.931" data-end="608.69">to messages selected, so you can type in there what you want to say.</span> <span data-start="608.69" data-end="614.14">He's saying, hey, painter, here's a message picture, give me the picture that you're currently</span> <span data-start="614.14" data-end="618.46">using and link it to the bouncing, which is the name of the object which represents the</span> <span data-start="618.46" data-end="619.48">animation, current frame.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="619.48" data-end="621.63">So the current frame of the animation above.</span> <span data-start="621.63" data-end="625.16">After he sends the message, we get the frame below.</span> <span data-start="625.16" data-end="626.77">This is done completely live.</span> <span data-start="626.77" data-end="629.26">This is not something that has been prepared beforehand.</span> <span data-start="629.26" data-end="633.71">It's the live system that the user is going to use.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="633.71" data-end="634.91">Right?</span> <span data-start="634.91" data-end="642.79">All of these applications are customisable by the users to feed their needs.</span> <span data-start="642.79" data-end="648.28">They turn the whole computer into some bicycle for the mind.</span> <span data-start="648.28" data-end="652.27">And all of these examples have been built on each other to formalise the idea that our</span> <span data-start="652.27" data-end="653.85">world is concurrent.</span> <span data-start="653.85" data-end="656.69">Everything around us is happening in parallel from us.</span> <span data-start="656.69" data-end="660.55">We communicate with everything around us by sending these metal, just like right now,</span> <span data-start="660.55" data-end="667.47">I'm not letting you access the memory in my head, I'm sending mention to you so we communicate.</span> <span data-start="667.47" data-end="670.2">Yes.</span> <span data-start="670.2" data-end="674.21">The underlying philosophical grounds that all of these people shared, the vision they</span> <span data-start="674.21" data-end="678.4">had, was to advance the human intellect.</span> <span data-start="678.4" data-end="682.96">We're not talking about for-profit companies trying to lure you into buying a product but</span> <span data-start="682.96" data-end="687.65">altruistic men and women dedicating the lives for all of us.</span> <span data-start="687.65" data-end="691.41">We've seen the sketch about the NLS — Smalltalk.</span> <span data-start="691.41" data-end="695.37">What are the learning we can take from them and apply today?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="695.37" data-end="698.59">I want to talk about two ideas.</span> <span data-start="698.59" data-end="703.11">The first one is the competition model behind this application, how is it that they're run,</span> <span data-start="703.11" data-end="706.73">and the second one is the philosophy behind it?</span> <span data-start="706.73" data-end="708.17">Let's begin with a first one.</span> <span data-start="708.17" data-end="713.43">When we model an application in Smalltalk, we model it in terms of objects that interact</span> <span data-start="713.43" data-end="718.06">with each other in terms of message-passing and each of those objects performs hopefully</span> <span data-start="718.06" data-end="719.06">one small task.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="719.06" data-end="725.69">That's a number of messages that it understands that it sends to all their objects.</span> <span data-start="725.69" data-end="730.67">It may have some internal state that can change over time.</span> <span data-start="730.67" data-end="736.66">Normally, one of these Smalltalk applications, right, can have millions, or hundreds of millions</span> <span data-start="736.66" data-end="741.22">of objects, and you may even think of those tiny objects as tiny computers on their own.</span> <span data-start="741.22" data-end="743.5">It's kind of like an internet inside your application.</span> <span data-start="743.5" data-end="749.04">If you look at this diagram, you can see we have some .. that is sending essentially</span> <span data-start="749.04" data-end="753.29">an in put object, a message called "clear", and it clears itself, and a container object</span> <span data-start="753.29" data-end="758.89">is sending a draw message telling where it has to be drawn, the same with a slide er</span> <span data-start="758.89" data-end="766.64">linked to the graph, and the synchronise from send to the graph that will in turn update</span> <span data-start="766.64" data-end="769.3">the slider.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="769.3" data-end="774.36">The underlying principles behind how Smalltalk works have been formalised with some differences</span> <span data-start="774.36" data-end="775.4">as the Actor model.</span> <span data-start="775.4" data-end="780.85">In the Actor model, we have separate actors, essentially independent entities, that they're</span> <span data-start="780.85" data-end="784.78">executed completely independently, completely in isolation.</span> <span data-start="784.78" data-end="789.2">They solve problems by collaboration, and then collaborate with each other by message-passing.</span> <span data-start="789.2" data-end="794.61">They collaborate by talking to each other just like humans do.</span> <span data-start="794.61" data-end="797.98">Modelling the system with this approach history is interesting properties.</span> <span data-start="797.98" data-end="801.06">The first one is failure .. by default.</span> <span data-start="801.06" data-end="808.41">The second one is an asynchronous nature, and the second one is that it is parallelisable.</span> <span data-start="808.41" data-end="816.76">A show of hands: have you ever seen an application, a website that bass completely unusable because</span> <span data-start="816.76" data-end="820.92">of some exception that blew up the complete application stack?</span> <span data-start="820.92" data-end="822.31">Yes or no?</span> <span data-start="822.31" data-end="826.13">Pretty everyone is yeah, that's the way it goes.</span> <span data-start="826.13" data-end="828.44">I think we all have, right?</span> <span data-start="828.44" data-end="834.37">Before application s start normally compose of those independent ly collaborating systems,</span> <span data-start="834.37" data-end="839.07">why do we treat them as a single monolith that has to be carefully programmed?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="839.07" data-end="840.66">I don't quite understand that.</span> <span data-start="840.66" data-end="846.06">We know that applications are scaling massively in complexity, and for the user experiences</span> <span data-start="846.06" data-end="851.48">that people that used them is perhaps the definition of a .. for some of us.</span> <span data-start="851.48" data-end="857.17">In the Actor model, an actor failing does not take down the entire system.</span> <span data-start="857.17" data-end="862.48">If you build it carefully, all the actors can take a look at your actors, and restart</span> <span data-start="862.48" data-end="863.48">them whenever they fail.</span> <span data-start="863.48" data-end="866.05">You have a system that heals.</span> <span data-start="866.05" data-end="871.54">Of course, we could decide the certain failures are worth a complete application crash, irrecoverable</span> <span data-start="871.54" data-end="872.54">crash.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="872.54" data-end="874.23">Now it's a constant decision that we make.</span> <span data-start="874.23" data-end="877.3">It's not something that just happens.</span> <span data-start="877.3" data-end="879.93">The second thing I want to talk about is asynchronous nature.</span> <span data-start="879.93" data-end="882.9">This is fairly straightforward.</span> <span data-start="882.9" data-end="885.75">The applications that we build are asynchronous by default.</span> <span data-start="885.75" data-end="888.87">The user interacts with it and we don't know when that is going to happen.</span> <span data-start="888.87" data-end="896.17">Why do we need to build up stacks of reactive libraries, we could be using a competition</span> <span data-start="896.17" data-end="899.44">model that is fit for it?</span> <span data-start="899.44" data-end="903.5">Lastly, parallelisable.</span> <span data-start="903.5" data-end="910.86">We struggle to parallelise this because we have a accessible stack running, and any co-ordination</span> <span data-start="910.86" data-end="915.49">in the thread has been thought about beforehand and done manually.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="915.49" data-end="919.34">In terms of actors, we could potentially run every Actor parallelly.</span> <span data-start="919.34" data-end="923.53">That might be useless because some might depend on messages from each other but you can do</span> <span data-start="923.53" data-end="924.53">that.</span> <span data-start="924.53" data-end="928.09">This is because each one of the actors is essentially its own tiny computer.</span> <span data-start="928.09" data-end="934.62">Just think of the performance gains some applications would have by using more cores because they</span> <span data-start="934.62" data-end="935.62">are available.</span> <span data-start="935.62" data-end="937.7">Without having to be rewritten.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="937.7" data-end="940.64">There is this three properties, right.</span> <span data-start="940.64" data-end="949.44">They are incredible in practice like in Erlang or Pony been when they are used for building</span> <span data-start="949.44" data-end="954.78">massively concurrent systems, like WhatsApp, for example, were built on it.</span> <span data-start="954.78" data-end="960.62">I will grant you that we don't want two million users per browser but knowing your application</span> <span data-start="960.62" data-end="966.49">can crash and recover on the fly by itself, it's incredibly powerful when it comes to</span> <span data-start="966.49" data-end="973.04">raising the bar on quality of any experience that we design or develop.</span> <span data-start="973.04" data-end="978.24">The second point I wanted to make beyond the competition model is the one of philosophy.</span> <span data-start="978.24" data-end="979.58">This is a briefer one.</span> <span data-start="979.58" data-end="982.85">It's the last point I like to make today.</span> <span data-start="982.85" data-end="990.06">And it is that most applications, if not all of them, are built on two key ideas: the idea</span> <span data-start="990.06" data-end="996.72">of liveness of an application, and the idea of directness of an application.</span> <span data-start="996.72" data-end="1001.13">When we talk about liveness, we are talking about the ability to always respond to a user's</span> <span data-start="1001.13" data-end="1002.13">actions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1002.13" data-end="1006.49">This means that whatever you do in the system, and whatever the system is doing, they will</span> <span data-start="1006.49" data-end="1011.16">never be a complete stop or gap in the feedback loop.</span> <span data-start="1011.16" data-end="1013.03">This is a little bit how the real world works.</span> <span data-start="1013.03" data-end="1018.06">We are constantly sending messages, sometimes we get responses back, sometimes, we get,</span> <span data-start="1018.06" data-end="1021.92">you know, double-tick red.</span> <span data-start="1021.92" data-end="1025.98">But naturally, as the workload of the system increases, you will expect some performance</span> <span data-start="1025.98" data-end="1026.98">degradation.</span> <span data-start="1026.98" data-end="1031.52">You would expect the system to gracefully degrade without actually stopping to work</span> <span data-start="1031.52" data-end="1032.52">entirely.</span> <span data-start="1032.52" data-end="1037.18">Now, do you remember the last time you were a were on a website that didn't do something</span> <span data-start="1037.18" data-end="1039.06">or anything, really, for some time.</span> <span data-start="1039.06" data-end="1043.839">There was perhaps something taking over the main loop, and your application just sort</span> <span data-start="1043.839" data-end="1046.97">of stopped working entirely.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1046.97" data-end="1050.57">Really, we can do much better than that.</span> <span data-start="1050.57" data-end="1056.05">And I think considering liveness and the actor model how they work together in isolation</span> <span data-start="1056.05" data-end="1059.73">is foundational to recoverable errors.</span> <span data-start="1059.73" data-end="1067.27">The second thing in the philosophy track is directness, or directness.</span> <span data-start="1067.27" data-end="1074.12">Directness means that everything you see can be modified, whatever the user sees on screen</span> <span data-start="1074.12" data-end="1081.03">that he can click on, whatever graphical representation of the system we have is the point that the</span> <span data-start="1081.03" data-end="1085.13">user can begin to explore the entire system.</span> <span data-start="1085.13" data-end="1088.73">That might be scary for some because you can right-click on something and get the actual</span> <span data-start="1088.73" data-end="1092.76">source and not bundled or minified version of it and modified.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1092.76" data-end="1099.1">If they can inspect the button, change the attributes to restructure the behaviour, even</span> <span data-start="1099.1" data-end="1108">reconstruct a user employee to suit their needs better, persist those changes and essentially</span> <span data-start="1108" data-end="1115.69">modify everything they already see, we have an application that show cases directness.</span> <span data-start="1115.69" data-end="1121.31">Really this is a deeper philosophical question to ask to all of you here, is are we going</span> <span data-start="1121.31" data-end="1127.61">to be building applications that model a flow that everybody sort of understands and doesn't</span> <span data-start="1127.61" data-end="1131.81">actually empower anybody to do better than they actually are doing?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1131.81" data-end="1137.15">Are we going to be giving them bicycles for their processes, or are we going to carry</span> <span data-start="1137.15" data-end="1141.37">them around?</span> <span data-start="1141.37" data-end="1144.92">So how do we get there?</span> <span data-start="1144.92" data-end="1150.23">I would inventory ure the that most of you who haven't heard of me before so it's hard</span> <span data-start="1150.23" data-end="1154.641">to agree with me right now that we need to rethink the complete foundations on which</span> <span data-start="1154.641" data-end="1157.22">we build applications.</span> <span data-start="1157.22" data-end="1160.85">After all, with all those fancy frameworks out there, backed by corporations, how could</span> <span data-start="1160.85" data-end="1162.76">they be wrong, right?</span> </p>
