data-end="250.139">off and it was awesome so sausage isn't</span> <span data-start="250.139" data-end="251.37">that different I was always really</span> <span data-start="251.37" data-end="252.66">interested in the idea of sausage</span> <span data-start="252.66" data-end="254.639">because it's like the next level from</span> <span data-start="254.639" data-end="256.229">bacon so I'm like always trying to level</span> <span data-start="256.229" data-end="258.979">up how do you cure sausage so you are</span> <span data-start="258.979" data-end="260.91">it's not that different you can see</span> <span data-start="260.91" data-end="261.9">there's only a couple different things</span> <span data-start="261.9" data-end="264.06">there's pork and salt and seasonings and</span> <span data-start="264.06" data-end="265.919">then the big difference is is you have</span> <span data-start="265.919" data-end="268.65">these friendly bacteria and you have to</span> <span data-start="268.65" data-end="270.719">have a specific temperature and humidity</span> <span data-start="270.719" data-end="272.11">and then time is the same</span> <span data-start="272.11" data-end="275.08">so the friendly bacteria it's easy you</span> <span data-start="275.08" data-end="276.37">can order friendly bacteria on the</span> <span data-start="276.37" data-end="280.06">internet on amazon com you get them and</span> <span data-start="280.06" data-end="282.15">you add them to your sausage mix and</span> <span data-start="282.15" data-end="285.04">they basically friendly bacteria or the</span> <span data-start="285.04" data-end="286.84">bacteria that grow on the outside</span> <span data-start="286.84" data-end="288.43">especially by a sausage at a store it's</span> <span data-start="288.43" data-end="290.17">covered in white mold and you're like oh</span> <span data-start="290.17" data-end="292">that's gross it's white those white</span> <span data-start="292" data-end="294.16">molds are good they're good mold that's</span> <span data-start="294.16" data-end="295.66">keeping away the bad mold that's black</span> <span data-start="295.66" data-end="297.34">and green you see any black and green on</span> <span data-start="297.34" data-end="300.37">it don't eat it first rule of sausage</span> <span data-start="300.37" data-end="305.68">and so if you if you but in order to get</span> <span data-start="305.68" data-end="307.24">those bacteria to grow you need a</span> <span data-start="307.24" data-end="309.61">specific temperature and humidity when</span> <span data-start="309.61" data-end="310.96">you're occurring bacon who's put in the</span> <span data-start="310.96" data-end="312.22">fridge it doesn't matter top shelf</span> <span data-start="312.22" data-end="313.54">bottom shelf it doesn't matter with</span> <span data-start="313.54" data-end="315.88">sopressata which is one of my favorite</span> <span data-start="315.88" data-end="317.68">types of Italian sausage you need to</span> <span data-start="317.68" data-end="319.39">keep the humidity around eighty percent</span> <span data-start="319.39" data-end="321.1">or higher and you need to keep the</span> <span data-start="321.1" data-end="324.16">temperature in around 55 degrees because</span> <span data-start="324.16" data-end="325.93">that's where the friendly bacteria</span> <span data-start="325.93" data-end="328.3">thrive anything out of that and you</span> <span data-start="328.3" data-end="330.58">might get those green and black ones</span> <span data-start="330.58" data-end="333.64">which you don't like so how to make a</span> <span data-start="333.64" data-end="335.65">raspberry pi in nodejs monitored sausage</span> <span data-start="335.65" data-end="337">curing chamber so obviously as a</span> <span data-start="337" data-end="338.95">programmer that's the next thing that</span> <span data-start="338.95" data-end="341.41">comes to mind obviously right so you got</span> <span data-start="341.41" data-end="342.85">your sausage you got a little fridge</span> <span data-start="342.85" data-end="345.88">there's a raspberry pi on top some wires</span> <span data-start="345.88" data-end="349.78">dangling scarily into the into the into</span>

data-end="369.34">is a little a brownie on roku and those</span> <span data-start="369.34" data-end="372.04">metrics get sent to librado and if the</span> <span data-start="372.04" data-end="373.9">temperature goes too high or too low</span> <span data-start="373.9" data-end="375.58">then you send a text message to yourself</span> <span data-start="375.58" data-end="379.09">so

<span data-start="385.3" data-end="387.03">it in action which is really really sad</span> <span data-start="387.03" data-end="389.32">but we you know this kind of follows a</span> <span data-start="389.32" data-end="391">theme of what we were talking about all</span> <span data-start="391" data-end="393.15">day this is the internet of tasty things</span> <span data-start="393.15"

<span data-start="419.389" data-end="421.46">into this whole idea of how do you</span> <span data-start="421.46" data-end="422.93">pickle things like what is that what</span> <span data-start="422.93" data-end="424.639">does that process look like and then you</span> <span data-start="424.639" data-end="426.29">have some parties where you have like</span> <span data-start="426.29" data-end="428.21">giant plates and Fickell's because your</span> <span data-start="428.21" data-end="429.889">entire freezer and fridge is filled with</span> <span data-start="429.889"

data-end="445.25">but it's gotten a little further there</span> <span data-start="445.25" data-end="446.87">you have some pastrami and some coppa</span> <span data-start="446.87" data-end="449.78">and

<span data-start="1309.46" data-end="1313.12">sound cool but emotional intelligence is</span> <span data-start="1313.12" data-end="1315.22">this other field of study so people like</span> <span data-start="1315.22" data-end="1318.22">think of IQ as like your intelligence</span> <span data-start="1318.22" data-end="1320.5">about making rational decisions and</span> <span data-start="1320.5"

Harvard and done smart things</span> <span data-start="1336.59" data-end="1339.65">have have figured out is that people who</span> <span data-start="1339.65" data-end="1341.42">are actually emotionally intelligent and</span> <span data-start="1341.42" data-end="1343.85">can do these things and navigate complex</span> <span data-start="1343.85" data-end="1346.31">situations and people are

data-start="1366.98" data-end="1368.87">gonna lie said dick and thence into said</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1368.87" data-end="1373.61">DB but anyway um uh there there like</span> <span data-start="1373.61" data-end="1375.98">outliers right there are there people</span> <span data-start="1375.98" data-end="1379.19">who who like try to buck this and but</span> <span data-start="1379.19" data-end="1380.81">people like praised them and put them on</span> <span data-start="1380.81" data-end="1382.43">pedestals but really we should be</span> <span data-start="1382.43" data-end="1384.38">praising everyone else who's doing a</span> <span data-start="1384.38" data-end="1386.81">really good job and being successful so</span> <span data-start="1386.81" data-end="1388.82">you basically breaks down to this I can</span> <span data-start="1388.82" data-end="1391.76">do like a 90 hour talking about this but</span> <span data-start="1391.76" data-end="1394.64">I won't but there are four quadrants and</span> <span data-start="1394.64" data-end="1396.92">mainly the basic idea is being aware of</span> <span data-start="1396.92" data-end="1399.2">who you are in the world and being aware</span> <span data-start="1399.2" data-end="1400.76">of the people that are around you that's</span> <span data-start="1400.76" data-end="1402.02">what it all breaks down to and if you</span> <span data-start="1402.02" data-end="1403.67">will be aware of your own emotions and</span> <span data-start="1403.67" data-end="1405.59">how they affect other people and how</span> <span data-start="1405.59" data-end="1407.48">other people's emotions might affect you</span> <span data-start="1407.48" data-end="1410.27">then you're on the path to being</span> <span data-start="1410.27" data-end="1412.4">successful basically so like if you're</span> <span data-start="1412.4" data-end="1413.9">in a meeting and someone shoots down</span> <span data-start="1413.9" data-end="1416.63">your idea and literally fire start</span> <span data-start="1416.63" data-end="1419.45">shooting out of your ears you're not a</span> <span data-start="1419.45" data-end="1421.04">very emotionally intelligent person</span> <span data-start="1421.04" data-end="1422.45">basically as the bottom line people</span> <span data-start="1422.45" data-end="1425.65">understand that seeing that emotion</span> <span data-start="1425.65" data-end="1427.88">steaming off of you and know that you're</span> <span data-start="1427.88" data-end="1430.73">about to flip out at them and they might</span> <span data-start="1430.73" data-end="1432.83">be like oh okay or if you're walking on</span> <span data-start="1432.83" data-end="1434.03">an office and your boss just starts</span> <span data-start="1434.03" data-end="1435.86">yelling at people that person is not</span> <span data-start="1435.86" data-end="1437.57">very emotionally intelligent it's not</span> <span data-start="1437.57" data-end="1439.4">just about anger it's about repressing</span> <span data-start="1439.4" data-end="1440.57">feelings and everything like that Thun</span> <span data-start="1440.57" data-end="1443.27">but we read this book it's really good</span> <span data-start="1443.27" data-end="1445.25">you'll get a lot out of it it'll take</span> <span data-start="1445.25" data-end="1451.16">you about 25 minutes to read so you care</span> <span data-start="1451.16" data-end="1453.46">a lot you're doing this thing and then</span> <span data-start="1453.46" data-end="1456.44">how do you burn out well it's easy you</span> <span data-start="1456.44" data-end="1458.18">actually care about things when you care</span> <span data-start="1458.18" data-end="1460.22">about things a lot and you work really</span> <span data-start="1460.22" data-end="1462.89">hard you end up putting everything in</span> <span data-start="1462.89" data-end="1466.37">this basket of this golden thing that's</span> <span data-start="1466.37" data-end="1467.57">going to flow to the heaven</span> <span data-start="1467.57" data-end="1470.87">and be the savior of all mankind and in</span> <span data-start="1470.87" data-end="1474.23">fact actually when you do that you</span> <span data-start="1474.23" data-end="1476.42">risked a lot and when you risked a lot</span> <span data-start="1476.42" data-end="1481.85">you fail sometimes and so I got to this</span> <span data-start="1481.85" data-end="1485.9">place about September 2013 where I was</span> <span data-start="1485.9" data-end="1487.91">like oh this is not really

data-end="1501.35">reviewing managing like 40 people and</span> <span data-start="1501.35" data-end="1505.01">that was hard and so I managed a couple</span> <span data-start="1505.01"
