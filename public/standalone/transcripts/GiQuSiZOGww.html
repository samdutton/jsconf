all had a good lunch I hope</span> <span data-start="17.99" data-end="20.21">you all don't sleep after the end of 30</span> <span data-start="20.21" data-end="22.58">minutes so I'll try my best to keep</span> <span data-start="22.58" data-end="26.329">y'all awake alright let's get started</span> <span data-start="26.329" data-end="32.029">so yes technology has already become</span> <span data-start="32.029" data-end="34.61">more productive and more natural more</span> <span data-start="34.61" data-end="37.13">intuitive the interfaces are more</span> <span data-start="37.13" data-end="40.67">intuitive more natural now having</span> <span data-start="40.67" data-end="42.8">interfaces this way makes the user</span> <span data-start="42.8" data-end="45.199">understand the product better or like</span> <span data-start="45.199" data-end="48.98">come closer with it so here I am Prince</span> <span data-start="48.98" data-end="52.309">iam working for a solando in Berlin and</span> <span data-start="52.309" data-end="55.28">to talk about natural user interfaces</span> <span data-start="55.28" data-end="62.499">using javascript so we typed we clicked</span> <span data-start="62.499" data-end="67.54">touched next what next next could be</span> <span data-start="67.54" data-end="72.05">alright I will go to the next slide with</span> <span data-start="72.05" data-end="75.41">a demo and the demo is highly dependent</span> <span data-start="75.41" data-end="95.64">on light so I really hope it works</span> <span data-start="95.65" data-end="99.58">okay so two slides again so we typed</span> <span data-start="99.58" data-end="107.86">clicked touched next what yeah so this</span> <span data-start="107.86" data-end="109.96">is what I am going to talk to y'all</span> <span data-start="109.96" data-end="113.62">about natural user interfaces using</span> <span data-start="113.62" data-end="114.61">javascript</span> <span data-start="114.61" data-end="116.53">this demo will you go over your so let</span> <span data-start="116.53" data-end="119.02">me just close it but yes it did its</span> <span data-start="119.02" data-end="123.24">purpose and yes so it could be gestures</span> <span data-start="123.24" data-end="127.15">right it could be a speech it could be</span> <span data-start="127.15" data-end="129.67">anything natural user interfaces could</span> <span data-start="129.67" data-end="133.39">include touch we typed we clicked touch</span> <span data-start="133.39" data-end="135.97">was more intuitive than click because it</span> <span data-start="135.97" data-end="138.09">was more direct next I would say</span> <span data-start="138.09" data-end="145.03">gestures or speech yes evolution of user</span> <span data-start="145.03" data-end="148.69">interfaces so somewhere this was coined</span> <span data-start="148.69" data-end="151.35">somewhere back in the 90s</span> <span data-start="151.35" data-end="155.05">wherein it started with CLI command line</span> <span data-start="155.05" data-end="157.42">interface wherein user had to understand</span> <span data-start="157.42" data-end="160.39">of an artificial medium that is the</span> <span data-start="160.39" data-end="162.82">keyboard to input something and to</span> <span data-start="162.82" data-end="164.07">interact with the interface</span> <span data-start="164.07" data-end="167.8">next came GUI graphical user interface</span> <span data-start="167.8" data-end="169.45">with the advent of the mouse</span> <span data-start="169.45" data-end="173.56">users could interact more closely better</span> <span data-start="173.56" data-end="176.26">than the keyboard with the interface and</span> <span data-start="176.26" data-end="179.23">understand the interface more better and</span> <span data-start="179.23" data-end="183.01">now we have this NUI with the advent of</span> <span data-start="183.01" data-end="185.62">a are we are perceptual computing we</span> <span data-start="185.62" data-end="187.989">hear that everywhere if we just do a</span> <span data-start="187.989" data-end="189.85">search on the internet what is the state</span> <span data-start="189.85" data-end="191.83">of art what we are AR or perceptual</span> <span data-start="191.83" data-end="194.41">computing there are there is lot</span> <span data-start="194.41" data-end="198.459">happening out there and anyway has more</span> <span data-start="198.459" data-end="201.85">space and it is more direct it is more</span> <span data-start="201.85" data-end="209.17">intuitive yes natural user interfaces to</span> <span data-start="209.17" data-end="210.85">coin it it is a system for</span> <span data-start="210.85" data-end="214.66">human-computer interaction wherein users</span> <span data-start="214.66" data-end="217.42">interact more intuitively more directly</span> <span data-start="217.42" data-end="221.769">perform more closer tasks these</span> <span data-start="221.769" data-end="224.53">interfaces are yes are more natural and</span> <span data-start="224.53" data-end="227.75">more intuitive</span> <span data-start="227.75" data-end="231.93">yes a quick study about natural user</span> <span data-start="231.93" data-end="234.989">interfaces revealed this sub info graph</span> <span data-start="234.989" data-end="238.95">this was taken from the internet a big</span> <span data-start="238.95" data-end="241.92">it was done and then yeah the results of</span> <span data-start="241.92" data-end="244.5">a link of a pretty cool because the work</span> <span

irrespective of if it's a</span> <span data-start="726.949" data-end="728.839">leap motion or anything we need to</span> <span data-start="728.839" data-end="730.339">understand as to how the

data-end="753.879">they want to yeah its left at them yes</span> <span data-start="753.879" data-end="757.129">there would be like few 2d or 3d cameras</span> <span data-start="757.129"

data-end="763.529">and so this USB controller reads the</span> <span data-start="763.529" data-end="765.959">sensor data the next what happens this</span> <span data-start="765.959" data-end="769.62">data is stored in local memory next data</span> <span data-start="769.62" data-end="773.27">is then streamed by our USB to the SDK</span> <span data-start="773.27" data-end="776.31">it is the streaming thing which is of</span> <span data-start="776.31" data-end="778.38">prime importance and we need to</span> <span data-start="778.38" data-end="780.42">understand what happens when we actually</span> <span data-start="780.42" data-end="787.29">do the streaming so to understand more</span> <span data-start="787.29" data-end="795.13">about how the sleep ocean would work</span> <span data-start="795.14" data-end="798.39">yeah so what happens here is we have</span> <span data-start="798.39" data-end="800.55">this USB controller and then there is</span> <span data-start="800.55" data-end="802.11">sleep service running in there</span> <span data-start="802.11" data-end="805.589">now once the USB controller reads the</span> <span data-start="805.589" data-end="807.3">sensor data stores it in local memory</span> <span data-start="807.3" data-end="809.279">and then again streams it back to the</span> <span data-start="809.279" data-end="811.95">usb so what happens is once the image</span> <span data-start="811.95" data-end="815.1">data is streamed to your computer then</span> <span data-start="815.1" data-end="817.86">the whole of this mat world

data-end="843.329">data to the SDK so in this case what</span> <span data-start="843.329" data-end="845.13">happens is there's a sleep service and</span> <span data-start="845.13" data-end="847.579">the other good thing is all of these</span> <span data-start="847.579" data-end="850.589">devices they are connected to the USB</span> <span data-start="850.589"
