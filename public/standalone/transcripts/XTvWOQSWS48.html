<p><span data-start="147.95" data-end="156.09">The best part about doing a slight check from the 1990s is you can use the animations you</span> <span data-start="156.09" data-end="161.45">never thought possible and taste goes out.</span> <span data-start="161.45" data-end="166.629">Let's remember what it was like in 1996.</span> <span data-start="166.629" data-end="172.51">The popular cellphone at the time did not have a head phone Jack.</span> <span data-start="172.51" data-end="176.01">We walked around with digital pets.</span> <span data-start="176.01" data-end="179.93">We neglected the digital pets.</span> <span data-start="179.93" data-end="189.23">We cloned a sheep and the Beatles.</span> <span data-start="189.23" data-end="190.319">And this happened.</span> <span data-start="190.319" data-end="198.49">Rachel gave us a taste yesterday of some of the wonderment that was the web in the 1990s</span> <span data-start="198.49" data-end="200.72">from a very cultural standpoint.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="200.72" data-end="212.26">I myself was a web developer at age 12 and made a website of Mortal Combat cheap codes.</span> <span data-start="212.26" data-end="216.92">I had a bunch of animated gifs for no reason.</span> <span data-start="216.92" data-end="218.459">Little to no concern for accessibility.</span> <span data-start="218.459" data-end="224.159">It took about three minutes to download the assets and played a music file without the</span> <span data-start="224.159" data-end="235.73">user's content — like the web pages in 2017!</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="307.219" data-end="309.069">You laugh at the marquee magazine.</span> <span data-start="309.069" data-end="311.55">It still works in Chrome today.</span> <span data-start="311.55" data-end="317.44">It can be used, if that is the designer aesthetic that you're going for.</span> <span data-start="317.44" data-end="318.669">The page got on a web ring.</span> <span data-start="318.669" data-end="319.759">That was great.</span> <span data-start="319.759" data-end="328.039">I got listed on a sub directory on Yahoo and you might say a web ring, who needs more than</span> <span data-start="328.039" data-end="333.71">one mortal code cheat code website?</span> <span data-start="333.71" data-end="337.18">I was 12.</span> <span data-start="337.18" data-end="340.189">Try to stay on topic and focus.</span> <span data-start="340.189" data-end="346.99">Keep that in mind next time you might want to write a think piece about JavaScript fatigue!</span> <span data-start="346.99" data-end="354.139">So the hit counter hit 100, which is very impressive considering that I was paying by</span> <span data-start="354.139" data-end="360.139">minute so it was time for a redesign.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="360.139" data-end="367.52">Going through and updating the tags can pest be described in this stock photograph.</span> <span data-start="367.52" data-end="370.61">To give you a sense for those who didn't have to update a page from the 1990s, it was like</span> <span data-start="370.61" data-end="374.559">migrating from one version of Angular to the next!</span> <span data-start="374.559" data-end="380.569">Luckily, there were frames so you had isolated components that you could cash with their</span> <span data-start="380.569" data-end="381.569">own style.</span> <span data-start="381.569" data-end="388.11">Again, you laugh but still supported in Chrome.</span> <span data-start="388.11" data-end="397.49">The things that, the — some of the style sheets today existed at the time but I was unaware</span> <span data-start="397.49" data-end="399.889">of them.</span> <span data-start="399.889" data-end="406.36">The first web browser, the one developed at CERN by Tim Berners-Lee — you might know him</span> <span data-start="406.36" data-end="412.05">as a web developer! — actually had support for this thing called style sheets.</span> <span data-start="412.05" data-end="416.81">There wasn't a formal shared syntax but the browser itself supported this idea that you</span> <span data-start="416.81" data-end="419.11">could define what all the styles should look like.</span> <span data-start="419.11" data-end="425.589">In fact, the voila browser was one of the first browsers to implement this and ship</span> <span data-start="425.589" data-end="426.589">it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="426.589" data-end="435.879">It is very hard to find screen shots from the early 1990s, by the way.</span> <span data-start="435.879" data-end="445.61">Mosaic browser took a step back and didn't allow users to use style sheets.</span> <span data-start="445.61" data-end="452.069">I noticed that Mosiac renders something different than links and I wonder if I can have any</span> <span data-start="452.069" data-end="454.629">control over that.</span> <span data-start="454.629" data-end="460.199">To which the response was, "In fact, it has been a constant source of delight for me over</span> <span data-start="460.199" data-end="467.12">the past year to tell hordes of people who want to strap themselves and control the way</span> <span data-start="467.12" data-end="473.349">your document that would be trivial in every other common text processing environment.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="473.349" data-end="477.149">Sorry, you're screwed.".</span> <span data-start="477.149" data-end="481.909">the idea of style sheets was that the browser could have some say what an-1 should look</span> <span data-start="481.909" data-end="483.77">like in a paragraph.</span> <span data-start="483.77" data-end="490.889">Ideally, the user could do that until someone sent a reset CSS in there.</span> <span data-start="490.889" data-end="499.879">Netscape supported this, still in modern browsers like Firefox.</span> <span data-start="499.879" data-end="505.979">There was a third group of people who wanted a say over their style at the time.</span> <span data-start="505.979" data-end="512.38">Authors like yourself and people like me with important Mortal Combat web pages.</span> <span data-start="512.38" data-end="516.63">Not to say these people could be trusted.</span> <span data-start="516.63" data-end="520.39">This is a website I designed in 2004.</span> <span data-start="520.39" data-end="525.139">So there is no accounting for taste when people got access to these style sheets.</span> <span data-start="525.139" data-end="533.329">There were as many ten different implementations of style sheets at the time.</span> <span data-start="533.329" data-end="540.18">We will talk about two of them — CSS and JavaScript style sheets.</span> <span data-start="540.18" data-end="551.8">There was no logo for, and found fair to grasp the worst possible logo for CSS.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="551.8" data-end="557.35">They came about in Netscape 4.0.</span> <span data-start="557.35" data-end="562.93">That was the only time they were seen in the wild.</span> <span data-start="562.93" data-end="569.01">Let's look what these style sheets look like.</span> <span data-start="569.01" data-end="571.449">Let's leave, and here we go.</span> <span data-start="571.449" data-end="575.11">We have a modern web browser, and some mark-up.</span> <span data-start="575.11" data-end="578.69">So there is some tasting notes here.</span> <span data-start="578.69" data-end="584.41">You will notice that we have a link, a still sheet link, but it goes to this JS immediately</span> <span data-start="584.41" data-end="585.41">of a CSS.</span> <span data-start="585.41" data-end="589.959">That is the first clue that you might be using JavaScript style sheets.</span> <span data-start="589.959" data-end="599.62">After that, we have some very non-exciting mark-up, careful readers will notice the "segum</span> <span data-start="599.62" data-end="605.75">ipsum", a little bit of form along those lines.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="605.75" data-end="611.12">One thing that I learned along the way is that there was no document.element.get.id</span> <span data-start="611.12" data-end="612.529">yet.</span> <span data-start="612.529" data-end="619.459">In fact, Netscape through away the DOM after it rendered it and showed the original version</span> <span data-start="619.459" data-end="622.459">there so it limited a lot what you could do at the time.</span> <span data-start="622.459" data-end="627.11">Let's play around with it a second.</span> <span data-start="627.11" data-end="636.92">We can see that there is nothing right now but we could theoretically write, "Document.</span> <span data-start="636.92" data-end="642.019">Tags H1."</span> <span data-start="642.019" data-end="643.38">Colour is red.</span> <span data-start="643.38" data-end="644.38">Cool.</span> <span data-start="644.38" data-end="646.66">Let's go ahead and refresh that.</span> <span data-start="646.66" data-end="652.46">And you see that there are lovely H1 turns red.</span> <span data-start="652.46" data-end="653.779">Other things that we might want to do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="653.779" data-end="658.75">For instance, in the notes, they said make sure that your fonts are 24 pixels so everyone</span> <span data-start="658.75" data-end="659.75">can see them.</span> <span data-start="659.75" data-end="662.18">Let's put that in as well.</span> <span data-start="662.18" data-end="664.35">You can see we can style individual tags.</span> <span data-start="664.35" data-end="666.48">So then, I know CSS, right?</span> <span data-start="666.48" data-end="671.24">I don't want to use dots for classes, how do we do that?</span> <span data-start="671.24" data-end="672.72">We had a slightly different way of doing that.</span> <span data-start="672.72" data-end="679.16">We could say document — and the document was actually arbitrary, it was window, it was</span> <span data-start="679.16" data-end="681.079">a global at the time.</span> <span data-start="681.079" data-end="687.75">We could say classes and we could say I believe that it was called first, our first paragraph.</span> <span data-start="687.75" data-end="690.6">You have to say what kind of tag that would be.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="690.6" data-end="698.21">You could say a P and then you could say background colour, weee!</span> <span data-start="698.21" data-end="699.21">Equals green.</span> <span data-start="699.21" data-end="700.35">I don't know, why not?</span> <span data-start="700.35" data-end="701.759">We've seen my taste already.</span> <span data-start="701.759" data-end="703.439">It can't hurt.</span> <span data-start="703.439" data-end="704.56">Save that.</span> <span data-start="704.56" data-end="707">This editor is from the 1990s.</span> <span data-start="707" data-end="710.29">It is not funny!</span> <span data-start="710.29" data-end="716.54">If you wanted to get everything with a class at first, which is the only one, you could</span> <span data-start="716.54" data-end="718.529">say Al-tags in this situation.</span> <span data-start="718.529" data-end="721.42">Cool — all tags in this situation.</span> <span data-start="721.42" data-end="725.04">JavaScript style sheets had other interesting things.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="725.04" data-end="727.73">They had variables.</span> <span data-start="727.73" data-end="738.189">So I could say bar colour is equal to green, and I could use that as well.</span> <span data-start="738.189" data-end="743.93">All right.</span> <span data-start="743.93" data-end="746.93">And you can see that works as well.</span> <span data-start="746.93" data-end="756.91">We had variables, all the JavaScript programming language available to us.</span> <span data-start="756.91" data-end="763.79">You could even, if you really wanted to, add a little bit of uncertainty to your web page,</span> <span data-start="763.79" data-end="764.92">right?</span> <span data-start="764.92" data-end="770.339">You could say, "Hey, give me a random number and round it to 0 or 1 and use in a as the</span> <span data-start="770.339" data-end="777.98">background colour of the page."</span> <span data-start="777.98" data-end="784.329">Sometimes it would be black and sometimes white.</span> <span data-start="784.329" data-end="786.24">You could set the variables and use it altogether.</span> <span data-start="786.24" data-end="794.19">You could say do you want to implement a dark mode which was very popular in like 2010.</span> <span data-start="794.19" data-end="796.279">Go ahead and do that as well.</span> <span data-start="796.279" data-end="802.509">And now if it was in dark mode, you got these different colours versus if that was not set</span> <span data-start="802.509" data-end="803.509">to true.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="803.509" data-end="808.85">In fact, you could do some interesting things because you had stuff like "confirm" so you</span> <span data-start="808.85" data-end="813.189">could ask the user did they want to go back to dark mode, and you could style it based</span> <span data-start="813.189" data-end="817.24">on user input.</span> <span data-start="817.24" data-end="823.639">If writing tags and documents every time was too verbose, we could go ahead and use everyone's</span> <span data-start="823.639" data-end="829.459">friend, the "with" key word in JavaScript and get the same basic effect as well.</span> <span data-start="829.459" data-end="837.41">There were some interesting things you could do as well where the page was evaluated — it's</span> <span data-start="837.41" data-end="841.389">hard to tell because I don't have any dev tools and there are no events or anything</span> <span data-start="841.389" data-end="846.69">like that, but here we will say, when this style sheet loads, let's measure the inner</span> <span data-start="846.69" data-end="852.62">width, and, if it is less than 600, let's make the background colour red otherwise make</span> <span data-start="852.62" data-end="853.62">it blue.</span> </p>
