<p><span data-start="11.25" data-end="12.349">I work for Mozilla.</span> <span data-start="12.349" data-end="13.86">I'm a web engineer.</span> <span data-start="13.86" data-end="18.8">These days, I work on Open Innovation, and I will talk about that in a second.</span> <span data-start="18.8" data-end="24.17">The project I'm working on is called Common Voice, which is Mozilla's initiative to crowd</span> <span data-start="24.17" data-end="28.75">source a large set of data voices to be used in speech technology.</span> <span data-start="28.75" data-end="32.07">We're trying to solve the data problem for machine learning and voice.</span> <span data-start="32.07" data-end="36.22">We're currently working on multiple languages meaning languages other than English.</span> <span data-start="36.22" data-end="41.93">If you're interested in collecting speech data for your language, reach out to me.</span> <span data-start="41.93" data-end="45.75">I have some contact info there.</span> <span data-start="45.75" data-end="55.62">Today, we're going to talk about voice HTML, the web and app stores.</span> <span data-start="55.62" data-end="61.25">We're going to do a brief history of the web, and then get into my VoiceHTML proposal, like</span> <span data-start="61.25" data-end="66.49">I promised, and then a case study on booking a flight with VoiceHTML.</span> <span data-start="66.49" data-end="71.93">I will try to get into Q&A if we have time for that.</span> <span data-start="71.93" data-end="73.4">Disclaimers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="73.4" data-end="79.07">I hate doing them but I will need to this time.</span> <span data-start="79.07" data-end="86.27">If you read the pitch, the pitch that I gave you was more of click bait to get people here</span> <span data-start="86.27" data-end="88.53">interested in voice and interested in the internet.</span> <span data-start="88.53" data-end="91.979">I made some bold statements there that I'm going to propose a new protocol and propose</span> <span data-start="91.979" data-end="93.909">a case study on the protocol.</span> <span data-start="93.909" data-end="97.9">It might not be the protocol you might think.</span> <span data-start="97.9" data-end="99.369">This is not a technical talk.</span> <span data-start="99.369" data-end="102.56">I'm not going to release a library or an API.</span> <span data-start="102.56" data-end="105.229">This is going to be more about trust.</span> <span data-start="105.229" data-end="110.659">I hope that you will bear with me as we talk about this today, because this is maybe a</span> <span data-start="110.659" data-end="112.26">little different than what you're expecting.</span> <span data-start="112.26" data-end="114.32">I hope it will be good.</span> <span data-start="114.32" data-end="115.78">VoiceHTML.</span> <span data-start="115.78" data-end="123.759">So, around the end of 2016, I had finished my last very successful project at Mozilla</span> <span data-start="123.759" data-end="128.2">called Firefox OS — you might have heard of it!</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="128.2" data-end="130.81">I moved over to the Open Innovation team.</span> <span data-start="130.81" data-end="135.86">What I was doing was trying to what Open Innovation team does is reach out to other teams within</span> <span data-start="135.86" data-end="142.75">Mozilla and get them to be more successful by embracing open practices.</span> <span data-start="142.75" data-end="151.67">I was working on a project called Dynotank which is an ideas contest.</span> <span data-start="151.67" data-end="158.7">Pretty much anybody who was interested in Dynotank can submit ideas to Dynotank and</span> <span data-start="158.7" data-end="164.69">then we have a team of executives who you would pitch to if we like your idea, and then</span> <span data-start="164.69" data-end="168.02">the top ideas get selected to be worked on.</span> <span data-start="168.02" data-end="171.62">For working on it be we would do a week of a design-thinking design sprint.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="171.62" data-end="175.459">We would have about eight different people from all sorts of different walks of life</span> <span data-start="175.459" data-end="181.18">and skill sets, and we would investigate the problem and see if we can build anything there.</span> <span data-start="181.18" data-end="184.709">One of those ideas was querying the voice-enabled internet.</span> <span data-start="184.709" data-end="188.92">How can the internet and voice play well together?</span> <span data-start="188.92" data-end="197.39">One of the concepts that came out of the design sprint — you can see it here a bit, was VoiceHTML.</span> <span data-start="197.39" data-end="204.68">That text says, "Voice analogy of HTML allows simple authoring of apps that can understand</span> <span data-start="204.68" data-end="206.84">speech and speak."</span> <span data-start="206.84" data-end="208.19">Everyone loved this idea.</span> <span data-start="208.19" data-end="210.92">It had by far the most votes.</span> <span data-start="210.92" data-end="214.39">Those little blue dots are votes.</span> <span data-start="214.39" data-end="215.93">We really wanted to explore this.</span> <span data-start="215.93" data-end="223.67">What I would like to do is explore the topic of VoiceHTML by exploring what the web is,</span> <span data-start="223.67" data-end="228.709">so we're going to do like a brief history here.</span> <span data-start="228.709" data-end="231.019">Okay.</span> <span data-start="231.019" data-end="232.47">So let's start with the web.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="232.47" data-end="233.489">Why do we like it?</span> <span data-start="233.489" data-end="234.84">Why is it so great?</span> <span data-start="234.84" data-end="239.459">Why would anybody want to use the web over competing models which we will talk about</span> <span data-start="239.459" data-end="240.459">in a second?</span> <span data-start="240.459" data-end="246.459">As a developer, the apps you make are easy to make, they're cross-platform, you don't</span> <span data-start="246.459" data-end="252.36">have to worry about gatekeepers, there's no revenue-sharing model or no approval process.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="252.36" data-end="254.599">As a user, we love the web.</span> <span data-start="254.599" data-end="256.38">That's what we use on desktop.</span> <span data-start="256.38" data-end="259.9">Your computers are now basically browsers with a couple of other apps.</span> <span data-start="259.9" data-end="262.119">The reason we like it is work flow.</span> <span data-start="262.119" data-end="268.57">We have multiple tabs open, we have email, calendar, looking up concert tickets while</span> <span data-start="268.57" data-end="275.9">Wikipedia-ing things and it is seamless and quick to get things done.</span> <span data-start="275.9" data-end="280.039">We love that we don't have to install.</span> <span data-start="280.039" data-end="282.029">And these last two points are really important.</span> <span data-start="282.029" data-end="285.949">We will talk about them and focus on them today.</span> <span data-start="285.949" data-end="288.509">There's an established trust model for the internet.</span> <span data-start="288.509" data-end="290.08">We know how to trust it.</span> <span data-start="290.08" data-end="295.759">We put our credit card information in there, and our social security tax ID in there, so</span> <span data-start="295.759" data-end="296.759">we trust it.</span> <span data-start="296.759" data-end="300.18">It's taken as while to get there, and I would like to explore that a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="300.18" data-end="302.729">We have choice: there's a ton of choice on the internet.</span> <span data-start="302.729" data-end="309">I can choose the device that I'm using — I can use a desktop, a phone, I can use any</span> <span data-start="309" data-end="311.21">number of IOT devices.</span> <span data-start="311.21" data-end="315.129">You can choose what browser, what sites you're using.</span> <span data-start="315.129" data-end="318.689">The choice is really paramount to what the web is.</span> <span data-start="318.689" data-end="323.599">Okay, but, the web is not the only model that is extremely successful right now.</span> <span data-start="323.599" data-end="328.43">There are other models out there, and I think we need to examine a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="328.43" data-end="332.97">Because, with all these great things, why would anyone choose anything different?</span> <span data-start="332.97" data-end="335.669">Let's look at it.</span> <span data-start="335.669" data-end="337.839">App stores: that's the other big model, right?</span> <span data-start="337.839" data-end="342.089">An app store, love it or hate it, they're extremely successful, and actually pretty</span> <span data-start="342.089" data-end="343.099">nice.</span> <span data-start="343.099" data-end="349.909">Let's talk about why they're nice: as a developer, the SDK and the IPA moves fast.</span> <span data-start="349.909" data-end="351.289">There's no consensus needed.</span> <span data-start="351.289" data-end="356.27">A single group of people can decide and a lot of people follow suit.</span> <span data-start="356.27" data-end="359.08">That's good as a developer because things move very quickly.</span> <span data-start="359.08" data-end="363.93">I don't know if any of you are iOS developers but you get a lot of updates and it's very</span> <span data-start="363.93" data-end="364.93">exciting.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="364.93" data-end="367.919">Next, you have a direct channel to your users.</span> <span data-start="367.919" data-end="371.059">You know exactly where they are because there's only one place they can be.</span> <span data-start="371.059" data-end="373.649">It's not like the web.</span> <span data-start="373.649" data-end="379.599">Then performance: you can optimise specifically for your platform much easier than this kind</span> <span data-start="379.599" data-end="384.569">of cross-platform that we love about the web.</span> <span data-start="384.569" data-end="387.11">As a user now, why do users like app stores?</span> <span data-start="387.11" data-end="388.33">There's an easy trust model.</span> <span data-start="388.33" data-end="393.589">I can trust that app store and everything that comes out of that app store, I can trust.</span> <span data-start="393.589" data-end="401.159">The other day, I had to make a meme picture I sent to my family, and I went and downloaded</span> <span data-start="401.159" data-end="402.669">five apps from the app store.</span> <span data-start="402.669" data-end="406.099">I didn't care or worry about it, I just did it.</span> <span data-start="406.099" data-end="411.919">Whether or not that's a good thing, it is nice as a user not to have to think about</span> <span data-start="411.919" data-end="413.84">what I'm visiting and what I'm doing.</span> <span data-start="413.84" data-end="418.749">Also, the content is curated and tailored more me, and also for the store.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="418.749" data-end="424.209">I generally like the stuff that comes up, the stuff that surfaced to the top of the</span> <span data-start="424.209" data-end="425.209">app store, of app stores.</span> <span data-start="425.209" data-end="426.209">Then of course performance.</span> <span data-start="426.209" data-end="427.209">I love performance.</span> <span data-start="427.209" data-end="431.759">The web is great, it's moving along, but it doesn't hold a candle to a native app.</span> <span data-start="431.759" data-end="436.46">If you're making a video game, which I used to do in a former life, you wouldn't do the</span> <span data-start="436.46" data-end="437.46">web, unfortunately.</span> <span data-start="437.46" data-end="438.46">You wouldn't use HTML/5.</span> <span data-start="438.46" data-end="448.53">You can, but you're getting difficulty getting to the same level as an app, as an app is</span> <span data-start="448.53" data-end="449.53">with default.</span> <span data-start="449.53" data-end="452.77">There is a third value pool that we need to talk about: the owner of that place.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="452.77" data-end="454.56">There is no owner of the web.</span> <span data-start="454.56" data-end="459.169">There are owners of app stores, and, of course, they love it because they get 30 per cent.</span> <span data-start="459.169" data-end="461.159">That's their standard cut.</span> <span data-start="461.159" data-end="464.979">Also, they get to control the experience for their users.</span> <span data-start="464.979" data-end="467.089">They need to show exactly what they see.</span> <span data-start="467.089" data-end="469.65">They can limit competition.</span> <span data-start="469.65" data-end="474.699">If you compete with a business model of someone who owns an app store, they're not going to</span> <span data-start="474.699" data-end="476.05">let you into that app store.</span> <span data-start="476.05" data-end="479.469">This is really important.</span> <span data-start="479.469" data-end="483.469">So we've talked a little bit about the difference between Web and app stores.</span> <span data-start="483.469" data-end="489.36">Let's talk about where this competition came from, and we're going to take a journey back</span> <span data-start="489.36" data-end="490.36">in time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="490.36" data-end="493.149">We will start with 2007.</span> <span data-start="493.149" data-end="494.529">Steve Jobs.</span> <span data-start="494.529" data-end="499.629">Let me just say it: we went native third-party applications on the iPhone.</span> <span data-start="499.629" data-end="505.919">You may not remember, before this time, before he said this, the web was dominant on mobile.</span> <span data-start="505.919" data-end="506.919">Even on iPhone.</span> <span data-start="506.919" data-end="508.659">The iPhone existed before the app store.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="508.659" data-end="516.769">There were a lot of reasons why the web was a great killer app for phones especially because</span> <span data-start="516.769" data-end="518.3">of Steve Jobs, actually.</span> <span data-start="518.3" data-end="523.432">He added a lot of these features you see here — GPS and maps, he did that, actually.</span> <span data-start="523.432" data-end="524.432">He made it really good.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="524.432" data-end="526.24">You can make phone calls.</span> <span data-start="526.24" data-end="529.709">If you see a phone number, you can make a phone call.</span> <span data-start="529.709" data-end="532.399">You can add things to your home screen, like book marking to your home screen.</span> <span data-start="532.399" data-end="534.68">That was a new concept.</span> <span data-start="534.68" data-end="540.139">And then this pinch-to-zoom double tap, it was a way to use desktop web pages on your</span> <span data-start="540.139" data-end="541.139">phone.</span> <span data-start="541.139" data-end="545.87">At the time, there were other phones that were smartphones that had the web, and they</span> <span data-start="545.87" data-end="549.85">weren't a great experience.</span> <span data-start="549.85" data-end="553.75">In the early days, Steve Jobs was really bullish about the mobile web.</span> <span data-start="553.75" data-end="557.23">When he released the iPhone, he said this: what is the developer story?</span> <span data-start="557.23" data-end="558.67">We've got the web, baby.</span> <span data-start="558.67" data-end="561.62">We've got Safari, the best mobile browser out there.</span> <span data-start="561.62" data-end="564.35">He had a reason to be optimistic.</span> <span data-start="564.35" data-end="568.139">It had a great SDK and tooling already.</span> <span data-start="568.139" data-end="569.139">You already had documentation.</span> <span data-start="569.139" data-end="576">You already had this vast distribution platform, you had content discovery figured out.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="576" data-end="577.899">So it's a no-brainer.</span> <span data-start="577.899" data-end="581.41">Then he beat all of the existing browsers that were out there.</span> <span data-start="581.41" data-end="583.43">Look at the Blackberry versus his phone.</span> <span data-start="583.43" data-end="584.889">This was a similar time.</span> <span data-start="584.889" data-end="590.92">He had touch versus scroll wheel, double-touch, bigger screens and incredible performance.</span> <span data-start="590.92" data-end="596.98">For a while, the web was the killer app on the phones.</span> <span data-start="596.98" data-end="598.48">How long was that?</span> <span data-start="598.48" data-end="606.54">Let's look: June 2007, he said, 2.0 applications, and then, October 2007, native app store.</span> <span data-start="606.54" data-end="609.62">That's about three months where the web was amazing on phones.</span> <span data-start="609.62" data-end="613.75">But it was a great time.</span> <span data-start="613.75" data-end="617.25">But however, the iPhone was not the first smartphone.</span> <span data-start="617.25" data-end="622.72">There were other phones that were around before the iPhone, and the web was a killer app.</span> <span data-start="622.72" data-end="625.069">You had the world's knowledge in your pocket.</span> <span data-start="625.069" data-end="629.689">You had transactions; you had vast communities discussing various niche topics.</span> <span data-start="629.689" data-end="631.91">You had to have it on your phone.</span> </p>
