<p><span data-start="59.239" data-end="63.59">It's really easy to get that hello world up and going and, you know, the first couple</span> <span data-start="63.59" data-end="66.19">months of the thing you're trying to build, it's really great.</span> <span data-start="66.19" data-end="72.25">But if you have any amount of success, things get really big, really complex really quickly.</span> <span data-start="72.25" data-end="79.63">So, how do you embrace this idea of simplicity while accounting for inevitable complexity,</span> <span data-start="79.63" data-end="80.63">right?</span> <span data-start="80.63" data-end="83.049">So, we don't want KISS.</span> <span data-start="83.049" data-end="88.08">What I tend to think about is elegance.</span> <span data-start="88.08" data-end="89.08">Right?</span> <span data-start="89.08" data-end="93.32">I think this is what we really mean when we say to keep things simple.</span> <span data-start="93.32" data-end="94.45">Right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="94.45" data-end="99.88">Elegance I define as complexity expressed simply.</span> <span data-start="99.88" data-end="106.259">And the goto metaphor I tend to use is if you think about all of our reality, all the</span> <span data-start="106.259" data-end="108.409">space and all that, it exists, right?</span> <span data-start="108.409" data-end="115.79">There are trillions and trillions of protons and photons whatnot in the universe.</span> <span data-start="115.79" data-end="122.579">They come together to form everything you see around you, stars and planets and meteors.</span> <span data-start="122.579" data-end="125.67">And even you and I, living organisms.</span> <span data-start="125.67" data-end="129.56">That's a hugely complex system.</span> <span data-start="129.56" data-end="137.01">But it's really interesting that all of reality as we understand it today can also be expressed</span> <span data-start="137.01" data-end="139.389">in the language of mathematics.</span> <span data-start="139.389" data-end="141.7">That's an incredibly elegant thing.</span> <span data-start="141.7" data-end="143.09">We don't know why.</span> <span data-start="143.09" data-end="146.73">There's a big argument in, you know, physics about, you know, whether math is real, whether</span> <span data-start="146.73" data-end="147.73">it's not.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="147.73" data-end="148.73">You know?</span> <span data-start="148.73" data-end="149.809">Do you discover math?</span> <span data-start="149.809" data-end="151.199">Or do you invent it?</span> <span data-start="151.199" data-end="155.499">That's a completely different talk out of the realm of my particular expertise.</span> <span data-start="155.499" data-end="159.159">But I think it's really elegant, nonetheless.</span> <span data-start="159.159" data-end="160.159">Don't keep it simple.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="160.159" data-end="161.87">Keep it elegant.</span> <span data-start="161.87" data-end="166.09">So, with that said, what is an abstraction?</span> <span data-start="166.09" data-end="172.719">In this context, I like to think about an abstraction as the degree to which complexity</span> <span data-start="172.719" data-end="174.61">is encapsulated.</span> <span data-start="174.61" data-end="180.379">And going a little bit deeper here, I like to think about things in terms of strong and</span> <span data-start="180.379" data-end="181.379">weak abstractions.</span> <span data-start="181.379" data-end="186.989">When you think about a strong abstraction, it encapsulates a lot of complexity.</span> <span data-start="186.989" data-end="190.44">And this is not necessarily a good thing.</span> <span data-start="190.44" data-end="191.44">Right?</span> <span data-start="191.44" data-end="195.529">There are many times when you don't necessarily want to hide a ton of complexity.</span> <span data-start="195.529" data-end="199.65">When you want to maximize the amount of flexibility you give people who consume your APIs.</span> <span data-start="199.65" data-end="202.719">And we'll talk a little bit about that later.</span> <span data-start="202.719" data-end="208.189">Conversely, a weak abstraction encapsulates very little complexity.</span> <span data-start="208.189" data-end="212.349">And pejorative to the term weak itself, this is not necessarily a bad thing.</span> <span data-start="212.349" data-end="217.669">Sometimes you actually need people to be able to get down to the nuts and bolts of what</span> <span data-start="217.669" data-end="220.879">you're providing them because that's what they need in order to be able to build something</span> <span data-start="220.879" data-end="225.059">on top of your platform.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="304.65" data-end="305.72">All right.</span> <span data-start="305.72" data-end="306.72">Ready?</span> <span data-start="306.72" data-end="310.49">Here's the next one.</span> <span data-start="310.49" data-end="312.46">Picking up context clues.</span> <span data-start="312.46" data-end="318.639">There's some event stuff in here, some listener stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="318.639" data-end="320.879">Anyone want to take a stab?</span> <span data-start="320.879" data-end="327.06">Event on, that's pretty good.</span> <span data-start="327.06" data-end="328.06">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="328.06" data-end="336.18">This is whenever anyone in Node uses an event emitter and calls a .on event, that's what's</span> <span data-start="336.18" data-end="337.19">invoked.</span> <span data-start="337.19" data-end="343.5">Most notably in strings, but also when you're creating HTTP servers and things like that.</span> <span data-start="343.5" data-end="346.05">What about this one?</span> <span data-start="346.05" data-end="347.919">This one might be a little bit easy.</span> <span data-start="347.919" data-end="354.969">This is props in a particular library all over the place.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="354.969" data-end="357.24">React what?</span> <span data-start="357.24" data-end="361.28">React dot?</span> <span data-start="361.28" data-end="363.31">Right.</span> <span data-start="363.31" data-end="364.31">React.createelement.</span> <span data-start="364.31" data-end="367.77">So, somebody's mad.</span> <span data-start="367.77" data-end="370.139">So, what's the point here?</span> <span data-start="370.139" data-end="374.36">The point is to illustrate that, you know, with some context clues you can kind of get</span> <span data-start="374.36" data-end="375.99">an idea of what's going on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="375.99" data-end="382.84">But the fact of the matter is, there's like nothing wrong with this code itself.</span> <span data-start="382.84" data-end="385.93">You know, unless you hate semicolons or whatever.</span> <span data-start="385.93" data-end="392.389">But the idea is that I wanted to illustrate the entropy that's involved in creating the</span> <span data-start="392.389" data-end="394.62">abstractions that you use every day.</span> <span data-start="394.62" data-end="402.36">Someone had to write so you can essentially write this.</span> <span data-start="402.36" data-end="406.12">This doesn't just apply to code either.</span> <span data-start="406.12" data-end="413.069">When you think about abstractions and what they're useful for, they're all over the place.</span> <span data-start="413.069" data-end="415.689">Most notably, when we think about infrastructure, right?</span> <span data-start="415.689" data-end="420.24">This is a big thing that's been happening within the industry really for about the last</span> <span data-start="420.24" data-end="421.24">ten years.</span> <span data-start="421.24" data-end="422.24">A lot of innovation has been happening.</span> <span data-start="422.24" data-end="425.27">But really the last few years is when things really heated up.</span> <span data-start="425.27" data-end="430.469">And I want to talk a bit about going up the abstraction chain to kind of figure out to</span> <span data-start="430.469" data-end="434.86">kind of illustrate exactly why these things are important and the big milestones that</span> <span data-start="434.86" data-end="435.86">we've seen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="435.86" data-end="441.6">So, for those of us who were around when you needed to essentially have access to a physical</span> <span data-start="441.6" data-end="443.99">server to actually deploy something.</span> <span data-start="443.99" data-end="446.699">Whether it's a website or whatever you.</span> <span data-start="446.699" data-end="450.94">This was a very imperative workflow to actually get your stuff deployed, right?</span> <span data-start="450.94" data-end="452.419">Needed to know a lot of things.</span> <span data-start="452.419" data-end="455.939">You needed to know where the server was.</span> <span data-start="455.939" data-end="460.949">You needed to know security considerables to get into the server.</span> <span data-start="460.949" data-end="464.969">You needed to know where on the server to put your deployable artifacts.</span> <span data-start="464.969" data-end="467.84">It was a very, very imperative thing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="467.84" data-end="472.4">And when say you need to know where it was, sometimes that was just in your bedroom, right?</span> <span data-start="472.4" data-end="477.68">So, moving forward a little bit, someone had a great idea to just use virtual machines.</span> <span data-start="477.68" data-end="481.729">The idea is like, forget the hardware, but I do need a computer.</span> <span data-start="481.729" data-end="486.069">And so, began this whole revolution of computer emulation.</span> <span data-start="486.069" data-end="491.02">A whole level of abstraction that was really a game changer in terms of portability.</span> <span data-start="491.02" data-end="497.55">For the first time, really the thing on which your application rely wasn't necessarily the</span> <span data-start="497.55" data-end="501.19">host operating system on which your stack actually ran.</span> <span data-start="501.19" data-end="503.78">And this was huge.</span> <span data-start="503.78" data-end="509.229">So, moving up a little bit, we talk about containers a bit, right?</span> <span data-start="509.229" data-end="514.63">Forget the computer, all I really need are compute resources, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="514.63" data-end="517.339">This is about compute resource emulation, right?</span> <span data-start="517.339" data-end="518.599">I don't need a UI.</span> <span data-start="518.599" data-end="521.18">I don't need a start menu, that's kind of dumb.</span> <span data-start="521.18" data-end="526.38">What I really need is a file system, CPU and, you know, memory.</span> <span data-start="526.38" data-end="527.38">Other stuff.</span> <span data-start="527.38" data-end="529.39">And that's what I need to run my application.</span> <span data-start="529.39" data-end="535.75">And so, the abstraction gets a bit stronger.</span> <span data-start="535.75" data-end="538.1">Platform as a service.</span> <span data-start="538.1" data-end="544.44">This was really great as well because it allowed you to not even have to think about what your</span> <span data-start="544.44" data-end="546.09">application was running on.</span> <span data-start="546.09" data-end="548.21">That was irrelevant most of the time, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="548.21" data-end="550.13">And there are caveats here as well.</span> <span data-start="550.13" data-end="554.25">But the idea is, the only thing you ship is an application.</span> <span data-start="554.25" data-end="556.589">And someone else worries about everything else.</span> <span data-start="556.589" data-end="559.63">That was your interface to your deployments.</span> <span data-start="559.63" data-end="560.63">Right?</span> <span data-start="560.63" data-end="567.04">Forget the compute resources, mostly, here's my app running.</span> <span data-start="567.04" data-end="571.779">Which brings us to the current revolution, which is serverless, right?</span> <span data-start="571.779" data-end="574.56">Forget the application and the computer.</span> <span data-start="574.56" data-end="576.29">I'm gonna ship business logic.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="576.29" data-end="579.49">I want you to take care of essentially everything else.</span> <span data-start="579.49" data-end="581.26">And that's kind of where we are now.</span> <span data-start="581.26" data-end="588.899">And you see this continuously evolving and getting more and more strong as an abstraction.</span> <span data-start="588.899" data-end="592.88">And you see where the benefits are for getting things up and running really closely.</span> <span data-start="592.88" data-end="598.61">But you also encounter situations where these strong abstractions don't really make sense.</span> <span data-start="598.61" data-end="602.009">Other people really need to use other things.</span> <span data-start="602.009" data-end="605.35">So, what can go wrong?</span> <span data-start="605.35" data-end="608.71">Well, short answer is: A lot.</span> <span data-start="608.71" data-end="613.279">So, breaking changes.</span> <span data-start="613.279" data-end="618.44">When you're not focusing on thinking about this up front, at least to some extent, you</span> <span data-start="618.44" data-end="623.37">really run the risk of having a lot of breaking changes occur when you are developing your</span> <span data-start="623.37" data-end="625.99">software, right?</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="679.05" data-end="684.69">This created a lot of tech debt in the weight and there was no clear path to actually cleaning</span> <span data-start="684.69" data-end="692.23">it up without essentially a complete refactor or rewrite.</span> <span data-start="692.23" data-end="693.54">User confusion.</span> <span data-start="693.54" data-end="696.8">So, this one is a bit less obvious.</span> <span data-start="696.8" data-end="703.7">But if you get your abstraction wrong, or if it's not ideal, there's gonna be a lot</span> <span data-start="703.7" data-end="708.92">of confusion within the communities that consume your software.</span> <span data-start="708.92" data-end="716.899">I remember back when the AngularJS 1 landed, and it was absolutely a game change fetor</span> <span data-start="716.899" data-end="718.57">frontend environment.</span> <span data-start="718.57" data-end="726.149">And I remember they demonstrated the twoway data binding and it was like amazing.</span> <span data-start="726.149" data-end="727.94">And this was great.</span> <span data-start="727.94" data-end="729.13">But then something happened.</span> <span data-start="729.13" data-end="732.94">I guess about 24 months had gone by.</span> <span data-start="732.94" data-end="737.88">Companies had started adopting AngularJS as like, you know, something that was real.</span> <span data-start="737.88" data-end="742.87">And then people actually started building really big, robust web applications using</span> <span data-start="742.87" data-end="745.23">AngularJS.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="745.23" data-end="750.36">And then what happens is, you get to a place where you need to make a deployment or you're</span> <span data-start="750.36" data-end="751.72">getting close to the end.</span> <span data-start="751.72" data-end="753.6">But you have some last-minute requirement changes.</span> <span data-start="753.6" data-end="756.29">It happens all the time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="756.29" data-end="763.329">But you've architected your application in such a way that your directives need to communicate</span> <span data-start="763.329" data-end="767.26">with each other in a very elegant way.</span> <span data-start="767.26" data-end="769.021">But you didn't architect, you didn't account for this, right?</span> <span data-start="769.021" data-end="774.19">This is before we had sort, you know before redux was really a thing and we had like really</span> <span data-start="774.19" data-end="777.72">mature sort of like state management solutions on the frontend.</span> <span data-start="777.72" data-end="783.24">So, what would happen is people would try to get two directives to talk to each other</span> <span data-start="783.24" data-end="784.24">very quickly.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="784.24" data-end="790.15">And instead of having to refactor the way the communication messaging happened, they</span> <span data-start="790.15" data-end="794.069">would adopt what I refer to as the spray and pray architecture.</span> <span data-start="794.069" data-end="798.339">And you take advantage of Angular's dependency injection.</span> <span data-start="798.339" data-end="804.449">You inject root scope and you do a rootscope.broadcast and throw out data out into the either a hope</span> <span data-start="804.449" data-end="806.01">something receives.</span> <span data-start="806.01" data-end="808.529">I know some of you have done it.</span> <span data-start="808.529" data-end="810.48">You look guilty, heads down.</span> <span data-start="810.48" data-end="812.98">I know, I have been there.</span> <span data-start="812.98" data-end="816.19">This was not Angular's fault.</span> <span data-start="816.19" data-end="822.16">This was the abstraction we were given in order to build our applications.</span> <span data-start="822.16" data-end="826.56">And it just so happen when is trying to scale out he's applications, this was the challenges</span> <span data-start="826.56" data-end="827.56">we ran into.</span> <span data-start="827.56" data-end="833.709">In fact, a lot of these issues were some of the early inspirations for, you know, architect</span> <span data-start="833.709" data-end="837.47">for libraries like React and Vue, et cetera.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="837.47" data-end="840.389">And these are the types of things that can happen, right?</span> <span data-start="840.389" data-end="842.98">This is not bashing Angular 1.x.</span> <span data-start="842.98" data-end="844.66">I'm a big fan.</span> <span data-start="844.66" data-end="848.17">I don't think it deserves half the flak it received.</span> <span data-start="848.17" data-end="851.57">So, the reason you're all here.</span> <span data-start="851.57" data-end="853.36">Where is my sweet spot?</span> <span data-start="853.36" data-end="860.98">How can I figure out where I need to be placing my abstractions such that it benefits both</span> <span data-start="860.98" data-end="863.25">myself and my users?</span> <span data-start="863.25" data-end="868.48">So, opinions, opinions, opinions, warning.</span> <span data-start="868.48" data-end="877.06">So, the big thing I think everyone should really think about is flexibility versus ease</span> <span data-start="877.06" data-end="878.06">of use.</span> <span data-start="878.06" data-end="879.06">Right?</span> <span data-start="879.06" data-end="880.06">This is the big one.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="880.06" data-end="881.72">This is going to be your ultimate tradeoff.</span> <span data-start="881.72" data-end="887.55">The idea is the more flexible you are, you're gonna tend to sacrifice some ease of use,</span> <span data-start="887.55" data-end="888.55">right?</span> <span data-start="888.55" data-end="890.87">This is gonna be your weaker abstractions with flexibility.</span> <span data-start="890.87" data-end="892.69">This is gonna be your low-level stuff.</span> <span data-start="892.69" data-end="897.379">This is gonna be your WebGLs of the world which are really great.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="897.379" data-end="902.18">But someone like me, not a 3D programmer, I need something higher level.</span> <span data-start="902.18" data-end="903.97">I need the 3JSs of the world.</span> <span data-start="903.97" data-end="907.37">Or higher than that, truth be told.</span> <span data-start="907.37" data-end="909.75">Versus ease of use, right?</span> <span data-start="909.75" data-end="913.76">You are a 3D programmer and you really know what you're doing, a lot of the helpers out</span> <span data-start="913.76" data-end="917">there are just gonna get in your way more than anything else.</span> <span data-start="917" data-end="918.31">Maybe that's not what you need.</span> <span data-start="918.31" data-end="923.69">So, what you have to do is figure out where your users are and make sure you're meeting</span> <span data-start="923.69" data-end="927.79">them where they are.</span> <span data-start="927.79" data-end="930.529">Similar to that, you have to consider your audience, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="930.529" data-end="932.5">Who are you building for?</span> <span data-start="932.5" data-end="934.529">Is this internal or external?</span> <span data-start="934.529" data-end="935.529">Right?</span> <span data-start="935.529" data-end="937.33">Internal you can get away with a lot of stuff.</span> <span data-start="937.33" data-end="942.8">If it's external and people are gonna be using this either as a product or maybe just an</span> <span data-start="942.8" data-end="947.009">open source tool, you need to make sure that you have that correct understanding.</span> <span data-start="947.009" data-end="950.19">What are people using your stuff to build with?</span> <span data-start="950.19" data-end="953.519">You can't control that, but it may come into play.</span> <span data-start="953.519" data-end="959.129">This is when you really get intimate with the users and figure out what they're doing.</span> <span data-start="959.129" data-end="961.48">Platforms.</span> <span data-start="961.48" data-end="963.209">This is a good one as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="963.209" data-end="967.829">Some platforms and languages lend themselves better to certain levels of abstraction.</span> <span data-start="967.829" data-end="972.339">Practitioners of a language might regularly work on a certain level, right?</span> <span data-start="972.339" data-end="977.569">JavaScript developers generally want objects and strings, that sort of thing.</span> <span data-start="977.569" data-end="978.79">Maybe some arrays.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="978.79" data-end="986.61">Go Lang, they want buffers and errors, have you looked at go code?</span> <span data-start="986.61" data-end="987.73">Rust developers want jobs.</span> <span data-start="987.73" data-end="988.73">Just kidding.</span> <span data-start="988.73" data-end="989.73">That's a troll.</span> <span data-start="989.73" data-end="992.329">I love Rust.</span> <span data-start="992.329" data-end="994.66">It's a great language.</span> <span data-start="994.66" data-end="998.009">Life span.</span> <span data-start="998.009" data-end="999.24">This is a big one as well.</span> <span data-start="999.24" data-end="1000.24">Right?</span> <span data-start="1000.24" data-end="1002.73">This is very similar to, you know, the breaking changes.</span> <span data-start="1002.73" data-end="1007.54">If you're very up front with your audience and your users about the type of timeline</span> <span data-start="1007.54" data-end="1012">they can expect for support, this is gonna inform the level at which you actually, you</span> <span data-start="1012" data-end="1013.67">know, write your software.</span> <span data-start="1013.67" data-end="1016.8">That's gonna be really important.</span> <span data-start="1016.8" data-end="1021.35">So, coming to wrap things up a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1021.35" data-end="1024.089">You want to make sure you focus on elegance.</span> <span data-start="1024.089" data-end="1026.19">And not just simplicity.</span> <span data-start="1026.19" data-end="1027.19">Simplicity won't scale.</span> <span data-start="1027.19" data-end="1030.54">No one's gonna buy anything that's simple, right?</span> <span data-start="1030.54" data-end="1032.95">Because anyone can reproduce your work.</span> <span data-start="1032.95" data-end="1036.98">If you're gonna be successful, you're gonna inevitably head towards complexity.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1036.98" data-end="1041.97">The best thing downing is account for it in a way that allows you to build a competitive</span> <span data-start="1041.97" data-end="1042.97">product.</span> <span data-start="1042.97" data-end="1048.209">But also ensures that your users are happy.</span> <span data-start="1048.209" data-end="1053.13">Think in terms of weak or strong abstractions and when is the right time to use either one.</span> <span data-start="1053.13" data-end="1055.87">Sometimes you need to support the whole spectrum, right?</span> <span data-start="1055.87" data-end="1057.37">That's something that's really important.</span> <span data-start="1057.37" data-end="1060.01">That's gonna take a lot of resources, it's gonna take a lot of time.</span> <span data-start="1060.01" data-end="1064.08">Maybe you start at one end of the spectrum and you end up on the other.</span> <span data-start="1064.08" data-end="1067.15">This is a decision that you have to make.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1067.15" data-end="1072.44">So, remember the tradeoffs of flexibility and ease of use.</span> <span data-start="1072.44" data-end="1074.11">Very similar to the previous point.</span> <span data-start="1074.11" data-end="1075.18">There are real tradeoffs here.</span> <span data-start="1075.18" data-end="1079.12">And you need to make them as close to up front as you can.</span> <span data-start="1079.12" data-end="1083.25">But not necessarily completely.</span> <span data-start="1083.25" data-end="1086.31">Think about the consequences of getting it wrong.</span> <span data-start="1086.31" data-end="1092.42">Frequent breaking changes, tech debt, user confusion, there's nothing you can do to avoid</span> <span data-start="1092.42" data-end="1095.2">all of these things, unfortunately.</span> <span data-start="1095.2" data-end="1098.88">Part of the planning up front is to make sure that you know that you're gonna accumulate</span> <span data-start="1098.88" data-end="1099.88">that tech debt.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1099.88" data-end="1102.89">So, just have a plan to kind of pay it down, right?</span> <span data-start="1102.89" data-end="1105.99">Or if you're gonna have frequent breaking changes, maybe you want to launch in a beta</span> <span data-start="1105.99" data-end="1109.4">for a while and make sure people understand that up front.</span> <span data-start="1109.4" data-end="1113.751">If you know this is gonna be crazy and maybe people are gonna be a bit confused, focus</span> <span data-start="1113.751" data-end="1118.42">more on developer reach out and make sure people know exactly how to use your software.</span> </p>
