<p><span data-start="66.59" data-end="73.909">I assumed that you knew so let's just move on from that unfortunately there is</span> <span data-start="73.909" data-end="78.56">a positive twist to this because it's a great example of what I'm here to ask</span> <span data-start="78.56" data-end="84.92">you to try and be aware of so let's agree that anything I say from here on</span> <span data-start="84.92" data-end="91.03">out can and most definitely will be applied to myself there's a small caveat</span> <span data-start="91.03" data-end="96.35">there these little asterisks that will show up when there is a flashing visual</span> <span data-start="96.35" data-end="103.01">on the following slide just as a trigger warning so I'm Gabby I work at the</span> <span data-start="103.01" data-end="107.69">Financial Times we are the world's leading news organization and Business</span> <span data-start="107.69" data-end="112.19">and Economic Affairs I've been there for a couple of years now and I've been very</span> <span data-start="112.19" data-end="116.54">lucky to work in a company that values its culture very strongly because it</span> <span data-start="116.54" data-end="119.21">means that the people that work there care about the people that work there</span> <span data-start="119.21" data-end="125.18">and it's a great environment to learn and develop in so I work specifically on</span> <span data-start="125.18" data-end="130.67">a team called origami we are the FTS component library and essentially our</span> <span data-start="130.67" data-end="136.04">work is geared at simplifying other people's work and we try to be as</span> <span data-start="136.04" data-end="139.41">accessible as possible in every sense of the word because our</span> <span data-start="139.41" data-end="144.94">users are developers but developers from various different backgrounds developing</span> <span data-start="144.94" data-end="150.1">various different ft products for various different ft customers so that</span> <span data-start="150.1" data-end="154.63">means that we need to make our components as clear as possible in their</span> <span data-start="154.63" data-end="159.91">functionality and their documentation one of the ways in which we do this is</span> <span data-start="159.91" data-end="164.53">by maintaining a public registry it houses information on all of the</span> <span data-start="164.53" data-end="171.07">components that we own and develop and it provides demos to assist others in</span> <span data-start="171.07" data-end="178.42">their implementation earlier this year we rewrote and redesigned this registry</span> <span data-start="178.42" data-end="182.77">you want to make it fast and sleek and cool to use and stuff and on the day</span> <span data-start="182.77" data-end="188.32">that we launched it we got a cake to celebrate with our users unfortunately I</span> <span data-start="188.32" data-end="192.34">didn't get a picture of the cake when it was whole because it was a good cake but</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="192.34" data-end="196.87">I figured I would use that opportunity to get some feedback from our users on</span> <span data-start="196.87" data-end="204.07">our registry and I wrote on the cake box right so I wrote for cake slice please</span> <span data-start="204.07" data-end="207.76">to leave nice feedback on post-it note and I thought I was being really</span> <span data-start="207.76" data-end="214.57">charming and like I'd got my point across and we got feedback but all of</span> <span data-start="214.57" data-end="217.769">our feedback was on the cake</span> <span data-start="218.12" data-end="230.159">so it's amusing to see people compliment cake for sure they get creative but</span> <span data-start="230.159" data-end="238.709">because I made an assumption about what people knew I didn't get the feedback</span> <span data-start="238.709" data-end="243.26">that I had asked for it so we have been working on the registry for a while and</span> <span data-start="243.26" data-end="247.049">because of that we knew why there was cake everybody else just saw you know</span> <span data-start="247.049" data-end="253.92">delicious chocolatey and free cake and that really complicates things for us</span> <span data-start="253.92" data-end="261.06">because what I really want to highlight is that it's very easy to forget that we</span> <span data-start="261.06" data-end="265.74">don't know what others know and that others don't know what we know and at</span> <span data-start="265.74" data-end="269.07">one point or another we all make assumptions that we believe to be an</span> <span data-start="269.07" data-end="274.08">offensive and because of what we don't know these assumptions can be harmful to</span> <span data-start="274.08" data-end="279.47">our interactions so I'm going to talk about a few aspects of our industry</span> <span data-start="279.47" data-end="286.88">where we may frequently make assumptions starting with error message it's mm-hmm</span> <span data-start="286.88" data-end="292.2">so I'll venture it guess that nobody really wants to see error messages but</span> <span data-start="292.2" data-end="297.45">at one point or another we all need them and we may even secretly be grateful for</span> <span data-start="297.45" data-end="304.2">them when they make sense so when they do make sense they have the ability to</span> <span data-start="304.2" data-end="309.15">help us improve our code and learn from the mistakes that we make when they</span> <span data-start="309.15" data-end="314.58">don't make sense maybe one of two things can happen one</span> <span data-start="314.58" data-end="318.419">we've seen the error or the type before and we can have a guess at what went</span> <span data-start="318.419" data-end="322.61">wrong and the odds are that this is going to sink a potentially unnecessary</span> <span data-start="322.61" data-end="327.24">amount of time into debugging the issue because we didn't have the relevant</span> <span data-start="327.24" data-end="334.68">information from the start or we don't understand the error and the wording</span> <span data-start="334.68" data-end="340.889">makes us feel bad about something that we've done just gonna be this there for</span> <span data-start="340.889" data-end="343.22">a second</span> <span data-start="344.19" data-end="349.74">so we can feel like we don't know how the language works and we can possibly</span> <span data-start="349.74" data-end="353.55">feel embarrassed that we don't understand the error or what we've done</span> <span data-start="353.55" data-end="359.79">wrong both of which do nothing for our drive to improve and learn and it can be</span> <span data-start="359.79" data-end="365.22">detrimental to our belief in our capability so I've asked Donnie so let</span> <span data-start="365.22" data-end="368.79">me share their tweet because I was immediately struck by it when I first</span> <span data-start="368.79" data-end="375.99">read it and it says as tool builders we're gatekeepers every time we print an</span> <span data-start="375.99" data-end="380.49">incomprehensible error message someone decides they're not good enough at</span> <span data-start="380.49" data-end="386.37">coding and even though I've been working in this industry for a few years I come</span> <span data-start="386.37" data-end="390.03">across error messages pretty frequently that make me feel like I have no idea</span> <span data-start="390.03" data-end="394.5">what I'm doing and they make my faith and what I think I understand pretty</span> <span data-start="394.5" data-end="400.95">wobbly so today I want to focus on point number two when error messages make us</span> <span data-start="400.95" data-end="405.78">feel bad I want to highlight what I think are some of the problems in the</span> <span data-start="405.78" data-end="409.56">way that error messages are communicated and I've picked a few examples to</span> <span data-start="409.56" data-end="413.67">illustrate my point so try to consider what I'm saying as a blanket statement</span> <span data-start="413.67" data-end="419.37">for error messages you might have seen out in the wild so let's begin type</span> <span data-start="419.37" data-end="426.99">error  is not a function problem we've got here is ambiguity to</span> <span data-start="426.99" data-end="430.169">one extent or another all of the error messages that I'm going to show you are</span> <span data-start="430.169" data-end="435.87">ambiguous they aren't specific about what has gone wrong and this wording</span> <span data-start="435.87" data-end="441.18">implies that we know where to start if we see this error and while this might</span> <span data-start="441.18" data-end="446.669">be true for some we could all just be helped along if we knew what the context</span> <span data-start="446.669" data-end="452.82">was the message here is being ambiguous by not telling us what the air were</span> <span data-start="452.82" data-end="457.11">is referencing and little caveat to be fair most bravura browsers</span> <span data-start="457.11" data-end="461.28">have implemented a referencing system but this doesn't detract from the fact</span> <span data-start="461.28" data-end="467.72">that this still applies to other error messages uncaught error object object</span> <span data-start="467.72" data-end="476.76">yay so big problem that we have here is succinct Ness in most cases unhelpful</span> <span data-start="476.76" data-end="481">error messages our short perhaps their short and to the</span> <span data-start="481" data-end="485.71">point for some but it's entirely possible that the point is completely</span> <span data-start="485.71" data-end="491.139">missed by others and I don't mean we need to write a novel about the details</span> <span data-start="491.139" data-end="494.83">of the error message but a sentence or two could help shed a lot of light onto</span> <span data-start="494.83" data-end="499.96">the problem whatever the real error is here it's been shrunk down to two</span> <span data-start="499.96" data-end="507.189">generally unhelpful words and finally unexpected token comma expected comma</span> <span data-start="507.189" data-end="513.43">guys this doesn't even look like a real sentence but big problem we have here is</span> <span data-start="513.43" data-end="519.519">obfuscation this is on par with ambiguity the specifics of what has gone</span> <span data-start="519.519" data-end="525.91">wrong are hidden away somewhere so useful information is being withheld and</span> <span data-start="525.91" data-end="531.19">this is gonna add a complication from the start in this example logically a</span> <span data-start="531.19" data-end="535.839">comma is a comma so something else must have gone wrong I just don't have the</span> <span data-start="535.839" data-end="542.56">information to know what that is or how to deal with it so let me reiterate what</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="542.56" data-end="548.62">I'm saying by creating an imaginary scenario for you okay picture yourself</span> <span data-start="548.62" data-end="554.23">at the entrance of a hedge maze in daylight there are no threats in this</span> <span data-start="554.23" data-end="561.36">maze and your objective is to get to the center of it when you get lost a</span> <span data-start="561.36" data-end="566.769">mystical Boulder will materialize with directions on it so you step into the</span> <span data-start="566.769" data-end="573.31">maze and after a few right turns and a few wrong turns you come to a fork but</span> <span data-start="573.31" data-end="578.68">you find that you've lost your sense of direction boom magical Boulder has a</span> <span data-start="578.68" data-end="585.87">sentence on it and that sentence says turn north</span> <span data-start="586.87" data-end="592.779">and so this is how I feel when I deal with an error message that I don't</span> <span data-start="592.779" data-end="598.54">understand so next time we write error messages let's try to keep these things</span> <span data-start="598.54" data-end="605.8">in mind context to counter ambiguity have we provided a connection between</span> <span data-start="605.8" data-end="613.9">the problem and what is causing it elaboration to counter what was it that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="613.9" data-end="618.279">I said it's a sickness sorry good are we being sufficiently</span> <span data-start="618.279" data-end="625.14">verbose have we provided relevant details about the problem and finally</span> <span data-start="625.14" data-end="632.11">clarity to counter obfuscation overall is our message clear have we surfaced</span> <span data-start="632.11" data-end="637.62">all of the things that are important about the error in our explanation of it</span> <span data-start="637.62" data-end="642.64">I've raised these points to aid us in moving away from general assumptions</span> <span data-start="642.64" data-end="646.39">that we can make about what our users understand and this will allow our</span> <span data-start="646.39" data-end="649.89">wording to be as inclusive as possible</span> <span data-start="650.339" data-end="656.29">but these points also apply to our documentation which brings me to the</span> <span data-start="656.29" data-end="663.279">read me read knees are pretty crucial to our projects they're often the single</span> <span data-start="663.279" data-end="667.87">source of documentation that a user will come across so what we say and how we</span> <span data-start="667.87" data-end="673.57">choose to convey it is very important I know I bragged about my company a little</span> <span data-start="673.57" data-end="676.75">bit at the beginning but it's mostly so that I can point out that we also make</span> <span data-start="676.75" data-end="681.57">these mistakes and take for example this readme</span> <span data-start="681.57" data-end="686.68">it belongs to a public repository that the FT owns and this is it there's</span> <span data-start="686.68" data-end="696.85">nothing more to it I want everyone to focus on this bit of it I have so many</span> <span data-start="696.85" data-end="707.38">questions so what is this library what's wrong with installing it globally what</span> <span data-start="707.38" data-end="713.62">package manager a moment to use what is n B T or n bt5 for that matter and why</span> <span data-start="713.62" data-end="720.11">does it get its own patches so who is this even for and first off</span> <span data-start="720.11" data-end="724.7">just because I work there when I know this this read me assumes that everyone</span> <span data-start="724.7" data-end="730.82">knows where the library should be used no context it gives you a warning about</span> <span data-start="730.82" data-end="736.69">installation but no installation instructions so there's no elaboration</span> <span data-start="736.69" data-end="741.019">and ultimately there's no explicit explanation for what this library</span> <span data-start="741.019" data-end="746.18">actually does so there's no clarity either and the fact is that this whole</span> <span data-start="746.18" data-end="753.11">project assumes that you work for the FT it assumes that you know what our</span> <span data-start="753.11" data-end="757.94">workflow is like it assumes that you know what our tools are and is done</span> <span data-start="757.94" data-end="761.99">really unhelpful but while all of that may be true for the people that already</span> <span data-start="761.99" data-end="768.44">work there it's just not helpful helpful for someone that may have just joined</span> <span data-start="768.44" data-end="776.18">for example but after raising all of this in-house we've changed it so if you</span> <span data-start="776.18" data-end="781.66">guys go looking for it it's not gonna look like this anymore we've specified</span> <span data-start="781.66" data-end="786.649">what this project is used for and we've provided further information for anyone</span> <span data-start="786.649" data-end="792.74">that might need it or might want it and not only were installation instructions</span> <span data-start="792.74" data-end="800.06">vague there were two years out of date so we've elaborated and provided and</span> <span data-start="800.06" data-end="806.93">explicit installation commands and we've provided clarity so we've emitted</span> <span data-start="806.93" data-end="810.67">abbreviations and there's more information</span> <span data-start="810.67" data-end="816.709">overall we've been more explicit about the functionality of this project so we</span> <span data-start="816.709" data-end="821.899">facilitator other people's use of it I'm aware that there's a lot more that we</span> <span data-start="821.899" data-end="828.01">should add to this readme but I don't have time and it doesn't fit on one side</span> <span data-start="828.01" data-end="834.589">so even if we don't have time to go through everything right now remembering</span> <span data-start="834.589" data-end="840.11">to supply context elaborate where relevant and provide clarity will help</span> <span data-start="840.11" data-end="847.85">us improve the way in which we write but writing isn't the only way in which we</span> <span data-start="847.85" data-end="853.69">communicate in this industry we talk a lot to exhibit a</span> <span data-start="853.69" data-end="858.01">so in addition to what we've covered so far</span> <span data-start="858.01" data-end="866.78">the next equally important point to consider is who is your audience and I</span> <span data-start="866.78" data-end="875.02">can't stress this enough whom are we speaking to and who are we writing for</span> <span data-start="875.74" data-end="881.66">everybody in this audience exists in a different spectrum of experience and</span> <span data-start="881.66" data-end="888.62">understanding so when we talk to someone from our version of the spectrum we talk</span> <span data-start="888.62" data-end="891.68">through the filters of our own experience and this is really important</span> <span data-start="891.68" data-end="897.77">to be aware of these are our own experiences and conversely when we talk</span> <span data-start="897.77" data-end="901.52">to somebody else we're talking to somebody that has a spectrum all of</span> <span data-start="901.52" data-end="908.39">their own and that is made up of their experiences so if we want to have a good</span> <span data-start="908.39" data-end="914.84">exchange we need to find common ground together instead of assuming there is</span> <span data-start="914.84" data-end="921.38">common ground and we probably don't intend it badly when we assume someone</span> <span data-start="921.38" data-end="925.79">else will know what we're talking about and hey maybe they do but we could be</span> <span data-start="925.79" data-end="930.65">clear from the beginning and there are a few things that we can do to improve our</span> <span data-start="930.65" data-end="936.95">communication firstly we can start by acknowledging that we do make</span> <span data-start="936.95" data-end="943.25">assumptions at one point or another this means that we can begin to notice the</span> <span data-start="943.25" data-end="950.3">things that we can improve second when we are talking about something we should</span> <span data-start="950.3" data-end="958.31">work to elaborate without judgment it takes practice absolutely but it's</span> <span data-start="958.31" data-end="962.33">important to learn not to assume that the person you are speaking to knows</span> <span data-start="962.33" data-end="968.96">what you were talking about and thereby provide more information that was loud</span> <span data-start="968.96" data-end="974.45">sorry so I have found myself explaining to</span> <span data-start="974.45" data-end="979.13">something to someone in a way that makes perfect sense to me until I look up and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="979.13" data-end="985.43">I see the person looking a little bit like this and I've had that look on my</span> <span data-start="985.43" data-end="988.91">face a few times as well and usually it's because I didn't get</span> <span data-start="988.91" data-end="993.77">that extra bit of elaboration I didn't understand the context I may have missed</span> <span data-start="993.77" data-end="1001.44">the Darden perhaps I just didn't know what they were saying but just</span> <span data-start="1001.44" data-end="1010.899">elaborating isn't enough we need to pay attention to how we say what we say we</span> <span data-start="1010.899" data-end="1016.51">understand the world through the words we use through the words we hear and</span> <span data-start="1016.51" data-end="1022">through the words that we read so consider that very carefully in this</span> <span data-start="1022" data-end="1026.53">case it doesn't matter who you talk to but the words that you choose to speak</span> <span data-start="1026.53" data-end="1032.439">with are far from inconsequential and this brings me to a few examples of</span> <span data-start="1032.439" data-end="1039.579">language that we can learn to avoid as outlined in the Code of Conduct for this</span> <span data-start="1039.579" data-end="1045.25">conference commentary like you would be crazy to think you would have to be</span> <span data-start="1045.25" data-end="1051.67">blind not to notice is a list it's ablest and it's alienating if you</span> <span data-start="1051.67" data-end="1056.14">do think in a particular way or if you don't notice something whether or not</span> <span data-start="1056.14" data-end="1065.08">you have a disability and it's degrading language so please leave this out words</span> <span data-start="1065.08" data-end="1073.45">and phrasing like all you need to do just obviously clearly simply they</span> <span data-start="1073.45" data-end="1079.54">trivialize what may not be obvious or clear to someone else and they're filler</span> <span data-start="1079.54" data-end="1091.36">words and we can omit these too and finally everyone knows or any developer</span> <span data-start="1091.36" data-end="1094.05">worth their salt</span> <span data-start="1100.74" data-end="1105.9">there are examples of career generalizations that can be exclusionary</span> <span data-start="1105.9" data-end="1111.49">we've already covered the fact that we don't know what others know and setting</span> <span data-start="1111.49" data-end="1116.1">arbitrary benchmarks for someone's knowledge or worth is just destructive</span> <span data-start="1116.1" data-end="1126.1">so let's not use these either make sure that you give your interactions your</span> <span data-start="1126.1" data-end="1138.01">full attention with that we can start picking up on the things that we say we</span> <span data-start="1138.01" data-end="1141.94">may use some of the language that I just talked about unconsciously and in fact I</span> <span data-start="1141.94" data-end="1147.669">know that I do I probably just said just somewhere like there it happens but the</span> <span data-start="1147.669" data-end="1154.12">beauty of interacting with somebody else is that we can ask questions so do ask</span> <span data-start="1154.12" data-end="1160.87">ask questions about the content of your conversations and provide your listeners</span> <span data-start="1160.87" data-end="1165.25">with the opportunity to correct you where you may not notice that you might</span> <span data-start="1165.25" data-end="1171.48">have made a mistake and when we do ask those questions and provide that chance</span> <span data-start="1171.48" data-end="1177.309">there's benefit in it for us as well we can take that opportunity to learn about</span> <span data-start="1177.309" data-end="1181.08">what our assumptions were in that scenario and begin to correct ourselves</span> <span data-start="1181.08" data-end="1185.49">when we notice that our language might have slipped</span> <span data-start="1185.49" data-end="1189.82">so with these points and lines we can go into our conversations with more</span> <span data-start="1189.82" data-end="1199.69">awareness make them more productive more effective and more inclusive I need to</span> <span data-start="1199.69" data-end="1203.85">let this slide because it's a good gift</span> <span data-start="1207.96" data-end="1215.549">so I'd like to stress that this is a learning process and it takes practice</span> <span data-start="1215.549" data-end="1220.499">and we will probably make mistakes throughout that process but it also</span> <span data-start="1220.499" data-end="1225.09">doesn't cost you anything to practice and you lose nothing by making the</span> <span data-start="1225.09" data-end="1232.46">effort unlike this cat so if we practice acknowledging our assumptions</span> <span data-start="1232.46" data-end="1238.44">elaborating without judgment asking questions and paying attention to the</span> <span data-start="1238.44" data-end="1243.48">words that we use will benefit from richer and more constructive</span> <span data-start="1243.48" data-end="1254.129">interactions going forward I am definitely pouring a lot of energy into</span> <span data-start="1254.129" data-end="1258.149">pointing out assumptions an overall implying that they have negative effects</span> <span data-start="1258.149" data-end="1265.49">and while this is true it is also true to a large extent that assumptions are</span> <span data-start="1265.49" data-end="1270.72">simplifications that make life possible for example if we're walking along a</span> <span data-start="1270.72" data-end="1275.49">sidewalk we do so relatively confidently because we assume that the drivers</span> <span data-start="1275.49" data-end="1280.139">aren't gonna drive up in front of us and the drivers drive confidently assuming</span> <span data-start="1280.139" data-end="1282.259">that people aren't gonna leap out in front of a street in front of them</span> <span data-start="1282.259" data-end="1287.94">helpful so if we had to double check with every driver going by that that was</span> <span data-start="1287.94" data-end="1294.929">the case nobody would ever get anywhere and it would be equally unrealistic to</span> <span data-start="1294.929" data-end="1298.71">try and have an answer for every possible situation that we find</span> <span data-start="1298.71" data-end="1306.029">ourselves assuming in which really begs the question once you start where do you</span> <span data-start="1306.029" data-end="1314.369">stop the correct answer that everybody really wants to know is that there is no</span> <span data-start="1314.369" data-end="1321.48">correct answer ultimately we don't have the brain power or the time to come up</span> <span data-start="1321.48" data-end="1327.779">with a solution to every scenario but we can lay the foundations in the word</span> <span data-start="1327.779" data-end="1334.71">choices that we make for our errors for our documentation and our speech which</span> <span data-start="1334.71" data-end="1341.07">can cover a lot of ground where we can't cover every eventuality which</span> <span data-start="1341.07" data-end="1347.039">for the last time brings me back to we don't know what others know and others</span> <span data-start="1347.039" data-end="1349.88">don't know what we know</span> <span data-start="1349.909" data-end="1358.049">so in all types of communication let us strive to provide context to elaborate</span> <span data-start="1358.049" data-end="1365.149">freely to convey clarity to be aware of the words that we communicate with and</span> <span data-start="1365.149" data-end="1372.72">to ask so that we can learn and apply what we learned to ourselves with that</span> <span data-start="1372.72" data-end="1377.669">will be setting ourselves up for better interactions and will already be at a</span> <span data-start="1377.669" data-end="1384.48">huge advantage finally I would like to leave you with a quote by American</span> <span data-start="1384.48" data-end="1391.169">novelist Ursula Guin which I might have browsed incorrectly words transform both</span> <span data-start="1391.169" data-end="1396.62">speaker and hearer they feed energy back and forth and amplify it</span> <span data-start="1396.62" data-end="1406.019">they feed understanding or emotion back and forth and amplify it so remember the</span> </p>
