<p><span data-start="158.66" data-end="163.58">CSS pixel which is great and then this</span> <span data-start="163.58" data-end="166.13">came along and you had Retina displays</span> <span

<span data-start="206.15" data-end="209.84">website through and that hole is</span> <span data-start="209.84" data-end="212.24">stretchable or maybe you can think of</span> <span data-start="212.24" data-end="214.22">the hole as getting closer or farther</span> <span data-start="214.22" data-end="217.19">away from the site but the viewport</span> <span data-start="217.19" data-end="219.26">despite what the user may think because</span> <span data-start="219.26" data-end="221.72">the user sees the viewport and thinks of</span> <span data-start="221.72" data-end="223.88">it as the browser window but the</span> <span data-start="223.88" data-end="225.29">viewport is not the browser window it's</span> <span data-start="225.29" data-end="226.52">a hole that you're looking at the</span> <span data-start="226.52" data-end="228.98">browser window through and that means</span> <span data-start="228.98" data-end="230.72">that when you make the viewport smaller</span> <span data-start="230.72" data-end="232.79">or bigger it's not the same thing as</span> <span data-start="232.79" data-end="234.38">making your browser window smaller or</span> <span data-start="234.38" data-end="236.87">bigger because on a fluid layout when</span> <span data-start="236.87" data-end="238.4">you make the browser bigger or smaller</span> <span data-start="238.4"

that doesn't happen so Apple</span> <span data-start="247.49" data-end="248.96">introduced Retina displays with the</span> <span data-start="248.96" data-end="252.02">iPhone 4 and they said look

data-end="374.75">the viewport which is just a piece of</span> <span data-start="374.75" data-end="376.79">glass but the width of the invisible</span> <span data-start="376.79"

data-end="385.61">understand with an iPhone because Apple</span> <span data-start="385.61" data-end="388.13">is saying yeah so forget how many pixels</span> <span data-start="388.13" data-end="391.79">there really are there are 320 pixels as</span> <span data-start="391.79" data-end="393.62">far as you're concerned you the CSS</span> <span data-start="393.62" data-end="398.68">developer so the device width is 360</span> <span data-start="398.68" data-end="402.74">except that different mobile devices</span> <span data-start="402.74" data-end="406.79">will

data-start="472.91" data-end="476.78">it looks like this on a phone are your</span> <span data-start="476.78" data-end="479.03">designers okay with how it's gonna look</span> <span data-start="479.03"
