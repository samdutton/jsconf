agree</span> <span data-start="113.459" data-end="114.84">that we're going to call it a shim from</span> <span data-start="114.84" data-end="118.289">now on John Rezac who originally talked</span> <span data-start="118.289" data-end="121.35">about this method has now recanted and</span> <span data-start="121.35" data-end="124.77">says it's a shim so the basic problem is</span> <span data-start="124.77" data-end="127.889">that IE does not handle elements that it</span> <span data-start="127.889" data-end="130.95">doesn't know about correctly what it</span> <span data-start="130.95" data-end="133.05">does is you can't style it so like here</span> <span data-start="133.05" data-end="135.03">we have this blah element right we want</span> <span data-start="135.03" data-end="137.1">to color it red IE doesn't allow you to</span> <span data-start="137.1" data-end="138.81">style it and also won't hold anything</span> <span data-start="138.81" data-end="139.44">inside</span> <span data-start="139.44" data-end="141.54">so just like if you put other elements</span> <span data-start="141.54" data-end="143.16">inside of an unknown element it is like</span> <span data-start="143.16" data-end="145.38">barfs all those elements outside of it</span> <span data-start="145.38" data-end="148.92">into the Dom doesn't contain so the</span> <span data-start="148.92" data-end="152.51">trick is a document create element</span> <span data-start="152.51" data-end="155.91">somehow you do that and everything's</span> <span data-start="155.91" data-end="161.19">just groovy so that that's the one</span> <span data-start="161.19" data-end="163.5">problem that we found and that we solved</span> <span data-start="163.5" data-end="166.2">and then just recently as more people</span> <span data-start="166.2" data-end="168.24">started putting a html5 in two years we</span> <span data-start="168.24" data-end="172.4">realize that printing is a problem in</span> <span data-start="172.4" data-end="177.33">nie that the html5 shim doesn't it</span> <span data-start="177.33" data-end="178.89">doesn't work like the whole DOM is</span> <span data-start="178.89" data-end="180.78">recalculated when it when it goes into</span> <span data-start="180.78" data-end="185.01">print so on so unknown elements are just</span> <span data-start="185.01" data-end="186.69">like they get the exact same behavior</span> <span data-start="186.69" data-end="188.39">and the technique that we've been using</span> <span data-start="188.39" data-end="192.18">didn't work so this is news as of about</span> <span data-start="192.18" data-end="197.67">last week john neal figured out a</span> <span data-start="197.67" data-end="200.67">technique and basically it's um IE has</span> <span data-start="200.67" data-end="202.29">these nice some on before printing mound</span> <span data-start="202.29" data-end="204.06">after print events and what he basically</span> <span data-start="204.06" data-end="207.81">does is takes the entire dom and like</span> <span data-start="207.81" data-end="210.81">holds it cashed but then creates a</span> <span data-start="210.81" data-end="213.6">shadow Dom with with like dibs in place</span> <span data-start="213.6" data-end="216.239">of all the articles and sections and</span> <span data-start="216.239" data-end="219.09">unknown elements for IE and then that</span> <span data-start="219.09" data-end="222.48">gets sent to the print view and then it</span> <span data-start="222.48" data-end="225.15">gets reconstructed afterwards so that's</span> <span data-start="225.15" data-end="229.35">now solve to this this piece of code is</span> <span data-start="229.35" data-end="232.05">now in the html5 Shiv j/s that is on</span> <span data-start="232.05" data-end="233.67">google code Remy sharp maintains that</span> <span

data-start="723.5" data-end="725.48">basically we have support for it so</span> <span data-start="725.48" data-end="726.68">we're going to do a couple more checks</span> <span data-start="726.68" data-end="730.72">to basically see if there's it what</span> <span data-start="730.72" data-end="734.26">codec support we have in each of the in</span> <span data-start="734.26" data-end="737.51">audio and video this one's nice because</span> <span data-start="737.51" data-end="740.84">basically we were provided with an API</span> <span data-start="740.84" data-end="744.11">that says what do you support a lot of</span> <span data-start="744.11" data-end="746.66">the times that's not the case things</span> <span data-start="746.66" data-end="751.73">like

data-start="762.86" data-end="764.93">there's a lot of real like edge case</span> <span data-start="764.93" data-end="769.04">stuff that we work around so we do a lot</span> <span data-start="769.04" data-end="771.14">of feature feature tests here and then</span> <span data-start="771.14" data-end="775.45">that gets that gets exposed to you as a</span> <span data-start="775.45" data-end="779.42">developer in two different ways we throw</span> <span data-start="779.42" data-end="781.28">classes on to the HTML tag and so</span> <span data-start="781.28" data-end="783.95">basically we have like you know this</span> <span data-start="783.95" data-end="785.32">browser supports canvas but it does</span> <span data-start="785.32" data-end="786.94">not support geolocation so you can just</span> <span data-start="786.94" data-end="788.68">style based on that maybe you're going</span> <span data-start="788.68" data-end="791.11">now going to show the little input box</span> <span data-start="791.11" data-end="792.1">where you can put in your zip code</span> <span data-start="792.1" data-end="794.05">because you're not able to query for the</span> <span data-start="794.05" data-end="795.85">geolocation the other thing is we create</span> <span data-start="795.85" data-end="797.17">a big JavaScript object with a bunch of</span> <span data-start="797.17" data-end="799.24">bullion's and the Codex and now you can</span> <span data-start="799.24" data-end="800.83">just like tests so the way that works</span> <span data-start="800.83" data-end="802.54">out you have something like border</span> <span data-start="802.54" data-end="804.85">radius and if there is a native support</span> <span data-start="804.85" data-end="806.17">you're going to use it but if there's no</span> <span data-start="806.17" data-end="807.94">border radius support maybe you're going</span> <span data-start="807.94" data-end="809.83">to like initialize a JavaScript library</span> <span data-start="809.83" data-end="811.06">that's going to do the rounded corners</span> <span data-start="811.06" data-end="815.62">or whatever something like box-shadow if</span> <span data-start="815.62" data-end="818.68">supports there hell yeah if there's not</span> <span data-start="818.68" data-end="822.61">it will make some mimicked like borders</span> <span data-start="822.61" data-end="824.38">on the side and bottom make it look</span> <span data-start="824.38" data-end="827.43">decent another idea is this is like a</span> <span data-start="827.43" data-end="832.36">geolocation geolocation bridge so way</span> <span data-start="832.36" data-end="833.53">that we use it was just going to call it</span> <span data-start="833.53" data-end="837.51">throw a call back to get location and</span> <span data-start="837.51" data-end="840.67">output where we're at inside of it we're</span> <span data-start="840.67" data-end="842.62">going to check make sure see if we have</span> <span data-start="842.62" data-end="844.27">native support if we are great we're</span> <span data-start="844.27" data-end="847.66">going to use that otherwise going to</span> <span data-start="847.66" data-end="850.36">grab the Google JavaScript API which</span> <span data-start="850.36" data-end="853">just that just requesting this file</span> <span data-start="853" data-end="856.72">gives you a client location data that</span> <span data-start="856.72"
