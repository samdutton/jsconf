<p><span data-start="22.83" data-end="26.42">I love solving hard problems every day.</span> <span data-start="26.42" data-end="28.9">And I've always worn a lot of hats.</span> <span data-start="28.9" data-end="34.48">I work at GitHub as the engineering manager as well for another team that is working on</span> <span data-start="34.48" data-end="39.8">a secret product, re-imagining fun and collaboration in code.</span> <span data-start="39.8" data-end="46.13">I'm also a Mozilla tech speaker, on the word of Ruby Together, and I run a podcast about</span> <span data-start="46.13" data-end="48.18">parent-driven development.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="48.18" data-end="50.799">I have stickers for all of these things.</span> <span data-start="50.799" data-end="54.47">If you want to chat about any of them, please come and find me.</span> <span data-start="54.47" data-end="60.41">I've been a community organiser, a mentor, a developer, an organiser, a COO, and then,</span> <span data-start="60.41" data-end="64.97">all of a sudden, I was a mom.</span> <span data-start="64.97" data-end="66.72">So this is Devon.</span> <span data-start="66.72" data-end="69.33">He was important in April 2015.</span> <span data-start="69.33" data-end="74.94">This talk is going to have a lot of pictures of him.</span> <span data-start="74.94" data-end="81.479">Devon's a full-blown toddler now and joined by his sister, Layla who is just over a year.</span> <span data-start="81.479" data-end="87.47">Today, I want to talk about the challenges people who are parents and developers face,</span> <span data-start="87.47" data-end="93.89">as well as what some solutions are, and how these solutions can help a company and an</span> <span data-start="93.89" data-end="95.77">entire team.</span> <span data-start="95.77" data-end="104.45">So, when Devon was about five months old, I felt like I was losing my mind.</span> <span data-start="104.45" data-end="108.74">I had been back at work full-time for a while — if you want to hear a separate rant, talk</span> <span data-start="108.74" data-end="115.03">to me about maternity leave in the States — and after a particularly bad week of very</span> <span data-start="115.03" data-end="119.95">little sleep at night, and having a really challenging workweek, I just really wasn't</span> <span data-start="119.95" data-end="121.609">sure if I could do it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="121.609" data-end="126.75">How was I going to keep learning all the things I needed to be learning while being a great</span> <span data-start="126.75" data-end="130.61">mom, employee, and adequate partner?</span> <span data-start="130.61" data-end="133.46">How did did others do it?</span> <span data-start="133.46" data-end="134.9">Was I being unrealistic?</span> <span data-start="134.9" data-end="135.9">Was I being lazy.</span> <span data-start="135.9" data-end="143.48">Could I even be a good mom and a developer or was this industry just truly not for me?</span> <span data-start="143.48" data-end="150.77">If I've being really honest, there's been many times in the past four years where even</span> <span data-start="150.77" data-end="156.599">though I loved tech and I loved code, I thought about how nice it would be just to go and</span> <span data-start="156.599" data-end="160.709">do a job that I could do on autopilot.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="160.709" data-end="163.15">I seriously thought about leaving the industry.</span> <span data-start="163.15" data-end="169.26">You see these cute pictures of parents orchids on Facebook or Instagram, but it's not always</span> <span data-start="169.26" data-end="174.3">like that, and, for me, in the early days, it definitely usually wasn't like that.</span> <span data-start="174.3" data-end="177.88">It has hard, tiring, frustrating.</span> <span data-start="177.88" data-end="181.81">It was also amazing, and all-encompassing.</span> <span data-start="181.81" data-end="187.939">It was really, really lonely.</span> <span data-start="187.939" data-end="192.829">Based on what I was experiencing, I created a survey to ask parents a few questions about</span> <span data-start="192.829" data-end="197.94">this issue, and what I found out from reading hundreds of surveys, is there are some real</span> <span data-start="197.94" data-end="200.37">trends and common issues.</span> <span data-start="200.37" data-end="209.02">In an industry, the values — in a industry that voles open-source contributions, parents</span> <span data-start="209.02" data-end="211.799">are struggling.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="211.799" data-end="216.93">So let me take a second to describe a typical day from a few months ago.</span> <span data-start="216.93" data-end="222.709">So Devon wakes up around seven, Layla already around 730.</span> <span data-start="222.709" data-end="226.409">A lot of parents say it's closer to 5.30 or six.</span> <span data-start="226.409" data-end="235.15">I would nurse Layla while Devon has a glass of milk and by 8.15, we really need to get</span> <span data-start="235.15" data-end="239.209">moving, brush teeth, make car breakfasts — you can feel free to judge.</span> <span data-start="239.209" data-end="244.92">We're not morning people, car breakfast is what works very well for us.</span> <span data-start="244.92" data-end="250.26">And at 8.45 or nanny comes which is already a huge privilege.</span> <span data-start="250.26" data-end="252.39">By nine I drop Devon off at preschool.</span> <span data-start="252.39" data-end="260.39">By 9.25 I was home pumping breast milk while eat breakfast and starting to check emails.</span> <span data-start="260.39" data-end="266.49">I would jump into the work day, do that punctuated by a few more breast-milk pumping breaks until</span> <span data-start="266.49" data-end="268.71">about 5.15.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="268.71" data-end="279.47">Then I race out the door, grab Layla, put her in the car, from 6.15 to 7.15, we do dinner</span> <span data-start="279.47" data-end="285.47">for the kids, sometimes try to cook our dinner, Bath time, bed tile, et cetera.</span> <span data-start="285.47" data-end="291.52">From .45 until around nine, we finish cooking, we eat dinner, clean up, prep food in bottles</span> <span data-start="291.52" data-end="297.95">for the next day, jot down childcare notes, talk about pertinent household stuff we need</span> <span data-start="297.95" data-end="304.28">to, usually relax for like 30 minutes, and then we head to bed.</span> <span data-start="304.28" data-end="307.66">We have it pretty good, even with two.</span> <span data-start="307.66" data-end="312">Now, fortunately, this was a day from a couple of months ago.</span> <span data-start="312" data-end="317.22">I got a lot more time back in my day as I weaned my daughter and didn't need to pump</span> <span data-start="317.22" data-end="318.32">breast milk.</span> <span data-start="318.32" data-end="323.67">Dropping the number of times that I had to pump in a day felt amazing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="323.67" data-end="328.8">I had more time to concentrate and didn't have to go through this huge context-switch</span> <span data-start="328.8" data-end="330.32">every two hours.</span> <span data-start="330.32" data-end="336.46">And I mention this tangent because pumping breast milk was mentioned in over half of</span> <span data-start="336.46" data-end="342.37">surveys for mothers and their answer is about company provision or issues they faced.</span> <span data-start="342.37" data-end="348.83">Now, the only time in that whole day that I would have to do any code for myself would</span> <span data-start="348.83" data-end="354.62">be those last 30 minutes that I have to relax, and even if I gave up that little bit of self-care</span> <span data-start="354.62" data-end="359.79">time, my brain is so tired by then, I wouldn't get anywhere fast.</span> <span data-start="359.79" data-end="366.08">And if you think about this in terms of code challenges that often need to be completed</span> <span data-start="366.08" data-end="371.59">outside of your work day for new jobs, parents may have to spend the whole weekend just working</span> <span data-start="371.59" data-end="373.03">on a couple of code challenges.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="373.03" data-end="377.9">It also means depending on our partner or spouse to do the childcare and not seeing</span> <span data-start="377.9" data-end="379.43">your kids.</span> <span data-start="379.43" data-end="383.68">This might not seem like a big deal, but when you're already working full-time, it really</span> <span data-start="383.68" data-end="384.68">is.</span> <span data-start="384.68" data-end="387.34">This is even more challenging if you're a single parent.</span> <span data-start="387.34" data-end="391.46">If you're a accessible parent, then you're likely paying for weekend childcare to get</span> <span data-start="391.46" data-end="395.33">these code challenges done.</span> <span data-start="395.33" data-end="398.86">Another issue mentioned was being able to stay sharp.</span> <span data-start="398.86" data-end="402.87">Developers live on coffee and solve really hard problems.</span> <span data-start="402.87" data-end="407.86">If you are a nursing mom, you're probably getting significantly less sleep, and you</span> <span data-start="407.86" data-end="411.5">can't rely on those cups of coffee to keep you going.</span> <span data-start="411.5" data-end="418.74">A recent study from baby care found that over 40 per cent of parents with babies aged zero</span> <span data-start="418.74" data-end="425.72">to six months only get one to three uninterrupted hours of sleep per night.</span> <span data-start="425.72" data-end="432.4">Parents lose a total of 44 days of sleep in their child's first year, and a newer study</span> <span data-start="432.4" data-end="437.65">found that parents are sleep-deprived for six years after they have a kid, and I'm like</span> <span data-start="437.65" data-end="442.46">really selling this parenting thing right now!</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="442.46" data-end="446.84">It's hard to keep a clear mind and solve hard problems when you're not getting uninterrupted</span> <span data-start="446.84" data-end="451.55">sleep, and you don't get the weekend to catch up or recharge.</span> <span data-start="451.55" data-end="455.61">A parent wrote, "Sometimes, the last thing I want to do or even have time to do when</span> <span data-start="455.61" data-end="458.84">I get home is code or learn new code.</span> <span data-start="458.84" data-end="463.24">Gone are the days of no responsibility and doing whatever I like when I get home.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="463.24" data-end="468.66">Finding a couple of hours to work on a personal project or pick up something new is hard,</span> <span data-start="468.66" data-end="474.84">especially when trying to help out my other half who is also tired."</span> <span data-start="474.84" data-end="479.61">When I asked if having children helped or hurt their career, only a small portion of</span> <span data-start="479.61" data-end="481.47">fathers said it hurt their career.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="481.47" data-end="485.61">They felt it either helped or had a future impact.</span> <span data-start="485.61" data-end="490.73">About 60 per cent of women said that having children hurt their career, but even more</span> <span data-start="490.73" data-end="495.74">than that, said it didn't hurt their career, but it changed it.</span> <span data-start="495.74" data-end="500.83">Many women said it slowed their career, affecting the overall trajectory and growth potential.</span> <span data-start="500.83" data-end="506.8">Now, I don't know about you, but that description certainly sounds like hurt ing mothers clearest</span> <span data-start="506.8" data-end="508.77">to me.</span> <span data-start="508.77" data-end="512.669">So here's the total breakdown of parents based on if they felt that having a child helped,</span> <span data-start="512.669" data-end="516.089">hurt, or had no impact, or helped and hurt their career.</span> <span data-start="516.089" data-end="521.3">Here are those same traces based on mom answers and bad answers.</span> <span data-start="521.3" data-end="525.98">As you can see, when everyone is together, the portions are equal.</span> <span data-start="525.98" data-end="529.699">As you break it down, it tells a much different story.</span> <span data-start="529.699" data-end="533.85">This data is backed up by additional research.</span> <span data-start="533.85" data-end="539.079">This 2018 study on children and gender and equality in Denmark shows these results based</span> <span data-start="539.079" data-end="544.209">on gender and earnings in Denmark, which I know at least for most Americans consider</span> <span data-start="544.209" data-end="549.899">closer to the gold standard in terms of supporting parents.</span> <span data-start="549.899" data-end="554.86">So while there are lots of challenges that parents face, there are also lots of solutions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="554.86" data-end="559.06">Looking at these surveys, they're identifiable solutions that companies can put in place,</span> <span data-start="559.06" data-end="563.18">solutions that colleagues with or without children can employ, and things that parents</span> <span data-start="563.18" data-end="565">out there can also work on.</span> <span data-start="565" data-end="568.36">These solutions can actually benefit an entire team.</span> <span data-start="568.36" data-end="575">The company- based ones: allow working from home or unconventional working options.</span> <span data-start="575" data-end="579.12">Even when a parent is ready to come back to work, offering different options can make</span> <span data-start="579.12" data-end="582.06">huge difference in their happiness level.</span> <span data-start="582.06" data-end="586.769">For women who are pumping, being able to work from home makes an enormous difference.</span> <span data-start="586.769" data-end="591.67">When I worked from home, I could pump in 22 minutes because I had everything set up, and</span> <span data-start="591.67" data-end="596.529">ready to go, but any time that I went into an office, it took me 32 to 34 minutes each</span> <span data-start="596.529" data-end="601.04">time, because I had to set up, clean up, and the travel time to get to the room, hope nobody's</span> <span data-start="601.04" data-end="603.73">in the room, et cetera.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="603.73" data-end="608.089">Hopefully, this isn't as much of an issue in Europe or outside of the States but I wanted</span> <span data-start="608.089" data-end="612.499">to mention it again, because over half of surveys from women suggested that issues are</span> <span data-start="612.499" data-end="617.1">difficulties around pumping pup if you have women at your company that are pumping in</span> <span data-start="617.1" data-end="622.339">their bathroom, your company needs to seriously consider how they prioritise mothers in the</span> <span data-start="622.339" data-end="625.519">workforce.</span> <span data-start="625.519" data-end="629.68">Allowing working from home takes the stress of a commute out of the equation, and allows</span> <span data-start="629.68" data-end="634.379">parents a little more flexibility and time in their day.</span> <span data-start="634.379" data-end="639.029">Another option is to offer a part-time transition back to work, so surveys show that people</span> <span data-start="639.029" data-end="643.19">took this in different ways, some working less hours, some working less days, but a</span> <span data-start="643.19" data-end="647.86">gradual transition back to work for pretty much as long as the company can allow it makes</span> <span data-start="647.86" data-end="650.67">an enormous difference in a parent's lifestyle.</span> <span data-start="650.67" data-end="656.86">Second, companies can take a much more proactive role in creating support systems.</span> <span data-start="656.86" data-end="661.67">So a really simple example of this might be a parenting Slack channel where parents can</span> <span data-start="661.67" data-end="664.6">share experiences, issues, and pictures of their kids.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="664.6" data-end="670.12">And a more involved option might be to connect parents returning to work with those who have</span> <span data-start="670.12" data-end="674.49">taken parental leave in the past and allow for it to be a safe space pour both parties</span> <span data-start="674.49" data-end="680.11">to discuss — for both parties to discuss successes, issues, and challenges.</span> <span data-start="680.11" data-end="685.649">Finally, train managers on what to expect when someone on parental leave comes back</span> <span data-start="685.649" data-end="686.85">to work.</span> <span data-start="686.85" data-end="689.18">This is important for moms do dads but moms?</span> <span data-start="689.18" data-end="690.519">In particular.</span> <span data-start="690.519" data-end="694.91">Oftentimes, managers in tech may never have had a mother go on maternity leave for their</span> <span data-start="694.91" data-end="696.139">team.</span> <span data-start="696.139" data-end="701.81">They have no idea what challenges she is facing, what questions might help or hurt her return</span> <span data-start="701.81" data-end="707.339">back to work transition, and how best to support her.</span> </p>
