modes we don't</span> <span data-start="278.93" data-end="280.52">need to have the additional diff we</span> <span data-start="280.52" data-end="281.48">don't even need to have a background</span> <span data-start="281.48" data-end="284.51">color there is a property hopefully</span> <span data-start="284.51" data-end="286.85">we'll get meted called backdrop filter</span> <span data-start="286.85" data-end="289.64">and backdrop filter is really cool</span> <span data-start="289.64" data-end="291.35">because not only can we create this</span> <span data-start="291.35" data-end="294.05">effect that sort of has that darker</span> <span data-start="294.05" data-end="296.32">color in the background we can't blurs</span> <span data-start="296.32" data-end="298.79">since it's a filter we can use any of</span> <span data-start="298.79" data-end="300.89">those 10 filters so remember he wrote</span> <span data-start="300.89" data-end="303.44">eight is one of the options we can do</span> <span data-start="303.44" data-end="305.36">you know we can change the brightness</span> <span data-start="305.36" data-end="308.81">value any of that and get that same</span> <span data-start="308.81" data-end="310.34">effect but it's so interactive and we</span> <span data-start="310.34" data-end="311.21">can do it just directly in the browser</span> <span data-start="311.21" data-end="314.54">we can prototype right here so if I want</span> <span data-start="314.54" data-end="316.34">at a brightness that means I can also</span> <span data-start="316.34" data-end="318.35">make it darker if that brightness value</span> <span data-start="318.35" data-end="320.3">is less than 1 so we don't even need</span> <span data-start="320.3" data-end="321.5">that line of code to the background</span> <span data-start="321.5" data-end="323.24">don't need a background at all in one</span> <span data-start="323.24" data-end="325.55">line of CSS is backdrop filter we can</span> <span data-start="325.55" data-end="327.74">recreate this entire effect it's pretty</span> <span data-start="327.74" data-end="334.08">cool this browser support is pretty bad</span> <span data-start="334.09" data-end="337.43">it won't want however there are</span> <span data-start="337.43" data-end="339.62">workarounds there are hacks that let you</span> <span data-start="339.62" data-end="342.229">do this here is another example of this</span> <span data-start="342.229" data-end="343.76">it allows that text to be much more</span> <span data-start="343.76" data-end="346.4">legible inside that modal window so it</span> <span data-start="346.4" data-end="347.93">has a light background but it's also</span> <span data-start="347.93" data-end="350.33">blurring that mountain image behind that</span> <span data-start="350.33" data-end="353.479">text so how do we recreate this in our</span> <span data-start="353.479" data-end="355.64">current modern browsers how can we do</span> <span data-start="355.64" data-end="358.16">this it's called the fixed background</span> <span data-start="358.16" data-end="360.38">hack and it looks like this what you're</span> <span data-start="360.38" data-end="362.57">essentially doing is applying the same</span> <span data-start="362.57" data-end="364.7">background to the page and the element</span> <span data-start="364.7" data-end="366.74">that you want to fake that blur effect</span> <span data-start="366.74" data-end="371.66">so I have here this fixed background and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="371.66" data-end="373.28">I have zero cover so it takes up the</span> <span data-start="373.28" data-end="373.92">entire</span> <span data-start="373.92" data-end="375.93">so whatever i'm revealing of that</span> <span data-start="375.93" data-end="378.57">background as i scroll will reveal the</span> <span data-start="378.57" data-end="381.15">same spot as the background of the page</span> <span data-start="381.15" data-end="383.34">so since that's an element that we've</span> <span data-start="383.34" data-end="385.14">added on top of that background we can</span> <span data-start="385.14" data-end="387.84">apply filters we can apply blur we can</span> <span data-start="387.84" data-end="390.12">apply a brightness filter take that text</span> <span data-start="390.12" data-end="392.28">more legible and it creates sort of that</span> <span data-start="392.28" data-end="394.62">same effect that same idea you can add</span> <span data-start="394.62" data-end="396.27">draggable to it like that previous</span> <span data-start="396.27" data-end="400.74">example in code pen and there we go you</span> <span data-start="400.74" data-end="403.05">can do things like revealing images so I</span> <span data-start="403.05" data-end="405.72">can hover over this and get whatever's</span> <span data-start="405.72" data-end="409.08">behind it you can do this with text so</span> <span data-start="409.08" data-end="410.55">making text more legible on top of</span> <span data-start="410.55" data-end="412.65">images if you had links or information</span> <span data-start="412.65" data-end="415.74">about speakers or users and it's really</span> <span data-start="415.74" data-end="417.3">easy to do this just in a couple of</span> <span data-start="417.3" data-end="419.22">lines of code you can apply this filter</span> <span data-start="419.22" data-end="421.5">this is you know using on a prefixed</span> <span data-start="421.5" data-end="422.7">here so it's going to add that WebKit</span> <span data-start="422.7" data-end="424.77">prefix and then add some content</span> <span data-start="424.77" data-end="427.17">afterwards just in two divs have a</span> <span data-start="427.17" data-end="428.91">rapper and do within it and you have</span> <span data-start="428.91" data-end="431.19">created this effect which is a blur that</span> <span data-start="431.19" data-end="436.2">reveals some text as you hover on top so</span> <span data-start="436.2" data-end="437.91">another cool thing about filters is not</span> <span data-start="437.91" data-end="440.7">just is there a variety of options to</span> <span data-start="440.7" data-end="443.31">play with and choose from but you're</span> <span data-start="443.31" data-end="445.47">saving image requests with your hover</span> <span data-start="445.47" data-end="447.42">states with whatever active States focus</span> <span data-start="447.42" data-end="449.52">you want because you don't have to have</span> <span data-start="449.52" data-end="452.64">an image for your main view and a</span> <span data-start="452.64" data-end="453.93">separate image that you're downloading</span> <span data-start="453.93" data-end="456.15">onto your users site for that secondary</span> <span data-start="456.15" data-end="458.13">view you can just apply a filter to it</span> <span data-start="458.13" data-end="460.77">and that's saving you a lot of memory if</span> <span data-start="460.77" data-end="463.2">you're not sending multiple images of</span> <span data-start="463.2" data-end="466.47">the same thing to your users so filters</span> <span data-start="466.47" data-end="467.73">can be really really useful in that</span> <span data-start="467.73" data-end="470.16">sense and here's just a good example of</span> <span data-start="470.16" data-end="473.07">the variety that you can apply and</span> <span data-start="473.07" data-end="477.33">mixing some of them so filters are</span> <span data-start="477.33" data-end="479.28">really cool but really what I think is</span> <span data-start="479.28" data-end="481.41">awesome about the web today is blend</span> <span data-start="481.41" data-end="484.8">modes blend modes how divs and colors</span> <span data-start="484.8" data-end="487.35">can interact on the web and this is</span> <span data-start="487.35" data-end="489.45">really really powerful there's a lot</span> <span data-start="489.45" data-end="492.36">more variety than the filters so here we</span> <span data-start="492.36" data-end="493.77">have all these options and I come in a</span> <span data-start="493.77" data-end="495.99">couple of groups dark and multiply and</span> <span data-start="495.99" data-end="497.43">color burn will all make those images</span> <span data-start="497.43" data-end="499.44">darker there's the Lightman group which</span> <span data-start="499.44" data-end="500.91">is lightning screen and color dodge</span> <span data-start="500.91" data-end="503.91">there's overlay soft light and hard</span> <span data-start="503.91" data-end="505.53">light then there's two that are kind of</span> <span data-start="505.53" data-end="507.06">similar which is difference in exclusion</span> <span data-start="507.06" data-end="509.34">and last four are all color properties</span> <span data-start="509.34" data-end="513.65">so hue saturation color and luminosity</span> <span data-start="513.65"
