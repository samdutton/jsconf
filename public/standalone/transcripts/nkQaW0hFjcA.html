data-start="225.83" data-end="227.72">basically we started off the class by</span> <span data-start="227.72" data-end="229.22">basically giving the students a textbook</span> <span data-start="229.22" data-end="231.47">and saying here let's go through this</span> <span data-start="231.47" data-end="233.209">together and ask us questions when I</span> <span data-start="233.209" data-end="234.86">have them I was like I learned from a</span> <span data-start="234.86" data-end="236.87">textbook this is the best way and then</span> <span data-start="236.87" data-end="238.13">like seventy-five percent of the</span> <span data-start="238.13" data-end="239.78">students were like this is it did</span> <span data-start="239.78" data-end="240.92">work for twenty-five percent of the</span> <span data-start="240.92" data-end="242.54">students yeah that's like the important</span> <span data-start="242.54" data-end="243.68">lesson is that everybody learns</span> <span data-start="243.68" data-end="245.15">differently and what works for one</span> <span data-start="245.15" data-end="247.34">student won't work for for others to</span> <span data-start="247.34" data-end="248.57">write and like the whole like some</span> <span data-start="248.57" data-end="250.43">people learn visually some people learn</span> <span data-start="250.43" data-end="254.09">orally whatever also not really the case</span> <span data-start="254.09" data-end="258.02">people switch modes like everybody same</span> <span data-start="258.02" data-end="260.75">day yeah so we had some students who</span> <span data-start="260.75" data-end="262.25">were like I don't understand anything</span> <span data-start="262.25" data-end="263.9">but the moment you sit down with them</span> <span data-start="263.9" data-end="265.58">and you like draw a picture for them</span> <span data-start="265.58" data-end="267.41">about like this is what happens when a</span> <span data-start="267.41" data-end="269.03">request comes in and it goes through the</span> <span data-start="269.03" data-end="271.16">stack you like see lights turning on its</span> <span data-start="271.16" data-end="272.54">the best possible feeling you can have</span> <span data-start="272.54" data-end="275.15">so whatever interaction may be whether</span> <span data-start="275.15" data-end="276.53">it's sitting down with them answering</span> <span data-start="276.53" data-end="279.68">questions drawing pictures or building</span> <span data-start="279.68" data-end="281.45">apps together like that's when students</span> <span data-start="281.45" data-end="283.4">are going to learn the best right so we</span> <span data-start="283.4" data-end="285.41">decided to like not just do full</span> <span data-start="285.41" data-end="286.729">lectures this was something that we</span> <span data-start="286.729" data-end="288.83">figured out later on we lectured for</span> <span data-start="288.83" data-end="291.14">like 5-10 minutes would be stopped class</span> <span data-start="291.14" data-end="291.889">and then we</span> <span data-start="291.889" data-end="294.46">little workshops for like 15 minutes so</span> <span data-start="294.46" data-end="296.84">again like if you were bored you just</span> <span data-start="296.84" data-end="298.819">had to wait 10 minutes and you get</span> <span data-start="298.819" data-end="300.289">something totally different and during</span> <span data-start="300.289" data-end="301.999">these workshops it's not just like one</span> <span data-start="301.999" data-end="304.039">person working by themselves we really</span> <span data-start="304.039" data-end="306.349">encourage them to pair program and talk</span> <span data-start="306.349" data-end="308.3">to each other and get better at like the</span> <span data-start="308.3" data-end="310.219">non technical stuff like how do you give</span> <span data-start="310.219" data-end="312.349">feedback how do you take feedback how do</span> <span data-start="312.349" data-end="315.59">you work together on a team exactly that</span> <span data-start="315.59" data-end="316.909">kind of stuff so while they were working</span> <span data-start="316.909" data-end="319.009">on their own basically that gave that</span> <span data-start="319.009" data-end="320.389">freed us off to be able to walk around</span> <span data-start="320.389" data-end="322.669">answer questions help students out with</span> <span data-start="322.669" data-end="324.169">whatever they need it but the problem</span> <span data-start="324.169" data-end="327.139">that we ended up having was our time was</span> <span data-start="327.139" data-end="330.71">being to monopolize by single question</span> <span data-start="330.71" data-end="333.08">yeah there's only two of us asking and</span> <span data-start="333.08" data-end="335.09">answering questions from like 30 people</span> <span data-start="335.09" data-end="337.909">so instead of one of our students decide</span> <span data-start="337.909" data-end="339.259">to make a solution to the problem like</span> <span data-start="339.259" data-end="341.84">this was his first rails app awesome I</span> <span data-start="341.84" data-end="344.24">learned how to build this in class saw</span> <span data-start="344.24"
