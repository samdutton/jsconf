<p><span data-start="14.28" data-end="16.07">So, for someone who's new to the profession,</span> <span data-start="16.07" data-end="17.699">I think the best thing to do is</span> <span data-start="17.7" data-end="22">start new projects and do things that you enjoy doing, because if you're doing something you enjoy doing,</span> <span data-start="22" data-end="24.42">you're gonna have such a better learning experience by doing that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="26.4" data-end="28.34">Look for mentorship.</span> <span data-start="28.34" data-end="33.98">Sometimes you just need to ask, and you will be surprised how many people are willing to help with that.</span> <span data-start="35.58" data-end="39.68">Learn the basics, like learn the JavaScript, learn the CSS, learn the HTML.</span> <span data-start="41.16" data-end="43.16">Yeah, I kind of agree,</span> <span data-start="43.4" data-end="49.44">Like, I went through so long and I didn't know HTTP, and that messed up so much of my understanding,</span> <span data-start="49.52" data-end="53.68">but I still think if I stopped and tried to learn HTTP that early on,</span> <span data-start="53.94" data-end="56.54">I would have just abandoned the whole thing, because I wouldn't haveâ€¦ I mean</span> <span data-start="56.54" data-end="60.16">you also have to be realistic, like many people start with a job, and in that job,</span> <span data-start="60.16" data-end="62.36">we use frameworks, you probably don't have the time to learn the basics.</span> <span data-start="62.36" data-end="67.24">So I'm not saying, like, you're doing it wrong if you not learn the basics first,</span> <span data-start="67.24" data-end="69.4">It's just that I recommend, I think it's time well invested.</span> <span data-start="69.84" data-end="74.56">I recommend speaking at conferences, like, before you even get a job in tech, speak at a conference, just make it up,</span> <span data-start="74.56" data-end="76.98">because it's really good for your profile, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="77.42" data-end="79.42">That's how you get it up in the first place! Exactly!</span> <span data-start="79.66" data-end="81.66">Fake it 'till you make it. Fake it 'till you make it!</span> <span data-start="86.38" data-end="92.1">This is my first time in JSConf Budapest, it's amazing. I love the diversity over here.</span> <span data-start="92.1" data-end="97.74">As an experience wise, it's amazing and the things I'm learning here is also very great, because, though I'm an infra engineer,</span> <span data-start="97.74" data-end="100.54">there are certain concepts which are relevant to a DevOps engineer as well,</span> <span data-start="100.54" data-end="102.96">like how you should communicate to your architects,</span> <span data-start="102.96" data-end="106.46">how you should work in collaboration with your product manager and the way you build your products.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="106.479" data-end="111.429">Maybe we can also think of having accessibility in DevOps, whatever products we're building,</span> <span data-start="111.92" data-end="113.63">So yeah, it's quite relevant.</span> <span data-start="113.86" data-end="120.18">JSConf Budapest is my first conference as an attendee, and my very first conference as a speaker,</span> <span data-start="120.19" data-end="123.099">it's all new to me, and I had a wonderful time. Thank you all so much!</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="123.649" data-end="128.979">My experience of JSConf has been really good so far, we've been able to travel here with the whole family,</span> <span data-start="129.56" data-end="131.92">got a lovely family room at the hotel,</span> <span data-start="132.47" data-end="139.239">the food has been good and all of the communications and the help I've gotten as a speaker has been, blew my mind.</span> <span data-start="140.209" data-end="143.229">For me a very humbling experience to be here today</span> <span data-start="143.33" data-end="149.679">This is one of the places where the people are so nice and so open. I love the community here</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="150.32" data-end="155.38">Last time I was at JSConf Budapest, I got hit in the eye by an HDMI dongle.</span> <span data-start="156.44" data-end="158.1">What a great memory! Yeah.</span> <span data-start="158.1" data-end="163.2">I think my favorite memory is my very first talk as a Googler with JSConf EU 2015.</span> <span data-start="163.2" data-end="167.4">It was a bad talk but it was a great community. I wasn't there.
No, you weren't.</span> <span data-start="172.98" data-end="180.74">It's my first time in any JSConf conferences and it's been amazing, I don't know, it's amazing content all the time.</span> <span data-start="180.76" data-end="184.2">It goes outside of what you would expect from a tech conference.</span> <span data-start="184.2" data-end="188.98">My favorite talk so far has been the talk of this guy that works with refugee aid camp,</span> <span data-start="188.98" data-end="193.58">which is something we would never have access to this, like, anywhere else, and I think, like, that,</span> <span data-start="193.58" data-end="201.14">alongside with the community here that seems to be very friendly and very respectful, I'm having a blast, like I'm having the best time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="202.96" data-end="207.94">My favorite JSConf memory was talking to the organizer of JSConf EU,</span> <span data-start="207.94" data-end="212.1">and kind of hearing his authentic heart for the conference</span> <span data-start="212.1" data-end="217.84">and how he wants to get everybody involved irrespective of race and gender and orientation, just,</span> <span data-start="217.84" data-end="219.86">it's a conference for everybody.</span> <span data-start="220.02" data-end="224.36">When I think of JSConf, I think inclusion, family, community.</span> </p>
