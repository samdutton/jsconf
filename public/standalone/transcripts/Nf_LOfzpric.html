<p><span data-start="105.39" data-end="115.92">API so all right so we're gonna start</span> <span data-start="115.92" data-end="120.03">with performance when we do animation</span> <span data-start="120.03" data-end="122.64">the most important property to use is</span> <span data-start="122.64" data-end="126.54">the transform property there's four</span> <span data-start="126.54" data-end="128.429">things the browser can really animate</span> <span data-start="128.429" data-end="131.43">really cheaply and that's position scale</span> <span data-start="131.43" data-end="133.13">rotation</span> <span data-start="133.13" data-end="136.07">pasady and so position scale rotation</span> <span data-start="136.07" data-end="138.53">you can do them all with CSS transforms</span> <span data-start="138.53" data-end="145.46">and opacity is just CSS opacity yeah and</span> <span data-start="145.46" data-end="148.97">you use them in CSS transform property</span> <span data-start="148.97" data-end="152.96">mostly the transform property can do can</span> <span data-start="152.96" data-end="156.29">do a lot of things you can translate</span> <span data-start="156.29" data-end="158.45">things so you can move them left to</span> <span data-start="158.45" data-end="161.81">right up and down on the XY axis and</span> <span data-start="161.81" data-end="164.93">also in a 3d space with translate set</span> <span data-start="164.93" data-end="169.1">you can rotate things on different axis</span> <span data-start="169.1" data-end="171.68">on the set axis on the x axis and the y</span> <span data-start="171.68" data-end="174.89">axis so you can also do 3d rotate you</span> <span data-start="174.89" data-end="178.49">can scale things up and down then you</span> <span data-start="178.49" data-end="180.28">can skew things</span> <span data-start="180.28" data-end="183.71">yeah you can also rotate on different</span> <span data-start="183.71" data-end="186.89">axes CSS reference is really useful the</span> <span data-start="186.89" data-end="188.84">link on the bottom to like look at what</span> <span data-start="188.84" data-end="191.09">transform can do and how to use two</span> <span data-start="191.09" data-end="195.64">different the different properties</span> <span data-start="195.64" data-end="198.41">because some of them use degrees some</span> <span data-start="198.41" data-end="200.93">just use numbers between 0 and 1 some</span> <span data-start="200.93" data-end="202.91">use pixels so it's all different</span> <span data-start="202.91" data-end="206.54">depending on what you're using and in</span> <span data-start="206.54" data-end="209.12">combination with transform the</span> <span data-start="209.12" data-end="211.55">transformer richness it really important</span> <span data-start="211.55" data-end="214.52">it tells your animation from which point</span> <span data-start="214.52" data-end="216.68">it should start so if it should be</span> <span data-start="216.68" data-end="219.14">reaching from the center from the top</span> <span data-start="219.14" data-end="222.77">left from the bottom right it looks like</span> <span data-start="222.77" data-end="225.44">the like the following so if it's from</span> <span data-start="225.44" data-end="229.82">the center it's gonna transform like</span> <span data-start="229.82" data-end="231.62">that then you can also have it outside</span> <span data-start="231.62" data-end="234.35">of the object so you can rotate for</span> <span data-start="234.35" data-end="237.8">example around the circle or you could</span> <span data-start="237.8" data-end="239.81">just have it on the top left or on the</span> <span data-start="239.81" data-end="241.64">bottom right wherever you need it to</span> <span data-start="241.64" data-end="247.64">original so what happens when we change</span> <span data-start="247.64" data-end="251.09">something this is really important to to</span> <span data-start="251.09" data-end="253.13">know to realize how does the browser</span> <span data-start="253.13" data-end="256.25">paint a website what changes you can</span> <span data-start="256.25" data-end="258.7">make and how they influence the painting</span> <span data-start="258.7" data-end="262.87">so first your Chavez script is evaluated</span> <span data-start="262.87" data-end="265.06">then we</span> <span data-start="265.06" data-end="267.219">then the browser is gonna recalculate</span> <span data-start="267.219" data-end="270.249">your Styles he's gonna see how much</span> <span data-start="270.249" data-end="273.009">space does every element need where does</span> <span data-start="273.009" data-end="275.74">it go this is often when you do um left</span> <span data-start="275.74" data-end="279.879">or right up top a button with CSS also</span> <span data-start="279.879" data-end="281.349">they're layered calculations it's the</span> <span data-start="281.349" data-end="284.229">same stuff then with their paintings so</span> <span data-start="284.229" data-end="286.509">everything gets rasterized and put on</span> <span data-start="286.509" data-end="288.039">two layers so you have different layers</span> <span data-start="288.039" data-end="290.43">when your browser paint something and</span> <span data-start="290.43" data-end="294.219">you can move layers independently so if</span> <span data-start="294.219" data-end="295.81">you have a layer in the bottom you can</span> <span data-start="295.81" data-end="297.699">move it independently from from an other</span> <span data-start="297.699" data-end="300.069">layer but your browsers gonna um group</span> <span data-start="300.069" data-end="303.159">things together into layers so you don't</span> <span data-start="303.159" data-end="304.87">get too many layers because too many</span> <span data-start="304.87" data-end="307.629">layers are also on performant and in the</span> <span data-start="307.629" data-end="309.969">end we have the composite step and</span> <span data-start="309.969" data-end="311.979">that's where the browser takes advantage</span> <span data-start="311.979" data-end="315.159">of the GPU and all the layers get get</span> <span data-start="315.159" data-end="317.83">glued together to one frame and that's</span> <span data-start="317.83" data-end="319.96">what's shown to the user that happens in</span> <span data-start="319.96" data-end="323.08">the last step so all of this happens in</span> <span data-start="323.08" data-end="324.999">in one frame and so when we change</span> <span data-start="324.999" data-end="327.189">different things it's gonna influence</span> <span data-start="327.189" data-end="330.46">our performance so when we change layer</span> <span data-start="330.46" data-end="333.189">it's gonna be in the layout step so in</span> <span data-start="333.189" data-end="335.469">the second step this is when we changed</span> <span data-start="335.469" data-end="338.259">with the March and the left the top all</span> <span data-start="338.259" data-end="340.569">of these layout properties and that's</span> <span data-start="340.569" data-end="342.43">really unperformed because then the</span> <span data-start="342.43" data-end="345.009">browser needs to go to also through the</span> <span data-start="345.009" data-end="347.289">other steps after that and that's why</span> <span data-start="347.289" data-end="349.719">you don't really want to animate layout</span> <span data-start="349.719" data-end="352.33">properties because yeah it's gonna be</span> <span data-start="352.33" data-end="354.55">unperformed then with the paint step</span> <span data-start="354.55" data-end="356.86">that's when we when we change for</span> <span data-start="356.86" data-end="358.87">example the background color shadows</span> <span data-start="358.87" data-end="362.469">outlines it's more performant and then</span> <span data-start="362.469" data-end="365.05">layout but the most performant way to</span> <span data-start="365.05" data-end="367.419">animate is like I already said transform</span> <span data-start="367.419" data-end="369.849">property and that's happening on the</span> <span data-start="369.849" data-end="373.319">composite layer so transform and opacity</span> <span data-start="373.319" data-end="376.18">are the last step and then when you when</span> <span data-start="376.18" data-end="377.86">you animate those you don't need to go</span> <span data-start="377.86" data-end="379.889">through the previous steps the browser</span> <span data-start="379.889" data-end="383.86">needs to run through yeah so try to</span> <span data-start="383.86" data-end="385.719">animate are always on their composite</span> <span data-start="385.719" data-end="389.349">step this is what it looks like in your</span> <span data-start="389.349" data-end="392.05">dev tools so you can you can dip back</span> <span data-start="392.05" data-end="396.5">animations and see what's happening what</span> <span data-start="396.5" data-end="399.08">causing your animation to be slow where</span> <span data-start="399.08" data-end="401.57">where the issues are yeah and the</span> <span data-start="401.57" data-end="403.52">coloring you can also look at why it's</span> <span data-start="403.52" data-end="406.1">taking so long</span> <span data-start="406.1" data-end="408.59">also yeah like I already said a lot of</span> <span data-start="408.59" data-end="411.32">layers a bad but it's good to like</span> <span data-start="411.32" data-end="413.51">create layers for the right things so if</span> <span data-start="413.51" data-end="415.46">you animate something specifically and</span> <span data-start="415.46" data-end="417.53">you know you're gonna need an extra</span> <span data-start="417.53" data-end="419.78">layer for that it's it's good to create</span> <span data-start="419.78" data-end="424.34">layers so what creates a new layer 3d</span> <span data-start="424.34" data-end="427.4">transform always creates a new layer so</span> <span data-start="427.4" data-end="431.84">if you use trance let's see set or you</span> <span data-start="431.84" data-end="434.29">know any any kind of 3d transform</span> <span data-start="434.29" data-end="437.54">animated 2d transforms to also create</span> <span data-start="437.54" data-end="440.419">layers so if you have keyframes the anim</span> <span data-start="440.419" data-end="442.91">transforms you're gonna have those on a</span> <span data-start="442.91" data-end="445.94">separate layer being on top of</span> <span data-start="445.94" data-end="448.69">compositing layers also creates new</span> <span data-start="448.69" data-end="452">creates a new layer so you have to see</span> <span data-start="452" data-end="454.58">where where where your layers are and</span> <span data-start="454.58" data-end="457.1">you should rather animate on top layers</span> <span data-start="457.1" data-end="460.82">not on the bottom layers accelerated CSS</span> <span data-start="460.82" data-end="463.13">filters create new layers and of course</span> <span data-start="463.13" data-end="466.729">will change property creates a new layer</span> <span data-start="466.729" data-end="470.36">that's the most popular one but you have</span> <span data-start="470.36" data-end="472.01">to be aware when you create new layers</span> <span data-start="472.01" data-end="477.32">that every layer consumes memory so ya</span> <span data-start="477.32" data-end="479.72">only use them when you need them for</span> <span data-start="479.72" data-end="481.79">animation and maybe remove them and</span> <span data-start="481.79" data-end="485.36">something has stopped animating so this</span> <span data-start="485.36" data-end="488.84">is SAS mixing for like really making</span> <span data-start="488.84" data-end="491.63">sure that a new layer is created it uses</span> <span data-start="491.63" data-end="496.16">will change then it uses a transform</span> <span data-start="496.16" data-end="499.669">translate that because will change isn't</span> <span data-start="499.669" data-end="502.85">supported in all browsers so if you</span> <span data-start="502.85" data-end="504.53">really want to support all our browsers</span> <span data-start="504.53" data-end="509.29">you're gonna probably use a 3d transform</span> <span data-start="509.29" data-end="513.32">yeah and on will change because you</span> <span data-start="513.32" data-end="514.849">always create new layers with will</span> <span data-start="514.849" data-end="517.4">change you you shouldn't optimize all</span> <span data-start="517.4" data-end="518.839">the elements because you're gonna get a</span> <span data-start="518.839" data-end="520.43">lot of layers and you don't want that</span> <span data-start="520.43" data-end="523.31">and only use it if the change happens</span> <span data-start="523.31" data-end="525.95">constantly and maybe remove it when you</span> <span data-start="525.95" data-end="527.06">don't need it anymore</span> <span data-start="527.06" data-end="531.75">and yeah in some browsers it's not</span> <span data-start="531.75" data-end="533.79">supported yet so you're gonna need to</span> <span data-start="533.79" data-end="537.959">use the 3d transforms also another thing</span> <span data-start="537.959" data-end="540.209">for performance that's really important</span> <span data-start="540.209" data-end="541.8">is a function that's called</span> <span data-start="541.8" data-end="545.64">requestanimationframe in JavaScript it's</span> <span data-start="545.64" data-end="547.5">a function that the browser can optimize</span> <span data-start="547.5"

data-end="556.649">and it allows the CPU to chill if you go</span> <span data-start="556.649" data-end="558.3">to another website so it doesn't run</span> <span data-start="558.3" data-end="559.8">consistently if you're not even looking</span> <span data-start="559.8" data-end="562.8">at it and it's more battery friendly so</span> <span data-start="562.8" data-end="565.35">if you do consistent changes consistent</span> <span data-start="565.35" data-end="567.99">animations requestanimationframe is a</span> <span data-start="567.99" data-end="571.649">great way to to make it more performant</span> <span data-start="571.649" data-end="573.329">and you don't need to use it if you're</span> <span data-start="573.329" data-end="575.339">using the web animations API because it</span> <span data-start="575.339" data-end="578.73">does this automatically yeah and green</span> <span data-start="578.73" data-end="580.29">sock of course also uses the</span> <span
