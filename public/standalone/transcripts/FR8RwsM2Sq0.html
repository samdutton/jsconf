data-end="349.21">make me believe that so I think the main</span> <span data-start="349.21" data-end="350.77">thing that I contributed to the world of</span> <span data-start="350.77" data-end="353.05">web performance is what I sit call</span> <span data-start="353.05" data-end="355.03">turning it upside down turning the focus</span> <span data-start="355.03" data-end="358.33">upside down I worked for 10 years doing</span> <span data-start="358.33" data-end="360.19">web development on back-end</span> <span data-start="360.19" data-end="362.32">architectures I ran to my yahoo team I</span> <span data-start="362.32" data-end="365.11">worked on yahoo's user database before</span> <span data-start="365.11" data-end="367.26">that I worked at lycos and who wear</span> <span data-start="367.26" data-end="374.26">large web companies and about five years</span> <span data-start="374.26" data-end="376.51">ago I got asked to start a performance</span> <span data-start="376.51" data-end="378.46">group at Yahoo and that was one of the</span> <span data-start="378.46" data-end="380.23">first times I fired up a packet sniffer</span> <span data-start="380.23" data-end="383.32">and we've seen a lot of these waterfall</span> <span data-start="383.32" data-end="386.11">charts so we kind of know what's going</span> <span data-start="386.11" data-end="388.63">on here but we have a HTML document and</span> <span data-start="388.63" data-end="390.61">then all the other requests that come</span> <span data-start="390.61" data-end="392.95">forward here and one thing that I'd like</span> <span data-start="392.95" data-end="394.6">to highlight here I'm not going to talk</span> <span data-start="394.6" data-end="396.94">about too much more but if you look at</span> <span data-start="396.94" data-end="400.99">this we consider or a lot of my work is</span> <span data-start="400.99" data-end="402.82">on how to download stuff more quickly</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="402.82" data-end="405.37">Kyle talked about that yesterday for an</span> <span data-start="405.37" data-end="409.44">hour and if you look here this person's</span> <span data-start="409.44" data-end="412.09">internet connection is being utilized at</span> <span data-start="412.09" data-end="414.64">most at about it twenty percent ten or</span> <span data-start="414.64" data-end="417.46">twenty percent of its capacity and so we</span> <span data-start="417.46" data-end="419.68">need to do a lot of work in trying to</span> <span data-start="419.68" data-end="421.63">get that up it'll never be a hundred</span> <span data-start="421.63" data-end="423.73">percent but we're never going to have</span> <span data-start="423.73" data-end="426.46">fast web at web applications until we</span> <span data-start="426.46" data-end="428.92">start utilizing the browser's network</span> <span data-start="428.92" data-end="430.69">connection at least at the eighty</span> <span data-start="430.69" data-end="432.82">percent level so we've got a lot of room</span> <span data-start="432.82" data-end="435.01">for improvement here that's why I'm very</span> <span data-start="435.01" data-end="438.37">optimistic that the slow performance I</span> <span data-start="438.37" data-end="440.98">experience now surfing the web is</span> <span data-start="440.98" data-end="443.92">fixable so anyway the thing I flipped</span> <span data-start="443.92" data-end="446.41">upside down was you know in my first ten</span> <span data-start="446.41" data-end="447.97">years why I wanted to optimize the</span> <span data-start="447.97" data-end="449.98">performance of a website I would focus</span> <span data-start="449.98" data-end="452.38">on that back-end architecture and it</span> <span data-start="452.38" data-end="455.05">turns out in here I'm unloading I google</span> <span data-start="455.05" data-end="457.51">with an empty cache in ie7 that only</span> <span data-start="457.51" data-end="460.66">nine percent of the overall page load</span> <span data-start="460.66" data-end="462.79">time was the part that I was focusing on</span> <span data-start="462.79" data-end="464.67">and maybe I could</span> <span data-start="464.67" data-end="466.95">move that back in part ten percent if I</span> <span data-start="466.95" data-end="469.11">was really successful so I was going to</span> <span data-start="469.11" data-end="471.21">knock off about point nine percent of</span> <span data-start="471.21" data-end="473.43">the low time of the page so clearly I</span> <span data-start="473.43" data-end="475.56">wasn't focusing on the long pole in the</span> <span data-start="475.56" data-end="477.57">tent the long pole in the tent is what i</span> <span data-start="477.57" data-end="479.76">call this front end part and this front</span> <span data-start="479.76" data-end="481.26">end part does include some network</span> <span data-start="481.26" data-end="482.94">traffic maybe a little bit of server</span> <span data-start="482.94" data-end="485.67">back in time but it turns out that these</span> <span data-start="485.67" data-end="490.65">techniques that I evangelize can really</span> <span data-start="490.65" data-end="492.96">have a dramatic improvement on this</span> <span data-start="492.96" data-end="495.99">front end part and even like the network</span> <span data-start="495.99" data-end="499.17">part isn't always the culprit so here we</span> <span data-start="499.17" data-end="501.36">see with a prime cash there's only two</span> <span data-start="501.36" data-end="504.06">requests the HTML document and some</span> <span data-start="504.06" data-end="505.65">other beacon or add or something like</span> <span data-start="505.65" data-end="507.93">that and even with everything cashed</span> <span data-start="507.93" data-end="511.23">their page still has a long load time</span> <span data-start="511.23" data-end="515.1">reading all of that all those resources</span> <span data-start="515.1" data-end="518.16">from the browser cache parsing and</span> <span data-start="518.16" data-end="520.62">applying all the CSS and JavaScript so</span> <span data-start="520.62" data-end="523.35">what what can we do to fix that so I</span> <span data-start="523.35" data-end="526.23">came up in why slow and in my first book</span> <span data-start="526.23" data-end="529.13">with these 14 rules for faster web sites</span> <span data-start="529.13" data-end="532.91">and and so I did that work mostly like</span> <span data-start="532.91" data-end="536.49">2006-2007 and after that first book came</span> <span data-start="536.49" data-end="538.41">out I started working and focusing more</span> <span data-start="538.41" data-end="541.2">on on the world of web soooo and ajax in</span> <span data-start="541.2" data-end="543.72">d HTML and so this book is much more</span> <span data-start="543.72" data-end="546.78">focused on JavaScript and I've got some</span> <span data-start="546.78" data-end="549.93">chapters contributed by industry experts</span> <span data-start="549.93" data-end="552.63">like Dion and band Doug Crockford</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="552.63" data-end="556.38">Nicholas akos Nicole who's here and</span> <span data-start="556.38" data-end="558.87">talking about CSS but she and story on</span> <span data-start="558.87" data-end="561.24">in my mind are the industry experts on</span> <span data-start="561.24" data-end="562.89">image optimization as well so they</span> <span data-start="562.89" data-end="564.93">contributed a chapter talking about</span> <span data-start="564.93" data-end="574.26">images so so we have all of these best</span> <span data-start="574.26" data-end="576.33">practices and they've been out there for</span> <span data-start="576.33" data-end="579.3">a while but I don't know about you the</span> <span data-start="579.3" data-end="582.45">web still feel slow to me and so popping</span> <span data-start="582.45" data-end="584.46">up a level what is it that you know in</span> <span data-start="584.46"

what is it that makes you feel</span> <span data-start="591.78" data-end="593.97">like a site is slow so I have a couple</span> <span data-start="593.97" data-end="595.86">examples here I want to</span> <span data-start="595.86" data-end="599.55">show so i actually have videos here so I</span> <span data-start="599.55" data-end="603.029">hit return so this is real time it's not</span> <span
