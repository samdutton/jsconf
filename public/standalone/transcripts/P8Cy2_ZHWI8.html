<p><span data-start="317.74" data-end="320.5">JavaScript you know how could she try</span> <span data-start="320.5" data-end="324.4">and visualize the hidden messages in the</span> <span

data-end="333.64">sound look like and you know how can we</span> <span data-start="333.64" data-end="335.47">visualize that so we saw some of that</span> <span data-start="335.47" data-end="337.21">last night where the sounds were</span> <span data-start="337.21" data-end="339.28">visualized long like the the frequency</span> <span data-start="339.28" data-end="340.93">samples I'm gonna do something slightly</span> <span data-start="340.93" data-end="344.47">different today and we're gonna find out</span> <span data-start="344.47" data-end="347.47">via art what sound can be made to look</span> <span data-start="347.47" data-end="349.39">like so we're gonna use the Web Audio</span> <span data-start="349.39" data-end="353.8">API and before I go into this you're</span> <span data-start="353.8" data-end="355.27">probably wondering what the formulaic</span> <span data-start="355.27" data-end="357.7">spectrum is well that's a made-up word</span> <span data-start="357.7" data-end="361.78">so I'll explain so when you work with</span> <span data-start="361.78" data-end="363.94">data especially in your professional job</span> <span data-start="363.94" data-end="366.55">you want to make sure that that the</span> <span data-start="366.55" data-end="368.77">integrity of that data is is accurate</span> <span data-start="368.77" data-end="370.93">and the way that you're presenting that</span> <span data-start="370.93" data-end="373.9">data is also super accurate and so when</span> <span data-start="373.9" data-end="376.36">you're creating art be loyal to that the</span> <span data-start="376.36" data-end="378.94">data is really important in order to</span> <span data-start="378.94" data-end="381.73">create beauty that people can still</span> <span data-start="381.73" data-end="384.01">relate back to the data right so that's</span> <span data-start="384.01" data-end="385.45">really really important</span> <span data-start="385.45" data-end="387.49">when you start getting on the data</span> <span data-start="387.49" data-end="389.65">corruption side things start to get</span> <span data-start="389.65" data-end="393.66">messy there's a slight disconnect and</span> <span data-start="393.66" data-end="396.01">you're not really sure what's going on</span> <span data-start="396.01" data-end="398.26">but the thing is like that's art — like</span> <span data-start="398.26" data-end="400.78">who cares it's it's not it's not</span> <span data-start="400.78" data-end="402.64">important because you start with</span> <span data-start="402.64" data-end="403.99">something and you come up with something</span> <span data-start="403.99" data-end="407.32">unexpected at the other end so the talk</span> <span data-start="407.32" data-end="409">today is sort of focusing more</span> <span data-start="409" data-end="411.22">it's this messy side just to give you a</span> <span data-start="411.22" data-end="415.27">bit of an indication so the way that I</span> <span data-start="415.27" data-end="417.07">wanted to use the Web Audio API was I</span> <span data-start="417.07" data-end="419.14">wanted to record samples of the subway</span> <span data-start="419.14" data-end="421.57">and then I wanted to analyze that PCM</span> <span data-start="421.57" data-end="424.63">data so what is PCM it stands for pulse</span> <span data-start="424.63" data-end="428.16">code modulation so it's actually the raw</span> <span data-start="428.16" data-end="430.87">uncompressed audio data so it's the</span> <span data-start="430.87" data-end="433.03">samples that have been taken from the</span> <span data-start="433.03" data-end="435.7">analog world and then digitized so each</span> <span data-start="435.7" data-end="439.78">value in like a PCM file the the sample</span> <span data-start="439.78" data-end="442.12">ranges from negative 1 to positive 1 in</span> <span data-start="442.12" data-end="443.83">value so that's really important cuz</span> <span data-start="443.83" data-end="445.12">we're sort of going to map to that later</span> <span data-start="445.12" data-end="448.78">and some common PCM format file</span> <span data-start="448.78" data-end="453.61">extensions WAV files a files a ul 16 and</span> <span data-start="453.61" data-end="458.26">of course start PCM and this is a rather</span> <span data-start="458.26" data-end="461.29">wonky photo I took from Wikipedia that</span> <span data-start="461.29" data-end="463.72">sort of shows how you have your analog</span> <span data-start="463.72" data-end="465.85">sine waves and then you do math to</span> <span data-start="465.85" data-end="468.46">figure out like how to actually sample</span> <span data-start="468.46" data-end="470.62">that at regulate intervals so they're</span> <span data-start="470.62" data-end="471.85">the sort of values that we'll be playing</span> <span data-start="471.85" data-end="475.99">with now I end a lot of time sort of</span> <span data-start="475.99" data-end="477.7">secretly trying to record sounds on the</span> <span data-start="477.7" data-end="480.1">subway and I decided to pick a really</span> <span data-start="480.1" data-end="481.96">annoying obnoxious sound that we've all</span> <span data-start="481.96" data-end="483.28">sort of learned to ignore so if you've</span> <span data-start="483.28" data-end="484.99">never been on the New York City subway</span> <span data-start="484.99" data-end="486.97">before you may not be familiar with this</span> <span data-start="486.97" data-end="488.62">so I'll play it for you those who have</span> <span data-start="488.62" data-end="491.13">will be very annoyingly aware of it</span> <span data-start="491.13" data-end="498.04">stand clear of the closing doors please</span> <span data-start="498.05" data-end="501.05">and that dingdong at the end every time</span> <span data-start="501.05" data-end="504.09">okay so what if we took this sounds</span> <span data-start="504.09" data-end="506.13">right what if we took it as a WAV file</span> <span data-start="506.13" data-end="508.009">and open debt and looked at the data and</span> <span data-start="508.009" data-end="510.509">what if we took all of those values from</span> <span data-start="510.509" data-end="513.36">negative one to positive one and we said</span> <span data-start="513.36" data-end="516.12">okay each sample is a pixel on our</span> <span data-start="516.12" data-end="518.49">screen and then what if we took that</span> <span data-start="518.49" data-end="521.13">range and just mapped it over so it</span> <span data-start="521.13" data-end="523.289">would be zero to 255 to make it easier</span> <span data-start="523.289" data-end="524.85">for us to work with right negative one</span> <span data-start="524.85" data-end="526.2">to positive one is a really weird range</span> <span data-start="526.2" data-end="528.36">to work with unless you're working with</span> <span data-start="528.36" data-end="531.089">random numbers and what if that new</span> <span data-start="531.089" data-end="532.74">value that we've mapped it to would</span> <span data-start="532.74" data-end="535.08">affect

data-end="556.23">then looping around and doing crazy</span> <span data-start="556.23" data-end="559.02">things with it within the loop so we use</span> <span data-start="559.02" data-end="561.15">the

data-start="575.25" data-end="577.11">dropping the right ear we loop through</span> <span data-start="577.11" data-end="581.58">that and once we've mapped the value</span> <span data-start="581.58" data-end="585.48">from 2 to from 0 to 255 we can then</span> <span data-start="585.48" data-end="588.45">generate a pixel out of it by generating</span> <span data-start="588.45" data-end="591.48">a

up</span> <span data-start="603.72" data-end="605.13">online later so you can have a look at</span> <span data-start="605.13" data-end="607.26">that more closely if you like so what</span> <span data-start="607.26" data-end="609.709">does it look like if we just do this</span> <span data-start="609.709" data-end="613.5">well this is sort of what we have and so</span> <span data-start="613.5" data-end="614.91">that comes out really interesting I</span> <span data-start="614.91" data-end="615.99">actually thought it was really beautiful</span> <span data-start="615.99" data-end="618.74">and so there's a lot of pixels in there</span> <span data-start="618.74" data-end="621.029">but you can sort of see this rainbow</span> <span data-start="621.029" data-end="622.529">banding effect which i think is really</span> <span data-start="622.529" data-end="623.31">really cool</span> <span data-start="623.31" data-end="627.029">and if you're so if you've really been</span> <span data-start="627.029" data-end="628.589">paying attention this photo in the last</span> <span data-start="628.589" data-end="629.36">10 seconds you</span> <span data-start="629.36" data-end="630.74">realize that you can actually see the</span> <span data-start="630.74" data-end="632.48">patterns of the sound and this really</span> <span data-start="632.48" data-end="635">delighted me a lot you can actually make</span> <span data-start="635" data-end="636.8">out the individual words through those</span> <span data-start="636.8" data-end="638.42">bands at the top so you can actually</span> <span data-start="638.42" data-end="640.91">figure out based on how big the bands</span> <span data-start="640.91" data-end="644.3">are which word and syllable the speaker</span> <span data-start="644.3" data-end="646.16">was saying then you can see this big</span> <span data-start="646.16" data-end="648.5">empty bit but that's the white noise and</span> <span data-start="648.5" data-end="650.36">then they very obnoxious dingdong at the</span> <span data-start="650.36" data-end="652.399">end is in like vibrant rainbow colors</span> <span data-start="652.399" data-end="655.13">and I thought this was actually really</span> <span data-start="655.13" data-end="657.47">cool like this was proof that the the</span> <span data-start="657.47" data-end="659.48">dotted integrity is like one for one you</span> <span data-start="659.48" data-end="661.37">can actually see it and so that's really</span> <span data-start="661.37" data-end="663.98">cool to verify that that you know you've</span> <span data-start="663.98" data-end="665.62">brought that in and visualized it</span> <span data-start="665.62" data-end="668.269">there's only one problem with that that</span> <span data-start="668.269" data-end="669.62">picture that you just looked at is</span> <span data-start="669.62" data-end="672.29">300,000 pixels and a couple of times I</span> <span data-start="672.29" data-end="674.029">got the code wrong and I just completely</span> <span data-start="674.029" data-end="675.68">crashed the browser because it got stuck</span> <span data-start="675.68" data-end="677.959">trying to work on something you can't</span> <span data-start="677.959" data-end="679.61">console.log within that loop or it will</span> <span data-start="679.61" data-end="683.269">freeze for example and when you think</span> <span data-start="683.269" data-end="686.51">about it I just got the one channel I</span> <span data-start="686.51" data-end="688.7">didn't get the other ear so imagine if</span> <span data-start="688.7" data-end="690.89">you had that would be 600,000 so it's</span> <span data-start="690.89" data-end="692.87">it's just it's a lot to work with and</span> <span data-start="692.87" data-end="696.89">it's a little bit scary so this is this</span> <span data-start="696.89" data-end="698.24">is a bit of a problem like how do we</span> <span data-start="698.24" data-end="701.839">sort of like reduce that I thought maybe</span> <span data-start="701.839" data-end="704.36">the best way that to reduce that is to</span> <span data-start="704.36" data-end="707.42">map it audio to visuals and then back</span> <span data-start="707.42" data-end="709.07">out to audio again what if we can make</span> <span data-start="709.07" data-end="713.51">different audio out of this so what if</span> <span data-start="713.51" data-end="715.04">we took the simple concepts of a song</span> <span data-start="715.04" data-end="718.73">right it's 16 beats so how do we sort of</span> <span data-start="718.73" data-end="721.1">divide that up well theoretically we</span> <span data-start="721.1" data-end="722.36">could take the three hundred and eight</span> <span data-start="722.36" data-end="723.86">thousand seven hundred and twenty eight</span> <span data-start="723.86" data-end="725.839">samples and we could divide that by</span> <span data-start="725.839" data-end="727.82">sixteen beats right so now we have our</span> <span data-start="727.82" data-end="729.56">chunks of samples to do something with</span> <span data-start="729.56" data-end="731.839">but that's still a lot of samples that's</span> <span data-start="731.839" data-end="735.019">19 thousand samples so what if we sort</span> <span data-start="735.019" data-end="736.399">of start getting real with the data</span> <span data-start="736.399" data-end="738.44">corruption and start losing data and</span> <span data-start="738.44" data-end="740.63">what if we average the sample values of</span> <span data-start="740.63" data-end="743.779">each beat so essentially we add all of</span> <span data-start="743.779" data-end="746.6">them together divide it by 19,000 and</span> <span data-start="746.6" data-end="749.39">then we end up with a negative 1 to</span> <span data-start="749.39" data-end="751.55">positive 1 range like value for every</span> <span data-start="751.55" data-end="753.32">single beat then we can take that value</span> <span data-start="753.32" data-end="755.779">and do something sort of meaningful with</span> <span data-start="755.779" data-end="757.459">it but it's it's a lot simpler to work</span> <span data-start="757.459" data-end="761.93">with so what if we wanted to put people</span> <span data-start="761.93" data-end="763.12">back on the train</span> <span data-start="763.12" data-end="766.13">we might be able to designate the seat</span> <span data-start="766.13" data-end="769.1">color of each feet based on the value</span> <span data-start="769.1" data-end="772.43">and maybe that seat color denotes what</span> <span data-start="772.43" data-end="775.04">drumbeats or what oscillator note we're</span> <span data-start="775.04" data-end="778.339">gonna play and then this little kitty at</span> <span data-start="778.339" data-end="780.769">the bottom what if if he was sitting on</span> <span data-start="780.769" data-end="782.69">a seat that was you know designated by a</span> <span data-start="782.69" data-end="784.51">specific value as well within that range</span> <span data-start="784.51" data-end="787.16">what if he could do a guitar strum and a</span> <span data-start="787.16" data-end="790.98">note to sort of accompany that</span> <span data-start="790.99" data-end="794.57">so what we get is something like this so</span> <span data-start="794.57" data-end="796.55">there are eight seats on the left and</span> <span data-start="796.55" data-end="798.23">eight seats on the right so that makes</span> <span data-start="798.23" data-end="801.29">up sixteen beats and you can see here</span> <span data-start="801.29" data-end="803.48">the cat has appeared in in this sort of</span> <span data-start="803.48" data-end="805.61">pattern now this is taking the direct</span> <span data-start="805.61" data-end="809.149">data from the the PCM values again from</span> <span data-start="809.149" data-end="810.8">that stand clear of the closing doors</span> <span data-start="810.8" data-end="813.139">please sound so without further ado</span> <span data-start="813.139" data-end="814.73">let's have a listen to what that sounds</span> <span data-start="814.73" data-end="833.22">like</span> <span data-start="833.23" data-end="836.99">okay so you get the point not sure</span> <span data-start="836.99" data-end="845.81">whether that's thank you so that's very</span> <span data-start="845.81" data-end="848.36">strange music and I sort of thought what</span> <span data-start="848.36" data-end="850.16">if we could make this a little more</span> <span data-start="850.16" data-end="853.94">entertaining so I have a friend and his</span> <span data-start="853.94" data-end="856.4">name is Mark Johnson and you can tell he</span> <span data-start="856.4" data-end="857.87">lives in New York just by looking at him</span> <span data-start="857.87" data-end="860.87">partly and he's a very incredibly</span> <span data-start="860.87" data-end="864.11">talented designer and he's also just a</span> <span data-start="864.11" data-end="866.81">really funny guy so I I met up with him</span> <span data-start="866.81" data-end="868.58">in the cafe a couple of weeks ago and I</span> <span data-start="868.58" data-end="870.44">said you don't happen to have any silly</span> <span data-start="870.44" data-end="872.57">sample sounds that you've recorded of</span> <span data-start="872.57" data-end="874.94">your own voice to you and without</span> <span data-start="874.94" data-end="876.83">surprise I said actually I do and he</span> <span data-start="876.83" data-end="878.6">just dropped boxed me a bunch of samples</span> <span data-start="878.6" data-end="881.18">so what happens if we put mark into this</span> <span data-start="881.18" data-end="882.74">train you know what is this gonna sound</span> <span data-start="882.74" data-end="903.309">like let's let's have a listen</span> <span data-start="903.319" data-end="905.009">anyway that's sort of a little bit</span> <span data-start="905.009" data-end="912.029">funnier and he we hasn't seen this yet</span> <span data-start="912.029" data-end="914.149">so I guess I'll just send him this video</span> <span data-start="914.149" data-end="916.74">okay so a little bit about how I put</span> <span data-start="916.74" data-end="918.69">this piece of art together</span> <span data-start="918.69" data-end="921.149">most of it is SVG images that I've drawn</span> <span data-start="921.149" data-end="923.67">in a different program and imported them</span> <span data-start="923.67" data-end="926.399">in just as image tags it's a lot of divs</span> <span data-start="926.399" data-end="928.079">so those seats are just floating divs</span> <span data-start="928.079" data-end="930.63">next to each other right so this this</span> <span data-start="930.63" data-end="932.91">sort of application is way easy to deal</span> <span data-start="932.91" data-end="934.769">with in canvas in my last example</span> <span data-start="934.769" data-end="937.35">because you're just working with CSS and</span> <span data-start="937.35" data-end="938.97">you're working with JavaScript</span> <span data-start="938.97" data-end="940.86">manipulating those Dom elements so I</span> <span data-start="940.86" data-end="943.589">highly recommend doing art with divs and</span> <span data-start="943.589" data-end="945.48">things like that because you probably</span> <span data-start="945.48" data-end="946.68">couldn't tell by looking at it that it</span> <span data-start="946.68" data-end="948.06">was just straight markup that you can</span> <span data-start="948.06" data-end="950.61">look at in in the chrome developer tools</span> <span data-start="950.61" data-end="953.37">and then I'm using CSS animations for</span> <span data-start="953.37"
