<p><span data-start="371.14" data-end="372.22">Salesman problem and that's a very</span> <span data-start="372.22" data-end="374.29">interesting property would you like to</span> <span data-start="374.29" data-end="378.04">talk now so word of the P equals NP</span> <span data-start="378.04" data-end="383.679">problem who knows what it means</span> <span data-start="383.689" data-end="385.949">okay well that's interesting but that's</span> <span data-start="385.949" data-end="388.529">precisely what I want to talk about so</span> <span data-start="388.529" data-end="390.869">there's a famous unsolved problem in</span> <span data-start="390.869" data-end="392.429">computer science famous for a lot of</span> <span data-start="392.429" data-end="394.829">reasons just recently there was a movie</span> <span data-start="394.829" data-end="398.239">about travelling salesman problem which</span> <span data-start="398.239" data-end="401.159">had the subject this problem so that's</span> <span data-start="401.159" data-end="403.679">why it's famous and there are popular</span> <span data-start="403.679" data-end="405.449">reference to it but what does it mean</span> <span data-start="405.449" data-end="408.899">actually well if you explain the two</span> <span data-start="408.899" data-end="411.269">different peas in there so what does P</span> <span data-start="411.269" data-end="413.969">mean so let's let's assume we have a</span> <span data-start="413.969" data-end="415.979">function edition everybody knows how to</span> <span data-start="415.979" data-end="418.259">do that and we're going to profile this</span> <span data-start="418.259" data-end="421.649">method on the following data set so the</span> <span data-start="421.649" data-end="425.269">profile method is not shown but it will</span> <span data-start="425.269" data-end="427.949">run a few times of this function with</span> <span data-start="427.949" data-end="430.289">the data two three and two so it will</span> <span data-start="430.289" data-end="436.219">actually answer with five I guess so</span> <span data-start="436.219" data-end="438.269">this is actually very interesting</span> <span data-start="438.269" data-end="440.939">because what I was expecting and this is</span> <span data-start="440.939" data-end="442.379">also nicely when you're preparing a talk</span> <span data-start="442.379" data-end="445.739">is that the amount of time to perform</span> <span data-start="445.739" data-end="447.959">these runs would grow it's actually not</span> <span data-start="447.959" data-end="449.549">the case so we have to talk to somebody</span> <span data-start="449.549" data-end="452.069">who knows the vm a lot better than me</span> <span data-start="452.069" data-end="454.589">why this is but you can imagine if</span> <span data-start="454.589" data-end="457.529">you're doing this calculation your hand</span> <span data-start="457.529" data-end="460.199">shift for example let's take 31 and 27</span> <span data-start="460.199" data-end="465.029">you have to first add 127 to form 8 and</span> <span data-start="465.029" data-end="469.86">then 3 to 2 245 so that's the answer and</span> <span data-start="469.86" data-end="471.659">if you do this for longer and longer</span> <span data-start="471.659" data-end="473.369">numbers you have to take longer and</span> <span data-start="473.369" data-end="476.939">longer time but it grows nicely and so</span> <span data-start="476.939" data-end="480.449">the P stands here for polynomial so who</span> <span data-start="480.449" data-end="483.929">knows what a polynomial is okay so</span> <span data-start="483.929" data-end="486.539">polynomial informally means efficient</span> <span data-start="486.539" data-end="489.149">it's not entirely the case but as the</span> <span data-start="489.149" data-end="491.399">input grows so if you have larger and</span> <span data-start="491.399" data-end="494.279">larger number let's say we have a two</span> <span data-start="494.279" data-end="497.609">two more two more digits then the then</span> <span data-start="497.609" data-end="499.649">the run time of the algorithm doesn't</span> <span data-start="499.649" data-end="502.319">grow very much actually so let's the</span> <span data-start="502.319" data-end="504.599">numbers grow twice as large the rent on</span> <span data-start="504.599" data-end="506.539">will grow twice as large for this case</span> <span data-start="506.539" data-end="509.129">so that's polynomial and generally this</span> <span data-start="509.129" data-end="510.959">means a computer can solve this</span> <span data-start="510.959" data-end="514.529">efficiently and it's obvious occasional</span> <span data-start="514.529" data-end="516.57">addition but there are other exam</span> <span data-start="516.57" data-end="520.44">balls so I just told you what P means so</span> <span data-start="520.44" data-end="525.34">does anybody want to guess what NP means</span> <span data-start="525.35" data-end="529.65">and so the obvious answer will be not</span> <span data-start="529.65" data-end="532.01">polynomial and that's not the case</span> <span data-start="532.01" data-end="536.1">unfortunately so we go to the next slide</span> <span data-start="536.1" data-end="538.86">what does NP me it means actually</span> <span data-start="538.86" data-end="541.49">non-data Mason deterministically</span> <span data-start="541.49" data-end="544.47">polynomial so at the end doesn't have a</span> <span data-start="544.47" data-end="547.17">relation to not p and i'm going to try</span> <span data-start="547.17" data-end="549.81">to explain what that means again we're</span> <span data-start="549.81" data-end="552.09">going to profile a function this time</span> <span data-start="552.09" data-end="555.14">there is a verification of factorization</span> <span data-start="555.14" data-end="559.47">so let's say somebody knows their</span> <span data-start="559.47" data-end="561.66">numbers very well and can call out the</span> <span data-start="561.66" data-end="565.23">factorization in prime factors of six so</span> <span data-start="565.23" data-end="566.85">does anybody know the factorization of</span> <span data-start="566.85" data-end="571.65">six yeah two times three to six so</span> <span data-start="571.65" data-end="573.66">you're going to be my Oracle which</span> <span data-start="573.66" data-end="576.57">whispers the answers in my ear because</span> <span data-start="576.57" data-end="579">when I'm verifying the result I don't</span> <span data-start="579" data-end="580.59">have to I don't have to do the hard work</span> <span data-start="580.59" data-end="583.83">i can do the easy work so it's somebody</span> <span data-start="583.83" data-end="585.93">asks what are the factors of 27 my</span> </p>
