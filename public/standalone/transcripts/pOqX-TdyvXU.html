this so this is a photo of the</span> <span data-start="168.12" data-end="169.95">entrance to one of the university</span> <span data-start="169.95" data-end="172.92">buildings on on the front side of the</span> <span data-start="172.92" data-end="174.69">photo you've got some steps and on the</span> <span data-start="174.69" data-end="176.43">other side you've got a ramp to enter</span> <span data-start="176.43" data-end="178.44">the building I was like okay cool they</span> <span data-start="178.44" data-end="179.79">saw about things so people would</span> <span data-start="179.79" data-end="180.959">wheelchairs can get in the building</span> <span data-start="180.959" data-end="185.84">great right so that's all good right</span> <span data-start="185.84" data-end="188.01">whilst I was setting there friend of</span> <span data-start="188.01" data-end="192.45">mine had a chronic illness then needed</span> <span data-start="192.45" data-end="195.959">to be able to use a wheelchair and so</span> <span data-start="195.959" data-end="199.199">they had gots user and were able to get</span> <span data-start="199.199" data-end="200.79">up like a powered wheelchair electrical</span> <span data-start="200.79" data-end="203.16">just to be able to never get round which</span> <span data-start="203.16" data-end="206.19">is cool they were able to do that and</span> <span data-start="206.19" data-end="209.489">some of the lectures that they're in and</span> <span data-start="209.489" data-end="212.37">buildings are in were able to have the</span> <span data-start="212.37" data-end="215.359">ramps and they were able to enter one</span> <span data-start="215.359" data-end="218.76">the first month after that I think they</span> <span data-start="218.76" data-end="223.53">were gonna go to the Students Union and</span> <span data-start="223.53" data-end="225.419">this is where if you don't know what</span> <span data-start="225.419" data-end="227.19">super teen is like I mean they also have</span> <span data-start="227.19" data-end="228.48">like coffee shops and things but they</span> <span data-start="228.48" data-end="231.48">also have like the offices of like the</span> <span data-start="231.48" data-end="233.819">welfare offices for students and people</span> <span data-start="233.819" data-end="235.53">who can give advice to students they</span> <span data-start="235.53" data-end="238.019">need help so like you know you need to</span> <span data-start="238.019" data-end="241.829">be accessing them and the building had</span> <span data-start="241.829" data-end="244.44">lift so this is the lift which is</span> <span data-start="244.44" data-end="247.65">awesome but it is probably you can't see</span> <span data-start="247.65" data-end="249.03">from the photo and maybe you can it's</span> <span data-start="249.03" data-end="251.04">really narrow you can probably walk in</span> <span data-start="251.04" data-end="252.87">there but and the wheelchair doesn't</span> <span data-start="252.87" data-end="255.69">can't can't enter they can enter so it's</span> <span data-start="255.69" data-end="257.88">like someone's thought about one aspect</span> <span data-start="257.88" data-end="260.37">but not reason about how they've gone to</span> <span data-start="260.37" data-end="261.989">the expense of building this whole lift</span> <span data-start="261.989" data-end="262.72">and like</span> <span data-start="262.72" data-end="265.23">organizing the whole building to make it</span> <span data-start="265.23" data-end="268.54">work for with a left not really thought</span> <span data-start="268.54" data-end="270.88">about like you know who I did all or</span> <span data-start="270.88" data-end="272.59">some things like that so it's not quite</span> <span data-start="272.59" data-end="277.66">as useful and in addition to that so</span> <span data-start="277.66" data-end="279.76">that's one building there were lectures</span> <span data-start="279.76" data-end="282.76">that were up on like the top floor and</span> <span data-start="282.76" data-end="286.42">like rickety staircases that had to be</span> <span data-start="286.42" data-end="288.16">like rearranged and things because they</span> <span data-start="288.16" data-end="290.74">hadn't considered that one of the</span> <span data-start="290.74" data-end="293.25">students might might need a special</span> <span data-start="293.25" data-end="296.53">access this and this was I thought it</span> <span data-start="296.53" data-end="298.06">was pretty frustrating I stood my friend</span> <span data-start="298.06" data-end="299.62">was my friend was pretty frustrated as a</span> <span data-start="299.62" data-end="301.69">little bit as well the fact that they</span> <span data-start="301.69" data-end="304.75">have to go to each individual lecturer</span> <span data-start="304.75" data-end="307.81">to ask them to read to change over sink</span> <span data-start="307.81" data-end="309.85">to rewrite or in the rooms and all of</span> <span data-start="309.85" data-end="314.169">that and this is like like seeing them</span> <span data-start="314.169" data-end="316.21">do that just make me realize just how</span> <span data-start="316.21" data-end="320.5">many how many barriers there are even</span> <span data-start="320.5" data-end="322.51">even from an institution that professes</span> <span data-start="322.51" data-end="324.85">to be open and accessible and in terms</span> <span data-start="324.85" data-end="328.12">of wanting to have such a range of and a</span> <span data-start="328.12" data-end="331.93">wide variety of students and dive and</span> <span data-start="331.93" data-end="334.99">talks about the diversity of its student</span> <span data-start="334.99" data-end="339.76">body so that was like my first like</span> <span data-start="339.76" data-end="342.43">major kind of thinking like there's</span> <span data-start="342.43" data-end="344.59">things need to be improved in the world</span> <span data-start="344.59" data-end="346.69">things things like even places people</span> <span data-start="346.69" data-end="350.41">that that care about will say that they</span> <span data-start="350.41" data-end="352.33">care about accessibility really need to</span> <span data-start="352.33" data-end="357.7">need to do a lot better now I'm going to</span> <span data-start="357.7" data-end="360.16">talk about something that might seem</span> <span data-start="360.16" data-end="364.24">completely unrelated family tech support</span> <span data-start="364.24" data-end="367.77">so hands up if you have ever had to be</span> <span data-start="367.77" data-end="370.36">her family text the tech support for any</span> <span data-start="370.36" data-end="373.39">family member come on

data-start="897.23" data-end="899.42">what I liked is the hearing the whole</span> <span data-start="899.42" data-end="905">range of understanding the well</span> <span data-start="905" data-end="906.5">obviously this isn't like an exhaustive</span> <span data-start="906.5" data-end="910.31">list but different groups of people with</span> <span data-start="910.31" data-end="913.37">various disabilities and understanding</span> <span data-start="913.37" data-end="915.38">the different needs was something that</span> <span data-start="915.38" data-end="916.11">we learn</span> <span data-start="916.11" data-end="919.68">initially so now I'm going to talk about</span> <span data-start="919.68" data-end="923.07">how that actually okay so that's like</span> <span data-start="923.07" data-end="924.66">maybe you some of the audience but I'm</span> <span data-start="924.66" data-end="926.19">going to talk about an actual case the B</span> <span

data-end="942.149">on the screen is an example of the of</span> <span data-start="942.149" data-end="948.72">the serif and what I liked was reading</span> <span data-start="948.72" data-end="950.88">what the aims so okay so the aims are</span> <span data-start="950.88" data-end="953.07">distinctiveness so basically what they</span> <span data-start="953.07" data-end="954.779">wanted to do the design teams wanted to</span> <span data-start="954.779" data-end="957.779">make it a pages look distinctively BBC</span> <span data-start="957.779" data-end="959.13">so you look at them and you read the</span> <span data-start="959.13" data-end="960.57">content and it's like it feels like</span> <span data-start="960.57" data-end="963.57">different to other sites okay that's</span> <span data-start="963.57" data-end="965.55">very designee it doesn't really make</span> <span data-start="965.55" data-end="967.41">sense to me but okay that's something</span> <span data-start="967.41" data-end="969.42">that kind of goes over my head but okay</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="969.42" data-end="971.25">I can understand the fat like this</span> <span data-start="971.25" data-end="973.35">there's also money saving argument</span> <span data-start="973.35" data-end="975.779">because Helvetica costs a lot to license</span> <span data-start="975.779" data-end="978.149">to pay for the license so they're like</span> <span data-start="978.149" data-end="979.769">you know if we do something in house</span> <span data-start="979.769" data-end="983.49">then it's we own the license through it</span> <span data-start="983.49" data-end="984.93">so we don't need to like pay tons of</span> <span data-start="984.93" data-end="987.42">money for it but one of the three cool</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="987.42" data-end="989.61">I'm cool aims which I quite liked was</span> <span data-start="989.61" data-end="992.13">that it was a legibility so to ensure</span> <span data-start="992.13" data-end="995.04">that this font font family is more</span> <span data-start="995.04" data-end="997.23">legible than the existing ones that we</span> <span data-start="997.23" data-end="1002.06">use okay so to make sure that happened</span> <span data-start="1002.06" data-end="1004.16">once they had a like an iteration of the</span> <span data-start="1004.16"

<span data-start="1060.26" data-end="1062.09">the previous fonts mate made it more</span> <span data-start="1062.09" data-end="1064.31">difficult and BB series made it much</span> <span data-start="1064.31" data-end="1068.9">much more easy so what does this mean is</span> <span data-start="1068.9" data-end="1072.95">that yes so even the design teams are</span> <span data-start="1072.95" data-end="1075.47">thinking about how to make this more</span> <span data-start="1075.47" data-end="1081.14">legible and how to consider people with</span> <span data-start="1081.14" data-end="1084.71">a range of needs what's even better</span> <span data-start="1084.71" data-end="1087.59">about this is that if it if it is more</span> <span data-start="1087.59" data-end="1090.02">legible to people with dyslexia say it</span> <span data-start="1090.02" data-end="1091.52">becomes more legible for pretty much</span> <span

data-end="1650.28">whole lot about the device like yes</span> <span data-start="1650.28" data-end="1652.65">if you don't just using what you have is</span> <span data-start="1652.65" data-end="1655.95">fine we have a device metrics that we</span> <span data-start="1655.95" data-end="1659.94">use so we actually look at what what</span> <span data-start="1659.94" data-end="1662.01">devices are most commonly used in the UK</span> <span data-start="1662.01" data-end="1663.9">what what assistive tech has miss</span> <span data-start="1663.9" data-end="1665.64">colonies in UK because that's why I call</span> <span data-start="1665.64" data-end="1669.27">me an audience there and and prioritize</span> <span data-start="1669.27" data-end="1670.71">them so we've got like a priority one</span> <span data-start="1670.71" data-end="1672.39">level and a priority to level and things</span> <span data-start="1672.39" data-end="1673.44">like that so you can go into a lot more</span> <span data-start="1673.44" data-end="1675.75">detail rather than if you've got that</span> <span data-start="1675.75" data-end="1678.49">the stats for there</span> <span data-start="1678.49" data-end="1680.56">and then if you've got a little bit more</span> <span data-start="1680.56" data-end="1683.53">budget you can do user research so this</span> <span data-start="1683.53" data-end="1687.81">photo is of a user research laboratory</span> <span data-start="1687.81" data-end="1691.12">so in London it's got a one-way mirror</span> <span data-start="1691.12" data-end="1693.79">which is the coolest thing it was like</span> <span data-start="1693.79" data-end="1695.35">so we're so we're sitting on one side of</span> <span data-start="1695.35" data-end="1698.17">the one-way mirror and the participants</span> <span data-start="1698.17" data-end="1699.49">of the user research are thinking and</span> <span data-start="1699.49" data-end="1702.13">the other where the somebody like asking</span> <span data-start="1702.13" data-end="1704.17">questions and things why not</span> <span data-start="1704.17" data-end="1705.7">ask more questions more like guiding</span> <span data-start="1705.7" data-end="1708.52">them and telling them what what let's</span> <span data-start="1708.52" data-end="1712.45">use that and the great thing is that as</span> <span data-start="1712.45" data-end="1716.91">a result that we get really positive</span> <span data-start="1716.91" data-end="1719.95">feedback for everybody so like Nora</span> <span data-start="1719.95" data-end="1721.33">senior designer so French now</span> <span data-start="1721.33" data-end="1723.16">understands the payment that assistive</span> <span data-start="1723.16" data-end="1725.92">tech users of assistive tech can go to</span> <span data-start="1725.92" data-end="1729.43">to access content so so that's great</span> <span data-start="1729.43" data-end="1731.38">because the thing is is that we want to</span> <span data-start="1731.38" data-end="1733.93">like not only is they use the research</span> <span data-start="1733.93" data-end="1735.61">good for us to find out what bugs we</span> <span data-start="1735.61" data-end="1737.38">have in our software but it's also</span> <span data-start="1737.38" data-end="1739.66">really really great so that we can get</span> <span data-start="1739.66" data-end="1743.74">more people within our organization to</span> <span data-start="1743.74" data-end="1745.48">really understand why it's an issue and</span> <span data-start="1745.48" data-end="1747.67">like get on board and feel more be more</span> <span data-start="1747.67" data-end="1752.23">be an active advocates for caring about</span> <span data-start="1752.23" data-end="1756.16">accessibility to takaka as a developer I</span> <span data-start="1756.16" data-end="1757.84">found it really eye-opening experience</span> <span data-start="1757.84" data-end="1763">and viewing the user research and wanted</span> <span data-start="1763" data-end="1765.54">to apply it to everyday practice and</span> <span data-start="1765.54" data-end="1768.52">finally Allison was the assistant editor</span> <span data-start="1768.52" data-end="1770.41">so on the stakeholder side of things so</span> <span data-start="1770.41" data-end="1772.27">he invited people from from about who</span> <span data-start="1772.27" data-end="1773.86">her on the stakeholders as well as like</span> <span data-start="1773.86" data-end="1776.83">in the product team and she thought it</span> <span data-start="1776.83" data-end="1778.15">was really interesting to see what</span> <span data-start="1778.15" data-end="1780.43">particular problems they face and this</span> <span data-start="1780.43" data-end="1784.6">is like invaluable because then next</span> <span data-start="1784.6" data-end="1785.8">time and we're talking about why</span> <span data-start="1785.8" data-end="1787.72">something we had to like redo a feature</span> <span data-start="1787.72" data-end="1789.19">and things because of accessibility they</span> <span data-start="1789.19" data-end="1792.25">understand why and they like acknowledge</span> <span data-start="1792.25" data-end="1793.9">the fact that that is like that is a</span> <span data-start="1793.9" data-end="1797.02">totally valid reason why like you know</span> <span data-start="1797.02" data-end="1799.57">the feature is delayed to get get we</span> <span data-start="1799.57" data-end="1801.19">delay launching and things and this is</span> <span data-start="1801.19" data-end="1803.98">like amazing to get everybody on all</span> <span data-start="1803.98" data-end="1807.97">sides of the organization involved and</span> <span data-start="1807.97" data-end="1809.59">understanding and positive about</span> <span data-start="1809.59" data-end="1813.429">accessibility yeah like over half of us</span> <span data-start="1813.429" data-end="1815.14">does like this the first time they're</span> <span data-start="1815.14" data-end="1818.32">using tech and pretty much everyone said</span> <span data-start="1818.32" data-end="1821.35">that their level of awareness had like</span> <span data-start="1821.35" data-end="1825.61">improved drastically so that was a bit</span> <span data-start="1825.61" data-end="1829.179">of a whirlwind tour talking about yeah</span> <span data-start="1829.179" data-end="1831.19">well I think accessibility is important</span> <span data-start="1831.19" data-end="1833.02">what we're kind of doing that BBC and</span> <span data-start="1833.02" data-end="1835.72">just brief overviews about what you can</span> <span data-start="1835.72" data-end="1838.63">do to get started for free I'll share</span> <span data-start="1838.63"
