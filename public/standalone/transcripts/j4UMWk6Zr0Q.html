to</span> <span data-start="796.77" data-end="798.72">discuss more about git objects because</span> <span data-start="798.72" data-end="802.12">all your data actually goes into it so</span> <span data-start="802.12" data-end="805.629">first thing it's the meat of your local</span> <span data-start="805.629" data-end="808.12">repository so that means it contains the</span> <span data-start="808.12" data-end="810.939">actual data of your get repository and</span> <span data-start="810.939" data-end="814.689">the second thing is how does get tract</span> <span data-start="814.689" data-end="817.569">or stole all your files and folders in</span> <span data-start="817.569" data-end="820.12">the form of objects and in the form of</span> <span data-start="820.12" data-end="821.74">those four different types of objects</span> <span data-start="821.74" data-end="825.16">blob tree commit and tag so I will be</span> <span data-start="825.16" data-end="827.17">talking about the first three object</span> <span data-start="827.17" data-end="831.49">four three object types and yes they are</span> <span data-start="831.49" data-end="834.73">stored by the char values as you have</span> <span data-start="834.73" data-end="836.129">seen before</span> <span data-start="836.129" data-end="838.99">okay let's take an example that we have</span> <span data-start="838.99" data-end="840.819">this particular repository and folder</span> <span data-start="840.819" data-end="842.949">structure in your local repository so we</span> <span data-start="842.949" data-end="846.1">have a root folder we have two text</span> <span data-start="846.1" data-end="848.499">files readme and make file and a slash</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="848.499" data-end="851.439">SRC folder and a dot C folder file</span> <span data-start="851.439" data-end="854.399">inside the SRC folder so let's see how</span> <span data-start="854.399" data-end="856.839">it actually stores them in the form of</span> <span data-start="856.839" data-end="861.269">objects so coming to the first basic</span> <span data-start="861.269" data-end="864.639">object type git stores your file</span> <span data-start="864.639" data-end="868.089">contents as blocks so it is important to</span> <span data-start="868.089" data-end="870.37">know that it just tows the contents of</span> <span data-start="870.37" data-end="873.519">your files but not the file name so the</span> <span data-start="873.519" data-end="875.889">names and modes of the files are not</span> <span data-start="875.889" data-end="878.05">stored within the block I am just trying</span> <span data-start="878.05" data-end="882.129">to repeat it again and get will only</span> <span data-start="882.129" data-end="885.37">store our blob only once so when I say</span> <span data-start="885.37" data-end="887.8">that what it means is if you have two</span> <span data-start="887.8" data-end="890.62">different file names but with same file</span> <span data-start="890.62" data-end="893.379">content block kit will be storing that</span> <span data-start="893.379" data-end="895.179">particular file as one single blob</span> <span data-start="895.179" data-end="897.329">because the file contents are saying and</span> <span data-start="897.329" data-end="900.61">what does what it also means is whenever</span> <span data-start="900.61" data-end="903.309">you try to transfer some of the blobs</span> <span data-start="903.309" data-end="905.529">from your repository to to the other</span> <span data-start="905.529" data-end="909.48">repository if it's the same blob but</span> <span data-start="909.48" data-end="911.86">coming from two different file names it</span> <span data-start="911.86" data-end="913.629">will just transfer that single blob and</span> <span data-start="913.629" data-end="915.85">then it will expand it into a different</span> <span data-start="915.85" data-end="923.37">different files and for our example</span> <span data-start="923.37" data-end="926.679">repository those files those files are</span> <span data-start="926.679" data-end="929.459">being stored as blob with different</span> <span data-start="929.459" data-end="934.269">shards now coming to the next type of</span> <span data-start="934.269" data-end="935.8">gate object</span> <span data-start="935.8" data-end="938.589">three it's all the problem of storing</span> <span data-start="938.589" data-end="940.99">the filename and it also allows you to</span> <span data-start="940.99" data-end="943.51">store the group of files together that</span> <span data-start="943.51" data-end="946.959">is the directory or folder and a tree is</span> <span data-start="946.959" data-end="948.88">nothing but a simple list of trees and</span> <span data-start="948.88" data-end="952.66">blobs combined together along with the</span> <span data-start="952.66" data-end="955.42">names and the file modes of those blobs</span> <span data-start="955.42" data-end="958.6">entries and when you actually go and</span> <span data-start="958.6" data-end="961.269">expand one of the tree object you get to</span> <span data-start="961.269" data-end="963.85">see something like this if you um it</span> <span data-start="963.85" data-end="967.029">actually contains entries of the blog</span> <span data-start="967.029" data-end="970.92">under that particular tree the file mode</span> <span data-start="970.92" data-end="972.04">charcoaled</span> <span data-start="972.04" data-end="977.44">and the file name and just try to you</span> <span data-start="977.44" data-end="979.269">know experiment with some of the tree</span> <span data-start="979.269" data-end="982.089">objects you will definitely get a get I</span> <span data-start="982.089" data-end="984.94">get an idea about it and for the same</span> <span data-start="984.94" data-end="987.579">example if you see every folder is</span> <span data-start="987.579" data-end="990.579">actually stored as a tree with whatever</span> <span data-start="990.579" data-end="995.26">file it have within it okay now coming</span> <span data-start="995.26" data-end="999.22">to the third object type commit um so we</span> <span data-start="999.22" data-end="1001.41">are storing the files and folders where</span> <span data-start="1001.41" data-end="1003.48">exactly does the history part comes in</span> <span data-start="1003.48" data-end="1006.18">this is where commit objects are coming</span> <span data-start="1006.18" data-end="1008.64">handy so the commit object is very</span> <span data-start="1008.64" data-end="1010.709">simple is much like a tree it simply</span> <span data-start="1010.709" data-end="1012.959">points to a tree and keeps a track of</span> <span data-start="1012.959" data-end="1016.17">the author the the commit message and</span> <span data-start="1016.17" data-end="1019.14">some time stamp around it along with</span> <span data-start="1019.14" data-end="1022.49">that any parent commit it's pointing to</span> <span data-start="1022.49" data-end="1025.62">so if you if you actually open a commit</span> <span data-start="1025.62" data-end="1031.02">object you will get to see the snapshot</span> <span data-start="1031.02" data-end="1034.74">of that particular commit suppose it's a</span> <span data-start="1034.74" data-end="1038.01">tree and the hash along with that and if</span> <span data-start="1038.01" data-end="1040.439">there is any parent commit it's pointing</span> <span

data-start="1046.29" data-end="1049.35">information and the commit message so</span> <span data-start="1049.35" data-end="1051.6">you will you will actually see all these</span> <span data-start="1051.6" data-end="1052.95">things when you try to open up these</span> <span data-start="1052.95" data-end="1057.3">objects and see alright done with the</span> <span data-start="1057.3" data-end="1061.5">boring stuff we have understood how file</span> <span data-start="1061.5" data-end="1064.26">stores are your data and some of the</span> <span data-start="1064.26" data-end="1066.69">important terms let's discuss with</span> <span data-start="1066.69" data-end="1068.91">discuss about some of the scenarios and</span> <span data-start="1068.91" data-end="1069.78">concepts with</span> <span data-start="1069.78" data-end="1072.45">with which we struggle every day first</span> <span data-start="1072.45" data-end="1076.11">thing is branching um as developers we</span> <span data-start="1076.11" data-end="1078.27">all know how important branching is um</span> <span data-start="1078.27" data-end="1080.28">in order to maintain a cleaner workflow</span> <span data-start="1080.28" data-end="1083.34">and if you're open-source maintainer for</span> <span data-start="1083.34" data-end="1085.289">any big project you definitely know the</span> <span data-start="1085.289" data-end="1089.28">pain of merging branches and sometimes</span> <span data-start="1089.28" data-end="1090.96">you know it's very important to know how</span> <span data-start="1090.96" data-end="1093.21">exactly get does this patching it will</span> <span data-start="1093.21" data-end="1094.799">definitely make your life little easier</span> <span data-start="1094.799" data-end="1098.07">so let's understand what how branching</span> <span data-start="1098.07" data-end="1101.85">is done in gating okay let's say we have</span> <span data-start="1101.85" data-end="1105.36">these three commits on your master</span> <span data-start="1105.36" data-end="1108.57">branch where my head is pointing to the</span> <span

data-start="1115.26" data-end="1118.37">simply run git log so that I can see</span> <span data-start="1118.37" data-end="1121.74">what is exactly happening in my work</span> <span data-start="1121.74" data-end="1124.98">working tree so what I do I don't get</span> <span data-start="1124.98" data-end="1127.44">log and I get to see the list of three</span> <span data-start="1127.44"

data-start="1168.24" data-end="1169.86">to my mind when I was preparing the</span> <span data-start="1169.86" data-end="1172.28">slides a sensible name so I just used it</span> <span data-start="1172.28" data-end="1174.929">so we can do so by running the command</span> <span data-start="1174.929" data-end="1177.299">as you can see git branch and the branch</span> <span data-start="1177.299" data-end="1181.53">name now if you want to see the list of</span> <span data-start="1181.53" data-end="1183.12">branches you have in your local</span> <span data-start="1183.12" data-end="1185.37">repository and also some important</span> <span data-start="1185.37" data-end="1187.669">details on what is your current branch</span> <span data-start="1187.669" data-end="1190.65">you can run git branch and then it will</span> <span data-start="1190.65" data-end="1192.87">clearly tell you that hey you're on</span> <span data-start="1192.87" data-end="1198.99">master branch I'm making it in green ok</span> <span data-start="1198.99" data-end="1203.91">now I have created a new branch</span> <span data-start="1203.91"

data-end="1212.35">because I haven't switched to the newly</span> <span data-start="1212.35" data-end="1216.13">created branch yet so let's so let's</span> <span data-start="1216.13" data-end="1219.04">just see what get log talks about this</span> <span data-start="1219.04" data-end="1222.16">workflow so when I run git git log it</span> <span data-start="1222.16"
