data-end="2076.49">this we made this assumption that okay</span> <span data-start="2076.49" data-end="2079.29">if the tweets are very close together</span> <span data-start="2079.29" data-end="2082.649">let's say 60 seconds or less it's highly</span> <span data-start="2082.649" data-end="2086.579">likely that horse Jas is following those</span> <span data-start="2086.579"

data-end="2099.81">all of the tweets that occur within 60</span> <span data-start="2099.81" data-end="2102.18">seconds of the original tweet so let's</span> <span data-start="2102.18" data-end="2104.089">do that</span> <span data-start="2104.089" data-end="2107.579">there they are okay you'll see that this</span> <span data-start="2107.579" data-end="2109.89">there's like this one over here again I</span> <span data-start="2109.89" data-end="2112.56">told you I'm terrible at charge a s I'd</span> <span data-start="2112.56" data-end="2114.119">like to apologize at the charge a

data-end="2121.98">okay so there's not a lot of them okay</span> <span data-start="2121.98" data-end="2124.29">now if we spread this out to like five</span> <span data-start="2124.29" data-end="2125.94">minutes to 10 minutes it starts to get</span> <span data-start="2125.94" data-end="2127.44">more interesting but then may that's a</span> <span data-start="2127.44" data-end="2129.69">lot of time on Twitter y'all five</span> <span data-start="2129.69" data-end="2132.06">minutes is a ton of time the other thing</span> <span data-start="2132.06" data-end="2135.51">is is that the analysis that we then did</span> <span data-start="2135.51" data-end="2138.78">from here is we said okay for each one</span> <span data-start="2138.78" data-end="2141.03">of these people let's get all of their</span> <span data-start="2141.03" data-end="2143.52">followers from the Twitter API okay and</span> <span data-start="2143.52" data-end="2146.49">then we can compare those followers and</span> <span data-start="2146.49" data-end="2149.79">see which followers do those accounts</span> <span data-start="2149.79" data-end="2152.31">have in common and that's how we're</span> <span data-start="2152.31" data-end="2157.29">going to get them</span> <span data-start="2157.3" data-end="2159.4">and that was an incredibly difficult</span> <span data-start="2159.4" data-end="2162.1">task here's why Brendan Eich was one of</span> <span data-start="2162.1" data-end="2163.66">those people and that dude's got like</span> <span data-start="2163.66" data-end="2168.55">200,000 followers West boss was one of</span> <span data-start="2168.55" data-end="2170.83">those people that guys got like 200,000</span> <span data-start="2170.83" data-end="2173.23">followers and what we really quickly</span> <span data-start="2173.23" data-end="2175.89">learned is first of all the Twitter API</span> <span data-start="2175.89" data-end="2178.69">just rate limited the crap out of us I</span> <span data-start="2178.69" data-end="2180.82">mean it was just all day long so that</span> <span data-start="2180.82" data-end="2183.1">was that was number one so basically</span> <span data-start="2183.1" data-end="2184.45">what you'd have to do is you would test</span> <span data-start="2184.45" data-end="2185.8">but then when she hit the rate limit</span> <span data-start="2185.8" data-end="2187.92">used to stop for 15 minutes and wait</span> <span data-start="2187.92" data-end="2191.47">some imagine that as a dev process right</span> <span data-start="2191.47" data-end="2193.09">sometimes I would just end our did we</span> <span data-start="2193.09" data-end="2194.62">just end our days like oh great limits</span> <span data-start="2194.62" data-end="2196.6">happen again let's just go he done so</span> <span data-start="2196.6" data-end="2199.27">yeah all right so what we did was we had</span> <span data-start="2199.27" data-end="2200.83">to set up these processes that would</span> <span data-start="2200.83" data-end="2205.27">recover by themselves so we did that and</span> <span data-start="2205.27" data-end="2211.76">here's what we found</span> <span data-start="2211.77" data-end="2214.12">all right so after all this what do we</span> <span data-start="2214.12" data-end="2215.56">know horse jeaious is probably in</span> <span data-start="2215.56" data-end="2217.42">central time or eastern time or the rest</span> <span data-start="2217.42" data-end="2222.88">of it was a vast waste of my time so</span> <span data-start="2222.88" data-end="2224.83">when it comes to frequency analysis I</span> <span data-start="2224.83" data-end="2226.99">don't have as good as a definition as</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2226.99" data-end="2228.91">Berk does he as Brooke did for time</span> <span data-start="2228.91" data-end="2230.71">series or for the time series analysis</span> <span data-start="2230.71" data-end="2232.48">so I'm not gonna give you an example or</span> <span data-start="2232.48" data-end="2234.45">I'm going to show you the example of</span> <span data-start="2234.45" data-end="2238.66">what frequency analysis is and when it</span> <span data-start="2238.66" data-end="2241.15">hasn't released our project or project</span> <span data-start="2241.15" data-end="2244.48">horse so one thing that we did is that</span> <span data-start="2244.48" data-end="2248.29">we ran an aggregation query to find out</span> <span data-start="2248.29" data-end="2250.84">the people that horse Jess had quoted</span> <span data-start="2250.84" data-end="2255.25">more than five times and this is pretty</span> <span data-start="2255.25" data-end="2256.99">much answering the question what is</span> <span data-start="2256.99" data-end="2258.79">horse you know who does horse just like</span> <span data-start="2258.79" data-end="2260.77">to tweet whose horse just like to quote</span> <span data-start="2260.77" data-end="2263.8">and so from this we got some really</span> <span data-start="2263.8" data-end="2266.23">interesting from some interesting data</span> <span data-start="2266.23" data-end="2268.36">and some interesting results so if you</span> <span data-start="2268.36" data-end="2271.87">notice who you're your left guess your</span> <span data-start="2271.87" data-end="2274.51">left your left here that there is</span> <span data-start="2274.51" data-end="2277.39">somebody who has been quoted a lot of</span> <span data-start="2277.39" data-end="2280.06">times and then there's also a cluster of</span> <span data-start="2280.06" data-end="2282.1">people after that have been quoted</span> <span data-start="2282.1" data-end="2284.83">pretty pretty often as well and then</span> <span data-start="2284.83" data-end="2285.56">notice that</span> <span data-start="2285.56" data-end="2288.53">as as you move over to the right there</span> <span data-start="2288.53" data-end="2290.96">starts to level off a little bit and</span> <span data-start="2290.96" data-end="2293.15">level off a bit so it seems that</span> <span data-start="2293.15" data-end="2296.9">horseshoes has a circle of people or</span> <span data-start="2296.9" data-end="2299.81">other friends or maybe he's just or</span> <span data-start="2299.81" data-end="2302.33">maybe they are just a superfan or maybe</span> <span data-start="2302.33" data-end="2305.15">they are just reordered maybe they have</span> <span data-start="2305.15" data-end="2306.53">that private list I don't know I'm still</span> <span data-start="2306.53" data-end="2307.97">convinced and it might they might have a</span> <span data-start="2307.97" data-end="2312.35">private list but anyway but so we so we</span> <span data-start="2312.35" data-end="2314.57">kind of focus in on those on that right</span> <span data-start="2314.57" data-end="2317.59">we're right on that high number of</span> <span data-start="2317.59" data-end="2321.23">quotes that occurrence of recurrences of</span> <span data-start="2321.23" data-end="2324.77">quotes per account and we when we take a</span> <span data-start="2324.77" data-end="2326.51">look we took a little bit closer look at</span> <span data-start="2326.51" data-end="2329.21">that and we we use the metadata from</span> <span data-start="2329.21" data-end="2331.97">from those from those tweets to gather</span> <span data-start="2331.97" data-end="2333.29">some more info you want talk a little</span> <span data-start="2333.29" data-end="2334.73">bit more about that book yeah absolutely</span> <span data-start="2334.73" data-end="2340.04">so it's important to note that here we</span> <span data-start="2340.04" data-end="2341.81">we kind of decided that horse J us</span> <span data-start="2341.81" data-end="2345.5">probably tweets themselves a lot again</span> <span data-start="2345.5" data-end="2346.88">because it would take a lot of restraint</span> <span data-start="2346.88" data-end="2348.59">not to do that and we just feel like</span> <span data-start="2348.59" data-end="2350.45">that's not who that is</span> <span data-start="2350.45" data-end="2353">that just that to us just does not</span> <span data-start="2353" data-end="2354.77">restraint does not sound like horse</span> <span data-start="2354.77" data-end="2357.41">neighs so what you're looking at here is</span> <span data-start="2357.41" data-end="2360.2">a Graham app here of all of the people</span> <span data-start="2360.2" data-end="2361.85">that live in either central or Eastern</span> <span data-start="2361.85" data-end="2365.48">time there's only six of all these</span> <span data-start="2365.48" data-end="2367.43">people and yes I know the names are</span> <span data-start="2367.43" data-end="2369.98">bordered at the bottom we're trying to</span> <span data-start="2369.98" data-end="2372.05">obscure some data here of all of these</span> <span data-start="2372.05" data-end="2376.04">people only six one of them is in Texas</span> <span data-start="2376.04" data-end="2379.84">and there are five in the New York area</span> <span data-start="2379.84" data-end="2384.05">all right so from this we can again make</span> <span data-start="2384.05" data-end="2387.8">a few assumptions about horse jeaious we</span> <span data-start="2387.8" data-end="2389.78">could make the assumption and we sort of</span> <span data-start="2389.78" data-end="2393.98">did that horse jeaious probably lives in</span> <span data-start="2393.98" data-end="2397.54">the New York area also of these other</span> <span data-start="2397.54" data-end="2399.77">four people that are in the New York</span> <span data-start="2399.77" data-end="2401.69">area with them almost all of those</span> <span data-start="2401.69" data-end="2403.7">people are on the left side of this</span> <span data-start="2403.7" data-end="2407.27">chart so it is highly likely that horse</span> <span data-start="2407.27" data-end="2409.97">a s is in New York or the New York area</span> <span data-start="2409.97" data-end="2411.5">they have a group of friends in that</span> <span data-start="2411.5" data-end="2413.9">area they are they are quoting those</span> <span data-start="2413.9" data-end="2415.97">people because their friends and it's</span> <span data-start="2415.97" data-end="2419.21">funny so we decided from this</span> <span data-start="2419.21" data-end="2421.31">that horse Jas lives in the Eastern time</span> <span data-start="2421.31" data-end="2423.32">zone which took us to the next part in</span> <span data-start="2423.32" data-end="2424.52">which we learned about some machine</span> <span data-start="2424.52" data-end="2426.92">learning yeah so this is the output of</span> <span data-start="2426.92" data-end="2430.55">the text analysis that we got and so so</span> <span data-start="2430.55" data-end="2432.29">like I showed you before we put all our</span> <span data-start="2432.29" data-end="2434.51">text analysis in a separate collection</span> <span data-start="2434.51" data-end="2437.599">ran an aggregate query I got really good</span> <span data-start="2437.599" data-end="2439.339">at arrogation if you if you ever need</span> <span data-start="2439.339" data-end="2442.609">everybody I had never used MongoDB</span> <span data-start="2442.609" data-end="2443.9">before so it was a learning experience</span> <span data-start="2443.9" data-end="2447.26">to start a consulting service for good</span> <span data-start="2447.26" data-end="2450.2">to be aggregation queries and what we</span> <span data-start="2450.2" data-end="2452.27">did is rent aggregation query on all the</span> <span data-start="2452.27" data-end="2454.19">keywords we want to kind of figure out</span> <span data-start="2454.19" data-end="2455.81">this is kind of answering the question</span> <span data-start="2455.81" data-end="2459.92">what does what makes horse GS tweet our</span> <span data-start="2459.92" data-end="2462.17">quote specific tweets what what are the</span> <span data-start="2462.17" data-end="2464.75">keywords that makes horse jeaious want</span> <span data-start="2464.75" data-end="2468.02">to want to quote a tweet and if you take</span> <span data-start="2468.02" data-end="2470.839">a look here so actually so on the left</span> <span data-start="2470.839" data-end="2472.4">here the first two there are kind of</span> <span data-start="2472.4" data-end="2474.14">kind of Givens there JavaScript and</span> <span data-start="2474.14" data-end="2474.65">jeaious</span> <span data-start="2474.65" data-end="2476.72">and I feel like that's kind of like even</span> <span data-start="2476.72" data-end="2478.369">those are even though even though those</span> <span data-start="2478.369" data-end="2479.599">are blurred I think that those are</span> <span data-start="2479.599" data-end="2480.98">probably a given you would you'd</span> <span data-start="2480.98" data-end="2482.54">probably assume that those it would be</span> <span data-start="2482.54" data-end="2485.45">first two and then there was some in</span> <span data-start="2485.45" data-end="2487.88">here that were actually kind of</span> <span data-start="2487.88" data-end="2490.76">surprising for example node was a rule</span> <span data-start="2490.76" data-end="2494.54">further to the right and and that was to</span> <span data-start="2494.54" data-end="2496.82">the and then also there was which is</span> <span data-start="2496.82" data-end="2498.14">actually kind of interesting because it</span> <span data-start="2498.14" data-end="2500.48">actually came I believe came before it</span> <span data-start="2500.48" data-end="2502.49">was there was more NPM than node</span> <span data-start="2502.49" data-end="2504.74">significantly more NPM yeah it was like</span> <span data-start="2504.74" data-end="2506.42">a little further further apart from each</span> <span data-start="2506.42" data-end="2507.83">other on the chart which is actually</span> <span data-start="2507.83" data-end="2509.33">really interesting because you would</span> <span data-start="2509.33" data-end="2510.98">think that they would kind of be like a</span> <span data-start="2510.98" data-end="2512.48">little bit more equal because they can</span> <span data-start="2512.48" data-end="2514.07">only think when I think of note I think</span> <span data-start="2514.07" data-end="2516.83">also of NPM so it was that was a little</span> <span data-start="2516.83" data-end="2520.52">interesting but yeah so the the the</span> <span data-start="2520.52" data-end="2521.81">interesting thing about that even though</span> <span data-start="2521.81" data-end="2524.51">that we didn't really gather too much</span> <span data-start="2524.51" data-end="2529.339">about our about a who horse yes is from</span> <span data-start="2529.339" data-end="2532.48">from this chart we did we did kind of</span> <span data-start="2532.48" data-end="2534.5">confirm some of our assumptions for</span> <span data-start="2534.5" data-end="2537.05">example we thought we assumed that</span> <span data-start="2537.05" data-end="2539.24">horses web developer and the keywords</span> <span data-start="2539.24"

data-end="2545.69">those stuff right and and once we figure</span> <span data-start="2545.69" data-end="2546.95">out who was that there was actually a</span> <span data-start="2546.95" data-end="2548.33">key piece of evidence in here that we're</span> <span data-start="2548.33" data-end="2549.859">not showing you that was actually like</span> <span data-start="2549.859" data-end="2552">yep of course it is</span> <span data-start="2552" data-end="2555.09">all right um so the last thing we</span> <span data-start="2555.09" data-end="2557.49">alright sources and this
