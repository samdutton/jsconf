<p><span data-start="316.72" data-end="319.96">I prepared what i did is i installed</span> <span data-start="319.96" data-end="324.13">Night Watch npm install Night Watch you</span> <span data-start="324.13" data-end="327.49">can get it and installed a selenium</span> <span data-start="327.49" data-end="334.05">helper that is called webdriver manager</span> <span data-start="334.05" data-end="338.71">and that can help me to set up a</span> <span data-start="338.71" data-end="349.69">selenium server locally here we go</span> <span data-start="349.69" data-end="352.48">selenium service up and running so what</span> <span data-start="352.48" data-end="362.15">we now can do is start the demo app I</span> <span data-start="362.16" data-end="367.09">think I killed the summer so yeah that</span> <span data-start="367.09" data-end="381.839">might take a little while and then</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="381.849" data-end="395.76">Night Watch is testing something</span> <span data-start="395.77" data-end="397.84">I'm not really sure but because the</span> <span data-start="397.84" data-end="400.9">screen is so small maybe we can we will</span> <span data-start="400.9" data-end="405.849">run into issues because of that but we</span> <span data-start="405.849" data-end="411.039">will see no actually okay my first chest</span> <span data-start="411.039" data-end="413.319">I prepared is passing so everything is</span> <span data-start="413.319" data-end="418">fine here's what I did we have a Night</span> <span data-start="418" data-end="422.259">Watch Jason oh that's a wrong project</span> <span data-start="422.259" data-end="427.87">one moment we take this one he's a Night</span> <span data-start="427.87" data-end="431.229">Watch Jason basically this is just cargo</span> <span data-start="431.229" data-end="435.63">coding from the Night Watch home page</span> <span data-start="435.63" data-end="438.639">interesting is that we connect to a</span> <span data-start="438.639" data-end="442.78">selenium here so we started a selenium</span> <span data-start="442.78" data-end="446.65">server and that's running on my local</span> <span data-start="446.65" data-end="455.8">machine here on port 44 44 and here</span> <span data-start="455.8" data-end="457.99">we're saying Night Watch to connect to</span> <span data-start="457.99" data-end="463.449">you this that could be also some cloud</span> <span data-start="463.449" data-end="465.669">service like sauce labs or browser stack</span> <span data-start="465.669" data-end="469.75">or something anything that can that</span> <span data-start="469.75" data-end="474.61">provides a selenium API and we are</span> <span data-start="474.61" data-end="476.62">saying hey we want to use a chrome and</span> <span data-start="476.62" data-end="478.96">the rest of this fire is pretty much</span> <span data-start="478.96" data-end="484.06">just cargo coding setup here's my first</span> <span data-start="484.06" data-end="486.159">test so basically what we're doing is</span> <span data-start="486.159" data-end="488.59">we're assigning the browser to weigh</span> <span data-start="488.59" data-end="492.699">more than you know can show us so every</span> <span data-start="492.699" data-end="501.219">600 to 800 800 600</span> <span data-start="501.229" data-end="504.389">then we want to test something so let's</span> <span data-start="504.389" data-end="513.209">test the production check what we first</span> <span data-start="513.209" data-end="516.149">need to do we tell the client to go on</span> <span data-start="516.149" data-end="519.089">this website so that's exactly the one</span> <span data-start="519.089" data-end="521.729">that I showed you here running on my</span> <span data-start="521.729" data-end="523.62">local machine could be anywhere I could</span> <span data-start="523.62" data-end="527.91">run this test against a production side</span> <span data-start="527.91" data-end="529.77">icon could run it against Google or</span> <span data-start="529.77" data-end="535.77">whatever and then I'm just asserting</span> <span data-start="535.77" data-end="540.209">that there is an element with this CSS</span> <span data-start="540.209" data-end="544.25">selector on the page it's a UI check</span> <span data-start="544.25" data-end="548.339">that's active and I want to ensure that</span> <span data-start="548.339" data-end="550.92">this is production so basically this</span> <span data-start="550.92" data-end="554.94">would be a chest to ensure that we see</span> <span data-start="554.94" data-end="560.25">this state when we land on this page it</span> <span data-start="560.25" data-end="564.87">could be that some person things that</span> <span data-start="564.87" data-end="566.579">would good would be good to it we have</span> <span data-start="566.579" data-end="569.339">the beta enabled by default and then</span> <span data-start="569.339" data-end="573.12">this check this chest would fail so if</span> <span data-start="573.12" data-end="576.5">we say we would like to have the beta</span> <span data-start="576.5" data-end="578.82">enabled by default and run the test</span> <span data-start="578.82" data-end="587.22">again I can watch it here yeah and now</span> <span data-start="587.22" data-end="591.99">it says hey the element was this</span> <span data-start="591.99" data-end="596.67">selector contains the text beta that was</span> <span data-start="596.67" data-end="600.149">our assertion but we got production so</span> <span data-start="600.149" data-end="609.87">something is wrong</span> <span data-start="609.88" data-end="612.95">it will but we actually want to have it</span> <span data-start="612.95" data-end="617.36">to be production and now let's change</span> <span data-start="617.36" data-end="621.23">that lets say hey what happens if we do</span> <span data-start="621.23" data-end="625.34">this we land on the page we click this</span> <span data-start="625.34" data-end="627.32">button and then we click this button now</span> <span data-start="627.32" data-end="630.05">we want to have one to ensure that the</span> <span data-start="630.05" data-end="636.41">beta button as a active it's simple as</span> <span data-start="636.41" data-end="649.1">that we say click here now we should</span> <span data-start="649.1" data-end="652.12">have a state where where there is no</span> <span data-start="652.12" data-end="657.38">active check and then we click on the</span> <span data-start="657.38" data-end="663.34">other</span> <span data-start="663.35" data-end="665.42">check when I'm searching for a selector</span> <span data-start="665.42" data-end="670.58">that we can actually click on you I take</span> <span data-start="670.58" data-end="686.269">better looks promising</span> <span data-start="686.279" data-end="694.11">and now we assert that this is Vita and</span> <span data-start="694.11" data-end="696.24">in case you wonder I have a palace here</span> <span data-start="696.24" data-end="699.3">just to have a chance to see the stage</span> <span data-start="699.3" data-end="703.499">before the browser quits if we would run</span> <span data-start="703.499" data-end="707.73">that in CI or some headless draw that is</span> <span data-start="707.73" data-end="710.61">pretty much useless so we can skip that</span> <span data-start="710.61" data-end="713.04">but right now it's kind of interesting</span> <span data-start="713.04" data-end="716.839">to see the state that we are after</span> <span data-start="716.839" data-end="721.41">having menu eadha manually clicked not</span> <span data-start="721.41" data-end="732.089">manually click I rerun this and that</span> <span data-start="732.089" data-end="736.579">word so these are our two assertions</span> <span data-start="736.579" data-end="738.959">then we have production better and</span> <span data-start="738.959" data-end="742.35">everything is fine I think you get the</span> <span data-start="742.35" data-end="746.49">idea you can basically go crazy with</span> <span data-start="746.49" data-end="754.769">this and we could yeah normally on the</span> <span data-start="754.769" data-end="756.3">left side here would be a navigation we</span> <span data-start="756.3" data-end="758.43">could check if the navigation works so</span> <span data-start="758.43" data-end="760.92">we see the exact pattern that we</span> <span data-start="760.92" data-end="764.519">navigated to we can check the context</span> <span data-start="764.519" data-end="767.25">switch that we have here but i think</span> <span data-start="767.25" data-end="771.809">that would be repetitive so let's dig a</span> <span data-start="771.809" data-end="774.75">little bit into a regression visual</span> <span data-start="774.75" data-end="778.649">regression stuff what we just recently</span> <span data-start="778.649" data-end="782.67">did is to use exactly this tool to do</span> <span data-start="782.67" data-end="785.309">then screenshots of this page so what we</span> <span data-start="785.309" data-end="793.679">can do is say hey please screen shot</span> <span data-start="793.679" data-end="801.149">here and i think i have to it's safe</span> <span data-start="801.149" data-end="810.259">screenshot and i have to say beta</span> <span data-start="810.269" data-end="813.16">something like that I don't actually</span> <span data-start="813.16" data-end="822.8">know if this works that's chick</span> <span data-start="822.81" data-end="829.48">you</span> <span data-start="829.49" data-end="835.02">doesn't look like it and so them oh here</span> <span data-start="835.02" data-end="846.68">it is nice we have a screenshot so and</span> <span data-start="846.68" data-end="849.9">we could now take this screenshot and</span> <span data-start="849.9" data-end="854.88">run some image analysis against it and</span> <span data-start="854.88" data-end="857.07">compared with another to ensure that we</span> <span data-start="857.07" data-end="860.16">made made few years ago and say hey we</span> <span data-start="860.16" data-end="863.07">want to have want to ensure that there's</span> <span data-start="863.07" data-end="867.86">no difference between this and that</span> <span data-start="867.86" data-end="871.71">there are tools that do all that out of</span> <span data-start="871.71" data-end="875.25">the box like phantom CSS and webdriver</span> <span data-start="875.25"

<span data-start="1221.53" data-end="1224.3">so he expected a second parameter on</span> <span data-start="1224.3" data-end="1245.28">that I think it's a timeout</span> <span data-start="1245.29" data-end="1247.93">okay yeah and that's not actually what</span> <span data-start="1247.93" data-end="1251.56">we wanted but it's traits the the issue</span> <span data-start="1251.56" data-end="1254.38">here because now we're getting an error</span> <span data-start="1254.38" data-end="1257.77">that we timed out while waiting for the</span> <span data-start="1257.77" data-end="1264.76">element loading to be present and we</span> <span data-start="1264.76" data-end="1268.24">expected it to become not visible but it</span> <span data-start="1268.24" data-end="1275.86">wasn't actually found so we need to</span> <span data-start="1275.86" data-end="1280.24">ensure that this element where the</span> <span data-start="1280.24" data-end="1284.13">selector loading is not present after we</span> <span data-start="1284.13" data-end="1287.02">go to this website and wait for five</span> <span data-start="1287.02" data-end="1297.76">seconds for at most five seconds okay</span> <span data-start="1297.76" data-end="1301.99">here we go element loading was not</span> <span data-start="1301.99"

data-end="1319.43">that's a bit tricky because yes you can</span> <span data-start="1319.43" data-end="1325.07">do that but maybe if you any made an</span> <span data-start="1325.07" data-end="1330.38">element in the view and you say hey wait</span> <span data-start="1330.38" data-end="1332.66">for this element to be to become visible</span> <span data-start="1332.66" data-end="1335.36">it will be visible when it just enters</span> <span data-start="1335.36" data-end="1340.52">the view a little bit so I know how</span> <span data-start="1340.52" data-end="1343.52">angular is solving that and I don't know</span> <span data-start="1343.52" data-end="1345.56">if I assume that other animation</span> <span data-start="1345.56" data-end="1347.57">frameworks have another approach so I</span> <span data-start="1347.57" data-end="1352.97">think if you have I guess jquery can do</span> <span data-start="1352.97" data-end="1356.54">that too that you just manually inject</span> <span data-start="1356.54" data-end="1359.6">the JavaScript into the page that sets</span> <span data-start="1359.6" data-end="1362.84">all animations 20 so it just happened</span> <span data-start="1362.84" data-end="1366.14">instantaneously that's the magic one of</span> <span data-start="1366.14" data-end="1368.21">the testing magic behind angular animate</span> <span data-start="1368.21" data-end="1370.01">and I think other animation framework</span> <span data-start="1370.01" data-end="1372.38">can support something simular so the</span> <span data-start="1372.38" data-end="1374.66">ideas that you just disable animations</span> <span data-start="1374.66" data-end="1377.75">for inch and tests and what I just did</span> <span data-start="1377.75" data-end="1381.56">in a case where I wasn't able to do that</span> <span data-start="1381.56" data-end="1384.95">is work with palaces but that's not</span> <span data-start="1384.95" data-end="1389.09">elegant so we checked what is the</span> <span data-start="1389.09" data-end="1390.89">longest animation that we can expect and</span> <span data-start="1390.89" data-end="1393.14">then when there was a state that we know</span> <span data-start="1393.14" data-end="1395.39">here an animation is happening here we</span> <span data-start="1395.39" data-end="1397.7">just waited for 500 milliseconds but I</span> <span data-start="1397.7" data-end="1400.16">see that this is not a good nada not an</span> <span data-start="1400.16" data-end="1402.05">elegant solution but it works for all in</span> <span data-start="1402.05" data-end="1413.039">our case so</span> <span data-start="1413.049" data-end="1417.019">no sorry the question was if I had</span> <span data-start="1417.019" data-end="1420.97">problems with scroll events not really</span> <span data-start="1420.97" data-end="1424.37">ran into problems why not try to scroll</span> <span data-start="1424.37" data-end="1429.129">in phantom ge'ez because that kind of</span> <span data-start="1429.129" data-end="1433.309">don't support scroll events but I</span> <span data-start="1433.309" data-end="1436.549">haven't dicked into that so we just</span> <span data-start="1436.549" data-end="1440.539">didn't use phantom j/s then I think it</span> <span data-start="1440.539" data-end="1444.909">would be possible somehow that we used</span> <span data-start="1444.909" data-end="1447.259">native products or Firefox and Chrome</span> <span data-start="1447.259" data-end="1450.259">for most parts and there the scrolling</span> <span
