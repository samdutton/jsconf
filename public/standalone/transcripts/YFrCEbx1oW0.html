<p><span data-start="0.12" data-end="1.12">JavaScript: Off the Grid</span> <span data-start="1.12" data-end="2.12">Sophia Shoemaker KATIE: Hello. Welcome back to the SitePen</span> <span data-start="2.12" data-end="3.12">track. We have Sophia Shoemaker. And you don't want to live in San Francisco with her because</span> <span data-start="3.12" data-end="4.12">her grandfather was born right before the 1906 earthquake and she was in the 1989 earthquake.</span> <span data-start="4.12" data-end="5.12">So, earthquakes follow her family around. If you live in San Francisco, you might want</span> <span data-start="5.12" data-end="6.12">to move. Or maybe get her to move. Anyways. I am super excited about Sophia's talk because</span> <span data-start="6.12" data-end="7.12">she's going to be telling us a story about the real world where some of like the hot</span> <span data-start="7.12" data-end="8.12">topics, progressive web apps, what everybody is talking about, where the rubber hits and</span> <span data-start="8.12" data-end="9.12">the road and these really cool technologies that we geek out about can actually bring</span> <span data-start="9.12" data-end="10.12">a positive impact to communities that we want to serve. So, I think this is gonna be a really</span> <span data-start="10.12" data-end="11.12">meaningful and awesome talk and I hope you're excited for it. So, let's give it up for Sophia.</span> <span data-start="11.12" data-end="12.12">[ Applause ] SOPHIA: Come on, computer. Okay. I think we're</span> <span data-start="12.12" data-end="15.98">good. There we go. Okay. Okay. Hi, everybody. I'm Sophia Shoemaker. I work as a freelance</span> <span data-start="15.98" data-end="17.62">developer of shoes. Just kidding. [ Laughter ]</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="17.62" data-end="21.81">I'm actually a web developer, a freelance web developer. But I really did make she's</span> <span data-start="21.81" data-end="27.16">shoes. They're little baby shoes that I made. One of the companies that I work for is called</span> <span data-start="27.16" data-end="33.679">Fullstack.IO. We write tons of tech books. We have a book about Angular, a couple books</span> <span data-start="33.679" data-end="42.269">about React. We have a Vue book. The latest book that we're hoping to publish in the next</span> <span data-start="42.269" data-end="48.219">couple of months is called JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures. If you would like a beta</span> <span data-start="48.219" data-end="55.1">version of the book, you can come find me after my talk. Yeah. Okay. So, before I get</span> <span data-start="55.1" data-end="61.079">started with like the technical side of my talk, I want to give a little bit of background.</span> <span data-start="61.079" data-end="67.66">So, for various political, social and economic reasons, there are large numbers of orphanages</span> <span data-start="67.66" data-end="76.62">in many regions of Africa. For example, in Uganda there were 2500 orphanages in 1992.</span> <span data-start="76.62" data-end="86.64">In 2013, there's 50,000. So, governments have begun to crack down on these orphanages because</span> <span data-start="86.64" data-end="91.98">in a lot of cases they're not actually helping these children. And in a lot of cases there's</span> <span data-start="91.98" data-end="102.06">abuse happening so they shut down and suspended or banned international adoptions. And for</span> <span data-start="102.06" data-end="107.63">the past couple of years I have been working on a project for a nonprofit organization</span> <span data-start="107.63" data-end="115.56">called Kaeme. They are working with orphanages and the government in Ghana to get these children</span> <span data-start="115.56" data-end="121.61">out of these orphanages and back with their families. In a lot of cases these children</span> <span data-start="121.61" data-end="128.009">often have family members alive. Sometimes their parents are still alive. So, they try</span> <span data-start="128.009" data-end="136.159">to get them back with people that can take care of them or get them adopted. And the</span> <span data-start="136.159" data-end="143.86">application that I built allows them to collect data and generate reports based on the data.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="143.86" data-end="148.73">So, I actually inherited this project from a group of grad students at Santa Clara University.</span> <span data-start="148.73" data-end="155.94">The first version of the application was built with PHP. Anybody do PHP out here?</span> <span data-start="155.94" data-end="161.11">[ Applause ] Which is great. PHP is great. But it needed</span> <span data-start="161.11" data-end="170.049">a little bit of reworking to get it in a better shape so I re architected it to use Laravel.</span> <span data-start="170.049" data-end="177.62">The Laravel framework. Which was fine. It totally worked great. But the team\h as the</span> <span data-start="177.62" data-end="182.519">team started to use it more and more, it was getting pretty frustrating for them because</span> <span data-start="182.519" data-end="187.599">their Internet connection in Ghana is limited. So, every page load required a round trip</span> <span data-start="187.599" data-end="193.73">to the server which when your Internet is slow is not a great experience. So, in addition</span> <span data-start="193.73" data-end="201.139">to speeding up the application, Kaeme also wanted the ability to use the application</span> <span data-start="201.139" data-end="204.62">offline so that when they went out to the orphanages where there was no Internet, they</span> <span data-start="204.62" data-end="210.68">wanted to be able to enter the data into the application directly rather than filling out</span> <span data-start="210.68" data-end="214.45">a paper form and taking the paper form back to the office where there was an Internet</span> <span data-start="214.45" data-end="220.09">connection and there's the chance of data not getting transferred properly or missing</span> <span data-start="220.09" data-end="231.04">data. So, in re architecting this a second time, I opted to leave the database structure</span> <span data-start="231.04" data-end="240.159">alone because the database structure was fine. So, it's\h I used a MySQL database and left</span> <span data-start="240.159" data-end="246.779">that alone and focused on the backend code and the frontend code. So, for the backend,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="246.779" data-end="256.359">I opted to use AWS Lambda. And I used Lambda for two reasons. One, I am not a DevOps expert.</span> <span data-start="256.359" data-end="262.9">And Lambda makes it really, really easy to write server side code without having to maintain</span> <span data-start="262.9" data-end="269.59">a server. And since I was the only person working on this application, not using my</span> <span data-start="269.59" data-end="276.569">headspace to maintain a server was really valuable. And then the other reason was switching</span> <span data-start="276.569" data-end="285.639">from an EC2 instance that was running PHP to AWS Lambda significantly reduced the costs</span> <span data-start="285.639" data-end="293.19">on AWS. So, right now Kaeme is essentially paying for the database because Lambda is</span> <span data-start="293.19" data-end="301.61">so cheap. And then finally, I used React for the frontend because I am a React fan girl.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="301.61" data-end="306.139">And I also needed a single page application. Like I mentioned earlier, making a round trip</span> <span data-start="306.139" data-end="312.24">to the server every time a page needed to get loaded was getting frustrating. And so,</span> <span data-start="312.24" data-end="319.83">making a single page application was a really great way to reduce the amount of data and</span> <span data-start="319.83" data-end="326.419">pages that were getting loaded or the amount of times that I needed to make\h get stuff</span> <span data-start="326.419" data-end="333.92">from the server. So, okay. So, what is a progressive web app? I'm sure a lot of you are familiar</span> <span data-start="333.92" data-end="339.24">with this term. But I just to want run through a couple of like features of a progressive</span> <span data-start="339.24" data-end="345.139">web app because this is relevant to what I built for Kaeme. And this isn't a comprehensive</span> <span data-start="345.139" data-end="351.43">list of features. But these are the ones that are relevant to the application. So, obviously</span> <span data-start="351.43" data-end="355.59">it's progressive. But what does that really mean? It means it works for every user, regardless</span> <span data-start="355.59" data-end="360.11">of browser choice. Whether somebody's on a mobile phone that has a really slow connection</span> <span data-start="360.11" data-end="370.5">or an awesome Macbook Pro. It works on all different types of devices. Oops. It's responsive.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="370.5" data-end="376.99">Which means it fits any form factor, desktop, mobile, tablet. It's connectivity independent.</span> <span data-start="376.99" data-end="383.52">Which means it is enhanced with service workers which I'll get to in a minute to work offline</span> <span data-start="383.52" data-end="391.4">around low quality networks. And then it's safe. It's HTTPS to ensure content is served</span> <span data-start="391.4" data-end="396.77">securely. So, one of the things you can do to improve your web application is to use</span> <span data-start="396.77" data-end="403.11">a tool called Lighthouse. It's from Google. And if you're not familiar with this tool,</span> <span data-start="403.11" data-end="409.19">it allows you to do an audit on your web application to see where you can improve in performance,</span> <span data-start="409.19" data-end="415.379">accessibility, progressive web apps, all those features that I just talked about. And it</span> <span data-start="415.379" data-end="422.78">can give you some great insight into where you can improve your application. So, I tried</span> <span data-start="422.78" data-end="428.37">to run Lighthouse on the PHP version of my application and the audit didn't even finish</span> <span data-start="428.37" data-end="433.639">running. It stalled out. I don't know if my PHP application was just really unprogressive</span> <span data-start="433.639" data-end="440.44">or I don't know what. Or maybe Lighthouse isn't meant to run on PHP apps. It just didn't</span> <span data-start="440.44" data-end="445.919">work. I don't know if you can see, but the text says, as page load time increases from</span> <span data-start="445.919" data-end="451.59">1 second to 7 seconds, the probability of a mobile site visitor bouncing increases 113%.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="451.59" data-end="458.979">So, yeah. it just was not great. But, so, I ran it again</span> <span data-start="458.979" data-end="464.449">on the new version and this is just a, you know, a screenshot of all the information</span> <span data-start="464.449" data-end="471.18">you can get from Lighthouse. It's a pretty extensive report. It's a great way to just</span> <span data-start="471.18" data-end="478.05">get a gut check of what\h how you can improve your application. Here's just another screenshot</span> <span data-start="478.05" data-end="482.139">of performance. Just some various things that you can do to improve your application. And</span> <span data-start="482.139" data-end="488.999">then here's another\h this section is specifically about progressive web app features that you</span> <span data-start="488.999" data-end="496.999">can improve on. Okay. So, service workers. So, in order to make any application accessible</span> <span data-start="496.999" data-end="502.879">offline, you have to make use of service workers. Service workers are JavaScript files that</span> <span data-start="502.879" data-end="510.25">allow you to cache other resources such as other JavaScript files, CSS, images. Then</span> <span data-start="510.25" data-end="517.49">they can then be available offline. Service workers only run over HTTPS and make use of</span> <span data-start="517.49" data-end="524.92">promises. So, let's take a look at how service worker works. So, there are three stages in</span> <span data-start="524.92" data-end="529.41">the life cycle of a service worker. The registration phase, the installation phase and the activation</span> <span data-start="529.41" data-end="536.24">phase. To register, a service worker will need to add code like this. The honor block</span> <span data-start="536.24" data-end="544.389">detects whether or not service workers are supported before trying to register it. Then</span> <span data-start="544.389" data-end="548.78">the register function registers a service worker which is just a JavaScript file in</span> <span data-start="548.78" data-end="554.69">our application. And then we have a then and a catch to handle what happens when the promise</span> <span data-start="554.69" data-end="562.98">is either resolved or rejected. So, this is what our service worker file actually looked</span> <span data-start="562.98" data-end="571.45">like. It handles the install event and caches the context. We add the install event and</span> <span data-start="571.45" data-end="578.7">call the wait until method on the event. This holds the service worker in the installing</span> <span data-start="578.7" data-end="585.95">phase until everything is ready\h is good to go. Inside the wait until\h sorry. Inside</span> <span data-start="585.95" data-end="591.73">the wait until the cache is dot open method is called and that creates a new cache called</span> <span data-start="591.73" data-end="598.99">v1 which will be v1 of the site's resources. And that can be any name that you want. It</span> <span data-start="598.99" data-end="606.08">doesn't have to be v1. So, if your service worker has been previously installed and there's</span> <span data-start="606.08" data-end="611.99">a new version of your worker available on refresh or page load. For example, you've</span> <span data-start="611.99" data-end="618.55">updated your application. You have a new JavaScript file or new CSS or it's been edited. The new</span> <span data-start="618.55" data-end="624.589">version is installed, but it's not activated. So, in this code you'll notice that it's the</span> <span data-start="624.589" data-end="630.42">same install code that I showed you in the previous slide. We've renamed the cache and</span> <span data-start="630.42" data-end="639.59">we have new assets to install. It's now called v2. So, the new version of your service worker</span> <span data-start="639.59" data-end="643.399">is only activated when there are no other pages loaded that are still using the old</span> <span data-start="643.399" data-end="649.25">service worker. And as soon as there's no more pages loaded, then the new service worker</span> <span data-start="649.25" data-end="654.57">gets activated. So, if you're a React fan like me, create React app does this all for</span> <span data-start="654.57" data-end="663.21">free so you don't have to write this stuff. So, when you create a new React application,</span> <span data-start="663.21" data-end="667.75">there's an option to add service workers and cache assets offline. And this is an example</span> <span data-start="667.75" data-end="676.94">of what your index.JS file looks like in React. So, if you switch the last line, service worker.unregister</span> <span data-start="676.94" data-end="685.589">to service worker.register, that will allow you to make use of service workers. Another</span> <span data-start="685.589" data-end="691.01">aspect of this project that was pretty critical, I don't know if this was obvious or not, but</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="691.01" data-end="696.54">I needed to know when the user was online or offline. The navigator online property</span> <span data-start="696.54" data-end="704.76">returns the status with true, meaning online, and false meaning offline. So, in the application</span> <span data-start="704.76" data-end="708.839">I start nod notice a lot of code that looked like this. A bunch of if elses all over the</span> <span data-start="708.839" data-end="714.209">place. And to make my code more maintainable, I created a function that took two callbacks</span> <span data-start="714.209" data-end="721.051">as parameters. An online callback and an offline callback. So, using this function, I could</span> <span data-start="721.051" data-end="729.33">customize what happens when a user is offline versus online. So, when the user is offline,</span> <span data-start="729.33" data-end="733.67">how do we store data that's getting created and updated? There's a few options for storing</span> <span data-start="733.67" data-end="740.99">data offline. But first I want to give a few guidelines on storing data offline. Number</span> <span data-start="740.99" data-end="746.2">one, like, the limit of\h you have a limit of 50% of the total hard drive storage. Like,</span> <span data-start="746.2" data-end="751.67">for example, if you have a 500 gigabyte hard drive, 250 gigabytes total allowed for the</span> <span data-start="751.67" data-end="759.449">browser. And then there's a limit of 10 megabytes to 2 gigabytes per group. A group is an origin</span> <span data-start="759.449" data-end="768.41">like Google.com. Okay. So, in researching the technologies I needed to use for this</span> <span data-start="768.41" data-end="773.82">project, I found that there was a few different options out there for storing data offline.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="773.82" data-end="779.4">There are a lot out there. But these are the ones that I became familiar with. Familiar</span> <span data-start="779.4" data-end="787.43">with for this project. One is PouchDB in connection with CouchDB. PouchDB is a library that syncs</span> <span data-start="787.43" data-end="799.48">with CouchDB, a NoSQL database. It makes going offline. If you have a user that's editing</span> <span data-start="799.48" data-end="806.21">data offline and a different use offline and there are merge conflicts, PouchDB allows</span> <span data-start="806.21" data-end="814.579">you to gracefully handle those issues. So, the con in using this for my project was that</span> <span data-start="814.579" data-end="820.389">I would have to migrate my MySQL database structure to a NoSQL format which is something</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="820.389" data-end="827.99">I'm not familiar with. And I have been burned in the past biting off more than I can chew</span> <span data-start="827.99" data-end="836.029">with refactors. I wanted to leave the database along so I opted not to use PouchDB with CouchDB.</span> <span data-start="836.029" data-end="842.269">And on top of it, the application\h the data was really meant to be relational database.</span> <span data-start="842.269" data-end="851.139">It didn't really fit the NoSQL format of things. Okay. So, another option is IndexedDB, a low</span> <span data-start="851.139" data-end="860.149">level way to store significant amounts of data including files and blobs. And this is</span> <span data-start="860.149" data-end="864.14">from the MDN docs. IndexedDB API is powerful but may seem too</span> <span data-start="864.14" data-end="870.589">complicated for simple case. If you'd prefer a simple API, try indications such as that</span> <span data-start="870.589" data-end="877.19">huge long list that make IndexedDB a little more programmer friendly. I read this and</span> <span data-start="877.19" data-end="885.529">said, hm, I'm not going down the path. I'm the only developer on this project. This looks</span> <span data-start="885.529" data-end="891.6">a little more complicated and I don't have seven, eight, nine, ten months to work on</span> <span data-start="891.6" data-end="898.149">this. So, I opted not to. But I think if I went back and re architected the application</span> <span data-start="898.149" data-end="903.839">I would go down this path of using the IndexedDB because it fit better with the data that I</span> <span data-start="903.839" data-end="911">was saving offline. But ultimately I ended up using localStorage. So, localStorage is</span> <span data-start="911" data-end="918.04">a property, and the stored data is saved across browser sessions. It's a key value store that</span> <span data-start="918.04" data-end="926.009">has a set, get and remove item methods on it. So, only strings can be stored in localStorage.</span> <span data-start="926.009" data-end="930.91">So, if you want to store anything other than a string, you have to turn your data into</span> <span data-start="930.91" data-end="937.269">a string. One caveat is that while storage limits for localStorage are larger than using</span> <span data-start="937.269" data-end="943.16">cookies, you can't store like gigabytes for the user unless the user allows for it for</span> <span data-start="943.16" data-end="950.41">the domain. So, typically localStorage is limited to 5 10 megabytes. Here is an example</span> <span data-start="950.41" data-end="963.079">of how I used localStorage in the Kaeme application. I was using JSON, user the JSON.stringify,</span> <span data-start="963.079" data-end="971.279">and then I would pull them out of local storage and turn them back into JSON objects. So,</span> <span data-start="971.279" data-end="977.06">in order to properly save a child's record online and offline, I used my online offline</span> <span data-start="977.06" data-end="984.98">function I showed you a couple slides back and saved it via API to the database or updated</span> <span data-start="984.98" data-end="990.68">the Q value in local storage. And then any time the child's record is saved offline,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="990.68" data-end="998.22">I set a flag in the local storage record indicating the record had an optimistic update. You can</span> <span data-start="998.22" data-end="1008.06">see right there. Okay. hopefully this demo goes okay. Let me go back. This is what the</span> <span data-start="1008.06" data-end="1014.17">Kaeme application looks like. Let me get some test data here. You can seeing right here</span> <span data-start="1014.17" data-end="1021.079">this first record here. Actually, let me go back a little bit. So, this black button right</span> <span data-start="1021.079" data-end="1028.6">here allows me to download a particular record and save it offline. It might take a little</span> <span data-start="1028.6" data-end="1039.35">bit of time. We'll see how long it takes. See if the Wi Fi works okay. Come on. Great.</span> <span data-start="1039.35" data-end="1046.57">Okay. So, now it's gray, that means that the\h that record\h particular record\h is saved</span> <span data-start="1046.57" data-end="1054.95">offline. Right now I'm online.\hso, if I go in and edit, I can just change\h hello, hello.</span> <span data-start="1054.95" data-end="1069.409">And then I'll save it. And then if I go back up here. And if I go up here and then turn</span> <span data-start="1069.409" data-end="1078.69">off Wi Fi. You can see now that the only records that are showing up are the ones that I've</span> <span data-start="1078.69" data-end="1093.12">downloaded to my application. And so, then I'll go in here and edit this one again. Earth\h</span> <span data-start="1093.12" data-end="1108.99">are not great. Okay. So, then if I go back. So, I have these two records here that are</span> <span data-start="1108.99" data-end="1113.94">highlighted red which means that there's been data that's been saved offline. So, then if</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1113.94" data-end="1133.98">I go back online. Get connected again. And then we go back. If guy in here, it says this</span> <span data-start="1133.98" data-end="1139.62">child has updates that were done offline. So, riff the option to upload the offline</span> <span data-start="1139.62" data-end="1144.91">data. Or I can opt to not upload that data if I wanted to. So, yeah. Let me just go back</span> <span data-start="1144.91" data-end="1158.429">to here. Okay. So, yeah. That's how it works. [ Applause ]</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1158.429" data-end="1167.22">Okay. So, in this process there were quite a few challenges and frustrations that came</span> <span data-start="1167.22" data-end="1174.37">with this project. Dealing with offline applications is not an easy task. At one point the team</span> <span data-start="1174.37" data-end="1180.4">in Ghana was having some issues with the application and I couldn't reproduce the issue on my end.</span> <span data-start="1180.4" data-end="1186.86">It always works on your own computer, right? So, we had a Skype call with them and they</span> <span data-start="1186.86" data-end="1193.36">were literally holding a laptop up with the, you know, the application running with the</span> <span data-start="1193.36" data-end="1197.77">computer that was offline. Because you can't do a screen share with the computer that's</span> <span data-start="1197.77" data-end="1202.779">offline. So, I had them opening like Chrome Dev tools and inspecting the elements and</span> <span data-start="1202.779" data-end="1208.51">clicking inside, you know, trying to figure out what the problem was. So, like the time</span> <span data-start="1208.51" data-end="1214.799">difference, the language barrier and the technical capabilities of the team made for some interesting</span> <span data-start="1214.799" data-end="1219.62">challenges and required a lot of patience on both ends. And we're still working out</span> <span data-start="1219.62" data-end="1225.429">some bugs. But in general it's a much better experience. So, this is the Kaeme team in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1225.429" data-end="1233.19">Ghana. So, in thinking about how to build this application, I knew that I could impose</span> <span data-start="1233.19" data-end="1239.84">a few constraints on how the offline interactions work. The Kaeme team in Ghana is very small.</span> <span data-start="1239.84" data-end="1244.309">There's just four people working on it to gather information about the children. So,</span> <span data-start="1244.309" data-end="1248.89">it was easier to manage how the users would be allowed to use the application. I knew</span> <span data-start="1248.89" data-end="1255.48">that there would not be a risk of a user potentially editing a child's record online and then somebody</span> <span data-start="1255.48" data-end="1260.99">else editing the record offline because they all work together. Obviously, if the team</span> <span data-start="1260.99" data-end="1266.95">scaled up in any way, I would have to rethink my approach. And there would be different</span> <span data-start="1266.95" data-end="1272.9">constraints. For example, as a number of users scaled up, maybe I would have a child worker</span> <span data-start="1272.9" data-end="1279.96">assigned to a particular user to ensure that the data would not get overwritten or maybe</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1279.96" data-end="1287.52">I would consider using PouchDB with CouchDB so that I could handle the conflicts there.</span> <span data-start="1287.52" data-end="1292.65">And then finally one last thing, I just wanted to share something that I have seen floating</span> <span data-start="1292.65" data-end="1299.82">around the Internet in a few places. It's this Japanese concept of\hikigai. If you happen</span> <span data-start="1299.82" data-end="1308.51">to speak Japanese, you can come up to me later and correct my pronunciation. Everyone according</span> <span data-start="1308.51" data-end="1315.49">to Japanese culture has one. And discovering it brings satisfaction and meaning to life.</span> <span data-start="1315.49" data-end="1323.09">When you combine these four things, what you love doing, what the world needs, what you</span> <span data-start="1323.09" data-end="1330.9">can get paid to do and what you are good at, you can find your sense of purpose, your Ikigai.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1330.9" data-end="1338.03">For me, this project has been an Ikigai experience. I loved stretching my engineering skills and</span> <span data-start="1338.03" data-end="1343.12">feeling like this project has provided more value to the world than some of the other</span> <span data-start="1343.12" data-end="1348.76">projects that I worked on. So, I hope you can all kind\h oh. There's the Ikigai. It's</span> <span data-start="1348.76" data-end="1356.86">in the center of the circle there. I hope you can use JavaScript in helpful and useful</span> <span data-start="1356.86" data-end="1362.06">ways that go beyond the typical ways that we think of creating web applications. I hope</span> <span data-start="1362.06" data-end="1364.275">you can all kind your Ikigai experience with JavaScript. And that's it. Thanks.</span> <span data-start="1364.275" data-end="1365.275">[ Applause ] KATIE: Hello, wow. That was so good. How many</span> <span data-start="1365.275" data-end="1366.275">of you feel like your current job is your Ikigai? Yeah. I can\h I can't see much. I</span> <span data-start="1366.275" data-end="1367.275">don't know how many people actually raised their hands. I'm sorry. That didn't work as</span> <span data-start="1367.275" data-end="1368.275">well as I'd hoped. Anyway. Oh, my goodness. It's gonna be a great day today, folks. I</span> <span data-start="1368.275" data-end="1369.275">hope you're ready. So, coming up next here in the SitePen track we have Lara Schenck</span> <span data-start="1369.275" data-end="1370.275">is going to talk about CSS algorithms which might seem like a contradiction in terms,</span> <span data-start="1370.275" data-end="1371.275">but actually is not. So, we'll all meet up back here at 11:15. And I hope to see you</span> </p>
