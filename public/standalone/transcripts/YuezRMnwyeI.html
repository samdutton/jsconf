<p><span data-start="20.75" data-end="29.36">Hello. So, um, I'm Etiene Dalcol I'm a software engineering student from Brazil, I'm currently studying</span> <span data-start="29.36" data-end="39.34">in France. And I also develop sailor, which is a LUA MVC framework. Some months</span> <span data-start="39.34" data-end="46.25">ago I was invited to present add MLH at a conference women's international leadership</span> <span data-start="46.25" data-end="53.95">at Bremen, besides presenting MLH and inviting people to hack ton, I was supposed to five</span> <span data-start="53.95" data-end="59.44">a two hour workshop on programming. There are a lot of things I would like to share</span> <span data-start="59.44" data-end="66.14">with you. Some of the topics I'll cover during the talk is why using JavaScript instead of</span> <span data-start="66.14" data-end="73.25">some other language, that is visible in such a short time, why inspiring people is important</span> <span data-start="73.25" data-end="80.509">and my personal growth from all of this. So let's begin with the choice of JavaScript,</span> <span data-start="80.509" data-end="87.74">well, a language was not imposed on me, I was just told to give an introduction workshop,</span> <span data-start="87.74" data-end="93.24">so I was free to chose what I wanted. The story tis not again with JavaScript, it begins</span> <span data-start="93.24" data-end="102.53">with Lua, one week before the conference, I participate in the a Hacathon where I built</span> <span data-start="102.53" data-end="110.96">a card game using Lua and a game development framework called love 2 D, I was really improved</span> <span data-start="110.96" data-end="117.049">how fast and fun it was. You can see the look on my face, seem to be having a lot of fun.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="117.049" data-end="123.509">And I never did lots of game development, but it actually remained me of my first programming</span> <span data-start="123.509" data-end="130.59">experience. There was this on‑line became called Rag or rock on‑line, we could run</span> <span data-start="130.59" data-end="137.68">local servers, we could modify the game, I remember exactly the first day where I got</span> <span data-start="137.68" data-end="143.26">my own character working and I could click on it and it would do exactly what I thought</span> <span data-start="143.26" data-end="150.17">it should do. And it was magical, it was powerful? AAnd I thought if I could relate to that,</span> <span data-start="150.17" data-end="157.2">maybe some other people would. So I said, okay, I'll go with them through this game,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="157.2" data-end="163.34">I had just made in Lua, but then there was some problems, well, not really problems but</span> <span data-start="163.34" data-end="169.849">things that could get improved. I started considering some other options. So, I had</span> <span data-start="169.849" data-end="176.59">two hours and I really just wanted to cover some basics, variables, array, etc., and we</span> <span data-start="176.59" data-end="182.22">need to be really careful when picking a language to teach a beginner, sometimes it's as if</span> <span data-start="182.22" data-end="188.709">we forget the basic structure of a language. For example, I could go for a language just</span> <span data-start="188.709" data-end="195.41">because it has lots of libraries, lots of tools, loathes of tutorials, specific for</span> <span data-start="195.41" data-end="204.959">beginners, for example Python, but I remember my first Python, and I remember taking over</span> <span data-start="204.959" data-end="211.36">30 minutes to find out what was wrong with my code when it looked exactly like the tutorial</span> <span data-start="211.36" data-end="216.989">I was following. I it looked equal but it just didn't work. It was because, somewhere,</span> <span data-start="216.989" data-end="222.48">somewhere in the code there were four spaces where there was supposed to be a tab, and</span> <span data-start="222.48" data-end="229.099">I started having home sigh deal thoughts. So I said, um .. yeah, maybe, let's consider</span> <span data-start="229.099" data-end="237.34">some other options. So what about JavaScript? I said, um .. maybe it's complex, right you</span> <span data-start="237.34" data-end="242.94">can do incredible stuff with script, I thought we don't need the whole thing, we just need</span> <span data-start="242.94" data-end="248.519">a subset of the language, and the subset is not scary at all to beginners, I said, okay,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="248.519" data-end="255.239">JavaScript seems like a good choice. And another point was I wouldn't be giving the workshop</span> <span data-start="255.239" data-end="260.909">alone, well 150 is a lot of people, so the conference organizer, wound herbful team of</span> <span data-start="260.909" data-end="264.87">volunteers, they walk around\h‑‑ a wonderful team of volunteers, they walk around and assist</span> <span data-start="264.87" data-end="273.03">and everything. They said it would be better if we use a language that we all have in common.</span> <span data-start="273.03" data-end="282.87">Lua is great, but somewhat obscure, JavaScript was the language we all knew. And there's</span> <span data-start="282.87" data-end="291.31">also the question about the tools needed. So, setting up a development environment quickest</span> <span data-start="291.31" data-end="297.31">and nicest and most pleasant activities we take before we starting to programming something.</span> <span data-start="297.31" data-end="302.62">And while Lua and the love 2D framework is really super easy to get going, I'm saying</span> <span data-start="302.62" data-end="307.25">that from my perspective as a software engineering student, I'm dealing with an audience that</span> <span data-start="307.25" data-end="317.5">consists of non‑tech participants. So the thing to cowas to reduce the time to zero.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="317.5" data-end="321.68">Everyone already has what it takes to code JavaScript on their compute computer, everybody</span> <span data-start="321.68" data-end="331.03">has a browser. Not even just a browser, someone on the team suggest wed use Mozilla Thimble,</span> <span data-start="331.03" data-end="341.9">we can see the code, use side by side (Mozilla) it's really easy to use. So, to sum up, about</span> <span data-start="341.9" data-end="348.21">JavaScript has zero effort, it doesn't need additional libraries or frameworks to make</span> <span data-start="348.21" data-end="354.139">graphics, which makes everything very easy to remember in case they want to try it out</span> <span data-start="354.139" data-end="361.389">later. And it's also pretty useful in a beginners context. mean, I'm sure the first program</span> <span data-start="361.389" data-end="368.889">will not be a TCP/IP protocol. And I know they tonight want to know what Monads are.</span> <span data-start="368.889" data-end="376.96">So, JavaScript enables people to write games and web sites, which is exactly the same kind</span> <span data-start="376.96" data-end="383.569">of software they have direct contact with on a daily basis. So, okay, the plan said</span> <span data-start="383.569" data-end="391.699">I was going to port my game from Lua to JavaScript and starting to plan the workshop. So let's</span> <span data-start="391.699" data-end="399.74">talk about the feasibility in two hours. This is a part, very detailed oriented, every tiny</span> <span data-start="399.74" data-end="406.169">thing we can do to save time counts, so I have some tips and tricks to share with you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="406.169" data-end="413.34">So, first, I recommend having everything ready. Even if you're teaching something very simple,</span> <span data-start="413.34" data-end="418.99">I wouldn't suggest impro vising. Not because you could make a mistake and make a fool of</span> <span data-start="418.99" data-end="423.3">yourself in front of everyone, if we're giving a workshop, chances are you know more than</span> <span data-start="423.3" data-end="428.41">the audience, so you really tonight have to worry about that but the thing is, if you</span> <span data-start="428.41" data-end="432.889">make a mistake you lose time, and if you has time, you take away from the audience the</span> <span data-start="432.889" data-end="438.96">opportunity to learn something else that could have been learning during that time. So having</span> <span data-start="438.96" data-end="447.08">that in mind, Skeleton code is very useful. Whale it would be much more\h‑‑ while</span> <span data-start="447.08" data-end="454.759">you could teach much more by developing everything from scratch, it is simply not feasible. So</span> <span data-start="454.759" data-end="460.569">what I did exactly was that I prepared the whole game, then I removed some parts so I</span> <span data-start="460.569" data-end="466.639">could have them fill and modify. For example, when I first explained what a variable is,</span> <span data-start="466.639" data-end="472.349">I would say, oh, hey hear's a variable called scale, it's being used to multiply the width</span> <span data-start="472.349" data-end="478.47">and height of all um imagines in a game. If you nodfy it, you can see the whole game shrink</span> <span data-start="478.47" data-end="484.28">or enlarge, when I first talk about functions I could say, hey, let's make the function</span> <span data-start="484.28" data-end="489.12">that makes the duck move and so on. So every tiny bit of the game was something I wanted</span> <span data-start="489.12" data-end="497.199">to teach. Now this is something that looks really simple, but it's really useful compared</span> <span data-start="497.199" data-end="505.86">to the foreign text to get going. Having a short easy pronounceable URL can save a whole</span> <span data-start="505.86" data-end="512.26">five ten mens of the participants being clueless and asking each other what's going on, I really</span> <span data-start="512.26" data-end="524.64">suggest that if you have anything to download or any materials to share. Also, give them</span> <span data-start="524.64" data-end="529.76">time to write their code, but be prepared to say times up, give out the answer and move</span> <span data-start="529.76" data-end="536.04">on to the next topic. Because it's normal if the participants get stuck in some aspect,</span> <span data-start="536.04" data-end="542.05">but you don't have to stop the workshop there and wait until everyone's done, because some</span> <span data-start="542.05" data-end="546.1">students they might not come up with a good answer by themselves, but they will understand</span> <span data-start="546.1" data-end="552.3">once you explain it. also suggest not moving to the next topic without first giving the</span> <span data-start="552.3" data-end="557.56">answer to the last one, because you might lose someone there, participants may get stuck</span> <span data-start="557.56" data-end="562.16">and trying to solve that little thing until the end of the workshop and get out of there</span> <span data-start="562.16" data-end="569.83">really frustrated. And believe me, you don't want people to get out of your workshop frustrated.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="569.83" data-end="575.399">It can also happen that you don't have time to show them everything you planned. So, I</span> <span data-start="575.399" data-end="580.339">really recommend leaving the extra things for the end, so in my case, for example, I</span> <span data-start="580.339" data-end="587.13">was planning to teach them operators by making the wings of the duck flap, and some flux</span> <span data-start="587.13" data-end="594.81">control by hitting the duck and killing it. So, we need to think what is more important</span> <span data-start="594.81" data-end="601.5">in terms of programming and what makes more sense in the whole context. So in the case</span> <span data-start="601.5" data-end="605.209">of my workshop I wanted the participants to have a complete and playable became by the</span> <span data-start="605.209" data-end="613.209">end so that the\h‑‑ should die. I moved the flapping to the end, because in the end</span> <span data-start="613.209" data-end="619.35">we rain out of time and it did have to be cut off, so it was a good idea. And last thing,</span> <span data-start="619.35" data-end="625.459">before I move on to the next topic is typography. I'm giving special attention to this pause</span> <span data-start="625.459" data-end="640.01">this is something  I messed up. I was reaching between the\h‑‑
switching between the slide and the code and</span> <span data-start="640.01" data-end="646.42">when I was explaining something using the slides, like I said, I was presenting HML,</span> <span data-start="646.42" data-end="652.37">and they have a branded style for using the style in the company, so I didn't give much</span> <span data-start="652.37" data-end="660.67">thought to it. So, this is for example, it worked just fine. But when I said, hey, let's</span> <span data-start="660.67" data-end="666.04">make the function that makes the duck move, then it didn't work at all. Can you guess</span> <span data-start="666.04" data-end="678.459">why? It was horrible for them to know what exactly what paren that sis or brackets or</span> <span data-start="678.459" data-end="686.62">could recallly on my crappy slide and it confused the hell out of them when I switched the code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="686.62" data-end="691.399">And the funny thing is that I did show the slides to friends two are programmers, to</span> <span data-start="691.399" data-end="698.82">people on the team, to people from MLH, and nobody has a flag there, because this is obvious</span> <span data-start="698.82" data-end="706.12">to us, we already know those are parenthesis When it's not obvious to us, then it's really</span> <span data-start="706.12" data-end="711.98">irritating (parenthesis) and I got particularly mad at myself because I'm often complaining</span> <span data-start="711.98" data-end="719.209">when professors do this, and then I went and did the very same thing, so, yeah .. I'll</span> <span data-start="719.209" data-end="724.56">definitely take this as a lesson for the next time, typography is really important. Okay,</span> <span data-start="724.56" data-end="732.29">so, we got to the end, we're able to do the whole game during the workshop with moving</span> <span data-start="732.29" data-end="739.459">ducks that could be shot and killed. And to me this is hugh. This is a hugh progress for</span> <span data-start="739.459" data-end="746.32">two hours, and we should be making this more often. But given that teaching a practical</span> <span data-start="746.32" data-end="755.91">skill alone is not enough. Inspiring is important. So I wanted to give them reasons to feel encouraged</span> <span data-start="755.91" data-end="761.32">so they could enjoy the technicality a bit more and also get curious once the workshop</span> <span data-start="761.32" data-end="769.73">is over, so they can experiment with it later, maybe start programming more. But how? How</span> <span data-start="769.73" data-end="778.26">do they go from one stage to the other? Well, one way is to show them examples of things</span> <span data-start="778.26" data-end="784.68">they can build with technology. You can also show them people having fun with things they</span> <span data-start="784.68" data-end="792.639">can build. Well, a particular aspect of my workshop was that directed at young women</span> <span data-start="792.639" data-end="798.779">and I really wanted to show them that computer science and programming is indeed a place</span> <span data-start="798.779" data-end="805.66">where women can be, which is something I am constantly not convinced myself, so, we all</span> <span data-start="805.66" data-end="810.42">in this universe can with be a little challenging to women. Please forgive my crappy drawing</span> <span data-start="810.42" data-end="819.11">abilities. That one is me, I'm really happy to see such a diverse conference here, more</span> <span data-start="819.11" data-end="826.8">often than not, I am the only woman in the room when I'm dealing with technology. And</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="826.8" data-end="832.57">I really wanted to show them that this is not the case, that this does not represent</span> <span data-start="832.57" data-end="840.55">the reality as a whole. So, I really wanted to show them role models, because it can be</span> <span data-start="840.55" data-end="848.089">really de‑motivating when we see only images of successful males in our field. Because</span> <span data-start="848.089" data-end="854.31">if we don't see people like us doing these things, we believe we can do these things</span> <span data-start="854.31" data-end="860.92">as well\h‑‑ we we believe we can't do these things as well. As I was searching pictures</span> <span data-start="860.92" data-end="867.86">and stories to show them, I\h‑‑ that was the first time I felt it was really important,</span> <span data-start="867.86" data-end="873.63">we had been discussing this often in our community, and I'm really happy about it, but this is</span> <span data-start="873.63" data-end="882.51">when I felt it for real because when I was looking for the source the show ‑‑ itches</span> <span data-start="882.51" data-end="894.19">really excited to show these womens to other women, I am teaching programming and I'm not</span> <span data-start="894.19" data-end="902.05">going anywhere. This was a moment that I absolutely needed to go through this list of amazing</span> <span data-start="902.05" data-end="922.8">women. And I'm not sure  and I'm not sure when I'll ever stop needing
that. So and I hope that this was as important</span> <span data-start="922.8" data-end="930.699">to the audience as it was for me. I hope some of them were positively surprised to hear</span> <span data-start="930.699" data-end="936.459">some of those names for the first time, just like I was when I first heard over them as</span> <span data-start="936.459" data-end="945.209">well. When I saw the room filled with women programming, so excited about the ducks moving</span> <span data-start="945.209" data-end="952.6">for the first time, I did learn something else. I mean lack at her, she's actually enjoying</span> <span data-start="952.6" data-end="961.889">it. And, I can't really express in words how it was by the end of the workshop. There was</span> <span data-start="961.889" data-end="971.18">this woman that came to me and said, computers hate me. Everything I touch crashes. I'm just</span> <span data-start="971.18" data-end="977.98">horrible with computers. But she managed to get everything working and she was so happy,</span> <span data-start="977.98" data-end="985.019">and she was asking me for materials. So I just gave her like code academy, and it was</span> <span data-start="985.019" data-end="995.43">amazing, other people were asking how to modify the game into doing this or that. And it got</span> <span data-start="995.43" data-end="1003.54">me like this ear to ear smile that I just can't get off my face. And I learned that</span> <span data-start="1003.54" data-end="1011.779">teaching is so rewarding, this is the moment I said, I must do this for life. This is amazing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1011.779" data-end="1021.889">So if you forget like everything I've been saying in this talk, please remember this:</span> <span data-start="1021.889" data-end="1030.669">Teach people. If you have any time to spare, reserve some time to teach people. Especially</span> <span data-start="1030.669" data-end="1036.24">if it relates to something you care about. Because it gathers this feeling we can do</span> <span data-start="1036.24" data-end="1045.589">this, we can totally do this. In two hours we can do amazing things. And while people</span> <span data-start="1045.589" data-end="1056.48">are coming to thank me for the workshop I was thanking them. So,\h‑‑ I was thanking</span> <span data-start="1056.48" data-end="1065.6">them, it was such an amazing feeling that I want everyone else to feel the same thing.</span> <span data-start="1065.6" data-end="1074.33">I'm very happy to share all the materials of my talk, of my workshop. If you go on my</span> <span data-start="1074.33" data-end="1080.36">GitHub Repository you'll find everything. You'll find the full code, you'll find the</span> <span data-start="1080.36" data-end="1087.37">Skeleton code, you'll find the slides. I have made a different version of the slides with</span> <span data-start="1087.37" data-end="1095.01">different typography. And so you can download everything. I also have the old version for</span> <span data-start="1095.01" data-end="1104.049">people that work with MLH by any chance. So, I'm finishing this really early. And I'm really</span> <span data-start="1104.049" data-end="1110.73">bad. This is the end of my talk, if you have any questions, I'll be around, you can also</span> </p>
