data-end="279.49">angles in it</span> <span data-start="279.49" data-end="283.88">okay so the rhombus has all four sides</span> <span data-start="283.88" data-end="286.13">equal so you think that you get a</span> <span data-start="286.13" data-end="290.12">rhombus by skewing a square let's see</span> <span data-start="290.12" data-end="292.58">that this is the square so let's see</span> <span data-start="292.58" data-end="296.72">what happens if we skew it well it's not</span> <span data-start="296.72" data-end="300.62">rhombus and you can see it better if I</span> <span

data-end="314.06">well let's see first how the skew</span> <span data-start="314.06" data-end="318.47">transform works so we have one we start</span> <span data-start="318.47" data-end="321.62">with a square and we apply a skew</span> <span data-start="321.62" data-end="325.25">transform on it so you can see that the</span> <span data-start="325.25" data-end="327.74">skew transform as any other transform</span> <span data-start="327.74" data-end="330.65">also transforms some the system of</span> <span data-start="330.65" data-end="334.82">coordinates of the element it's not the</span> <span data-start="334.82" data-end="338.3">same as it was before and all for every</span> <span data-start="338.3" data-end="344.03">point of the initial square applying the</span> <span data-start="344.03" data-end="348.31">skew X preserves the y coordinate and</span> <span data-start="348.31" data-end="351.05">changes the x coordinate just the x</span> <span data-start="351.05" data-end="355.25">coordinate and you can see from for</span> <span data-start="355.25" data-end="359.06">every point XY the new coordinate after</span> <span data-start="359.06" data-end="363.34">skew is going to be X plus a and Y and</span> <span data-start="363.34" data-end="367.66">frisky Y is going to be x and y plus a</span> <span data-start="367.66" data-end="375.83">all right but what is a well to</span> <span data-start="375.83" data-end="378.38">understand that we need to go a bit into</span> <span data-start="378.38" data-end="382.94">trigonometry so does anybody remember</span> <span data-start="382.94" data-end="387.44">the stuff well what a sine and a cosine</span> <span data-start="387.44" data-end="391.37">and tangent are so the sine is the ratio</span> <span data-start="391.37" data-end="395">between the side opposing the angle and</span> <span data-start="395" data-end="399.98">the hypotenuse the biggest side the one</span> <span data-start="399.98" data-end="403.64">opposing the 90-degree angle and the</span> <span data-start="403.64" data-end="406.94">cosine is the ratio between the adjacent</span> <span data-start="406.94" data-end="407.39">side</span> <span data-start="407.39" data-end="411.22">the one near it and the hypotenuse and</span> <span data-start="411.22" data-end="414.29">tangent is the ratio between the</span> <span data-start="414.29" data-end="417.53">opposite side and the adjacent side and</span> <span data-start="417.53" data-end="425.6">now let's go back to this one so in this</span> <span data-start="425.6" data-end="430.01">case we consider this triangle and this</span> <span data-start="430.01" data-end="436.19">point has coordinates initially let's go</span> <span data-start="436.19" data-end="438.98">back this point it has initially</span> <span data-start="438.98" data-end="443.27">coordinates 0 and Y and after we skew it</span> <span data-start="443.27" data-end="446.81">it gets here and it has coordinates a</span> <span data-start="446.81" data-end="452.3">and Y so this piece here is a the</span> <span data-start="452.3" data-end="454.67">distance from this point to this point</span> <span data-start="454.67" data-end="465.11">this is a but this is half the initial</span> <span data-start="465.11" data-end="475.4">length of the side and this is the skew</span> <span data-start="475.4" data-end="477.89">angle which is 30 degrees in our case</span> <span data-start="477.89" data-end="484.31">and this the length of this is y so the</span> <span data-start="484.31" data-end="486.98">tangent for this angle is going to be a</span> <span data-start="486.98" data-end="492.62">over Y so we can get a as being Y times</span> <span data-start="492.62" data-end="500.6">the tangent of the skew angle so since</span> <span data-start="500.6" data-end="503.27">the side of the initial rectangle was to</span> <span data-start="503.27" data-end="513.57">2y and the cosine of this angle</span> <span data-start="513.58" data-end="520.27">is why over the hypotenuse which is just</span> <span data-start="520.27" data-end="527.6">half of the initial side which means</span> <span data-start="527.61" data-end="532.72">that applying the skew X gives us the</span> <span data-start="532.72" data-end="536.71">lateral side of two times y over cosine</span> <span data-start="536.71" data-end="539.62">of 30 degrees in our case skew angle in</span> <span data-start="539.62" data-end="547.63">general so we need to scale down along</span>

data-end="1240.85">get some a prism we're not gonna get the</span> <span data-start="1240.85" data-end="1242.68">full prism we're gonna get just one</span> <span data-start="1242.68"

data-end="1259">and a square lateral face the first</span> <span data-start="1259" data-end="1261.79">thing is we translate the base we</span> <span data-start="1261.79" data-end="1265.54">translate it down by half of it and now</span> <span data-start="1265.54" data-end="1269.5">we rotate it around the x axis by 90</span> <span data-start="1269.5" data-end="1273.58">degrees and we rotate it by

<span data-start="1280.3" data-end="1285.67">is going to be outside the shape this is</span> <span data-start="1285.67" data-end="1286.42">not right</span> <span data-start="1286.42" data-end="1288.67">the center is not right we need to</span> <span data-start="1288.67" data-end="1291.52">translate it back</span> <span data-start="1291.52" data-end="1296.45">by the incircle and

data-start="1316.7" data-end="1320.54">along the z-axis and it gets into</span> <span data-start="1320.54" data-end="1323.36">position and the other two we get them</span> <span data-start="1323.36" data-end="1326.33">just the same we just add the radius</span> <span data-start="1326.33" data-end="1329.66">ankle we add another on central angle so</span> <span data-start="1329.66"
