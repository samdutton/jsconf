<p><span data-start="554.63" data-end="559.46">If you're using a keyboard that can be a problem, as we saw with virgin America when it changed</span> <span data-start="559.46" data-end="565.259">the careen we didn't get a page reload it scrolled me further down the page but my focus</span> <span data-start="565.259" data-end="570.93">was jumped all the way to the top, for a keyboard user, that's not fun user experience, it's</span> <span data-start="570.93" data-end="577.22">not what you would call "slick" if we're ripping out the DOM and putting it back, we need to</span> <span data-start="577.22" data-end="584.269">guide the user through the experience by sending their focus around, that's really useful thing</span> <span data-start="584.269" data-end="591.56">in JavaScript MVP applications, you should remember that before creating these custom</span> <span data-start="591.56" data-end="596.47">controls or adding ARIA, you should try to write meaningful HTML and native HTML, I'm</span> <span data-start="596.47" data-end="604.399">not going to ouch to on this much today in MVP App we saw when there was a big alert</span> <span data-start="604.399" data-end="609.329">and it didn't tell me if I was a non‑visual user you need to alert the user this thanks</span> <span data-start="609.329" data-end="614.69">are happening on the screen, maybe their focus is on one part of the application and something</span> <span data-start="614.69" data-end="621.05">is happening elsewhere, it's filtering or maybe they had an error in their form submission.</span> <span data-start="621.05" data-end="624.53">We need to actually tell the user that something else is happening.</span> <span data-start="624.53" data-end="631.97">So,let's talk about ARIA, stands for accessible rich internet applications, the idea is that</span> <span data-start="631.97" data-end="637.54">it's a set of attributes you use to expand HTML's semantic vocabulary, you can fill in</span> <span data-start="637.54" data-end="644.339">the gaps where HTML ‑‑ you're creating custom elements you have to define what those</span> <span data-start="644.339" data-end="651.69">are, if you think of a form input that has properties, it could be disabled, it would</span> <span data-start="651.69" data-end="652.69">required.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="652.69" data-end="655.509">In a screen reader, it's communicated that is a form element.</span> <span data-start="655.509" data-end="659.83">If you're creating a custom element, you don't get any of that for free, you can use area</span> <span data-start="659.83" data-end="663.3">to add some of that meaning.</span> <span data-start="663.3" data-end="668.05">The first core component of ARIA is the role, you think of it as what does this thing do,</span> <span data-start="668.05" data-end="670.55">my example is I have aiv.</span> <span data-start="670.55" data-end="677.95">It has a style ‑‑ a Div ‑‑ you might think that why isn't it just an image tag.</span> <span data-start="677.95" data-end="684.05">CSS background images have a few more options, and maybe you want to make scaling background</span> <span data-start="684.05" data-end="689.839">images, in the real world this happens to communicate the purpose of this Div, which</span> <span data-start="689.839" data-end="695.1">is presentation related, I can make it a more one to one experience by communicating that</span> <span data-start="695.1" data-end="700.509">this is an image, if I add a role of image to this D ivy all it has on it is a style</span> <span data-start="700.509" data-end="703.16">of background image.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="703.16" data-end="707.91">This communicates a purpose, they can't see the image, but at least they know it's an</span> <span data-start="707.91" data-end="712.23">image not just some empty Div sitting there.</span> <span data-start="712.23" data-end="716.98">The next piece in ARIA core components is the state, the current condition of this particular</span> <span data-start="716.98" data-end="721">thing, I mention in a form input might be required or disabled.</span> <span data-start="721" data-end="726.889">A state tends to change depending on the state of the application, here I have a material</span> <span data-start="726.889" data-end="733.82">input, which is like a custom input tag, and since it's a custom element, I can't make</span> <span data-start="733.82" data-end="736.709">use of the actual disabled attribute.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="736.709" data-end="742.62">So, you might wonder why would I use ARIA, if lease already a disabled attribute, it</span> <span data-start="742.62" data-end="747.93">only works on certain elements, if you're creating a custom one you need to expand the</span> <span data-start="747.93" data-end="750.939">vocabulary, that item is disabled.</span> <span data-start="750.939" data-end="756.39">And then you can update it depending on what the interface is doing.</span> <span data-start="756.39" data-end="761.23">And then, lastly if ARIA core components there are core properties, they tendless often than</span> <span data-start="761.23" data-end="772.019">states, I have a Doner‑Kebab element, not a taco butt son, it has an ARIA label, it's</span> <span data-start="772.019" data-end="776.5">a Doner‑Kebab, it might have Angelina Magmum bringing us lunch.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="776.5" data-end="784.959">No today ‑‑ it's a piece of off screen piece of information that tells the use wharethis</span> <span data-start="784.959" data-end="789.99">thing is it's really useful.</span> <span data-start="789.99" data-end="794.24">Every form input needs a label, sometimes you might not have label as part of your design,</span> <span data-start="794.24" data-end="800.1">either you could put a label element off screen or add area label directly on the input and</span> <span data-start="800.1" data-end="806.579">add confection to a non‑visual user ‑‑ add context to a non‑visual user.</span> <span data-start="806.579" data-end="810.85">Firstly the element types like we saw with the image, there's headings, let's see what</span> <span data-start="810.85" data-end="819.16">else is there that you might use, there's links, forms, where's some other ones, lists.</span> <span data-start="819.16" data-end="823.129">The idea with a role is it communicates what the type of element is.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="823.129" data-end="826.56">It will be announce in the a careen reader.</span> <span data-start="826.56" data-end="831.87">Secondly, roles can be used as landmarks, by landmarks for a screen reader they can</span> <span data-start="831.87" data-end="835.07">jump around a page without having to use the tab.</span> <span data-start="835.07" data-end="840.949">They could navigate through beige by navigation elements or maybe you have a main element</span> <span data-start="840.949" data-end="847.1">indicating the main body of your document, so those are useful to users who maybe aren't</span> <span data-start="847.1" data-end="849.07">using a mouse.</span> <span data-start="849.07" data-end="854.05">So you also want to start with native HTML tags, you get a lot for free, attributes,</span> <span data-start="854.05" data-end="860.64">keyboard vents if it's an interactive control, if you most use custom elements read the ARIA</span> <span data-start="860.64" data-end="866.839">documentation, which I have in my slides, if you're using a certain role, what the expected</span> <span data-start="866.839" data-end="868.85">keyboard behavior is.</span> <span data-start="868.85" data-end="873.69">If it's a button, you expect it to be engaged with the space bar, so those are things that</span> <span data-start="873.69" data-end="878.959">you need to know when a certain vole announce in the a screen reader, that user who's expecting</span> <span data-start="878.959" data-end="883.949">it to behave in a certain way you will have thought of that and you can bind the JavaScript</span> <span data-start="883.949" data-end="887.62">vents to make it work the way they expect.</span> </p>
