data-end="186.43">this is not just as easy especially when</span> <span data-start="186.43" data-end="188.319">you have a large complicated code base</span> <span data-start="188.319"

rigid</span> <span data-start="215.709" data-end="217.329">so you have classes and the class has a</span> <span data-start="217.329" data-end="219.76">fixed set of members and you have to</span> <span data-start="219.76" data-end="220.989">list the members when you are defining</span> <span data-start="220.989" data-end="223.75">the class and so on and with JavaScript</span> <span data-start="223.75" data-end="225.31">people want to have more flexibility</span> <span data-start="225.31" data-end="226.87">than that they want to have like objects</span> <span data-start="226.87" data-end="228.31">which have properties they can add some</span> <span data-start="228.31" data-end="229.84">properties and they can inspect what the</span> <span data-start="229.84"

data-end="235.239">some property is there or not so the</span> <span data-start="235.239" data-end="236.859">type system that you that we are using</span> <span data-start="236.859" data-end="238.15">the static type system needs to be</span> <span data-start="238.15" data-end="240.909">expressive enough to be able to state</span> <span data-start="240.909" data-end="242.889">all of these requirements and state all</span> <span data-start="242.889" data-end="246.329">of these points in the type declaration</span> <span data-start="246.329" data-end="250.03">but the interesting thing is it is</span> <span data-start="250.03" data-end="253.9">actually possible to express the stat to</span> <span data-start="253.9" data-end="255.639">infer the static types that were meant</span> <span data-start="255.639" data-end="257.769">by the JavaScript library developers so</span> <span data-start="257.769" data-end="259.51">this is the definite type brought this</span> <span data-start="259.51" data-end="262.12">is the definite typed project on github</span> <span data-start="262.12" data-end="264.699">where people actually after the fact</span> <span data-start="264.699" data-end="266.65">take JavaScript libraries written by the</span> <span data-start="266.65" data-end="269.02">community and come up with static type</span> <span data-start="269.02" data-end="270.729">declarations for all of the functions in</span> <span data-start="270.729" data-end="272.38">those libraries and you can see they</span> <span data-start="272.38" data-end="274.09">cover like a huge set so this is just</span> <span data-start="274.09" data-end="275.62">not a complete list of the libraries</span> <span data-start="275.62" data-end="277.9">that are there and it is actually</span> <span data-start="277.9" data-end="279.009">possible when you have a good language</span> <span data-start="279.009" data-end="280.69">of the good type system to express all</span> <span data-start="280.69" data-end="282.22">the types that are that have been used</span> <span data-start="282.22" data-end="285.639">by those libraries and so like in any in</span> <span data-start="285.639" data-end="287.529">any piece of JavaScript code it is also</span> <span data-start="287.529" data-end="289">possible with a good enough type system</span> <span data-start="289" data-end="291.4">to express your intentions and</span> <span data-start="291.4" data-end="294.52">your requirements another common</span> <span data-start="294.52" data-end="296.169">misconception about types is that like</span> <span data-start="296.169" data-end="297.52">type slowed you down when you change</span> <span data-start="297.52" data-end="300.699">code because you have to you have to</span> <span data-start="300.699" data-end="303.55">adapt the you have to go in and make</span> <span data-start="303.55" data-end="305.169">sure that the types actually fit and you</span> <span data-start="305.169" data-end="306.55">have to go and change the type</span> <span data-start="306.55" data-end="308.62">declarations when you are else altering</span> <span data-start="308.62" data-end="311.35">the code but this is actually all this</span> <span data-start="311.35" data-end="313.09">is actually not quite true so it does it</span> <span data-start="313.09" data-end="314.77">is true that you have to like go and</span> <span data-start="314.77" data-end="316.72">worry about the types but this is still</span> <span data-start="316.72" data-end="318.37">extremely useful to be able to</span> <span data-start="318.37" data-end="320.59">understand so the types are not there</span> <span data-start="320.59" data-end="322.36">for that for the sakes of themself for</span> <span data-start="322.36" data-end="324.039">the sake of themselves it's you they</span> <span data-start="324.039" data-end="326.11">give you a list of all the places that</span> <span data-start="326.11" data-end="327.91">you have to change when you are changing</span> <span data-start="327.91" data-end="330.1">a particular piece of code in order to</span> <span data-start="330.1" data-end="331.449">make sure that your program fit together</span> <span data-start="331.449" data-end="333.82">fits together yet that you do not end up</span> <span data-start="333.82" data-end="334.84">with the like square peg in the round</span> <span data-start="334.84" data-end="340.78">hole situation and if you don't have</span> <span data-start="340.78" data-end="342.31">types you have to run the test and you</span> <span data-start="342.31" data-end="343.449">have to like go through the test</span> <span data-start="343.449" data-end="344.74">failures and understand what exactly</span> <span data-start="344.74" data-end="346.75">needs to be changed when you because of</span> <span data-start="346.75" data-end="348.37">this test failure and you have to make</span> <span data-start="348.37" data-end="349.9">sure that you have enough coverage in</span> <span data-start="349.9" data-end="351.81">enough test covering your program and</span> <span data-start="351.81" data-end="354.22">like type save you a lot of pain in this</span> <span data-start="354.22" data-end="357.61">regard and of course a very good things</span> <span data-start="357.61" data-end="359.26">about types is that you do not have to</span> <span data-start="359.26" data-end="362.5">have them everywhere so if if in some</span> <span data-start="362.5" data-end="364.12">particular place like it's simple event</span> <span data-start="364.12" data-end="365.8">handler that takes it's like a parameter</span> <span data-start="365.8" data-end="367.15">you know what the parameter is you don't</span> <span data-start="367.15" data-end="368.979">you don't you are not ever getting</span> <span data-start="368.979" data-end="371.229">confused by that so you just leave it as</span> <span data-start="371.229" data-end="374.83">is but you can't specify types in like</span> <span data-start="374.83" data-end="376.75">more here in more complicated pieces of</span> <span data-start="376.75" data-end="378.099">code simply to support your thinking</span> <span data-start="378.099" data-end="380.5">simply to make it clear what happens in</span> <span data-start="380.5" data-end="385.24">every particular place now how can you</span> <span data-start="385.24" data-end="386.86">actually put types in a Java Script so</span> <span data-start="386.86" data-end="388.24">this was like a bit of the white part</span> <span data-start="388.24" data-end="390.31">and so how can you do actually how can</span> <span data-start="390.31" data-end="391.169">you actually do that</span> <span data-start="391.169" data-end="393.19">so first of all there are a bunch of</span> <span data-start="393.19" data-end="394.96">languages that compile to JavaScript and</span> <span data-start="394.96" data-end="397.3">that's like have fully supported static</span> <span data-start="397.3" data-end="399.19">type systems so these are just a few of</span> <span data-start="399.19" data-end="401.199">them there are actually like others so</span> <span data-start="401.199" data-end="403.33">cotton is made by JetBrains so this is</span> <span data-start="403.33" data-end="404.65">also something that I have worked on</span> <span data-start="404.65" data-end="406.81">previously but this is not what this</span> <span data-start="406.81" data-end="407.65">talk is about</span> <span data-start="407.65" data-end="409.63">so all these languages are nice they</span> <span data-start="409.63" data-end="411.34">give you a lot of a lot of power but</span> <span data-start="411.34" data-end="413.169">they require you to essentially change</span> <span data-start="413.169" data-end="415.03">the language in your project and then</span> <span data-start="415.03" data-end="416.32">the JavaScript communities can be often</span> <span data-start="416.32" data-end="417.729">a very controversial topic and there are</span> <span data-start="417.729" data-end="419.409">like many reasons why you do not want to</span> <span data-start="419.409" data-end="422.379">do that</span> <span data-start="422.389" data-end="424.58">and so this is not what I'm going to</span> <span data-start="424.58" data-end="426.98">talk about for like for the meat or my</span> <span data-start="426.98" data-end="429.71">talk today what I am going to talk to</span> <span data-start="429.71" data-end="433.04">talk about is Jays dog which is actually</span> <span data-start="433.04" data-end="435.53">great too and it actually it is much</span> <span data-start="435.53" data-end="439.31">more than just the cogeneration tool it</span> <span data-start="439.31" data-end="441.53">is a tool that lets you simply document</span> <span data-start="441.53" data-end="444.35">your code by adding parameter names like</span> <span

data-end="449.75">parameters are and so on but it does</span> <span data-start="449.75" data-end="451.73">much more than that it has actually</span> <span data-start="451.73" data-end="454.01">built-in type system that allows you to</span> <span data-start="454.01" data-end="455.84">express like all of those things that I</span> <span data-start="455.84"

have about functions all of the</span> <span data-start="464.05" data-end="467.39">like like all the parameter types and so</span> <span data-start="467.39" data-end="478.28">on okay and beside the documentation</span> <span data-start="478.28" data-end="480.229">there are also tools that can make use</span> <span data-start="480.229" data-end="481.61">of this additional information to do</span> <span data-start="481.61" data-end="484.4">error checking and to improve your code</span> <span data-start="484.4" data-end="487.37">experience when you write code so Google</span> <span

it's not it's</span> <span data-start="582.54" data-end="585.36">something that we want to be able to be</span> <span data-start="585.36" data-end="586.89">able to get a warning about because this</span> <span data-start="586.89" data-end="588.42">isn't we are not using the function in a</span> <span data-start="588.42" data-end="590.34">way that I meant and this is an example</span> <span

checks can be</span> <span data-start="609.48" data-end="611.13">performed by webstorm for examples so</span> <span data-start="611.13" data-end="614.46">yeah this is a function that takes it</span>

express all of those in a single in</span> <span data-start="692.7" data-end="696.21">a simple way also continuing the object</span> <span data-start="696.21" data-end="697.59">oriented programming

yeah this interface tag is used</span> <span data-start="731.91" data-end="736.62">to do that and when yes and you can also</span> <span data-start="736.62" data-end="739.41">mark an object that as requiring to</span> <span data-start="739.41" data-end="741.51">implement some interface and if it does</span> <span data-start="741.51" data-end="742.77">not actually implement the interface</span> <span data-start="742.77" data-end="744.89">then you get a warning because like the</span> <span data-start="744.89" data-end="746.73">implementation of the interfaces are not</span> <span data-start="746.73" data-end="749.43">there and once you do that it's very</span> <span data-start="749.43" data-end="751.05">easy to generate the implementations and</span> <span data-start="751.05" data-end="753.3">webstorm so you can just invoke the</span> <span data-start="753.3" data-end="757.23">implement methods quick fix and the</span> <span data-start="757.23" data-end="759.8">implementations are generated for you</span> <span data-start="759.8" data-end="763.8">it's quite easy to use the next concept</span> <span data-start="763.8" data-end="770.13">is announced so just the set of just</span> <span data-start="770.13" data-end="772.47">when a function takes the values that</span> <span data-start="772.47" data-end="774.39">need to be in a particular

<span data-start="779.01" data-end="780.63">else to a function you get an warning</span> <span data-start="780.63" data-end="782.82">about not like this this thing is not</span> <span data-start="782.82" data-end="784.14">assignable it does not have the right</span> <span data-start="784.14" data-end="789.9">type you can also the next thing I'm</span> <span data-start="789.9" data-end="792.81">going to show you the type def tag so</span> <span data-start="792.81" data-end="794.34">the type def it actually allows you to</span> <span data-start="794.34" data-end="796.73">give a short name to a particular set of</span> <span data-start="796.73" data-end="803.91">like a set of object fields so like if</span> <span data-start="803.91"

data-end="809.55">commonly used when it does not have like</span> <span data-start="809.55" data-end="811.71">a class or space like a specific class</span> <span data-start="811.71" data-end="813.78">at a constructor function you can just</span> <span data-start="813.78" data-end="815.61">take this thing and give it a specific</span> <span data-start="815.61" data-end="817.92">particular name and you like use it in</span> <span data-start="817.92" data-end="820.37">your code and according to this name and</span> <span data-start="820.37" data-end="822.35">so in this case yeah we</span> <span data-start="822.35" data-end="824.54">you can simply after once you do that</span> <span data-start="824.54" data-end="827.18">you can use it as

data-start="836.18" data-end="840.86">quite quickly but just the key concepts</span> <span data-start="840.86" data-end="842.57">are the one that the ones that have been</span> <span

data-end="855.59">talking about or is that is the</span> <span data-start="855.59" data-end="859.4">documentation for for the job for the</span> <span data-start="859.4" data-end="860.81">standard job field function that we have</span> <span data-start="860.81" data-end="864.29">as part of the webstorm distribution so</span> <span data-start="864.29" data-end="865.34">in this case we are making a mistake</span> <span data-start="865.34" data-end="867.5">that's very easy to that's very easy to</span> <span data-start="867.5" data-end="869.33">make accidentally so to this set</span> <span data-start="869.33" data-end="872.03">interval function instead of passing the</span> <span data-start="872.03" data-end="873.29">function itself we are passing the</span> <span data-start="873.29" data-end="874.55">return value of the function which is</span> <span data-start="874.55" data-end="875.84">not going to work because this function</span> <span data-start="875.84" data-end="877.7">does not return anything just returns</span> <span data-start="877.7" data-end="879.98">and webstorm can actually</span> <span data-start="879.98" data-end="886.64">highlight this error and so yeah</span> <span data-start="886.64" data-end="889.07">actually get this cubicle you can also</span> <span data-start="889.07" data-end="890.39">see that the type system allows you to</span> <span data-start="890.39" data-end="891.92">express alternatives and types so this</span> <span data-start="891.92" data-end="893.63">this thing must be either a string or a</span> <span data-start="893.63" data-end="896.42">function this or this pipe marker means</span> <span data-start="896.42" data-end="899.69">that yeah and this is how we how we</span> <span data-start="899.69" data-end="902.39">declare the types for the expected types</span> <span data-start="902.39" data-end="903.83">or sentence for the set interval</span> <span data-start="903.83" data-end="905.99">function it is just part of like this</span> <span data-start="905.99" data-end="908">these documents are just part of the</span> <span data-start="908" data-end="909.41">standard distribution of webstorm we are</span> <span data-start="909.41" data-end="911.09">simply maintaining this information to</span> <span data-start="911.09" data-end="912.65">make sure it's accurate and

data-start="917.39" data-end="918.89">another feature of webstorm that relies</span> <span data-start="918.89" data-end="920.45">on static type information is parameter</span> <span data-start="920.45" data-end="922.79">in for parameter information so it's a</span> <span data-start="922.79" data-end="925.85">very just very easy way to get to get a</span> <span data-start="925.85" data-end="927.11">tooltip for the function that you are</span> <span data-start="927.11" data-end="930.38">calling to get to check whether the</span> <span data-start="930.38"

also make use of static typing</span> <span data-start="939.08" data-end="940.58">information so in this case we have</span> <span data-start="940.58" data-end="942.8">declared the parameter parameter as a as</span> <span data-start="942.8" data-end="945.17">an element and so the completion</span> <span data-start="945.17" data-end="949.1">variants are generated based on knowing</span> <span data-start="949.1" data-end="951.11">the type of this value and so it's an</span> <span data-start="951.11" data-end="952.4">element and so we show the list of</span> <span data-start="952.4" data-end="955.45">members for element</span> <span data-start="955.46" data-end="957.51">this also works in slightly more</span> <span data-start="957.51" data-end="959.7">complicated situations so in this case</span> <span data-start="959.7" data-end="963.12">we have declared that the change</span> <span data-start="963.12" data-end="965.37">function takes a callback and the D and</span> <span data-start="965.37" data-end="967.35">in the context of the callback this is</span> <span data-start="967.35" data-end="969.66">going to be an element and so now we are</span> <span data-start="969.66" data-end="971.79">calling the change function and invoking</span> <span data-start="971.79" data-end="973.95">the code completion for this and once</span> <span data-start="973.95" data-end="976.5">again we get the list of the list of</span> <span data-start="976.5" data-end="979.92">members for element so this is also</span> <span data-start="979.92" data-end="986.8">quite handy in the next example we are</span> <span data-start="986.81" data-end="991.98">we are also we are also seeing another</span> <span data-start="991.98" data-end="993.54">common pattern in JavaScript libraries</span> <span data-start="993.54" data-end="996.06">where we have an object we has like so</span> <span data-start="996.06" data-end="997.71">instead of adding multiple
