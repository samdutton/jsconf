data-start="1892.11" data-end="1894.3">another next one says like 1x electron</span> <span data-start="1894.3" data-end="1895.89">4x electron this is just a naming</span> <span data-start="1895.89"

data-end="1914.25">if we look at the the electron tests the</span> <span data-start="1914.25" data-end="1915.81">one that just used one machine it took</span> <span data-start="1915.81" data-end="1918.9">two minutes 38 seconds and the one we</span> <span data-start="1918.9" data-end="1921.45">use for machines only took 46 seconds</span> <span data-start="1921.45" data-end="1924.24">and you know 2 minutes 38 seconds is not</span> <span data-start="1924.24" data-end="1925.92">a lot but when you're looking this is</span> <span data-start="1925.92"

data-end="1932.4">you're really gonna see the time time</span> <span data-start="1932.4" data-end="1935.37">savings here and it only aggregates over</span> <span data-start="1935.37" data-end="1941.63">over time and the next thing we have</span> <span data-start="1941.63" data-end="1945.69">that's with 3.1 is now we enable you to</span> <span data-start="1945.69" data-end="1948.39">group all your test runs together it's</span> <span data-start="1948.39" data-end="1950.43">it's like a nice general-purpose way of</span> <span data-start="1950.43" data-end="1952.17">grouping different test runs so for</span> <span data-start="1952.17" data-end="1954.63">example you want to test your main user</span> <span data-start="1954.63"

data-end="1961.86">you want to test like your admin page or</span> <span data-start="1961.86" data-end="1963.75">your ad in an application then you can</span> <span data-start="1963.75" data-end="1966.66">you know label that as admin so then</span> <span data-start="1966.66" data-end="1968.7">when you go to the dashboard kind of</span> <span data-start="1968.7" data-end="1972.12">like you saw here we use like the names</span> <span data-start="1972.12" data-end="1974.91">2x chrome 1x electron whatever but these</span> <span data-start="1974.91" data-end="1977.85">are the group names we chose and and</span> <span data-start="1977.85" data-end="1980.49">we're able to see them all in one test</span> <span data-start="1980.49" data-end="1982.2">run we group them all together you get</span> <span data-start="1982.2" data-end="1985.02">to see them all in one page and this is</span> <span data-start="1985.02" data-end="1986.64">how like you can associate them all</span> <span data-start="1986.64" data-end="1988.98">together and so if we kind of look at</span> <span data-start="1988.98" data-end="1991.11">these parallelized tests use and this is</span> <span data-start="1991.11" data-end="1994.05">kind of like a timeline view it's very</span> <span data-start="1994.05" data-end="1996.08">similar to like how the dev tools</span> <span data-start="1996.08" data-end="1999.51">waterfall network of you looks like so</span> <span data-start="1999.51" data-end="2001.16">you can see like we ran the action spec</span> <span data-start="2001.16" data-end="2003.47">first and then you know and so on and</span> <span data-start="2003.47" data-end="2006.04">the longest one ran first and as</span> <span data-start="2006.04" data-end="2008.59">go down the duration of the test specs</span> <span data-start="2008.59" data-end="2010.09">get
