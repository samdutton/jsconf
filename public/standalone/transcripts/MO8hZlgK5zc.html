<p><span data-start="53.39" data-end="56.71">I'm going to tell you the version of the story I know how to tell.</span> <span data-start="56.71" data-end="63.239">I'm one human being with imperfect knowledge as a point of view, so this story is not the</span> <span data-start="63.239" data-end="66.7">only story anyone could tell about it — not by a long way.</span> <span data-start="66.7" data-end="70.81">I could tell you a good version of one slice of this story because I was part of it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="70.81" data-end="79.649">I was at its heart, because, until last year, I was CTO of NPM Inc.</span> <span data-start="79.649" data-end="86.81">This gives me an expertise on the topic few people in the world have.</span> <span data-start="86.81" data-end="91.179">It also comes with a point of view, and I'm going to invite you to keep my point of view</span> <span data-start="91.179" data-end="94.119">in mind as you hear this story.</span> <span data-start="94.119" data-end="97.979">You're in this story.</span> <span data-start="97.979" data-end="98.979">Yes, you.</span> <span data-start="98.979" data-end="104.07">I bet you didn't know you were part of this story.</span> <span data-start="104.07" data-end="108.85">You will know why you're part of it, and you will know why your participation matters when</span> <span data-start="108.85" data-end="111.28">I'm done with this story.</span> <span data-start="111.28" data-end="117.86">It's a story about money, people who have money, and people who make money from open-source</span> <span data-start="117.86" data-end="125.179">software are not the people who — it's the story of an accidental decision that you made</span> <span data-start="125.179" data-end="129.63">without knowing about it, and one that I made consciously, and how that decision working</span> <span data-start="129.63" data-end="130.63">out today.</span> <span data-start="130.63" data-end="134.86">So it's a story about ownership, control, and their consequences.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="134.86" data-end="141.629">It's also a story about power: who has it, how much of it you have, and what you can</span> <span data-start="141.629" data-end="143.599">do with it.</span> <span data-start="143.599" data-end="145.569">Are you ready?</span> <span data-start="145.569" data-end="146.569">[Cheering].</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="201.879" data-end="203.37">JavaScript exploded.</span> <span data-start="203.37" data-end="208.32">Server-side JavaScript was starting to be a big topic, and it was here in 2009, ten</span> <span data-start="208.32" data-end="215.909">years ago, where Dahl announced node.js and that turned out to be the JavaScript platform</span> <span data-start="215.909" data-end="218.42">we wanted on the server.</span> <span data-start="218.42" data-end="223.499">Now, the early Node community was a happening place.</span> <span data-start="223.499" data-end="226.26">It was a scene.</span> <span data-start="226.26" data-end="230.709">It swept up a whole bunch of interesting people from systems programming and web programming,</span> <span data-start="230.709" data-end="235.75">and people who really enjoyed being at a bleeding edge ecosystem where a whole lot of stuff</span> <span data-start="235.75" data-end="239.31">hadn't been invented yet.</span> <span data-start="239.31" data-end="243.859">Several of the people involved early on figured out earlier on that package management would</span> <span data-start="243.859" data-end="248.109">be a pretty great thing, and there were a bunch of package managers, plural, being written</span> <span data-start="248.109" data-end="250.709">- yeah, more than one.</span> <span data-start="250.709" data-end="253.299">One of these people was a Yahoo employee.</span> <span data-start="253.299" data-end="256.169">He was super into Node.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="256.169" data-end="260.9">He quit his job so that he could write something inspired by the Yahoo package manager but</span> <span data-start="260.9" data-end="269.16">for node.js, and this particular programmer was clever in a couple of really useful ways.</span> <span data-start="269.16" data-end="275.31">For one thing, he got really super involved with Node, and this let him work on the Node</span> <span data-start="275.31" data-end="279.59">side implementation and his package manager at the same time.</span> <span data-start="279.59" data-end="284.17">He could make installer work right, and he really championed the common JS implementation</span> <span data-start="284.17" data-end="286.04">that Node has.</span> <span data-start="286.04" data-end="292.53">He did other stuff to beat other package managers, going around to other managers to support</span> <span data-start="292.53" data-end="295.44">pull requests of his rather than the other one.</span> <span data-start="295.44" data-end="298.97">Pretty smart.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="298.97" data-end="305.22">His was good enough and useful enough, the right solution, supported well enough so that</span> <span data-start="305.22" data-end="314">it won, so that the node package manager, or npm, was put along with node rather than</span> <span data-start="314" data-end="318.26">a third-party thing that you downloaded.</span> <span data-start="318.26" data-end="326.17">Official status granted by the Node Project continues to today.</span> <span data-start="326.17" data-end="333.25">Right about this time, bought Node from Dahl for a paltry amount of money.</span> <span data-start="333.25" data-end="340.25">You notice we're already in interesting economic territory.</span> <span data-start="340.25" data-end="346.4">The man who invented node.js, the tool used by everyone in this room, and millions of</span> <span data-start="346.4" data-end="353.58">people daily to develop JavaScript, made a few tens of thousands of dollars from it.</span> <span data-start="353.58" data-end="359.63">Whoever is making money from Node today, it's not its inventor.</span> <span data-start="359.63" data-end="365.35">He did at least make a living after selling it, because he was hired, which is pretty</span> <span data-start="365.35" data-end="374">good, and the joint also hired the programmer who made Node's package manager, but, important</span> <span data-start="374" data-end="377.26">plot point, he retained ownership of it.</span> <span data-start="377.26" data-end="385.65">He retained ownership of the npm domain name and source code.</span> <span data-start="385.65" data-end="393.37">He didn't turn it all over to it Joyen the way the Node source had been.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="393.37" data-end="397.4">This decision matters later, so, in the it.</span> <span data-start="397.4" data-end="404.39">The open source doesn't mean open ownership or control, it means you get to read the source</span> <span data-start="404.39" data-end="405.39">for something.</span> <span data-start="405.39" data-end="410.37">And the ability to read part of the source from something doesn't mean you can change</span> <span data-start="410.37" data-end="411.37">that source.</span> <span data-start="411.37" data-end="420.59">It doesn't give you any control over it, what it does, or what it .. The story moved forward,</span> <span data-start="420.59" data-end="426.11">you've probably heard this part before, 2012, Dahl leaves the npm project.</span> <span data-start="426.11" data-end="434.16">Right up about here is where all of you start appearing on the scene, or some of you anyway.</span> <span data-start="434.16" data-end="436.45">You're JavaScript programmers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="436.45" data-end="438.53">You like writing JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="438.53" data-end="442.53">If you can write a tool in JavaScript, you will.</span> <span data-start="442.53" data-end="445">So you started writing JavaScript with Node, and you liked it.</span> <span data-start="445" data-end="450.31">Meanwhile, people like me, who are kind of mixed about JavaScript — don't tell anyone!</span> <span data-start="450.31" data-end="455.45">- I figured out that Node was handy for writing I/O multiplexing services and thought this</span> <span data-start="455.45" data-end="456.45">is fun.</span> <span data-start="456.45" data-end="461.22">As 2013 went on, more and more people got on the Node train and Node got popular.</span> <span data-start="461.22" data-end="465.33">It meant npm got pretty popular.</span> <span data-start="465.33" data-end="468.42">That's great.</span> <span data-start="468.42" data-end="469.97">Right?</span> <span data-start="469.97" data-end="473.06">Well, no.</span> <span data-start="473.06" data-end="475.65">Success is a catastrophe for a lot of projects.</span> <span data-start="475.65" data-end="481.88">It's a catastrophe you need to survive, and success for npm was a catastrophe.</span> <span data-start="481.88" data-end="487.86">Here's why: npm's package registry is centralised.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="487.86" data-end="494.5">It is not just a CLI tool that grabs the code and puts it to to your hard drive and do modules.</span> <span data-start="494.5" data-end="500.3">The CLI probably is the least important part of the machinery despite how frequently you</span> <span data-start="500.3" data-end="502.52">interact with it.</span> <span data-start="502.52" data-end="509.93">Npm is most importantly to all of you a centralised package registry and a repository.</span> <span data-start="509.93" data-end="515.76">Right from the beginning, the registry was there running inside a Crouch DB database</span> <span data-start="515.76" data-end="519.13">on the same domain it is today.</span> <span data-start="519.13" data-end="523.769">Registry is just a list of all the packages you can install, their authors, anywhere names,</span> <span data-start="523.769" data-end="524.769">their versions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="524.769" data-end="530.41">The repository part is the part that stores all those packages in a centralised spot.</span> <span data-start="530.41" data-end="535.079">This is pretty great, because it makes installing them fast and reliable.</span> <span data-start="535.079" data-end="538.81">Someone is work on making that central repository zippy.</span> <span data-start="538.81" data-end="546.74">There's a lot to unpack there.</span> <span data-start="546.74" data-end="552.069">Centralisation is what we are talking about here, and centralisation has some advantages.</span> <span data-start="552.069" data-end="554.81">The npm registry is centralised.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="554.81" data-end="556.92">It comes with usability wins.</span> <span data-start="556.92" data-end="559.959">You only need to go to one place to look for something.</span> <span data-start="559.959" data-end="564.29">That one place can enforce some rules about the things you're looking for that they all</span> <span data-start="564.29" data-end="568.569">look the same, that they provide the same kind of information, maybe they don't even</span> <span data-start="568.569" data-end="571.66">vanish on a whim when their owner gets board.</span> <span data-start="571.66" data-end="575.449">Centralisation has advantages that matter to you.</span> <span data-start="575.449" data-end="580.391">I've been doing a Go programming lately, and it's weird.</span> <span data-start="580.391" data-end="584.181">It's very strange to try to find Go packages, because they're everywhere, and the only way</span> <span data-start="584.181" data-end="586.54">to find them is Google them.</span> <span data-start="586.54" data-end="592.639">You look at these old-fashioned lists of really exciting Go packages, the thing that Yahoo</span> <span data-start="592.639" data-end="595.779">used to do, like a hand-made list of things.</span> <span data-start="595.779" data-end="601.42">When I install these packages, I is that you will from GitHub repos I can just vanish.</span> <span data-start="601.42" data-end="610.749">So I have expectations that come from having used npm for eight years, and Go decent meet</span> <span data-start="610.749" data-end="612.579">any of those expectations.</span> <span data-start="612.579" data-end="618.249">The absence of a central registry for Go has helped me understand what NPM provides every</span> <span data-start="618.249" data-end="622.47">JavaScript programmer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="622.47" data-end="627.199">Centralisation is such an advantage that it is a trend.</span> <span data-start="627.199" data-end="629.089">Blogs were something you used to host on your own.</span> <span data-start="629.089" data-end="634.48">You used to buy your own domain name and spin up a server and host a blog.</span> <span data-start="634.48" data-end="639.91">Through the last ten years, there's been this big trend towards centralised hosting platforms.</span> <span data-start="639.91" data-end="646.75">You know, things that can provide a reliable place for you to put your blog, like MySpace.</span> <span data-start="646.75" data-end="656.86">Yes, Tumblr medium, social media centralised, Twitter and Facebook, and open source is even</span> <span data-start="656.86" data-end="658.26">centralised.</span> <span data-start="658.26" data-end="664.49">So, okay, npm is a centralised registry for the node packages.</span> <span data-start="664.49" data-end="670.279">In 2013, it wasn't great.</span> <span data-start="670.279" data-end="671.85">Why?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="671.85" data-end="677.38">Downside of centralisation is that costs are costs are centralised.</span> <span data-start="677.38" data-end="682.639">Downside of npm's registry is that all that use centred on a single database with a .. inside</span> <span data-start="682.639" data-end="684.459">it.</span> <span data-start="684.459" data-end="689.43">Here's a fact of the world: servers cost money.</span> <span data-start="689.43" data-end="692.199">Who pays for them?</span> <span data-start="692.199" data-end="699.029">For years, Node manager ran on donated hosting.</span> <span data-start="699.029" data-end="703.899">It was written with help from some of the people involved in implementing CouchDB, and</span> <span data-start="703.899" data-end="716.91">it free loaded on a bunch of CouchDB hosting services, treated as an ad for Couch — they</span> <span data-start="716.91" data-end="726.16">continued to host Node's package manager, and then it wasn't so cheap.</span> <span data-start="726.16" data-end="730.559">Success, the catastrophe, is expensive.</span> <span data-start="730.559" data-end="740.709">You all started using Node and that ad stopped being cheap the other various lazy short cuts</span> <span data-start="740.709" data-end="744.67">in implementing the registry starting have an effect once the registry saw some real</span> <span data-start="744.67" data-end="746.16">use.</span> </p>
