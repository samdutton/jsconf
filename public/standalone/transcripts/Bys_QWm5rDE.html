<p><span data-start="9.68" data-end="10.82">Hi, everyone.</span> <span data-start="10.88" data-end="11.68">How are you?</span> <span data-start="11.74" data-end="14.04">Can you hear me okay?</span> <span data-start="14.04" data-end="14.54">Awesome.</span> <span data-start="14.76" data-end="15.46">All right.</span> <span data-start="15.6" data-end="18.2">I'm really, really excited to be here today with you all.</span> <span data-start="18.2" data-end="20.699">Look, yes, my name is Patima.</span> <span data-start="20.699" data-end="22.109">So, a quick introduction.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="22.109" data-end="28.369">I'm the head of product and design at 7 west media in Australia.</span> <span data-start="28.369" data-end="30.589">I'm from Perth.</span> <span data-start="30.589" data-end="34.11">And we have very adorable quokka animals.</span> <span data-start="34.11" data-end="39.47">That's me traveling here for the first time ever in Europe.</span> <span data-start="39.47" data-end="42.53">And I'm super, super excited to be here.</span> <span data-start="42.53" data-end="44.969">It's amazing and it's quite an experience.</span> <span data-start="44.969" data-end="50.93">So, I bring over with me a little bit of Aussie slang.</span> <span data-start="50.93" data-end="59.12">So, as I have been told that my accent is quite strong, so I hope you can all understand</span> <span data-start="59.12" data-end="60.12">me.</span> <span data-start="60.12" data-end="66.509">But we do like to have a few idioms where we can connect and concatenate words together.</span> <span data-start="66.509" data-end="70.729">And the words I want to run through you all today is hard yakka.</span> <span data-start="70.729" data-end="74.82">Who has heard of the term before.</span> <span data-start="74.82" data-end="77.66">We have a few hands there.</span> <span data-start="77.66" data-end="80.41">Hey in the back there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="80.41" data-end="86.84">Now, hard yakka is the meaning of it is basically hard work.</span> <span data-start="86.84" data-end="89.96">And it comes from rural slang, essentially.</span> <span data-start="89.96" data-end="94.35">So, in the country there's wood, which is referred to as yakka.</span> <span data-start="94.35" data-end="99.39">And hard yakka is that meaning of hard work and work ethic.</span> <span data-start="99.39" data-end="102.35">And this term reminds me of my granddad.</span> <span data-start="102.35" data-end="105.939">Look how cute he is.</span> <span data-start="105.939" data-end="107.38">He's adorable.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="107.38" data-end="112.619">But he's one of the most hard working people I know, and he's got an amazing work ethic.</span> <span data-start="112.619" data-end="117.54">And just one of those people that has sage advice for any scenario.</span> <span data-start="117.54" data-end="120.13">And he's one of my greatest role models.</span> <span data-start="120.13" data-end="126.45">So, he'll say things like, work hard and be good to your mother.</span> <span data-start="126.45" data-end="130.12">Listen before you speak.</span> <span data-start="130.12" data-end="134.91">And never say gonna, because if you're gonna, you haven't done it yet.</span> <span data-start="134.91" data-end="142.3">And he's taught me a lot about work ethic and having just, I suppose, that determination</span> <span data-start="142.3" data-end="149.22">to really apply myself and to work hard no matter no matter what the circumstance and</span> <span data-start="149.22" data-end="150.96">just set goals and go for it.</span> <span data-start="150.96" data-end="156.46">So, he's really taught me a lot about resilience and diligence.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="156.46" data-end="158.77">And determination, of course.</span> <span data-start="158.77" data-end="163.57">But this transition of work ethic and hard yakka in our industry has been something that</span> <span data-start="163.57" data-end="169.51">I have been trying to adjust to for this, I don't know, 15 years I have been here working</span> <span data-start="169.51" data-end="171.02">in the web.</span> <span data-start="171.02" data-end="178.39">And the I suppose that concept of it is tricky because, well, the state of our industry is</span> <span data-start="178.39" data-end="181.42">something that requires a lot of mental willpower.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="181.42" data-end="187.31">And there's something that is not quite the same about it like other industries would</span> <span data-start="187.31" data-end="189.36">have in a traditional sense.</span> <span data-start="189.36" data-end="195.68">So, I suppose I just wanted to ask you all a few questions today, because this is something</span> <span data-start="195.68" data-end="198.84">that's been swirling around in my mind for a little bit.</span> <span data-start="198.84" data-end="205.42">And it's the observation of, I suppose, what's become normal in our industry.</span> <span data-start="205.42" data-end="206.94">Constant learning.</span> <span data-start="206.94" data-end="213.07">So, what I mean by this, as you know in our industry, we're always learning something</span> <span data-start="213.07" data-end="214.07">new.</span> <span data-start="214.07" data-end="216.23">I suppose here's a simple question for you all.</span> <span data-start="216.23" data-end="220.56">Who has learned something new this week?</span> <span data-start="220.56" data-end="222.85">Last week?</span> <span data-start="222.85" data-end="224.34">Last month?</span> <span data-start="224.34" data-end="225.73">Daily?</span> <span data-start="225.73" data-end="228.93">It's continuous and constant learning.</span> <span data-start="228.93" data-end="231.66">And it's also continuous change.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="231.66" data-end="233.56">Another question for you all.</span> <span data-start="233.56" data-end="240.05">Who is doing the exact same workflow as what they did two years ago?</span> <span data-start="240.05" data-end="242.56">One year ago?</span> <span data-start="242.56" data-end="243.84">One month ago?</span> <span data-start="243.84" data-end="244.84">Okay.</span> <span data-start="245.84" data-end="248.79">Sounds about right.</span> <span data-start="248.79" data-end="250.77">Also, community.</span> <span data-start="250.77" data-end="255.45">No, connectivity, I've jumped forward.</span> <span data-start="255.45" data-end="260.57">So, who hops on their laptops or their machines after work?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="260.57" data-end="262.75">Or on the weekends?</span> <span data-start="262.75" data-end="264.18">Oh, that's a lot of hands.</span> <span data-start="264.18" data-end="265.18">Yep.</span> <span data-start="265.18" data-end="266.18">Me too.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="267.18" data-end="270.38">And who goes out and hangs out with the community?</span> <span data-start="270.38" data-end="274.28">Who runs or volunteers at or attends meetups all the time?</span> <span data-start="274.28" data-end="278.07">Uh huh, uh huh.</span> <span data-start="278.07" data-end="279.07">Contributions.</span> <span data-start="279.07" data-end="284.14">Who is contributed to open source software in this last week?</span> <span data-start="284.14" data-end="285.86">This month?</span> <span data-start="285.86" data-end="287.58">This year?</span> <span data-start="287.58" data-end="288.58">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="288.58" data-end="290.16">Yeah, yeah.</span> <span data-start="290.16" data-end="294.48">And the last C that I wanted to bring in and talk about is in the state of our industry</span> <span data-start="294.48" data-end="296.77">is also creativity.</span> <span data-start="296.77" data-end="302.72">And in that sense of, how many of you have a side project going on or are working on</span> <span data-start="302.72" data-end="307.28">a side project, have worked on side projects, thinking about working on a side project?</span> <span data-start="307.28" data-end="308.28">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="308.28" data-end="312.04">That's a that's a lot happening, right?</span> <span data-start="312.04" data-end="315.16">That's we're doing all of this stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="315.16" data-end="322.12">Probably on top of full time work or full time study, and, you know, that's that's a</span> <span data-start="322.12" data-end="324.78">lot of hours that we're putting into this world.</span> <span data-start="324.78" data-end="330.9">So, then I kind of got to thinking about, you know, what is it that we value and normalize</span> <span data-start="330.9" data-end="333.83">as good, strong work ethic in our industry?</span> <span data-start="333.83" data-end="337.62">What's the hard yakka here?</span> <span data-start="337.62" data-end="341.82">And really, you know, it's it's what we value, right?</span> <span data-start="341.82" data-end="343.98">As human beings and as professionals.</span> <span data-start="343.98" data-end="349.72">And you kind of hear these kind of praises that swirl around and humble brags that happen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="349.72" data-end="351.34">These might sound familiar.</span> <span data-start="351.34" data-end="355.5">You know, there's Dev, it's super fast.</span> <span data-start="355.5" data-end="358.08">And then you might do the whole, I worked nine hours today.</span> <span data-start="358.08" data-end="360.41">Well, I worked ten hours today.</span> <span data-start="360.41" data-end="362.06">I worked 24.</span> <span data-start="362.06" data-end="364.58">It's like this humble bragging that's happening.</span> <span data-start="364.58" data-end="371.34">And, you know, it's this kind of sense, oh, well, that is what we consider maybe working</span> <span data-start="371.34" data-end="372.48">harder.</span> <span data-start="372.48" data-end="376.66">But then we've also got this kind of world surrounding us as well which is, you know,</span> <span data-start="376.66" data-end="381.57">blog posts and contributing and working on side projects and mentoring and all these</span> <span data-start="381.57" data-end="386.02">other things that we do to kind of keep progressing our career forward.</span> <span data-start="386.02" data-end="389.6">And then we kind of have this really hard wired mentality.</span> <span data-start="389.6" data-end="396.78">But, you know, we do all these things of, well, so much to do and I'm so busy and these</span> <span data-start="396.78" data-end="399.49">are the general normal conversations that we have.</span> <span data-start="399.49" data-end="402.21">And to me I kind of I kind of worry.</span> <span data-start="402.21" data-end="408.53">Because what we're saying to not only ourselves, but to the people that are looking up to us</span> <span data-start="408.53" data-end="413.84">or that we speak to day to day, the things that we're praising each other about are saying</span> <span data-start="413.84" data-end="414.84">these.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="414.84" data-end="421.19">I suppose the translations, that somehow high performance is shipping things quickly.</span> <span data-start="421.19" data-end="423.45">Regardless of quality, maintainability.</span> <span data-start="423.45" data-end="426.41">Yeah, smash it out.</span> <span data-start="426.41" data-end="428.79">Let's get other things done.</span> <span data-start="428.79" data-end="434.889">Or that clocking becomes this badge of pride that's somehow related to productivity because</span> <span data-start="434.889" data-end="439.27">we're doing so much all the time and we're always busy.</span> <span data-start="439.27" data-end="441.47">Is that a good thing?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="441.47" data-end="447.55">And doing all of these things somehow is expected of us to get ahead in this industry.</span> <span data-start="447.55" data-end="451.95">If you're not doing all of those things I was listing out before with the state of our</span> <span data-start="451.95" data-end="457.79">industry somehow, you know, are we performing the best that we can?</span> <span data-start="457.79" data-end="460.79">Are we meeting our potential?</span> <span data-start="460.79" data-end="466.32">And the other thing I'm reading into it is, if we're always busy and needed, then this</span> <span data-start="466.32" data-end="469.89">relates to somehow the I'm valuable conversation.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="469.89" data-end="472.64">So, I see a few nods out there.</span> <span data-start="472.64" data-end="476.37">And this is kind of my reaction to it.</span> <span data-start="476.37" data-end="478.72">Like, what is happening to our industry?</span> <span data-start="478.72" data-end="481.47">It doesn't quite sound right.</span> <span data-start="481.47" data-end="482.47">Kind of like this.</span> <span data-start="482.47" data-end="483.68">It's like a little yeah.</span> <span data-start="483.68" data-end="486.49">Oh, I love it.</span> <span data-start="486.49" data-end="492.03">So, suppose when we're kind of looking at Googling.</span> <span data-start="492.03" data-end="494.23">Good old Google.</span> <span data-start="494.23" data-end="495.99">Leveling up, you know?</span> <span data-start="495.99" data-end="502.13">If we want to level up as developer or human being, then all of a sudden, we have to go,</span> <span data-start="502.13" data-end="505.7">well, what are the steps that we need to take to do that?</span> <span data-start="505.7" data-end="509.79">And all the things that are expected of us, are they fair?</span> <span data-start="509.79" data-end="515.33">And I came across this Tweet from Eric Elliott a little while ago and it really got me thinking.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="515.33" data-end="517.71">It's one of those reflective pieces, right?</span> <span data-start="517.71" data-end="521.67">It's like, think of the most extraordinary developer you have worked with and the traits</span> <span data-start="521.67" data-end="523.75">and qualities they have.</span> <span data-start="523.75" data-end="526.81">And the results of the survey, he wrote a great blog post about it.</span> <span data-start="526.81" data-end="530.35">Feel free to go forth and check it out.</span> <span data-start="530.35" data-end="539.24">He came out with these top five qualities, communicative, honest, top five traits, problem</span> <span data-start="539.24" data-end="544.24">solver, skilled, mentor, teacher, excellent learner, passionate.</span> <span data-start="544.24" data-end="545.24">Cool.</span> <span data-start="545.24" data-end="546.24">Not bad.</span> <span data-start="546.24" data-end="550.82">These are things I would personally expect any kind of working professional to have these</span> <span data-start="550.82" data-end="553.05">kinds of skills and traits.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="553.05" data-end="557.85">But, you know, kind of add to this, we see lots of mind maps around about the state of</span> <span data-start="557.85" data-end="558.85">the web.</span> <span data-start="558.85" data-end="561.529">And, wow, that just keeps going.</span> <span data-start="561.529" data-end="569.64">And that's from frontend to backend to DevOps to, you know, sitting in this full stack world.</span> <span data-start="569.64" data-end="572.87">It's so full on and we're just learning all these things constantly.</span> <span data-start="572.87" data-end="574.37">And all the expectations.</span> <span data-start="574.37" data-end="575.62">We should know everything.</span> <span data-start="575.62" data-end="578.97">And then we just it's tiring.</span> <span data-start="578.97" data-end="580.15">You know?</span> <span data-start="580.15" data-end="583.71">Do we do we accept this?</span> <span data-start="583.71" data-end="589.601">Do we accept that this is a healthy environment that we want people to come into our industry</span> <span data-start="589.601" data-end="591.16">and go, hey, yeah?</span> <span data-start="591.16" data-end="596.75">Working ten hours to 15 hours to getting no sleep and being busy all the time is cool.</span> <span data-start="596.75" data-end="597.75">Yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="597.75" data-end="599.67">I don't know.</span> <span data-start="601.86" data-end="605.6">With this save the world, I feel like it's no wonder we're exhausted.</span> <span data-start="605.6" data-end="611.85">And it's no wonder we're seeing people talk about, I suppose, the signs and symptoms of</span> <span data-start="611.85" data-end="612.85">burnout.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="612.85" data-end="619.11">And I find that really concerning because there's some really talented people that are</span> <span data-start="619.11" data-end="624">kind of hitting this stage and then not able to recover.</span> <span data-start="624" data-end="628.35">And they're leaving the industry or changing the industry or taking these massive breaks.</span> <span data-start="628.35" data-end="634.82">And when we're talking about it in a physical sense, it's actually a thing called OTS.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1573.34" data-end="1577.879">Maybe they might be more organized to say, okay, well, I really need you for X, Y, Z.</span> <span data-start="1577.879" data-end="1581.149">Can we catch up in the window where you're available?</span> <span data-start="1581.149" data-end="1586.24">And you might then become a better communicator of saying I'm not available from this time</span> <span data-start="1586.24" data-end="1588.109">onwards.</span> <span data-start="1588.109" data-end="1590.279">Maybe catch me in a window I'm available.</span> <span data-start="1590.279" data-end="1592.369">Again, taking control of that calendar again.</span> <span data-start="1592.369" data-end="1599.33">And, I mean, it sounds pretty awful, but you get time to do the things that you really</span> <span data-start="1599.33" data-end="1601.14">like to enjoy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1601.14" data-end="1603.95">Or enjoy doing or that are important to you.</span> <span data-start="1603.95" data-end="1606.889">Wouldn't that be a bit ace?</span> <span data-start="1606.889" data-end="1610.96">So, here's the methods I would suggest just getting started with that.</span> <span data-start="1610.96" data-end="1614.46">Because it can be difficult, especially if there's a culture in your work place where</span> <span data-start="1614.46" data-end="1620.09">people are staying back or online all the time because that's the state of our industry,</span> <span data-start="1620.09" data-end="1621.09">right?</span> <span data-start="1621.09" data-end="1626.33">Maybe just start by booking in a few after work appointments.</span> <span data-start="1626.33" data-end="1628.039">Whether that's a coffee and a cake with someone.</span> <span data-start="1628.039" data-end="1632.32">Whether that's a walking catchup with someone else.</span> <span data-start="1632.32" data-end="1638.549">But having a regular routine, maybe something like a fitness group or rock climbing or whatever</span> <span data-start="1638.549" data-end="1644.639">activity to take on that you're doing with someone else means you have that responsibility.</span> <span data-start="1644.639" data-end="1647.46">You can go out and do it together with your buddy.</span> <span data-start="1647.46" data-end="1654.179">And committing to leaving on time is really something that is going to take a lot of discipline.</span> <span data-start="1654.179" data-end="1659.97">And working in that habit might be a little tricky at first, but then you start to be</span> <span data-start="1659.97" data-end="1661.84">okay with it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1661.84" data-end="1667.83">And here's a really important one if you are working a lot of open source projects.</span> <span data-start="1667.83" data-end="1673.809">Ask your boss and create that culture within that environment that you're working in for</span> <span data-start="1673.809" data-end="1677.139">these contributions to be happening during work hours.</span> <span data-start="1677.139" data-end="1679.679">I think this is professional development.</span> <span data-start="1679.679" data-end="1685.669">I think this is the way as an employee or someone working in the industry you're growing</span> <span data-start="1685.669" data-end="1687.059">your skills in that way.</span> <span data-start="1687.059" data-end="1693.309">And that training should be endorsed and encouraged within work hours in some way, share, or form.</span> <span data-start="1693.309" data-end="1697.809">So, you know, that and also if you're going to a lot of meetups, that's also training</span> <span data-start="1697.809" data-end="1698.809">as well.</span> <span data-start="1698.809" data-end="1704.129">Maybe balance that out, okay, if I'm going to meetup one night can I come in later the</span> <span data-start="1704.129" data-end="1705.129">next day?</span> <span data-start="1705.129" data-end="1707.639">That was learning time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1707.639" data-end="1713.149">Taking control of that more so you can spend time on things that matter.</span> <span data-start="1713.149" data-end="1718.45">And the hard yakka side of it really comes into knowing and understanding that your time</span> <span data-start="1718.45" data-end="1719.69">is precious.</span> <span data-start="1719.69" data-end="1722.82">And really that's our most valuable commodity.</span> <span data-start="1722.82" data-end="1726.73">So, shouldn't we be dedicating that to things that bring us joy?</span> <span data-start="1726.73" data-end="1729.519">Or making us more us?</span> <span data-start="1729.519" data-end="1733.509">What about spending time with family and friends?</span> <span data-start="1733.509" data-end="1736.83">What about prioritizing your interests and hobbies?</span> <span data-start="1736.83" data-end="1741.729">Learning and discovery, playing, travel, exploration.</span> <span data-start="1741.729" data-end="1745.539">We're all very unique human beings that are inspired by different things.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1745.539" data-end="1748.269">So, why not embrace that?</span> <span data-start="1748.269" data-end="1752.609">And something that might help towards that so that you might have some more energy to</span> <span data-start="1752.609" data-end="1756.369">contribute to it is a journal.</span> <span data-start="1756.369" data-end="1761.789">Getting things out of your head and reflecting on it means you might have that chance to</span> <span data-start="1761.789" data-end="1765.21">see it laid out rather than just swirling around in your mind.</span> <span data-start="1765.21" data-end="1769.739">Feel free to get a Pinterest or a happiness board up and running.</span> <span data-start="1769.739" data-end="1772.94">Those visuals give you those reminders constantly.</span> <span data-start="1772.94" data-end="1774.999">And deliberately booking time for play.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1774.999" data-end="1778.719">Again, taking ownership of your calendar.</span> <span data-start="1778.719" data-end="1787.239">So, I say, in your own way, and that energized people can do even more, and we should take</span> <span data-start="1787.239" data-end="1790.289">care of ourselves and take care of each other.</span> <span data-start="1790.289" data-end="1794.929">And what my grandad would say is, hard yakka is good, but don't be a dingo.</span> </p>
