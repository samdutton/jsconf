discovered the first of</span> <span data-start="673.059" data-end="677.439">all rendering we had the question of how</span> <span data-start="677.439" data-end="679.689">do I actually rendered 2,000 objects in</span> <span data-start="679.689" data-end="681.79">less than 50 milliseconds because that</span> <span data-start="681.79" data-end="684.069">if you're looking at scaling viewports</span> <span data-start="684.069" data-end="687.22">to full HD that's some test case that</span> <span data-start="687.22" data-end="692.439">really might happen and where we what we</span> <span data-start="692.439" data-end="696.459">thought right was obviously I use canvas</span> <span data-start="696.459" data-end="698.649">because canvas is the hot new thing and</span> <span data-start="698.649" data-end="700.959">and canvas is sexy and canvas is</span> <span data-start="700.959" data-end="703.87">hardware accelerated now so canvas is</span> <span data-start="703.87" data-end="705.73">really the way to go and you can load</span> <span data-start="705.73" data-end="709.48">images in canvas all nice so here's what</span> <span data-start="709.48" data-end="713.649">happened we figured out that canvas in</span> <span data-start="713.649" data-end="715.389">fact is a lot slower than everything</span> <span data-start="715.389" data-end="718.559">else so if you're using a lot of images</span> <span data-start="718.559" data-end="721.23">canvas really drags you down because</span> <span data-start="721.23" data-end="725.41">canvas image API unfortunate since you</span> <span data-start="725.41" data-end="727.269">always have to initialize the image</span> <span data-start="727.269" data-end="730.149">using the Dom then you have to wait for</span> <span data-start="730.149" data-end="732.339">it to load until you can actually render</span> <span data-start="732.339" data-end="735.55">it out to the canvas um which means if</span> <span data-start="735.55" data-end="737.279">you're working with lots of graphics is</span> <span data-start="737.279" data-end="739.749">actually waste lowered and just do DOM</span> <span data-start="739.749" data-end="742.779">and just have dibs all over the place</span> <span data-start="742.779" data-end="746.439">and work with images so that was</span> <span data-start="746.439" data-end="749.11">frustrating but you know I really just</span> <span data-start="749.11" data-end="751.66">want to get it fast so i didn't use</span> <span data-start="751.66" data-end="754.959">canvas ruining rendering after all but</span> <span data-start="754.959" data-end="757.48">um that actual explanation was kind of</span> <span data-start="757.48" data-end="759.37">not enough for many people they were</span> <span data-start="759.37" data-end="761.47">talking like okay I can kind of</span> <span data-start="761.47" data-end="763.42">understand that and but you still you</span> <span data-start="763.42" data-end="765.04">know you're still constructing Dom</span> <span data-start="765.04" data-end="767.379">elements with tips to and images and</span> <span data-start="767.379" data-end="769.749">whatever it's not like that it should be</span> <span data-start="769.749" data-end="773.889">a huge difference so why can it be that</span> <span data-start="773.889" data-end="777.91">much slower so canvas best redrawing and</span> <span data-start="777.91" data-end="779.589">that's another big point it's also</span> <span data-start="779.589" data-end="782.29">extremely painful as we had any talk if</span> <span data-start="782.29" data-end="783.79">you've attended the talk right before</span> <span data-start="783.79" data-end="785.709">that they were talking about this little</span> <span data-start="785.709" data-end="788.589">bit so I feel if you're working with</span> <span data-start="788.589" data-end="791.079">canvas what you have to do is if you</span> <span data-start="791.079" data-end="792.519">have something on the screen happening</span> <span data-start="792.519" data-end="795.16">and and the character fences is moving</span> <span data-start="795.16" data-end="796.959">on the screen and moving its position</span> <span data-start="796.959" data-end="798.31">what you usually do</span> <span data-start="798.31" data-end="800.35">simply wipe out the Holts hold scream</span> <span data-start="800.35" data-end="802.54">the whole frame again and rendered once</span> <span data-start="802.54" data-end="805.12">again all the stuff that goes in it and</span> <span data-start="805.12" data-end="808.6">that tends to be really really slow if</span> <span data-start="808.6" data-end="810.279">you're looking at operating systems and</span> <span data-start="810.279" data-end="812.5">browsers in general what browsers do and</span> <span data-start="812.5" data-end="814.39">what operating systems do is partial</span> <span data-start="814.39" data-end="817.51">redrawing so really what you do have to</span> <span data-start="817.51" data-end="819.91">do if you want to do a scalable game in</span> <span data-start="819.91" data-end="821.5">canvas you have to implement your own</span> <span data-start="821.5" data-end="824.23">partial redrawing algorithm so what you</span> <span data-start="824.23" data-end="826.54">have to do have to analyze the areas</span> <span data-start="826.54" data-end="829.36">that really do change and basically only</span> <span data-start="829.36" data-end="832.12">read or those areas and this gets really</span> <span data-start="832.12" data-end="834.19">reach tricky believe me okay you have to</span> <span data-start="834.19" data-end="836.14">invest a lot of time into getting this</span> <span data-start="836.14" data-end="838.27">right and impulsive vendors we're doing</span> <span data-start="838.27" data-end="840.13">it and you know if you're working with</span> <span data-start="840.13" data-end="842.02">thumb the browser vendors are already</span> <span data-start="842.02" data-end="844.3">doing it for you so I figured it might</span> <span data-start="844.3" data-end="846.31">be really good to just do dham for our</span> <span data-start="846.31" data-end="851.65">prototypes so really the basic message I</span> <span data-start="851.65" data-end="854.26">want to give you don't just go for</span> <span data-start="854.26" data-end="856.24">feature because it's hot and because</span> <span data-start="856.24" data-end="859.69">it's new um really try out what you want</span> <span data-start="859.69" data-end="862.9">to do and test my testing is key test</span> <span data-start="862.9" data-end="864.94">until you really are confident that it's</span> <span data-start="864.94" data-end="867.339">the right solution for your case and the</span> <span data-start="867.339" data-end="869.26">right solution for my case was pure</span> <span data-start="869.26" data-end="873.96">vanilla Dom so our next one delegation</span> <span data-start="873.96" data-end="877.63">as i mentioned events is really</span> <span data-start="877.63" data-end="879.82">important for all kinds of stuff we're</span> <span data-start="879.82" data-end="884.26">doing so what we came up with with was</span> <span data-start="884.26" data-end="886.81">really one event to rule them all that</span> <span data-start="886.81" data-end="889.12">is actually three events one of them is</span> <span data-start="889.12" data-end="890.86">mouse move but those are the three that</span> <span data-start="890.86" data-end="893.1">are most important to control the game</span> <span data-start="893.1" data-end="895.6">obviously can you can have keyboard</span> <span data-start="895.6" data-end="897.7">control as well but for our prototypes</span> <span data-start="897.7" data-end="899.38">that were that were the three events</span> <span data-start="899.38" data-end="903.94">events that we need it so if you think</span> <span data-start="903.94" data-end="905.91">about clicking on objects for instance</span> <span data-start="905.91" data-end="910.209">since its using event delegation yeah</span> <span data-start="910.209" data-end="912.04">obviously like you have that you know</span> <span data-start="912.04" data-end="914.2">that's that's a diff and you just put it</span> <span data-start="914.2" data-end="917.62">somewhere on your map and what happens</span> <span data-start="917.62" data-end="919.12">now well obviously it's using a</span> <span data-start="919.12" data-end="921.76">background graphic some P&G with alpha</span> <span data-start="921.76" data-end="923.74">transparency and well you can click on</span> <span data-start="923.74" data-end="925.779">it but you know you can click on the</span> <span data-start="925.779" data-end="928.06">alpha transparency to which kind of</span> <span data-start="928.06" data-end="929.77">sucks because that that's really not the</span> <span data-start="929.77" data-end="931.58">kind of experience that you want</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="931.58" data-end="933.32">I go if for instance if I have another</span> <span data-start="933.32" data-end="936.95">house behind that one and I click into</span> <span data-start="936.95" data-end="939.59">that transparent area I'm not expecting</span> <span data-start="939.59" data-end="942.98">that house to actually be lounge at</span> <span data-start="942.98" data-end="946.19">whatever opening pop-up so this this</span> <span data-start="946.19" data-end="948.65">really kind of sucks so what we came up</span> <span data-start="948.65" data-end="951.74">with was something really creative and</span> <span data-start="951.74" data-end="955.64">that is click food maps this is well</span> <span data-start="955.64" data-end="957.83">maybe not that creative but creative web</span> <span data-start="957.83" data-end="960.02">in the web and creative in the way we do</span> <span data-start="960.02" data-end="964.01">it so um the game industry was doing</span> <span data-start="964.01" data-end="965.75">that all over again they were doing it</span> <span data-start="965.75" data-end="968.24">for years but I haven't seen this in the</span> <span data-start="968.24" data-end="971.6">web any anywhere so what it means it's</span> <span data-start="971.6" data-end="974.03">build up pixel map for each object that</span> <span data-start="974.03" data-end="976.37">tells us what it turns when pixels are</span> <span data-start="976.37" data-end="979.07">so if it's transparent then check behind</span> <span data-start="979.07" data-end="981.53">until you find a valid target so this is</span> <span data-start="981.53" data-end="983.99">pretty easy because if you if you do the</span> <span data-start="983.99" data-end="986.15">event delegation from the top you always</span> <span data-start="986.15" data-end="988.37">know you always control your viewport so</span> <span data-start="988.37" data-end="990.53">you always know where your stuff is in</span> <span data-start="990.53" data-end="993.92">general if in your JavaScript so</span> <span data-start="993.92" data-end="996.2">checking behind is really not that hard</span> <span data-start="996.2" data-end="998.03">and this fixes our issue which is really</span> <span data-start="998.03" data-end="1001.62">nice however there's one issue with that</span> <span data-start="1001.62" data-end="1003.85">building up those pixel maps is</span> <span data-start="1003.85" data-end="1007.6">amazingly crappy work it's hard and you</span> <span data-start="1007.6" data-end="1009.43">have to automate it somehow so what we</span> <span data-start="1009.43" data-end="1012.64">did is we lack canvas to it so this is</span> <span data-start="1012.64" data-end="1014.17">what I mentioned when I said I use</span> <span data-start="1014.17" data-end="1016.12">canvas as a tool I'm not using a</span> <span data-start="1016.12" data-end="1018.19">rendering I'm just using it to actually</span> <span data-start="1018.19" data-end="1020.83">read pixel data of the images then we</span> <span data-start="1020.83" data-end="1022.39">check if our pixel is in fact</span> <span data-start="1022.39" data-end="1024.699">transparent and then save this value in</span> <span data-start="1024.699" data-end="1027.28">a new optimized array and basically use</span> <span data-start="1027.28" data-end="1029.68">this whenever we need to check and it</span> <span data-start="1029.68" data-end="1032.17">actually scares really well so EXCI</span> <span data-start="1032.17" data-end="1034.15">works really well you have to be careful</span> <span data-start="1034.15" data-end="1035.89">if you want to support IE six but other</span> <span data-start="1035.89" data-end="1039.64">than that it's nice so that's just one</span> <span data-start="1039.64" data-end="1044.35">of the tricks next one exit surfaces I</span> <span data-start="1044.35" data-end="1046.209">was talking about this a bit in our</span> <span data-start="1046.209" data-end="1049">videos but I might be going a bit more</span> <span data-start="1049" data-end="1051.7">into detail to today which is really new</span> <span data-start="1051.7" data-end="1054.91">content so action surfaces was something</span> <span data-start="1054.91" data-end="1058.78">we came up it's basically drop of over</span> <span data-start="1058.78" data-end="1061.93">widgets or other objects so if you look</span> <span data-start="1061.93" data-end="1063.99">at that TV right the</span> <span data-start="1063.99" data-end="1066.69">black screen basically would be an area</span> <span data-start="1066.69" data-end="1069">where you could drop generic content for</span> <span data-start="1069" data-end="1071.28">instance I frames or whatever so they</span> <span data-start="1071.28" data-end="1073.08">transformed to isometric projection in</span> <span data-start="1073.08" data-end="1075.51">real time using CSS transforms since by</span> <span data-start="1075.51" data-end="1078.33">using CSS transforms you can transform</span> <span data-start="1078.33" data-end="1080.64">to isometry on the fly and its really</span> <span data-start="1080.64" data-end="1083.07">way cool and that's also something by</span> <span data-start="1083.07" data-end="1084.84">the way that could not be possible if</span> <span data-start="1084.84" data-end="1086.7">you were to use canvas because if you</span> <span data-start="1086.7"

data-end="1790.49">interpolated so you see the background</span> <span data-start="1790.49" data-end="1792.86">image sliding right so it's not just</span> <span data-start="1792.86" data-end="1794.69">jumping from one position to another</span> <span data-start="1794.69" data-end="1797.12">like picture picture picture is actually</span> <span data-start="1797.12" data-end="1800.09">sliding through it so that kind of sucks</span> <span data-start="1800.09" data-end="1801.26">and not that's not the impression that</span> <span data-start="1801.26" data-end="1805.55">we want and luckily this is really</span> <span data-start="1805.55" data-end="1806.87">really hot and this is really really</span> <span data-start="1806.87" data-end="1809.18">knew this just went into the specs</span> <span data-start="1809.18" data-end="1812">recently like a I think two weeks ago</span> <span data-start="1812" data-end="1814.34">three weeks ago it's not implemented in</span> <span data-start="1814.34" data-end="1815.87">any browser which is which is</span> <span data-start="1815.87" data-end="1818.21">unfortunate but it really steps it's</span> <span data-start="1818.21" data-end="1820.55">nice steps there's a new eating property</span> <span data-start="1820.55" data-end="1822.68">is a new timing function so basically</span> <span data-start="1822.68" data-end="1824.54">what it does it it's not eating at all</span> <span data-start="1824.54" data-end="1827.63">it's actually disabling easing so if set</span> <span data-start="1827.63" data-end="1829.94">keyframes are in fact behaving like</span> <span data-start="1829.94" data-end="1832.73">individual frames so with that you can</span> <span data-start="1832.73" data-end="1834.61">actually control it you can actually</span> <span data-start="1834.61" data-end="1838.37">control signal framing and I hope</span> <span data-start="1838.37" data-end="1839.84">you can see some implementations soon i</span> <span data-start="1839.84" data-end="1842.05">know there's tickets already and then</span> <span data-start="1842.05" data-end="1845.75">hopefully something is coming up so</span> <span data-start="1845.75" data-end="1848.21">that's it i think i'm right on time</span> <span data-start="1848.21"
