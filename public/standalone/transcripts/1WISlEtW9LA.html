<p><span data-start="31.949" data-end="34.32">I have studied computer science where I</span> <span data-start="34.32" data-end="37.41">learned Java and a little bit JavaScript</span> <span data-start="37.41" data-end="39.21">and objective oriented programming</span> <span data-start="39.21" data-end="42.059">paradigm and it was fine back then but</span> <span data-start="42.059" data-end="44.1">when I started to work in real</span> <span data-start="44.1" data-end="47.34">application that solve business problems</span> <span data-start="47.34" data-end="50.7">I barely see the same techniques I</span> <span data-start="50.7" data-end="53.789">learned back at university also I don't</span> <span data-start="53.789" data-end="56.61">know for you guys but for me debugging</span> <span data-start="56.61" data-end="61.1">code in JavaScript it's very hard so</span> <span data-start="61.1" data-end="64.949">today we live in a world where if you</span> <span data-start="64.949" data-end="67.049">want to learn new skills it's very easy</span> <span data-start="67.049" data-end="70.229">you don't need to wait for universities</span> <span data-start="70.229" data-end="72.689">and all those long processes you just</span> <span data-start="72.689" data-end="73.619">start right away</span> <span data-start="73.619" data-end="75.9">pick your computer and then start</span> <span data-start="75.9" data-end="78.77">reading about what you want to learn and</span> <span data-start="78.77" data-end="81.54">here I would like to point out something</span> <span data-start="81.54" data-end="84.75">that this way of learning it is cool but</span> <span data-start="84.75" data-end="87.299">has a side effect in it sometimes I</span> <span data-start="87.299" data-end="89.61">believe developers are very creative</span> <span data-start="89.61" data-end="93.09">human being but sometimes they create</span> <span data-start="93.09" data-end="95.67">some stereotypes like half PHP it's a</span> <span data-start="95.67" data-end="99.59">lazy language and JavaScript has heart</span> <span data-start="99.59" data-end="103.11">magic and those stereotypes are fine for</span> <span data-start="103.11" data-end="105.57">people who are very experienced but for</span> <span data-start="105.57" data-end="109.32">me as a junior who just started to code</span> <span data-start="109.32" data-end="111.659">it is very hard to understand what do</span> <span data-start="111.659" data-end="115.35">they mean and all those why I can find</span> <span data-start="115.35" data-end="119.159">an answer so that's was the reason that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="119.159" data-end="120.81">I started to learn functional</span> <span data-start="120.81" data-end="123.78">programming because I thought it is cool</span> <span data-start="123.78" data-end="127.619">and first I started with to answer the</span> <span data-start="127.619" data-end="130.04">question what is functional program</span> <span data-start="130.04" data-end="134.05">actually I find it very hard to give a</span> <span data-start="134.05" data-end="136.61">definition like what is functional</span> <span data-start="136.61" data-end="138.68">programming the one I read on the</span> <span data-start="138.68" data-end="141.83">internet it's kind of boring and hard to</span> <span data-start="141.83" data-end="145.16">memorize so I decided to tell you first</span> <span data-start="145.16" data-end="148.19">the characteristics and let's see if I</span> <span data-start="148.19" data-end="151.19">will manage to give you a summarize what</span> <span data-start="151.19" data-end="153.52">I understand functional programming is</span> <span data-start="153.52" data-end="157.55">so functional programming it is a</span> <span data-start="157.55" data-end="160.49">programming paradigm let me explain to</span> <span data-start="160.49" data-end="162.38">you what I understand and I think of a</span> <span data-start="162.38" data-end="165.5">paradigm for me a paradigm it is kind of</span> <span data-start="165.5" data-end="168.11">a world view a way how we look at the</span> <span data-start="168.11" data-end="170.78">world in terms of how the world is</span> <span data-start="170.78" data-end="173.81">composed to like what elements and how</span> <span data-start="173.81" data-end="175.58">does elements interact with each other</span> <span data-start="175.58" data-end="177.68">so if we say what is functional</span> <span data-start="177.68" data-end="179.21">programming I would say it's a code</span> <span data-start="179.21" data-end="182.12">style like we look how those what</span> <span data-start="182.12" data-end="184.76">elements it contains and Hamas and and</span> <span data-start="184.76" data-end="186.92">them interact with each other so to</span> <span data-start="186.92" data-end="190.76">explain this I will try to talk about</span> <span data-start="190.76" data-end="193.42">other programming paradigms like</span> <span data-start="193.42" data-end="196.55">imperative codes so an imperative code</span> <span data-start="196.55" data-end="198.98">we write codes out of commands like</span> <span data-start="198.98" data-end="200.78">because we instruct the code line by</span> <span data-start="200.78" data-end="203.3">line like now do this and then do that</span> <span data-start="203.3" data-end="205.43">and after that do that and after do that</span> <span data-start="205.43" data-end="209.69">and as we see time here is an important</span> <span data-start="209.69" data-end="211.76">concept in imperative programming and</span> <span data-start="211.76" data-end="214.34">with that comes an idea of values</span> <span data-start="214.34" data-end="217.459">changing over the time which is called</span> <span data-start="217.459" data-end="221.27">state another characteristic of function</span> <span data-start="221.27" data-end="225.02">of imperative programming it is that for</span> <span data-start="225.02" data-end="227.209">the same input we don't always get the</span> <span data-start="227.209" data-end="230.33">same output from the other side that</span> <span data-start="230.33" data-end="232.31">this object oriented programming which</span> <span data-start="232.31" data-end="234.5">says that imperative programming it's</span> <span data-start="234.5" data-end="237.29">cool but what if our programs get</span> <span data-start="237.29" data-end="242.72">complicated and the valve manage that</span> <span data-start="242.72" data-end="244.7">state in those days are changing over</span> <span data-start="244.7" data-end="247.76">the time it is very hard so what if we</span> <span data-start="247.76" data-end="250.91">pack those data in some little units</span> <span data-start="250.91" data-end="253.37">call them object and the way how they</span> <span data-start="253.37" data-end="255.14">talk and interact or each other each</span> <span data-start="255.14" data-end="257.139">byte is it is by standing mesh</span> <span data-start="257.139" data-end="259.629">back and forth which is essentially what</span> <span data-start="259.629" data-end="262.12">we do when we call the methods and</span> <span data-start="262.12" data-end="264.819">objects one object method called the</span> <span data-start="264.819" data-end="267.819">method of another object the opposite of</span> <span data-start="267.819" data-end="269.979">imperative programming it is declarative</span> <span data-start="269.979" data-end="272.469">programming if imperative programming</span> <span data-start="272.469" data-end="275.08">was the program growth out of comments</span> <span data-start="275.08" data-end="277.389">inverting declarative programming it is</span> <span data-start="277.389" data-end="279.699">built out of expression so it's like</span> <span data-start="279.699" data-end="282.25">that's what I want I don't care how you</span> <span data-start="282.25" data-end="285.33">deliver it to me but that's what I want</span> <span data-start="285.33" data-end="288.849">so what fight what is functional</span> <span data-start="288.849" data-end="290.949">programming then so a functional</span> <span data-start="290.949" data-end="293.71">programming it is a paradigm where we</span> <span data-start="293.71" data-end="295.84">express everything with functions and</span> <span data-start="295.84" data-end="298.09">the way how they lament interact with</span> <span data-start="298.09" data-end="300.599">each other is by giving input and</span> <span data-start="300.599" data-end="306.099">transferring them into an output and how</span> <span data-start="306.099" data-end="309.009">we do that it is by using pure functions</span> <span data-start="309.009" data-end="311.919">what is a pure function a pure function</span> <span data-start="311.919" data-end="314.62">it is a function that for the same input</span> <span data-start="314.62" data-end="318.009">gets always the same output without side</span> <span data-start="318.009" data-end="321.87">effects let me explain this also</span> <span data-start="321.87" data-end="324.219">functional programming I would say it's</span> <span data-start="324.219" data-end="326.83">kind of a sub paradigm of declarative</span> <span data-start="326.83" data-end="329.349">programming so I would explain this with</span> <span data-start="329.349" data-end="330.339">an example</span> <span data-start="330.339" data-end="333.279">let's say we have a function which takes</span> <span data-start="333.279" data-end="335.71">as argument an array and you return a</span> <span data-start="335.71" data-end="338.139">new function with the double values of</span> <span data-start="338.139" data-end="340.479">the old array the code like looks like</span> <span data-start="340.479" data-end="342.49">this in declarative style which is</span> <span data-start="342.49" data-end="344.71">basically functional programming if we</span> <span data-start="344.71" data-end="347.5">want to do the to solve the same problem</span> <span data-start="347.5" data-end="350.8">in imperative code we have to do we have</span> <span data-start="350.8" data-end="353.199">to declare function which is called Dabu</span> <span data-start="353.199" data-end="355.15">age and then takes an array we have to</span> <span data-start="355.15" data-end="357.43">initialize a new array and then with the</span> <span data-start="357.43" data-end="359.919">help of a for loop we push the other</span> <span data-start="359.919" data-end="362.919">values and as you see the code this line</span> <span data-start="362.919" data-end="366.669">by line and also we use those old</span> <span data-start="366.669" data-end="370.12">methods or methyls I you I learned in</span> <span data-start="370.12" data-end="373.419">the data structure subject like four and</span> <span data-start="373.419" data-end="375.039">four and this is the good thing about</span> <span data-start="375.039" data-end="377.139">functional programming we will never</span> <span data-start="377.139" data-end="379.87">have to write a for loop or a push I</span> <span data-start="379.87" data-end="384.8">have never seen this at least and my job</span> <span data-start="384.81" data-end="388.16">actually when I think of an application</span> <span data-start="388.16" data-end="390.05">usually I have in mind like without</span> <span data-start="390.05" data-end="392.81">considering the UI part I have in mind a</span> <span data-start="392.81" data-end="395.09">list of data that we have to render in</span> <span data-start="395.09" data-end="397.76">the screen and those data can be mutable</span> <span data-start="397.76" data-end="400.79">and immutable immutable data can change</span> <span data-start="400.79" data-end="402.8">after the creation and immutable data</span> <span data-start="402.8" data-end="405.35">cannot change after the creation let me</span> <span data-start="405.35" data-end="409.31">explain this let's say we have an object</span> <span data-start="409.31" data-end="413.3">called a and it has a property fo and</span> <span data-start="413.3" data-end="416.15">which has a value bar and then we assign</span> <span data-start="416.15" data-end="419.36">the we have a new variable a which we</span> <span data-start="419.36" data-end="422.89">assign it to B and then once we want to</span> <span data-start="422.89" data-end="426.32">portion your value to the V and if we</span> <span data-start="426.32" data-end="430.46">console.log V we will see that a and V</span> <span data-start="430.46" data-end="432.71">are equal because we are not doing</span> <span data-start="432.71" data-end="434.99">anything else we assign those objects to</span> </p>
