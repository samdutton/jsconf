<p><span data-start="23.17" data-end="32.07">Hi, guys, my name is Olga,i'm UX the designer at AWS, this is my colleague Thomas, we create</span> <span data-start="32.07" data-end="39.199">the team responsible for making developer enslavers easier. We did that beginning last</span> <span data-start="39.199" data-end="44.97">year, this year, sorry, last year for me, no, this year and we want to tell you what</span> <span data-start="44.97" data-end="49.75">we learned along the way in the last couple of months and we want to talk about the first</span> <span data-start="49.75" data-end="58.4">project we actually did in AWS, and I will start by explaining why there's a big challenge</span> <span data-start="58.4" data-end="64.19">to create user interfaces on a large scale. So, you probably kind of have used some of</span> <span data-start="64.19" data-end="69.96">our services before, they're pretty massi, but there's also a\h‑‑ massive, there's</span> <span data-start="69.96" data-end="76.64">creative aspecting in creating use erspaces. After that, Olga will continue with the Web</span> <span data-start="76.64" data-end="84.56">Components part of the talk, why that failed, and what we did instead. Let me start with</span> <span data-start="84.56" data-end="93.109">talking about Amazon web services, we, as an organization, are splitted into very small</span> <span data-start="93.109" data-end="98.039">different independent teams, and each team can work independently of each other. And</span> <span data-start="98.039" data-end="104.759">the purpose of each team is to create a service for our customers or for other teams internally.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="104.759" data-end="113.009">And the challenge there is how all of these build their products, and we don't have any</span> <span data-start="113.009" data-end="118.939">speaker notes. But, there's also an upside to kind of the structure, so there's a couple</span> <span data-start="118.939" data-end="124.38">of different things that make us stick to this operational structure, which is kind</span> <span data-start="124.38" data-end="129.429">of each team can inindependently decide on what they do and what technologies they use</span> <span data-start="129.429" data-end="138.61">to solve that problem. And\h‑‑ sorry, we're having technical difficulties here.</span> <span data-start="138.61" data-end="140.86">If you already would see the next slide, I can continue probably.</span> <span data-start="140.86" data-end="143.99">Sorry. Now, that's the speaker notes, that's cheating,</span> <span data-start="143.99" data-end="149.95">don't read this. (Laughing). There we go. All right. So, the next slide.</span> <span data-start="149.95" data-end="157.73">Awesome. Kind of we measure the success, for example also in our output, last year, not</span> <span data-start="157.73" data-end="164.93">sure if you're following what we're doing, last year we launched 516 larger interface</span> <span data-start="164.93" data-end="171.7">features or port features, or even completely new services that kind of comes down to one</span> <span data-start="171.7" data-end="180.64">and half large deployment store interface, which you might have seen. I'm not talking</span> <span data-start="180.64" data-end="185.67">about all the other small deployments we're doing, if you follow other talks or seen other</span> <span data-start="185.67" data-end="189.959">talks, like, just the amount of deployments we do every day is just blind blowing, just</span> <span data-start="189.959" data-end="194.75">don't really get how you do that. Part of the organizational structure where you have</span> <span data-start="194.75" data-end="199.689">all these tiny dependent teams can decide on the technology completely the frameworks</span> <span data-start="199.689" data-end="205.079">whatever they want to use to be most effective. The thing is thatment cos with a challenge,</span> <span data-start="205.079" data-end="210.25">like most large companies we have a design, but we don't have a design guide on one team</span> <span data-start="210.25" data-end="227.819">implementing, we have a ton of different teams trying to implement 
the design guide. We talked about that\h‑‑</span> <span data-start="227.819" data-end="235.03">like not all designers understand how time me meant that, not everyone that implements</span> <span data-start="235.03" data-end="241.709">understand designs, that's actual live examples, we thought, we have to do something about</span> <span data-start="241.709" data-end="251.129">that, and the first project we're creating, designer as code, and I wanted to improve</span> <span data-start="251.129" data-end="256.22">on that, the idea was to build something in code that was always in line with design guides</span> <span data-start="256.22" data-end="264.15">and works across all different frameworks, our reality is they use GOT\h‑‑ whatever,</span> <span data-start="264.15" data-end="268.59">they pick their tools, and it needs to be easy to integrate on whatever's being used</span> <span data-start="268.59" data-end="276.94">inindependent of the teams are using. This is how we started our first experiment.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="276.94" data-end="282.95">Okay, so when you think about these requirements what comes to your mind immediately is, Ooohh</span> <span data-start="282.95" data-end="290.66">we're going to use web components, Web Components are a series of technology, Shadow DOM, HTML</span> <span data-start="290.66" data-end="298.33">imports and templates you can think of them as reusable interface widgets that are encapsulated</span> <span data-start="298.33" data-end="303.04">and basically reusable, so this is what we would like to use, the two most interesting</span> <span data-start="303.04" data-end="308.75">technologies that are part of Web Components is for Shadow DOM and Custom Elements, this</span> <span data-start="308.75" data-end="313.2">is exactly what we would like to use when building our components, this basically solves</span> <span data-start="313.2" data-end="319.33">our problem. So what is Shadow DOM? Shadow DOM offers encapsulation of CSS templates</span> <span data-start="319.33" data-end="325.29">and JavaScript in a download, this is pretty cool. Now we have custom Elements, which basically</span> <span data-start="325.29" data-end="334.51">allow you to create your own HTML tags, so, looking at the custom Elements, what can you</span> <span data-start="334.51" data-end="341.5">do with them? So basically you can say, instead of a select you can create an AWS UI select</span> <span data-start="341.5" data-end="346.47">and that select can behave in a completely different way. I side that select, you can</span> <span data-start="346.47" data-end="350.35">have, instead of normal options that behave and look in a given way, you can have AWS</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="350.35" data-end="357.09">U I options that is pretty cool. You might think, okay, why did we actually need those</span> <span data-start="357.09" data-end="363.96">Custom Elements, it was already possible beforehand to add your own custom tags to HTML and your</span> <span data-start="363.96" data-end="368.78">browser would render them and they would behave in a given way and you would be able to style</span> <span data-start="368.78" data-end="375.06">them even (AWSUI) the real cool thing about using Custom Elements, by using them you get</span> <span data-start="375.06" data-end="381.06">life cycle call backs. That are they, actually life cycle call backs notify you when something</span> <span data-start="381.06" data-end="386.06">happens to your Element. When you Element is created you get a created call back, when</span> <span data-start="386.06" data-end="390.46">you Element is added to the together, you get an attached call back, and at that point</span> <span data-start="390.46" data-end="395">you might want to add event listeners, notify the Element's parent that the Element has</span> <span data-start="395" data-end="400.52">been created and so on. Also, same thing happens when you remove your Element from view, you</span> <span data-start="400.52" data-end="405.27">get a detach call back, you might handle garage collection at this point, you might want to</span> <span data-start="405.27" data-end="410.68">memory management, you night want to remove the event handlers that you created. It's</span> <span data-start="410.68" data-end="416.4">all cool. And this actually you get only when you use Custom Elements, what happens when</span> <span data-start="416.4" data-end="422.27">you register an Element in the browser is that it uses the HTML Element interface instead</span> <span data-start="422.27" data-end="428.11">of using the HTML unknown Element interface when you actually don't use Custom Elements,</span> <span data-start="428.11" data-end="436.71">so this is what makes it so cool. We look at browser\h‑‑ Shadow DOM and Elements</span> <span data-start="436.71" data-end="444.46">are support in the Chrome, we can see that the standard is just not there yet. So what</span> <span data-start="444.46" data-end="449.66">we tried doings was using polyfills to basically back fill the missing browser function faulty,</span> <span data-start="449.66" data-end="456.27">you probably know web component JS polyfill for all technologies that are under Web Components,</span> <span data-start="456.27" data-end="461.11">if you tonight want the use a full polyfill, you can use a smaller one, so we chose to</span> <span data-start="461.11" data-end="467.69">use document register Elements as a polyfill for Custom Elements. Those polyfills are really</span> <span data-start="467.69" data-end="472.84">good, I mean they work great, but mostly when they're used as a mainframe work in your application,</span> <span data-start="472.84" data-end="478.09">if you tray using them with different frameworks, in our case we tried using them with Angular,</span> <span data-start="478.09" data-end="485.94">you run into all sorts of problems with those polyfills. So what are those problems? Basically</span> <span data-start="485.94" data-end="494.92">all polyfills use mow take observers check that has been change in the your component.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="494.92" data-end="504.26">How it works in practice is if your component changes you want to be notified. It doesn't</span> <span data-start="504.26" data-end="518.44">just observe components it observes the whole DOM. This has an impact on performance. ‑‑ you'll</span> <span data-start="518.44" data-end="523.82">get notified about it, but maybe a bit later, once you call a function you get notified</span> <span data-start="523.82" data-end="528.899">immediately, it works a little bit difficultly and can cause a lot of problems when using</span> <span data-start="528.899" data-end="534.16">that together with frameworks that rely on certain things being done at certain points.</span> <span data-start="534.16" data-end="540.959">Also, the implementation doviers per browser, so not all browsers support mutation observers,</span> <span data-start="540.959" data-end="546.069">some of them support an older technology that's called mutation events, and those mutation</span> <span data-start="546.069" data-end="552.5">events work synchronously, not only do we have to care about if you do the native thing</span> <span data-start="552.5" data-end="557.819">or if we use mutation observers, but also about the version of the browser that we're</span> <span data-start="557.819" data-end="564.779">actually using because we might end up using something completely different. So to summarize,</span> <span data-start="564.779" data-end="569.339">web components are not there yet, we can't use them to solve our problems, we were also</span> <span data-start="569.339" data-end="574.939">unable to use the polyfills because they didn'tplay play nasally with the frameworks we were using.</span> <span data-start="574.939" data-end="579.629">What we found out is the concept they're using in Web Components are really good concepts</span> <span data-start="579.629" data-end="586.629">we started looking into actually using those concepts to build our own Custom Elements.</span> <span data-start="586.629" data-end="594.85">And this is how our second experiment started. . So let's build a component together. This</span> <span data-start="594.85" data-end="601.87">is a native AWSUI alert, you see them quite often, notify your user about something in</span> <span data-start="601.87" data-end="606.019">your application, in terms of the verbals, this is how we could the\h‑‑ of the verbals</span> <span data-start="606.019" data-end="611.329">we can use them for alert, this is what our design guide says an alert should look like.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="611.329" data-end="616.86">Let's build an alert, the first thing we need to do is create the Elements, but we would</span> <span data-start="616.86" data-end="621.74">like to be able to use exactly in the same way as we would use a Custom Element, so we</span> <span data-start="621.74" data-end="629.37">would like to get life cycle call backs. So what we need to do fist is\h‑‑ el, append</span> <span data-start="629.37" data-end="633.97">that Element to the body, because we don't have Element\h‑‑ have to call has been</span> <span data-start="633.97" data-end="643.73">attached. At the end we only get a download, so we get\h‑‑ something to this. That's</span> <span data-start="643.73" data-end="649.06">cool, now we would like to be able to interact with our components somehow, we would like</span> <span data-start="649.06" data-end="655.43">to maybe be able to change how it looks and how it behaves. So for that we have to find</span> <span data-start="655.43" data-end="660.12">two properties, we have a type and dismissible, the type defines the nature of the order to</span> <span data-start="660.12" data-end="666.899">be displayed, success, info, warning, that ever we want, dismissible if you set it, it</span> <span data-start="666.899" data-end="671.66">shows a little controller in the UI that allows the user to dismiss the alert. Let's have</span> <span data-start="671.66" data-end="678.379">a look at actually interacting with the components, let's say we don't want to have an info alert,</span> <span data-start="678.379" data-end="683.43">instead of blue box, we would like it to be red. Let's say it's report .</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="683.43" data-end="688.47">So the component changed the component to red, from blue, so we can see\h‑‑ we can</span> <span data-start="688.47" data-end="694.019">say we have an error alert, what if we want to make it dismissible, we say alert.dismissible</span> <span data-start="694.019" data-end="705.269">is true. There we go it gets the little icon, so now the user can dismiss our alert: Speaking</span> <span data-start="705.269" data-end="711.149">of interacting with components, actually, maybe in our UI you would like to be able</span> <span data-start="711.149" data-end="717.56">to dismiss the alerts, if a user clicks an acknowledge button, let's say, we would like</span> <span data-start="717.56" data-end="723.91">to be able to do something similar to this. So for that, we have defined a dismiss function</span> <span data-start="723.91" data-end="733.589">that basically removes the alert from view once the user clicks it. But in, like it's</span> <span data-start="733.589" data-end="738.98">also super cool, right, it works, but, you would like to be able not only to pass properties</span> <span data-start="738.98" data-end="746.23">and strings, but maybe also be able to pass an HTML to elder right. Maybe you want to</span> <span data-start="746.23" data-end="754.73">say, I want to set the header and say is header is rocks. And the content of your alert might</span> <span data-start="754.73" data-end="766.199">be something using HTML so I'm going to say it minerals involved. How did we do it? We</span> <span data-start="766.199" data-end="772.529">added support for regions, what the regions do is basically instead of just taking' string</span> <span data-start="772.529" data-end="777.559">they take a whole download and render the down hold as is. So thanks to that you can</span> <span data-start="777.559" data-end="789.699">actually enter HTML to work components. Then, obviously, maybe you would like to get notified</span> <span data-start="789.699" data-end="794.459">if something happens to your alert, so when the user dismisses it, maybe you would like</span> <span data-start="794.459" data-end="799.629">to know about it, maybe to store it somewhere as a preference that a certain user has dismissed</span> <span data-start="799.629" data-end="804.689">this type of alert, to never show it again, or maybe if somebody clicks a button you would</span> <span data-start="804.689" data-end="812.199">also like to notify, be notified about that. So we\h‑‑ you can basically add event</span> <span data-start="812.199" data-end="818.149">listeners to our Elements this is pretty easy, so let me demo that, so let's say if a user</span> <span data-start="818.149" data-end="822.42">dismisses this alert, we would like to see the browser native alert on the screen and</span> <span data-start="822.42" data-end="829.189">it should say, Ooops, so, exactly what the function says, okay, that worked. So you can</span> <span data-start="829.189" data-end="834.399">interact with our Element\h‑‑ with our components. So, to summarize, we have a complete</span> <span data-start="834.399" data-end="839.22">component now, we deal with the life cycle, we create the Elements, we append it to the</span> <span data-start="839.22" data-end="845.559">body, we call the life cycle call back, then we set the type of alert, maybe we say success,</span> <span data-start="845.559" data-end="850.54">maybe the alert is dismissible if we want the users to dismiss the alert, then we say</span> <span data-start="850.54" data-end="856.8">regions, pass in him that. Him set the header and then we add some eventers to our Elements</span> <span data-start="856.8" data-end="864.089">(HTML) how do we make sure that the component is being rendered on the page? So for that,</span> <span data-start="864.089" data-end="872.749">we use Reactive DOM rendering, so, looking at our alert, let's say it\h‑‑ would like</span> <span data-start="872.749" data-end="877.17">to\h‑‑ it has some content in it, right, but we would like to also be able to set the</span> <span data-start="877.17" data-end="882.22">header, but we don't want to render the header if it's not there. So, what we want to do</span> <span data-start="882.22" data-end="887.019">is, if the user sets a header, in our alert, we would like to render an icon, we would</span> <span data-start="887.019" data-end="893.889">like to show the header text, right? Let me download exactly what we would like to do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="893.889" data-end="903.329">So as you can see in the demo, the icon class and the header appeared only after I have'ded</span> <span data-start="903.329" data-end="908.949">the header, let me remove it and try it again. This is cool, we only ma nip late the Element</span> <span data-start="908.949" data-end="913.11">when it's actually\h‑‑ manipulate the Element when it's actually needed. We insert</span> <span data-start="913.11" data-end="920.55">those things when they're not\h‑‑ we don't insert the things when they're not needed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="920.55" data-end="925.369">It also needed styles, it has to look in a certain way, what we know about our users</span> <span data-start="925.369" data-end="931.93">is they're not going to rebuild their whole applications from scratch, the if they want</span> <span data-start="931.93" data-end="936.339">to use their components, they won't build a whole new thing, we have to integrate with</span> <span data-start="936.339" data-end="941.85">their existing code. What it means for us is that that we can't break people with our</span> <span data-start="941.85" data-end="948.449">components, if they want to use our components, we can't bring their code and introduce some</span> <span data-start="948.449" data-end="953.899">weird behaviors, what it also means for us is that people are going to have styles that</span> <span data-start="953.899" data-end="958.929">might link into our components, that might break our components, so how did we deal with</span> <span data-start="958.929" data-end="964.139">this? So basically we have two rules, one rule is if you want to use our component you</span> <span data-start="964.139" data-end="970.759">need to guess it in a <div> or Element, basically in your application that use AWSUI class,</span> <span data-start="970.759" data-end="976.999">so that way you can use your Element quite safely because if there is a place in your</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="976.999" data-end="981.709">App that is obviously broken, if you either Element or\h‑‑ anotherrer an Element or</span> <span data-start="981.709" data-end="987.879">style, this wouldn't happen. One thing is using our Elements in a given scope. The second</span> <span data-start="987.879" data-end="993.529">thing we, do and you can see that here is that, for example, let's say, you use an icon</span> <span data-start="993.529" data-end="1001.569">class in your CSS, and obviously that icon class has some style tied to it. What we don't</span> <span data-start="1001.569" data-end="1006.47">want to do is we don't want to break your icon class, so if we add our own styles, we</span> <span data-start="1006.47" data-end="1011.759">tonight want the break the code for you, so what we the in the component, in this case</span> <span data-start="1011.759" data-end="1017.309">it's an alert, we free fission all class name in the component with the name of the component,</span> <span data-start="1017.309" data-end="1020.899">that way we can make sure that felon of our styles actually leek out of the component</span> <span data-start="1020.899" data-end="1028.429">and we don't break your code. So, looking at the component, again, this is what you</span> <span data-start="1028.429" data-end="1032.3">would have to write in order to use our component, you would have to create the Element, append</span> <span data-start="1032.3" data-end="1038.809">to the body and then code has been attacheds so on and so on. While this works, I wouldn't</span> <span data-start="1038.809" data-end="1042.24">call it super easy to use, I wouldn't want to use that, but asan Angular developer or</span> <span data-start="1042.24" data-end="1046.809">something you\h‑‑ as an Angular developer you would want to write something like this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1046.809" data-end="1055.45">I would love to use this instead of the thing on the top, it's so much easier we created</span> <span data-start="1055.45" data-end="1061.51">frame word wrappers, what are these wrappers, they allow to be able to use the component</span> <span data-start="1061.51" data-end="1067.45">natively in any framework, because the life cycle management is complicated you tonight</span> <span data-start="1067.45" data-end="1071.65">want to do it manually, you don't want to call has been attached or detached when you</span> <span data-start="1071.65" data-end="1078.77">delete the component, what happens is the wrapper code gets like take cares of that</span> <span data-start="1078.77" data-end="1085.61">logic. What we currently have is an Angular GWT, and we're planning on adding more wrappers</span> <span data-start="1085.61" data-end="1092.53">like for React and also for Web Components. How much overmade is that? How much work do</span> <span data-start="1092.53" data-end="1096.62">I need to do to add this wrapper? Well those wrappers are actually quite small and compact,</span> <span data-start="1096.62" data-end="1101.73">it's only a couple hundred of lines of codes for every wrapper, it adds the support to</span> <span data-start="1101.73" data-end="1110.42">use the component natively. Wrappers are not done manually, so they're actually generated</span> <span data-start="1110.42" data-end="1116.41">automatically out of the component code. So how do we do that? Component has an official</span> <span data-start="1116.41" data-end="1122.8">description, that description we call a component definition in the component definition, we</span> <span data-start="1122.8" data-end="1127.7">talk about all the properties, functions, events and regions 245 a single component</span> <span data-start="1127.7" data-end="1133.58">has, and we also add some useful typing information. So for example if you haven't defined the</span> <span data-start="1133.58" data-end="1138.73">property and this prop is required, you'd gel warned about it, it's not that it will</span> <span data-start="1138.73" data-end="1144.65">fail silently and you wouldn't know. These component definitions they're used to generate</span> <span data-start="1144.65" data-end="1150.2">the framework wrappers, we can do more with the component definitions, we use them to</span> <span data-start="1150.2" data-end="1158.14">generate documentation for every component as well as generate tests. So now to evaluate</span> <span data-start="1158.14" data-end="1165.18">our experiments has it been successful? Do we think that designers code has worked for</span> <span data-start="1165.18" data-end="1173.83">us? We think it has, so, since I think July\h29th, teams have been using our components in production</span> <span data-start="1173.83" data-end="1179.12">and they're actually liking our components, there's an actual quote from a developer,</span> <span data-start="1179.12" data-end="1183.01">the person claimed we have helped their team to write recodeble\h‑‑ reusable code and</span> <span data-start="1183.01" data-end="1191.57">style, they're now also one hundred percent compatible with the AWS design guide. What</span> <span data-start="1191.57" data-end="1198.63">you can see is the graph that shows interaction of customers with our components you can see</span> <span data-start="1198.63" data-end="1205.41">the tendency is growing, that looks pretty good to me. But, we're not going to stop here,</span> <span data-start="1205.41" data-end="1212.53">so, yeah, we're not going to stop here, saying thank you, but it's not a thank you yet. We</span> <span data-start="1212.53" data-end="1218.01">have a lot more frameworks to support and a lot more components to add. And, actually</span> <span data-start="1218.01" data-end="1223.09">we're hoping you'll be able to give us also feedback on the components, and that you'll</span> <span data-start="1223.09" data-end="1229.12">be able to use the components very soon because we're planning to Open Source them. If you</span> <span data-start="1229.12" data-end="1233.44">have any questions, we'd\h‑‑ or would like to talk to us about the components, please</span> <span data-start="1233.44" data-end="1239.06">do, we're available during the breaks and also later tonight. And, Thomas is showing</span> <span data-start="1239.06" data-end="1245.87">the little chocolate guy, so the Orange dude, try to look for the Orange dude during the</span> </p>
