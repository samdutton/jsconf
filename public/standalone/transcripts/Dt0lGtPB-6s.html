<p><span data-start="7.37" data-end="12.96">well welcome to my attraction spell so</span> <span data-start="12.96" data-end="14.94">I'm just going to talk kind of briefly</span> <span data-start="14.94" data-end="17.16">about the divide we have between the</span> <span data-start="17.16" data-end="19.23">back end and the front ends and how we</span> <span data-start="19.23" data-end="20.61">can try to bridge that with some of our</span> <span data-start="20.61" data-end="23.88">current tooling so Jonathan Martin I</span> <span data-start="23.88" data-end="25.86">work at the big nerd ranch in our front</span> <span data-start="25.86" data-end="27.69">end and rails development team at each</span> <span data-start="27.69" data-end="29.58">our front-end course so if you happen to</span> <span data-start="29.58" data-end="31.44">be in that lanta area she couldn't check</span> <span data-start="31.44" data-end="33.6">us out you can also follow me on twitter</span> <span data-start="33.6" data-end="37.89">at nibbler so i'm going to talk about</span> <span data-start="37.89" data-end="40.11">something we deal with every day that is</span> <span data-start="40.11" data-end="42.78">people and specifically as front-end</span> <span data-start="42.78" data-end="45.87">developers we deal with back-end people</span> <span data-start="45.87" data-end="49.17">so that's great but very often they're a</span> <span data-start="49.17" data-end="50.67">little bit too irrational for our taste</span> <span data-start="50.67" data-end="52.829">because we have a very specific workflow</span> <span data-start="52.829" data-end="56.34">of how we like to work so when we have</span> <span data-start="56.34" data-end="58.2">to work on a full step team kind of</span> <span data-start="58.2" data-end="59.91">environment we have to pick some</span> <span data-start="59.91" data-end="61.35">different strategies for how we're going</span> <span data-start="61.35" data-end="64.17">to cope with our backend friends the</span> <span data-start="64.17" data-end="65.489">first strategy we could pick as we could</span> <span data-start="65.489" data-end="67.409">just try to survive through it and</span> <span data-start="67.409" data-end="70.26">typically that means anytime we need to</span> <span data-start="70.26" data-end="72.99">do some PRS or something one developer</span> <span data-start="72.99" data-end="75.12">on it keep them separated don't let them</span> <span data-start="75.12" data-end="77.04">get anywhere near each other kind of</span> <span data-start="77.04" data-end="79.049">like matter and antimatter reacting so</span> <span data-start="79.049" data-end="80.85">that collaboration strategy of steer</span> <span data-start="80.85" data-end="82.89">clear it's pretty much what most people</span> <span data-start="82.89" data-end="85.59">go with when it comes to tooling</span> <span data-start="85.59" data-end="87.39">deciding what tools to pick if you're</span> <span data-start="87.39" data-end="89.01">going to collaborate with rails in front</span> <span data-start="89.01" data-end="90.96">end it's typically whoever got to the</span> <span data-start="90.96" data-end="94.08">code base first and this is something</span> <span data-start="94.08" data-end="95.85">that's very common and typically makes</span> <span data-start="95.85" data-end="99.26">up the bulk of front-end back-end teams</span> <span data-start="99.26" data-end="102.39">so the solution we want is we want to be</span> <span data-start="102.39" data-end="104.4">able to thrive we want to be able to</span> <span data-start="104.4" data-end="105.6">take our front-end and back-end and make</span> <span data-start="105.6" data-end="107.22">them thrive together like an Oreo I</span> <span data-start="107.22" data-end="109.11">talked about an Oreo just because we all</span> <span data-start="109.11" data-end="110.64">know that the cookie part of an Oreo is</span> <span data-start="110.64" data-end="113.13">just the presentation and the sustaining</span> <span data-start="113.13" data-end="114.33">white stuff that's hidden or</span> <span data-start="114.33" data-end="117.39">encapsulated inside for the consumer is</span> <span data-start="117.39" data-end="119.58">the important part at least until the</span> <span data-start="119.58" data-end="120.93">cookie contents are requested by the</span> <span data-start="120.93" data-end="124.14">digestive tract so without a little</span> <span data-start="124.14" data-end="125.58">analogy we want to treat our back-end</span> <span data-start="125.58" data-end="128.569">fellow members like that Oreo cream so</span> <span data-start="128.569" data-end="131.249">too often we try too hard to mix</span> <span data-start="131.249" data-end="133.079">together the front end and back end and</span> <span data-start="133.079" data-end="134.4">try to get everyone on the</span> <span data-start="134.4" data-end="135.959">same level try to get them all educated</span> <span data-start="135.959" data-end="138.03">the same like an Oreo truffle we don't</span> <span data-start="138.03" data-end="140.099">want to do that we want to keep our</span> <span data-start="140.099" data-end="141.78">separation of concerns we want to keep</span> <span data-start="141.78" data-end="143.909">the people who are experts in the front</span> <span data-start="143.909" data-end="146.099">end and keep the experts your experts in</span> <span data-start="146.099" data-end="147.569">back end but we need to find a good way</span> <span data-start="147.569" data-end="150.51">to get us interoperating so the first</span> <span data-start="150.51" data-end="152.73">way we can try to do that is by trying</span> <span data-start="152.73" data-end="155.04">to keep the two completely separate have</span> <span data-start="155.04" data-end="157.2">an entirely separate repo for your front</span> <span data-start="157.2" data-end="159.48">end part of the appt kind of like an</span> <span data-start="159.48" data-end="161.549">iPhone clients the iphone client isn't</span> <span data-start="161.549" data-end="162.9">developed along with the server code</span> <span data-start="162.9" data-end="165.209">it's developed in isolation so you can</span> <span data-start="165.209" data-end="167.01">do the same thing just pretend that your</span> <span data-start="167.01" data-end="169.829">front end client is a client and have it</span> <span data-start="169.829" data-end="173.01">consumed the back end so that's one way</span> <span data-start="173.01" data-end="174.599">we can do it and this is a really great</span> <span data-start="174.599" data-end="176.609">strategy to take if we have the time and</span> <span data-start="176.609" data-end="178.889">resources to do it but unfortunately a</span> <span data-start="178.889" data-end="180.989">lot of times we don't have either if</span> <span data-start="180.989" data-end="182.939">you're in a hackathon of some sort this</span> <span data-start="182.939" data-end="184.5">especially comes up where you'd like to</span> <span data-start="184.5" data-end="186.959">split off the two but you have so little</span> <span data-start="186.959" data-end="188.31">time to begin with it you don't have</span> <span data-start="188.31" data-end="190.109">time to split off the to make the</span> <span data-start="190.109" data-end="192.72">separate repose configure all the CSRF</span> <span data-start="192.72" data-end="194.25">tokens and whatnot that come with a</span> <span data-start="194.25" data-end="196.92">rails based api so unfortunately that's</span> <span data-start="196.92" data-end="200.37">not always our leisure so there are some</span> <span data-start="200.37" data-end="202.23">strategies we can follow in some tooling</span> <span data-start="202.23" data-end="204.299">we can pick from the go to make sure</span> <span data-start="204.299" data-end="206.459">that the front-end developers don't go</span> <span data-start="206.459" data-end="208.139">insane working with back-end developers</span> <span data-start="208.139" data-end="211.56">and vice versa so thankfully we have</span> <span data-start="211.56" data-end="212.639">some people have already put the other</span> <span data-start="212.639" data-end="215.04">some really cool tools and we can rely</span> <span data-start="215.04" data-end="219.389">on their smarts to get started so one</span> <span data-start="219.389" data-end="221.22">strategy would be to just push through</span> <span data-start="221.22" data-end="223.5">this with a front-end developer just</span> <span data-start="223.5" data-end="225.419">make it work would be kind of our</span> <span data-start="225.419" data-end="228.269">ideology for doing that so here's one</span> <span data-start="228.269" data-end="229.68">approach to doing it tastes driven</span> <span data-start="229.68" data-end="231.72">development which means we're going to</span> <span data-start="231.72" data-end="233.94">test the two parts the front end in the</span> <span data-start="233.94" data-end="236.28">back end we're going to develop those</span> <span data-start="236.28" data-end="239.43">and test them in isolation and then come</span> <span data-start="239.43" data-end="241.139">back frequently with pairing and</span> <span data-start="241.139" data-end="247.26">deployment to do those together so when</span> <span data-start="247.26" data-end="248.609">we're working in the same git repo</span> <span data-start="248.609" data-end="249.989">because we've made the assumption that</span> <span data-start="249.989" data-end="251.79">we're going to develop our rails in</span> <span data-start="251.79" data-end="253.739">front end in the same repo we can take</span> <span data-start="253.739" data-end="257.37">one strategy where we educate the back</span> <span data-start="257.37" data-end="258.9">end developers in all the ways of the</span> <span data-start="258.9" data-end="260.43">front end and how to do those sorts of</span> <span data-start="260.43" data-end="262.349">things and how to name their CSS classes</span> <span data-start="262.349" data-end="265.289">and where to put their CSS so that's one</span> <span data-start="265.289" data-end="266.3">way</span> <span data-start="266.3" data-end="268.909">and that might work until we go to do</span> <span data-start="268.909" data-end="271.009">the reverse and try to tell the</span> <span data-start="271.009" data-end="272.99">front-end developers how they need to</span> <span data-start="272.99" data-end="274.639">code how they need to work with the</span> <span data-start="274.639" data-end="276.889">api's how they should organize your CSS</span> <span data-start="276.889" data-end="278.12">the best work with the rails asset</span> <span data-start="278.12" data-end="281.3">pipeline so after going through some of</span> <span data-start="281.3" data-end="283.58">that trauma we might be tempted to</span> <span data-start="283.58" data-end="286.97">instead d the don't share ideology where</span> <span data-start="286.97" data-end="289.159">we try to split our concerns completely</span> <span data-start="289.159" data-end="290.93">and give front-end developers their</span> <span data-start="290.93" data-end="293.69">domain of just the front end and tell</span> <span data-start="293.69" data-end="296.449">them follow rails conventions except we</span> <span data-start="296.449" data-end="298.069">can't follow rails conventions rails</span> <span data-start="298.069" data-end="299.599">unfortunately gives us poor front end</span> <span data-start="299.599" data-end="302.12">conventions on occasion so to prevent</span> <span data-start="302.12" data-end="304.31">insanity I'm going to go through just a</span> <span data-start="304.31" data-end="306.08">bucket list of some ways that we have</span> <span data-start="306.08" data-end="308.84">big nerd ranch have found make this a</span> <span data-start="308.84" data-end="310.58">little bit easier to work with between</span> <span data-start="310.58" data-end="314.15">the front end and back end so now I move</span> <span data-start="314.15" data-end="316.729">to just a live coding demo and let's see</span> <span data-start="316.729" data-end="323.159">if I can get the screens working here</span> <span data-start="323.169" data-end="325.789">alright so here i have an end result</span> <span data-start="325.789" data-end="328.479">this is just a project we did recently</span> <span data-start="328.479" data-end="331.849">for in internal hackathon but many of</span> <span data-start="331.849" data-end="333.919">you may recognize this as dashing which</span> <span data-start="333.919" data-end="337.009">is put out by shopify so as part of the</span> <span data-start="337.009" data-end="338.18">classroom project we wanted to use</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="338.18" data-end="340.31">Shopify but of course we took it upon</span> <span data-start="340.31" data-end="342.68">ourselves to rewrite it in ember because</span> <span data-start="342.68" data-end="344.779">none of us wanted to write Batman code</span> <span data-start="344.779" data-end="346.729">so in the process it made for a really</span> <span data-start="346.729" data-end="349.25">interesting experiment because we had to</span> <span data-start="349.25" data-end="352.49">back-end developers another back-end</span> <span data-start="352.49" data-end="355.099">developer who apparently wrote go and</span> <span data-start="355.099" data-end="357.8">one front-end developer and that</span> <span data-start="357.8" data-end="359.99">consistently changed through the period</span> <span data-start="359.99" data-end="361.94">of the hackathon because we had one jump</span> <span data-start="361.94" data-end="364.639">on and off from front end to back end so</span> <span data-start="364.639" data-end="366.08">it was an interesting consistency to</span> <span data-start="366.08" data-end="367.25">work with and we had to make sure</span> <span data-start="367.25" data-end="369.5">working at that fast pace that we didn't</span> <span data-start="369.5" data-end="373.52">get in each other's way so one of the</span> <span data-start="373.52" data-end="376.219">ways we did that was when we started out</span> <span data-start="376.219" data-end="378.59">with the rails app we wanted to make</span> <span data-start="378.59" data-end="381.259">sure that we had a conventional rails</span> <span data-start="381.259" data-end="383.87">app to be to begin with but when it came</span> <span data-start="383.87" data-end="386.33">to assets of any sort we wanted to let</span> <span data-start="386.33" data-end="389.33">the front-end team have their domain so</span> <span data-start="389.33" data-end="391.4">the first thing we did is we used Bauer</span> <span data-start="391.4" data-end="394.219">now Bauer obviously is for the front end</span> <span data-start="394.219" data-end="395.87">and must tool to make sure you aren't</span> <span data-start="395.87" data-end="397.82">just copy pasting scripts from off the</span> <span data-start="397.82" data-end="399.26">internet and putting it in your repo</span> <span data-start="399.26" data-end="402.14">so with rails we would typically pull in</span> <span data-start="402.14" data-end="404.42">some gems in the gem file if we wanted</span> <span data-start="404.42" data-end="406.16">to use backbone we might pull in that</span> <span data-start="406.16" data-end="408.13">helper Jim if we want to use underscore</span> <span data-start="408.13" data-end="410.66">bootstrap jQuery the list goes on and on</span> <span data-start="410.66" data-end="412.46">typically if you're developing rails</span> <span data-start="412.46" data-end="414.11">you're going to pull in a separate gem</span> <span data-start="414.11" data-end="416.36">but the problem is these gems are often</span> <span data-start="416.36" data-end="419.39">behind the bower version or whatever</span> <span data-start="419.39" data-end="421.61">version is on github it also doesn't</span> <span data-start="421.61" data-end="423.71">really handle assets very well gems are</span> <span data-start="423.71" data-end="425.78">meant for packaging Ruby code not so</span> <span data-start="425.78" data-end="427.66">much for packaging and managing assets</span> <span data-start="427.66" data-end="430.37">so what we'd like to do is pull Bauer</span> <span data-start="430.37" data-end="432.44">which gives us a really nice way of</span> <span data-start="432.44" data-end="435.05">specifying dependencies for front-end</span> <span data-start="435.05" data-end="436.76">developers and we'd like to be able to</span> <span data-start="436.76" data-end="440">use that in the asset pipeline so it's</span> <span data-start="440" data-end="441.71">actually not all that difficult to set</span> <span data-start="441.71" data-end="443.39">up but there are some kinks to work out</span> <span data-start="443.39" data-end="446.24">so first in our gem file we want to make</span> <span data-start="446.24" data-end="449.66">sure that we're using the bower rails</span> <span data-start="449.66" data-end="452.78">gym so Bauer rails is just a little gem</span> <span data-start="452.78" data-end="456.35">that can handle some of the asset</span> <span data-start="456.35" data-end="458.78">loading for us it also provides some</span> <span data-start="458.78" data-end="460.76">rake tasks but we actually don't want to</span> <span data-start="460.76" data-end="462.2">use the rake task because front-end</span> <span data-start="462.2" data-end="463.64">developers are going to want to use the</span> <span data-start="463.64" data-end="465.95">bower install command they don't want to</span> <span data-start="465.95"
