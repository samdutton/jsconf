data-start="959.23" data-end="961.81">things are and like you've got you've</span> <span data-start="961.81" data-end="964.27">got like CSS 1 & 2 are all really solid</span> <span data-start="964.27" data-end="966.13">and like CSS 3s may be right here</span> <span data-start="966.13" data-end="967.3">because like some of the modules are</span> <span data-start="967.3" data-end="968.23">starting to be stamped you know</span> <span data-start="968.23" data-end="970.54">standardized and put into browsers CSS 4</span> <span data-start="970.54" data-end="972.31">is way out here so the stuff that I'm</span> <span data-start="972.31" data-end="973.24">going to talk to you about today is</span> <span data-start="973.24" data-end="975.04">stuff that I've gone to the</span> <span data-start="975.04" data-end="976.84">specification documents and I've pulled</span> <span data-start="976.84" data-end="978.37">out there they're interesting things</span> <span data-start="978.37" data-end="982.99">that I thought were cool to share but I</span> <span data-start="982.99" data-end="984.25">wanted to look ahead a little bit</span> <span data-start="984.25" data-end="986.17">further and so my warning to you is that</span> <span data-start="986.17" data-end="988.84">all this stuff is a work in progress so</span> <span data-start="988.84" data-end="990.16">you can actually go and take a look at</span> <span data-start="990.16" data-end="991.57">these documents you can go to the lists</span> <span data-start="991.57" data-end="992.86">and give feedback if you think that</span> <span data-start="992.86" data-end="994.57">they're cool ideas or if you think the</span> <span data-start="994.57" data-end="996.4">ridiculous idea is like it's okay to say</span> <span data-start="996.4" data-end="998.71">like well that's ridiculous it can and</span> <span data-start="998.71" data-end="1001.8">will change and it will change Lots so</span> <span data-start="1001.8" data-end="1005.97">super future level 4 specs there is the</span> <span data-start="1005.97" data-end="1007.74">borders and backgrounds level 4 module</span> <span data-start="1007.74" data-end="1009.15">and there's some really cool things in</span> <span data-start="1009.15" data-end="1011.97">there for example in addition to your</span> <span data-start="1011.97" data-end="1013.59">border radius we're going to have</span> <span data-start="1013.59"

data-end="1028.8">and officially I don't have photos of</span> <span data-start="1028.8" data-end="1029.91">this because there weren't any examples</span> <span data-start="1029.91" data-end="1031.56">in the spec so you have to use your</span> <span data-start="1031.56" data-end="1033.87">imagination and I think that this is</span> <span data-start="1033.87" data-end="1035.49">particularly interesting especially if</span> <span data-start="1035.49" data-end="1037.26">you've seen some of the stuff that Leah</span> <span data-start="1037.26" data-end="1039.21">vero has done with her border-radius</span> <span data-start="1039.21" data-end="1042.75">talk that she gave it a CSS comp in the</span> <span data-start="1042.75" data-end="1045.87">u.s. like the the other CSS comps and I</span> <span data-start="1045.87" data-end="1047.19">think that there's some really cool</span> <span data-start="1047.19" data-end="1048.6">opportunity there to combine things you</span> <span data-start="1048.6" data-end="1050.73">can do with border-radius having</span> <span data-start="1050.73" data-end="1052.65">additional shapes that you can do with</span> <span data-start="1052.65" data-end="1056.28">them with your borders now so there's</span> <span data-start="1056.28" data-end="1058.23">that and then we've got something called</span> <span data-start="1058.23" data-end="1060.42">border clip which I find a little bit a</span> <span data-start="1060.42" data-end="1063.24">little bit ridiculous but in a good way</span> <span data-start="1063.24" data-end="1066.63">and so a border clip sometimes you want</span> <span data-start="1066.63" data-end="1068.43">to hide parts of abort</span> <span data-start="1068.43" data-end="1070.2">maybe you do maybe you don't I mean I</span> <span data-start="1070.2" data-end="1071.49">actually hadn't thought about it before</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1071.49" data-end="1072.78">I saw a border clip and then I thought</span> <span data-start="1072.78" data-end="1074.15">that it could be a really interesting</span> <span data-start="1074.15" data-end="1075.96">really interesting for people that</span> <span data-start="1075.96" data-end="1077.79">create art in the browser and use only</span> <span data-start="1077.79" data-end="1080.16">CSS so it's a set of properties border</span> <span data-start="1080.16" data-end="1082.65">cliff top right bottom border clip left</span> <span data-start="1082.65" data-end="1084.36">and of course naturally just using the</span> <span data-start="1084.36" data-end="1087.15">border border : as a shorthand property</span> <span data-start="1087.15" data-end="1088.38">will work like you would expect other</span> <span data-start="1088.38" data-end="1091.5">properties to and it when you're</span> <span data-start="1091.5" data-end="1093.84">specifying your units you can also use a</span> <span data-start="1093.84" data-end="1096.78">fraction or FR fractional unit which is</span> <span data-start="1096.78" data-end="1098.94">a unit specified by the css3</span> <span data-start="1098.94" data-end="1101.64">specification or sorry css3 grid</span> <span data-start="1101.64" data-end="1103.95">specification and a fractional unit is</span> <span data-start="1103.95" data-end="1106.65">described as one sheriff space in all</span> <span data-start="1106.65" data-end="1108.21">the available space of an element so</span> <span data-start="1108.21" data-end="1111.72">it's sort of a relative unit and i'm not</span> <span data-start="1111.72" data-end="1113.55">totally 100% sure if that one's going to</span> <span data-start="1113.55" data-end="1116.1">stay as a fractional units i also was</span> <span data-start="1116.1" data-end="1117.75">reading about one called like a gr like</span> <span data-start="1117.75" data-end="1120.06">a like a grid unit so that that's a bit</span> <span data-start="1120.06" data-end="1121.92">ambiguous but for our intents and</span> <span data-start="1121.92" data-end="1123.69">purposes we can refer to this relative</span> <span data-start="1123.69" data-end="1126.42">fractional unit for describing this but</span> <span data-start="1126.42" data-end="1128.55">so here's an example we have at the top</span> <span data-start="1128.55" data-end="1130.2">there we've described a border that's</span> <span data-start="1130.2" data-end="1131.94">thin solid black so it would go all the</span> <span data-start="1131.94" data-end="1133.77">way around the box and then what we've</span> <span data-start="1133.77" data-end="1135.42">done with border clip is we've said that</span> <span data-start="1135.42" data-end="1137.52">for one fractional unit and because only</span> <span data-start="1137.52" data-end="1139.38">one is specified that means the entire</span> <span data-start="1139.38" data-end="1142.02">element we're just going to say that the</span> <span data-start="1142.02" data-end="1143.7">border is clipped entirely so as the</span> <span data-start="1143.7" data-end="1145.32">comment says that would hide the border</span> <span data-start="1145.32" data-end="1147.33">and then what we do is we say border</span> <span data-start="1147.33" data-end="1149.97">clip top we want to show exactly ten</span> <span data-start="1149.97" data-end="1152.28">picks up ten pixels of the black border</span> <span data-start="1152.28" data-end="1154.68">then fill in one fractional unit and</span> <span data-start="1154.68" data-end="1157.74">then ten pixels and that one fractional</span> <span data-start="1157.74" data-end="1159.24">unit basically fills up all the</span> <span data-start="1159.24" data-end="1160.98">remaining space except for the twenty</span> <span data-start="1160.98" data-end="1163.53">pixels of that we've specified that we</span> <span data-start="1163.53" data-end="1164.73">actually want to show and so we've done</span> <span data-start="1164.73" data-end="1166.44">the same on the top and on the bottom an</span> <span data-start="1166.44" data-end="1168.78">example 35 the second one there we've</span> <span data-start="1168.78" data-end="1170.91">sort of done the same thing again we've</span> <span data-start="1170.91" data-end="1172.8">got border tops in solid black border</span> <span data-start="1172.8" data-end="1175.32">bottom thin solid black and we didn't do</span> <span data-start="1175.32" data-end="1176.52">anything to hide the borders here but</span> <span data-start="1176.52" data-end="1178.14">instead we just specified that we want</span> <span data-start="1178.14" data-end="1180.03">to clip the top and the boredom bottom</span> <span data-start="1180.03" data-end="1181.98">after the ten pixels</span> <span data-start="1181.98" data-end="1183.75">only ten pixels you end up with just a</span> <span data-start="1183.75" data-end="1185.25">little bit of a line but you can do more</span> <span data-start="1185.25" data-end="1187.02">interesting things with this so in this</span> <span data-start="1187.02" data-end="1190.05">example here we've defined a four pixel</span> <span data-start="1190.05" data-end="1192.36">farming four pixel border that's also</span> <span data-start="1192.36" data-end="1194.61">black but then we've used the fractional</span> <span data-start="1194.61" data-end="1196.89">units to actually describe the border</span> <span data-start="1196.89" data-end="1199.83">itself and use the like the absolute the</span> <span data-start="1199.83" data-end="1201.84">pixel units to describe the space</span> <span data-start="1201.84" data-end="1203.73">between those fractional units and so</span> <span data-start="1203.73" data-end="1206.46">you get something like this and so the</span> <span data-start="1206.46" data-end="1207.84">length of these border border parts will</span> <span data-start="1207.84" data-end="1209.13">change when the width of the element</span> <span data-start="1209.13" data-end="1210.63">changes so you can imagine like you know</span> <span data-start="1210.63" data-end="1213.36">like expanding this expanding this and</span> <span data-start="1213.36" data-end="1214.529">some sort of like a responsive layout</span> <span data-start="1214.529" data-end="1215.82">maybe and then it will change</span> <span data-start="1215.82" data-end="1218.549">accordingly so and as it mentions there</span> <span data-start="1218.549" data-end="1219.779">the read there is just for illustrative</span> <span data-start="1219.779" data-end="1221.37">purposes it says there that you know the</span> <span data-start="1221.37" data-end="1222.659">browser shouldn't implement them in red</span> <span data-start="1222.659" data-end="1224.49">that's how specific these documents are</span> <span data-start="1224.49" data-end="1225.6">but I thought this was particularly</span> <span data-start="1225.6" data-end="1227.01">interesting I think that for people that</span> <span data-start="1227.01" data-end="1228.779">you know spend a lot of time in CSS you</span> <span data-start="1228.779" data-end="1230.039">could do some creative things with this</span> <span data-start="1230.039" data-end="1232.86">and also imagine combining it with like</span> <span data-start="1232.86" data-end="1234.419">the the different border or partly the</span> <span data-start="1234.419" data-end="1235.799">different corner shapes as well you can</span> <span data-start="1235.799" data-end="1237.299">come up with some very interesting Lee</span> <span data-start="1237.299" data-end="1240.059">shaped divs no longer are you limited to</span> <span data-start="1240.059" data-end="1241.86">boxes I think we saw from the CSS</span> <span data-start="1241.86" data-end="1244.2">animations and stuff and the geometry</span> <span data-start="1244.2" data-end="1246.48">earlier that that's definitely not the</span> <span data-start="1246.48" data-end="1247.98">case today but this opens up the door</span> <span data-start="1247.98" data-end="1251.669">for more things so media queries level</span> <span data-start="1251.669" data-end="1254.13">for this is one that I really like</span> <span data-start="1254.13" data-end="1256.35">actually so there are a lot of devices</span> <span data-start="1256.35" data-end="1259.89">now that have ambient light sensors and</span> <span data-start="1259.89" data-end="1262.14">what level for media queries introduces</span> <span data-start="1262.14" data-end="1266.909">is luminosity and luminosity will allow</span> <span data-start="1266.909" data-end="1269.429">you to apply styles for specific</span> <span data-start="1269.429" data-end="1272.299">lighting conditions as reflected by the</span> <span data-start="1272.299" data-end="1274.559">ambient light sensor on your device</span> <span data-start="1274.559" data-end="1278.159">so you can specify for dim and dim would</span> <span data-start="1278.159" data-end="1280.649">be used for you know like nighttime you</span> <span data-start="1280.649" data-end="1281.909">know there's not very much light and so</span> <span data-start="1281.909" data-end="1284.19">so in that case high contrast styles</span> <span data-start="1284.19" data-end="1285.74">would probably be fairly distracting</span> <span data-start="1285.74" data-end="1288.45">also for normal you know whatever that's</span> <span data-start="1288.45" data-end="1291.21">going to mean but that's ideally</span> <span data-start="1291.21" data-end="1293.07">described as the environment where the</span> <span data-start="1293.07" data-end="1296.58">luminosity is ideal for reading and and</span> <span data-start="1296.58" data-end="1298.32">it's the ideal arrange for the screen</span> <span data-start="1298.32" data-end="1300.33">that you have and then also washed which</span> <span data-start="1300.33"

data-end="1306.21">device in the sunlight and of course</span> <span data-start="1306.21" data-end="1308.88">that washes everything out so maybe you</span> <span data-start="1308.88" data-end="1310.919">do want high contrast in that situation</span> <span data-start="1310.919" data-end="1312.33">now I think all of this is very</span> <span data-start="1312.33" data-end="1313.83">interesting and of course like I say</span> <span data-start="1313.83" data-end="1316.919">this is well into the future but you</span> <span data-start="1316.919" data-end="1318.69">know devices with a light sensor usually</span> <span data-start="1318.69" data-end="1320.46">sort of auto adjust and it's going to be</span> <span data-start="1320.46"

data-end="1328.049">about this because I really don't like</span> <span data-start="1328.049" data-end="1330.09">it when like my I've got an iPhone and I</span> <span data-start="1330.09"
