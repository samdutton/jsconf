data-start="74.149" data-end="76.759">suppose we had this greeter function it</span> <span data-start="76.759" data-end="78.86">takes a name and returns hello that name</span> <span data-start="78.86" data-end="80.479">so if we pass it in J's cough it would</span> <span data-start="80.479" data-end="84.38">say hello J's cough how friendly here's</span> <span data-start="84.38" data-end="85.49">what that code would look like in</span> <span data-start="85.49" data-end="87.259">typescript notice that it's quite</span> <span data-start="87.259" data-end="88.549">similar the only difference is that</span> <span data-start="88.549" data-end="90.289">we've annotated the parameter with what</span> <span data-start="90.289" data-end="92.32">type it is</span> <span data-start="92.32" data-end="94.939">so if we use this function in our</span> <span data-start="94.939" data-end="97.189">typescript project and we pass a string</span> <span data-start="97.189" data-end="99.74">everything compiles fine but if we pass</span> <span data-start="99.74" data-end="101.479">something that's not a string in this</span> <span data-start="101.479"

can describe types</span> <span data-start="128.03" data-end="131.41">for more complicated constructs</span> <span data-start="131.41" data-end="133.25">typescript normally comes with a</span> <span

data-end="143.84">usages for factoring and more in this</span> <span data-start="143.84" data-end="146">example we've hooked up the type for our</span> <span data-start="146" data-end="147.86">with styles react higher cut order</span> <span data-start="147.86" data-end="149.96">component so we get autocomplete for the</span> <span data-start="149.96" data-end="151.94">hundreds of CSS properties it accepts</span> <span data-start="151.94" data-end="154.82">including inline documentation amazing I</span> <span data-start="154.82" data-end="156.41">didn't have to flip back and forth to</span> <span data-start="156.41" data-end="158.09">the docs pages I got all of this in my</span> <span data-start="158.09" data-end="160.82">editor with types with types throughout</span> <span data-start="160.82" data-end="162.83">our code we can do more as it's being</span> <span data-start="162.83" data-end="165.5">authored this just scratches the surface</span> <span data-start="165.5" data-end="168.41">of what typescript is capable of but</span> <span data-start="168.41" data-end="169.79">gives you a sense of the kind of areas</span> <span data-start="169.79" data-end="171.47">that can help catch and the tooling it</span> <span data-start="171.47" data-end="175.94">enables so that's the typescript part</span> <span data-start="175.94" data-end="179.72">what about the at scale part Oh is there</span> <span data-start="179.72" data-end="186.32">a problem oh thanks tied scripts I'm not</span> <span data-start="186.32" data-end="188.21">actually making all this up if you did</span> <span data-start="188.21" data-end="189.77">typo a variable that would give you an</span> <span data-start="189.77" data-end="191.21">area that looked like that so it</span> <span data-start="191.21" data-end="195.61">actually is real thing so let's fix that</span> <span data-start="195.61" data-end="199.37">so the scale changes a conversation I've</span> <span data-start="199.37" data-end="201.38">been on small teams before where it was</span> <span data-start="201.38" data-end="203.39">just hey you wanna use typescript yeah</span> <span data-start="203.39" data-end="205.82">sounds cool let's use it but as you</span> <span data-start="205.82" data-end="207.95">scale up to hundreds of engineers and</span> <span data-start="207.95" data-end="209.75">more and more code that conversation</span> <span data-start="209.75" data-end="212.51">changes we would have changed that we</span> <span data-start="212.51" data-end="214.19">were proposing is using
