data-start="855.39" data-end="857.61">whatever but basically what happens is</span> <span data-start="857.61" data-end="860.79">you have like a giant horizontal image</span> <span data-start="860.79" data-end="863.07">so like each one of these five things</span> <span data-start="863.07" data-end="866.4">here is one image and basically you</span> <span data-start="866.4" data-end="868.65">break

and you say like</span> <span data-start="872.67" data-end="875.4">40 and then at 80 pixels there's the</span> <span data-start="875.4" data-end="877.95">second pixel picture and at 120 pixels</span> <span data-start="877.95" data-end="883.32">there's a third picture right so as you</span> <span data-start="883.32" data-end="885.6">do these but what's also cool is you</span> <span data-start="885.6" data-end="887.25">might have multiple different animations</span> <span data-start="887.25" data-end="888.87">in one file so like if we look at the</span> <span data-start="888.87"

<span data-start="907.11" data-end="911.49">really really long animation so we can</span> <span data-start="911.49" data-end="914.029">kind of mix these up how we want and</span> <span

data-end="921.57">looking at the monster we're actually</span> <span data-start="921.57" data-end="925.86">looking at one of the monkeys and in the</span> <span data-start="925.86"

data-end="979.08">code every time you want to play it so</span> <span data-start="979.08" data-end="981.63">it's it's about as simple as it can get</span> <span data-start="981.63" data-end="983.94">and and that's kind of one of the things</span> <span data-start="983.94" data-end="986.43">that I want to kind of convey through</span> <span data-start="986.43" data-end="988.92">this whole thing is basically it's</span> <span data-start="988.92" data-end="991.14">pretty easy like it seems daunting like</span> <span data-start="991.14" data-end="992.97">you see games and like you don't have to</span> <span data-start="992.97" data-end="995.67">make like 3d unreal game like there's a</span> <span data-start="995.67" data-end="997.77">lot of fun two teams it's like the cat</span> <span data-start="997.77" data-end="999.3">game we showed earlier it isn't it</span> <span data-start="999.3" data-end="1001.43">there's no like advanced technology that</span> <span data-start="1001.43" data-end="1002.57">could have been made on a Super Nintendo</span> <span data-start="1002.57" data-end="1007.459">you know so kind of the next building</span> <span data-start="1007.459" data-end="1010.91">block that we have in kind of 2d and 2d</span> <span data-start="1010.91" data-end="1011.99">game programming it's called the</span> <span data-start="1011.99" data-end="1014.33">parallax scrolling and this is kind of</span> <span data-start="1014.33" data-end="1015.86">like if you ever played Super Mario</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1015.86" data-end="1017.9">Brothers I don't know is how many people</span> <span data-start="1017.9" data-end="1019.76">I don't know if that's too old in this</span> <span data-start="1019.76" data-end="1021.8">audience okay okay cool</span> <span data-start="1021.8" data-end="1023.18">actually half more than half the</span> <span data-start="1023.18" data-end="1026.179">audiences play this good so basically</span> <span data-start="1026.179" data-end="1029.959">the whole idea of Super Mario is Mario</span> <span data-start="1029.959" data-end="1031.579">doesn't really move that much it's</span> <span data-start="1031.579" data-end="1033.74">really the background of the screen that</span> <span data-start="1033.74" data-end="1035.449">moves so I just want to really quickly</span> <span data-start="1035.449" data-end="1037.76">show so like this is actually the game</span> <span data-start="1037.76" data-end="1040.459">right so like this is this is actually</span> <span data-start="1040.459" data-end="1042.47">all those elements put together inside</span> <span data-start="1042.47" data-end="1044.929">of one of the levels in the game but if</span> <span data-start="1044.929" data-end="1046.85">we break it down into pieces it's really</span> <span data-start="1046.85" data-end="1048.74">four different graphics that are really</span> <span data-start="1048.74" data-end="1051.86">wide and kind of the idea with a</span> <span data-start="1051.86" data-end="1054.35">parallax is that you have different</span> <span data-start="1054.35" data-end="1056.87">parts of the screen and they move at</span> <span data-start="1056.87" data-end="1059.9">different speeds so the clouds might be</span> <span data-start="1059.9" data-end="1061.83">moving really slow</span> <span data-start="1061.83" data-end="1063.54">the city scene might be moving very</span> <span data-start="1063.54" data-end="1065.46">quickly and then the middle city scene</span> <span data-start="1065.46" data-end="1067.08">might be moving just a little bit slower</span> <span data-start="1067.08" data-end="1069.66">and then the ground just barely moves</span> <span data-start="1069.66" data-end="1072.72">right and it creates this effect as</span> <span data-start="1072.72" data-end="1074.58">though you're walking through the screen</span> <span data-start="1074.58" data-end="1075.96">but all you're doing is you're just kind</span> <span data-start="1075.96" data-end="1077.46">of you're just shifting different</span> <span data-start="1077.46" data-end="1079.59">elements and what's kind of cool is that</span> <span data-start="1079.59" data-end="1081.48">it ends up being like a circle so like</span> <span data-start="1081.48" data-end="1084.03">the clouds we don't have infinite number</span> <span data-start="1084.03" data-end="1085.55">of clouds right we're just basically</span> <span data-start="1085.55" data-end="1089.1">circling around a circle so we like are</span> <span data-start="1089.1" data-end="1091.02">just showing a portion of the clouds at</span> <span data-start="1091.02" data-end="1092.7">any pour it's important the time so</span> <span data-start="1092.7" data-end="1095.34">maybe like on this screen here we might</span> <span data-start="1095.34" data-end="1096.66">be showing maybe a quarter of those</span> <span data-start="1096.66" data-end="1099.15">clouds especially on iOS where you're</span> <span data-start="1099.15" data-end="1100.32">not gonna you don't have that much</span> <span data-start="1100.32" data-end="1102.21">resolution so you as you can see we're</span> <span data-start="1102.21" data-end="1104.73">only seeing like a very very very small</span> <span data-start="1104.73" data-end="1106.98">fraction of each piece but it kind of</span> <span data-start="1106.98" data-end="1109.26">moves around and it kind of gives the</span> <span data-start="1109.26" data-end="1111.12">impression is that that you're really</span> <span data-start="1111.12" data-end="1116.13">kind of moving through this city soon so</span> <span data-start="1116.13" data-end="1119.16">let's let's talk about the code and once</span> <span data-start="1119.16" data-end="1122.64">again this is really easy so basically</span> <span data-start="1122.64" data-end="1126.36">for parallax you basically are just for</span> <span data-start="1126.36" data-end="1129">each one you give it a name you give it</span> <span data-start="1129" data-end="1132.84">the dimensions and you give it the speed</span> <span data-start="1132.84" data-end="1135.12">the rate that it's going to be moving so</span> <span data-start="1135.12" data-end="1138.47">some are going to be moving at you know</span> <span data-start="1138.47" data-end="1141.84">point so many milliseconds and each one</span> <span data-start="1141.84" data-end="1143.37">will be moving at different milliseconds</span> <span data-start="1143.37" data-end="1146.4">and then the actual implementation of</span> <span data-start="1146.4" data-end="1148.41">parallax itself is only ten lines of</span> <span data-start="1148.41" data-end="1151.29">code in JavaScript you're basically just</span> <span data-start="1151.29" data-end="1154.86">taking the velocity and you're basically</span> <span data-start="1154.86" data-end="1157.32">just moving it around the x-axis at the</span> <span data-start="1157.32" data-end="1160.05">velocity that it needs to go so like and</span> <span data-start="1160.05" data-end="1162.57">if it loops around we just start over</span> <span data-start="1162.57" data-end="1165.33">from the beginning so it's it's it's</span> <span data-start="1165.33" data-end="1167.97">really really easy it didn't even have a</span> <span data-start="1167.97" data-end="1169.8">parallax implementation I just got this</span> <span data-start="1169.8" data-end="1171.21">off the internet I was like ten lines of</span> <span data-start="1171.21" data-end="1173.7">code it was it it's it's really fun</span> <span data-start="1173.7" data-end="1177.42">though so now we have kind of the main</span> <span data-start="1177.42" data-end="1179.46">building blocks of like a 2d game like</span> <span data-start="1179.46" data-end="1181.68">we can we have the characters we can</span> <span data-start="1181.68" data-end="1184.14">make big characters animate and move and</span> <span data-start="1184.14" data-end="1185.58">we can move the background as though</span> <span data-start="1185.58" data-end="1187.86">we're walking through the screen now how</span> <span data-start="1187.86" data-end="1189.75">does the main game loop work in a game</span> <span data-start="1189.75" data-end="1193.44">so kind of games are kind of built</span> <span data-start="1193.44" data-end="1195.46">around state machines</span> <span data-start="1195.46" data-end="1198.76">so basically what happens is every time</span> <span data-start="1198.76" data-end="1200.89">there's a clock tick so usually you'll</span> <span data-start="1200.89" data-end="1202.72">divide a game into like 60 frames a</span> <span data-start="1202.72" data-end="1205.21">second or 30 frames a second and you'll</span> <span data-start="1205.21" data-end="1207.07">have an event which is your clock tick</span> <span data-start="1207.07" data-end="1209.53">in create yes they called the update</span> <span data-start="1209.53" data-end="1213.7">function and once every so like if we</span> <span data-start="1213.7" data-end="1216.28">have 60 frames a second so once a what</span> <span data-start="1216.28" data-end="1218.95">once every one 60th of a second will get</span> <span data-start="1218.95" data-end="1222.04">an event and basically what we'll do is</span> <span data-start="1222.04" data-end="1224.47">we'll decide at that point in time if we</span> <span data-start="1224.47" data-end="1226.45">need to do an animation or maybe we need</span> <span data-start="1226.45" data-end="1228.64">to scroll the screen some and and</span> <span data-start="1228.64" data-end="1230.05">basically we're just doing it a</span> <span data-start="1230.05" data-end="1232.15">fractions fractions in fractions of a</span> <span data-start="1232.15" data-end="1236.71">second and the main game loop as you can</span> <span data-start="1236.71" data-end="1238.15">see here you can maybe I can't see the</span> <span data-start="1238.15" data-end="1241.54">code gray but it's only maybe about 50</span> <span data-start="1241.54" data-end="1242.92">lines of code and we'll just kind of</span> <span data-start="1242.92" data-end="1244.3">talk through just kind of the main</span> <span data-start="1244.3" data-end="1246.76">elements of how how a game loop actually</span> <span data-start="1246.76" data-end="1250.09">works so like as I said it's a state</span> <span data-start="1250.09" data-end="1252.73">machine so like for example if somebody</span> <span data-start="1252.73" data-end="1254.65">hit the pause button the function</span> <span data-start="1254.65" data-end="1256.48">shouldn't do anything right so it starts</span> <span data-start="1256.48" data-end="1259.57">there and then if if we're in the middle</span> <span data-start="1259.57" data-end="1262.21">of a monster dying so like an event so</span> <span data-start="1262.21" data-end="1264.04">like a monster dies well that's not</span> <span data-start="1264.04" data-end="1265.93">instantaneous right because it may take</span> <span data-start="1265.93" data-end="1268.72">a second it may take a half a second for</span> <span data-start="1268.72" data-end="1271.09">the animation to play through so you</span> <span data-start="1271.09" data-end="1272.86">have to keep you have to maintain these</span> <span data-start="1272.86" data-end="1275.95">states and you have to see if we're if</span> <span data-start="1275.95" data-end="1278.05">we're done yet with each of these kinds</span> <span data-start="1278.05" data-end="1282.52">of states and then for each kind of</span> <span data-start="1282.52" data-end="1284.74">thing on the screen now it's granted</span> <span data-start="1284.74" data-end="1286.75">like this is a pretty simple game so</span> <span data-start="1286.75" data-end="1290.23">like I explicitly mention each monster</span> <span data-start="1290.23" data-end="1292.3">and each hero like if you're building a</span> <span data-start="1292.3" data-end="1293.68">bigger game you would have like a linked</span> <span data-start="1293.68" data-end="1296.83">list or a map of like all of the all the</span> <span data-start="1296.83" data-end="1298.3">objects that you would have on the</span> <span data-start="1298.3" data-end="1299.73">screen and you would iterate over them</span> <span data-start="1299.73" data-end="1302.05">but basically what you're gonna do is</span> <span data-start="1302.05" data-end="1304.54">you talk to each object and you tell the</span> <span data-start="1304.54" data-end="1306.97">object to render itself and and</span> <span data-start="1306.97" data-end="1309.88">basically in in like the hero or in the</span> <span data-start="1309.88" data-end="1313.03">monster they know about time so the hero</span> <span data-start="1313.03" data-end="1315.67">he's running so like every so often</span> <span data-start="1315.67" data-end="1318.33">he'll be changing frames of his run or</span> <span data-start="1318.33" data-end="1321.52">if it's the monster he'll have to be</span> <span data-start="1321.52" data-end="1323.89">checking to see if the hero intersects</span> <span data-start="1323.89" data-end="1327.01">with with the box so like if the monster</span> <span data-start="1327.01" data-end="1328.12">and the hero touchy</span> <span data-start="1328.12" data-end="1331.24">the hero dies shame these kinds of</span> <span data-start="1331.24" data-end="1333.25">things so each of these classes is like</span> <span data-start="1333.25" data-end="1336.039">responsible for its own for its own</span> <span data-start="1336.039" data-end="1338.529">functionality and it kind of breaks in</span> <span data-start="1338.529" data-end="1342.159">like that so then yeah so so and then</span> <span data-start="1342.159" data-end="1344.559">yes then there's the collided so we</span> <span data-start="1344.559" data-end="1346.9">might do things we play an audio we</span> <span data-start="1346.9" data-end="1350.679">might lower the health and for our game</span> <span data-start="1350.679" data-end="1353.409">since we're building something that</span> <span data-start="1353.409" data-end="1355.44">actually is tracking words per minute</span> <span data-start="1355.44" data-end="1358.299">we're gonna start calculating the words</span> <span data-start="1358.299" data-end="1360.58">per minute and update any labels so like</span> <span data-start="1360.58" data-end="1363.01">we have labels on the screen if I come</span> <span data-start="1363.01" data-end="1366.13">back here we have that's yeah we have</span> <span data-start="1366.13" data-end="1368.169">labels on the screen like the time the</span> <span data-start="1368.169" data-end="1371.08">words per minute how many points we have</span> <span data-start="1371.08" data-end="1372.73">and we have to kind of keep track of</span> <span data-start="1372.73" data-end="1374.38">those and like every time we do an</span> <span data-start="1374.38" data-end="1377.11">update and then the very last thing is</span> <span data-start="1377.11" data-end="1379.36">we iterate over all the parallax layers</span> <span data-start="1379.36" data-end="1382.659">that we talked about earlier and we we</span> <span data-start="1382.659" data-end="1384.279">make sure that they get updated so like</span> <span data-start="1384.279" data-end="1386.5">we just talked to the parallax which we</span> <span data-start="1386.5" data-end="1388.87">talked about here and the parallax knows</span> <span data-start="1388.87" data-end="1391.149">how to render itself what's kind of cool</span> <span data-start="1391.149" data-end="1392.919">is like the main game loop just kind of</span> <span data-start="1392.919" data-end="1395.289">knows about objects and then each object</span> <span data-start="1395.289" data-end="1396.73">is kind of responsible for its own</span> <span data-start="1396.73" data-end="1398.38">rendering it's kind of very similar to</span> <span data-start="1398.38" data-end="1400.27">like when you guys do like angular or</span> <span data-start="1400.27" data-end="1401.95">any of these other component frameworks</span> <span data-start="1401.95" data-end="1404.5">but now we can do this with like games</span> <span data-start="1404.5" data-end="1406.72">and it's it's pretty straightforward if</span> <span data-start="1406.72" data-end="1409.96">you've done any kind of other game</span> <span data-start="1409.96" data-end="1412.75">development so that's kind of the main</span> <span data-start="1412.75" data-end="1415.059">glue that's that's basically all the</span> <span data-start="1415.059" data-end="1417.13">main things you need to like break down</span> <span data-start="1417.13" data-end="1419.32">a game and we've talked about maybe 150</span> <span data-start="1419.32" data-end="1421.63">lines of code for the core of a 2-d game</span> <span data-start="1421.63" data-end="1423.94">that's that's pretty reasonable for</span> <span data-start="1423.94" data-end="1426.039">anybody starting out to just like flip</span> <span data-start="1426.039" data-end="1429.37">through right so cool so I'm going to</span> <span data-start="1429.37" data-end="1430.72">talk about some of the other cool fun</span> <span data-start="1430.72" data-end="1433.24">libraries that I found for doing game</span> <span data-start="1433.24" data-end="1436">development with with this there's</span> <span data-start="1436" data-end="1438.549">another library called creatine and once</span> <span data-start="1438.549" data-end="1440.44">you start to get a more complex game</span> <span data-start="1440.44" data-end="1441.94">like so once I started to have multiple</span> <span data-start="1441.94" data-end="1443.679">levels and stuff I wanted to be able to</span> <span data-start="1443.679" data-end="1445.39">like actually manage the levels in a</span> <span data-start="1445.39" data-end="1448.33">sane way and this creatine framework</span> <span data-start="1448.33" data-end="1450.36">allows you to do like level management</span> <span data-start="1450.36" data-end="1453.309">transitions between levels it can even</span> <span data-start="1453.309" data-end="1455.919">do things like did anybody play like the</span> <span data-start="1455.919" data-end="1458.049">old Final Fantasies were like you have</span> <span data-start="1458.049" data-end="1460.21">like this 2d yeah</span> <span data-start="1460.21" data-end="1462.43">plantain yeah I see a couple of people</span> <span data-start="1462.43" data-end="1464.68">smiling so like the old Final Fantasy</span> <span data-start="1464.68" data-end="1466.3">games were all they call it I so more</span> </p>
