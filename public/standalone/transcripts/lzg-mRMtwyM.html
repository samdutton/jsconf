your</span> <span data-start="211.52" data-end="213.59">code and do things like turn on this</span> <span data-start="213.59" data-end="216.59">advanced setting over here and it like</span> <span

data-end="226.82">constant it'll go through and inline</span> <span data-start="226.82" data-end="229.25">that code and stuff like that so there's</span> <span data-start="229.25" data-end="231.71">a

better job them the</span> <span data-start="235.67" data-end="238.04">yui compressor on some code sometimes it</span> <span data-start="238.04" data-end="240.41">breaks and doesn't even work but another</span> <span data-start="240.41" data-end="243.38">thing to going to check out now out wait</span> <span data-start="243.38" data-end="248.62">oops does anyone know who this guy is</span> <span data-start="248.62" data-end="251.84">this is Steve Souders who will be at the</span> <span data-start="251.84" data-end="254.9">show and originally I was scheduled to</span> <span data-start="254.9" data-end="257">talk after his talk so would have made a</span> <span data-start="257" data-end="258.23">little bit more sense by when I play a</span> <span data-start="258.23" data-end="260.39">little bit of a trick on him when he</span> <span data-start="260.39" data-end="261.919">starts his talk if everyone can just</span> <span data-start="261.919" data-end="266.04">start doing a little buzzed just like</span> <span data-start="266.05" data-end="269.45">just to going to get him there is a</span> <span data-start="269.45" data-end="271.31">reason why Steve is showing up this is</span> <span data-start="271.31" data-end="273.07">his halloween party where is a</span> <span data-start="273.07" data-end="278.75">pollinating his wife Carrie he's</span> <span data-start="278.75" data-end="280.13">performance techniques are actually</span> <span data-start="280.13" data-end="282.2">baked into that compiler so when you run</span> <span data-start="282.2" data-end="283.34">the compiler it actually does</span> <span data-start="283.34" data-end="285.23">performance tests on the flying gives</span> <span data-start="285.23" data-end="287.63">you interest in output so the stuff he's</span> <span data-start="287.63" data-end="290.33">talking about kind of shows up a little</span> <span data-start="290.33" data-end="292.88">bit here which is kind of fun there's</span> <span data-start="292.88" data-end="294.38">also some other really fun things that</span> <span data-start="294.38" data-end="296.77">he did there's Firebug extensions that</span> <span data-start="296.77" data-end="298.61">take care of some of the stuff that you</span> <span data-start="298.61" data-end="300.41">get that's messy so once you do you know</span> <span data-start="300.41" data-end="302.69">compilers and you get this you know</span> <span data-start="302.69" data-end="305.12">office cody code out then when you're</span> <span data-start="305.12" data-end="307.52">trying to debug that it's a pain or so</span> <span data-start="307.52" data-end="309.2">what they did they do a bunch of stuff</span> <span data-start="309.2" data-end="311.09">in the Firebug extension including</span> <span data-start="311.09" data-end="313.46">having this source mapping where you can</span> <span data-start="313.46" data-end="315.29">say here's my source of the original and</span> <span data-start="315.29" data-end="317.09">so instead of getting that there's an</span> <span data-start="317.09" data-end="318.71">error on line one because everything's</span> <span data-start="318.71" data-end="321.11">lined one it's one big line it'll map it</span> <span data-start="321.11" data-end="322.79">back to what's going on so it's just</span> <span data-start="322.79" data-end="324.47">kind of cool to see you like it's not</span> <span data-start="324.47" data-end="325.79">just a libraries this whole suite of</span> <span data-start="325.79" data-end="326.93">tools and I think there's some</span> <span data-start="326.93" data-end="328.79">interesting things to learn from here</span> <span data-start="328.79" data-end="330.74">not that you're going to obviously just</span> <span data-start="330.74" data-end="333.02">kind of run out and use closure anyway</span> <span data-start="333.02" data-end="336.68">that's the aside so I'm talking about</span> <span data-start="336.68" data-end="338.36">the future of the web whatever that</span> <span data-start="338.36" data-end="340.22">means and you know obviously kind of a</span> <span data-start="340.22" data-end="341.51">high-level topic we're going to talk</span> <span data-start="341.51" data-end="343.34">about a bunch of different things but</span> <span data-start="343.34" data-end="348.2">when i started with been a JAX ian at</span> <span data-start="348.2" data-end="349.58">the time we were given all these talks</span> <span data-start="349.58" data-end="351.8">on like how to build rich web</span> <span data-start="351.8" data-end="354.32">applications and hardly anyone was</span> <span data-start="354.32" data-end="356.09">showing up everyone was trying to</span> <span data-start="356.09" data-end="357.77">innovate on the server side and no one</span> <span data-start="357.77" data-end="359.69">cared about the client side and then</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="359.69" data-end="361.82">Jesse James coined the whole Ajax term</span> <span data-start="361.82" data-end="363.86">and then that was actually one day</span> <span data-start="363.86" data-end="366.77">before a server-side conference that the</span> <span data-start="366.77" data-end="368.45">we're out we did a search and replace on</span> <span data-start="368.45" data-end="371.45">our slides from d HTML to a Jackson like</span> <span data-start="371.45" data-end="374.81">it was a full house but it a lot of the</span> <span data-start="374.81" data-end="377.51">people here at this conference are kind</span> <span data-start="377.51" data-end="380.03">of responsible for going in getting all</span> <span data-start="380.03" data-end="381.89">these like hacks and quirks and little</span> <span data-start="381.89" data-end="384.83">ap is that the browser's had and it kind</span> <span data-start="384.83" data-end="386.51">of felt to me when when this stuff was</span> <span data-start="386.51" data-end="388.58">happening that we'd kind of like found</span> <span data-start="388.58" data-end="390.71">flight with Ajax we could build these</span> <span data-start="390.71" data-end="393.14">finally kind of rich applications on the</span> <span data-start="393.14" data-end="395.06">web but it was all</span> <span data-start="395.06" data-end="396.56">of a hack and it was all kind of pokey</span> <span data-start="396.56" data-end="398.389">and the runtime was really crappy but</span> <span data-start="398.389" data-end="400.13">it's amazing like we flew with would</span> <span data-start="400.13" data-end="402.59">like how did that happen and we kind of</span> <span data-start="402.59" data-end="404.389">did that the people in this room kind of</span> <span data-start="404.389" data-end="407.57">did that but it feels like now things</span> <span data-start="407.57" data-end="410.48">are changing and we finally get in these</span> <span data-start="410.48" data-end="413.36">amazing run times and new API is an</span> <span data-start="413.36" data-end="415.1">html5 and all of this stuff that's going</span> <span data-start="415.1" data-end="417.62">to enable us to get away from kind of</span> <span data-start="417.62" data-end="418.85">the crappy stuff that we had to deal</span> <span data-start="418.85" data-end="421.13">with and really kind of build some</span> <span data-start="421.13" data-end="422.87">disruptive applications in the future</span> <span data-start="422.87" data-end="424.82">and that's why I kind of at this time</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="424.82" data-end="428.18">I'm like amazingly excited much more so</span> <span data-start="428.18" data-end="429.979">than when the Ajax revolution kind of</span> <span

data-end="463.25">know that the engine is drastically</span> <span data-start="463.25" data-end="465.89">changed underneath we've finally got</span> <span data-start="465.89"

data-end="479.45">with that jet plane so Ajax used to mean</span> <span data-start="479.45" data-end="481.61">this when we did our first like Ajax</span> <span data-start="481.61" data-end="484.43">experience it was kind of a grassroots</span> <span data-start="484.43" data-end="485.93">thing just like this conference I think</span> <span data-start="485.93" data-end="487.639">these conferences like by far the most</span> <span data-start="487.639" data-end="490.43">exciting and all the talks are all about</span> <span data-start="490.43" data-end="493.1">like little things on top of this Ajax</span> <span data-start="493.1" data-end="496.01">thing and quickly we saw our whole slew</span> <span data-start="496.01" data-end="498.139">of libraries come out to like really</span> <span data-start="498.139" data-end="500.09">make it easy to do that kind of stuff</span> <span data-start="500.09" data-end="501.919">and give us a facts and

and so fun yeah it's so easy and</span> <span data-start="535.12" data-end="537.05">when Ben and I kind of looked at the</span> <span data-start="537.05" data-end="538.49">horizon with like talking about all this</span> <span data-start="538.49" data-end="541.009">great html5 stuff and we're like well we</span> <span data-start="541.009" data-end="543.29">need to like really build something on</span> <span data-start="543.29" data-end="545.389">top of this and and see what we can what</span> <span data-start="545.389" data-end="548.269">we can really do and that's why Bespin</span> <span data-start="548.269" data-end="549.86">actually came about we wanted to going</span> <span data-start="549.86" data-end="551.689">to play around with all of the new</span> <span data-start="551.689" data-end="554.36">technology and we're geeks obviously so</span> <span data-start="554.36" data-end="556.069">you thought what's an application that</span> <span data-start="556.069" data-end="557.839">you wouldn't really think of to do on</span> <span data-start="557.839" data-end="560.66">the web and make it happen and so for us</span> <span data-start="560.66" data-end="563">it's a code editor that's what we live</span> <span data-start="563" data-end="564.259">in all the time if we could make</span> <span data-start="564.259" data-end="566.36">something that's kind of desktop class</span> <span data-start="566.36" data-end="568.85">desktop quality then that will say a lot</span> <span data-start="568.85" data-end="571.43">and so we we went about trying to do</span> <span data-start="571.43" data-end="574.279">this and we tried it actually a few</span> <span data-start="574.279" data-end="577.61">times and the platform wasn't ready the</span>

data-start="585.86" data-end="588.62">it to work and so if you haven't seen</span> <span data-start="588.62" data-end="590.569">this is Bespin web-based code editor and</span> <span data-start="590.569" data-end="592.759">this is all you know canvas doing the</span> <span data-start="592.759" data-end="595.759">rendering and we were able to like</span> <span data-start="595.759" data-end="598.189">really focus on the performance side</span> <span data-start="598.189" data-end="600.259">that's all we really focused on at first</span> <span data-start="600.259" data-end="602.389">was to be able to scale up because we</span> <span data-start="602.389" data-end="604.49">saw a bunch of different editors that</span> <span data-start="604.49" data-end="605.839">are out there on the web and we've all</span> <span data-start="605.839" data-end="607.55">been there little kind of web-based text</span> <span data-start="607.55"

data-end="613.759">breaks down you got a million Dom nodes</span> <span data-start="613.759" data-end="616.339">and it's it's craziness and it was only</span> <span data-start="616.339" data-end="618.41">when we got to using canvas that we were</span> <span data-start="618.41" data-end="621.139">able to scale this thing up and we in</span> <span data-start="621.139" data-end="623">our prime we had this one session where</span> <span data-start="623" data-end="626.089">we had 50 thousand lines of code at 83</span> <span data-start="626.089"

data-end="636.019">kind of stuff and best buds got a long</span> <span data-start="636.019" data-end="639.11">way to go but that's kind of the key</span> <span data-start="639.11" data-end="640.67">thing that was like okay I think that I</span> <span data-start="640.67" data-end="642.709">think that we're kind of there and it's</span> <span data-start="642.709" data-end="646.009">really exciting so the technology that</span> <span data-start="646.009" data-end="648.17">we use not to invest member that we're</span> <span data-start="648.17" data-end="650.209">particularly excited about with the web</span> <span data-start="650.209" data-end="652.579">right now is the graphic side obviously</span> <span data-start="652.579" data-end="653.81">with things like canvas</span> <span data-start="653.81" data-end="656.029">finally having a decent JavaScript</span> <span data-start="656.029" data-end="658.31">engine and a whole

data-end="2913.04">like double click on the DVD and it</span> <span data-start="2913.04" data-end="2914.9">stopped playing it nope can't do that</span> <span data-start="2914.9" data-end="2916.91">maybe I could read the book click on the</span> <span data-start="2916.91" data-end="2918.5">book no can't do that I could literally</span> <span data-start="2918.5" data-end="2921.41">put in my information look at this or</span> <span data-start="2921.41" data-end="2923.48">look at my bookshelf unlike that was it</span> <span data-start="2923.48" data-end="2928.1">and the innovation was this feature here</span> <span data-start="2928.1" data-end="2929.78">was kind of cool at the time where you</span> <span data-start="2929.78" data-end="2931.73">could put the the code up to the webcam</span> <span data-start="2931.73" data-end="2933.44">and it would scan it and automatically</span> <span data-start="2933.44" data-end="2935.39">put in the information and you could</span> <span data-start="2935.39" data-end="2937.85">like drag a book to a friend and it</span> <span data-start="2937.85" data-end="2939.08">would say like you've loaned it to him</span> <span data-start="2939.08" data-end="2941.69">but that's it you could use Excel really</span> <span data-start="2941.69" data-end="2944.12">easily to do that you could use one of</span> <span data-start="2944.12" data-end="2946.67">the millions of like inventory systems</span> <span data-start="2946.67" data-end="2948.41">out there but he basically took</span> <span data-start="2948.41" data-end="2950.6">something made it look really nice had</span> <span data-start="2950.6" data-end="2953.51">amazing attention to detail and did it</span> <span data-start="2953.51" data-end="2959.96">matter well yeah he sold 500,000 in</span> <span data-start="2959.96" data-end="2962.21">three months yet this is literally his</span> <span data-start="2962.21" data-end="2965.66">car he bought this car and as a bit of</span> <span data-start="2965.66" data-end="2967.34">an ego so he blogged about buying this</span> <span data-start="2967.34" data-end="2970.07">car and a fifty four thousand dollars of</span> <span data-start="2970.07" data-end="2971.33">profit in the first day without doing</span> <span data-start="2971.33" data-end="2974.15">any advertising at all he literally took</span> <span data-start="2974.15" data-end="2975.95">something that had a little bit of use</span> <span data-start="2975.95" data-end="2979.13">not too much made it just beautiful to</span> <span data-start="2979.13" data-end="2981.14">use and people bought it I bought it and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2981.14" data-end="2983.33">I've used it like three times and it's</span> <span data-start="2983.33" data-end="2985.22">just like so nice to use you want to use</span> <span data-start="2985.22" data-end="2987.17">it this stuff actually really works and</span> <span data-start="2987.17" data-end="2989.21">that then bought him time to go ahead</span> <span data-start="2989.21" data-end="2990.92">and like innovate and add features and</span> <span data-start="2990.92" data-end="2993.86">stuff so this like directly really</span> <span data-start="2993.86" data-end="2995.96">really matters but I'm not trying to say</span> <span data-start="2995.96" data-end="2997.91">just like make put lipstick on a pig and</span> <span data-start="2997.91" data-end="2999.05">make it look better because that goes</span> <span data-start="2999.05" data-end="3005.4">wrong too</span> <span data-start="3005.41" data-end="3008.21">so remember the campaign it was all</span> <span data-start="3008.21" data-end="3009.98">about the WoW starts now and all this</span> <span data-start="3009.98" data-end="3012.68">kind of stuff it's not just about the</span> <span data-start="3012.68" data-end="3014.24">visual side of things you've got to get</span> <span data-start="3014.24" data-end="3018.44">the into the integration stuff worked</span> <span data-start="3018.44" data-end="3021.14">out well and jef raskin talks a lot</span> <span data-start="3021.14" data-end="3023.39">about this and i kind of shows you why</span> <span data-start="3023.39" data-end="3025.55">vista did so badly is like the</span> <span data-start="3025.55" data-end="3028.43">experience of the interaction just</span> <span data-start="3028.43" data-end="3030.74">poisons you and like we've all been</span> <span data-start="3030.74" data-end="3031.76">there we've been working with different</span> <span data-start="3031.76" data-end="3033.56">programs you get frustrated you want to</span> <span data-start="3033.56" data-end="3035.24">like throw the mouse out the window kind</span> <span data-start="3035.24" data-end="3037.28">of thing mr. did that all the time right</span> <span data-start="3037.28" data-end="3038.75">we're just like pop up are you sure you</span> <span data-start="3038.75" data-end="3042.65">want to click on that go away and so we</span> <span data-start="3042.65" data-end="3043.58">need to make sure that we obviously</span> <span data-start="3043.58" data-end="3045.14">don't poison our users and given</span> <span data-start="3045.14" data-end="3047.69">fantastic experiences so there's</span> <span data-start="3047.69" data-end="3049.28">actually kind of two sides to design</span> <span data-start="3049.28" data-end="3051.77">there's the visual staff which I'm never</span> <span data-start="3051.77" data-end="3053.119">going to be good at I just don't have</span> <span data-start="3053.119" data-end="3055.55">that feel that's just like a fashion and</span> <span data-start="3055.55" data-end="3057.05">we talked about that's importance but</span> <span data-start="3057.05" data-end="3059.09">then there's the interaction design</span> <span data-start="3059.09" data-end="3061.25">which is the geeky nerds like watching</span> <span data-start="3061.25" data-end="3063.91">exactly how people interact with things</span> <span data-start="3063.91" data-end="3067.28">and yakima nielsen talks about you know</span> <span data-start="3067.28" data-end="3069.26">one of the laws which is you have to</span> <span data-start="3069.26" data-end="3071.24">make sure every interaction there</span> <span data-start="3071.24" data-end="3074.15">directly manipulate in those objects if</span> <span data-start="3074.15" data-end="3076.73">you're able to do that the user's brain</span> <span data-start="3076.73" data-end="3078.53">can stay in the flow and they feel like</span> <span data-start="3078.53" data-end="3080.96">they're really enjoying that experience</span> <span data-start="3080.96" data-end="3083.06">and this again ties back to the fact</span> <span data-start="3083.06" data-end="3084.98">that now we can do that with web workers</span> <span data-start="3084.98" data-end="3087.08">and the javascript engines we can make</span> <span data-start="3087.08" data-end="3088.28">sure that we do this kind of stuff</span> <span data-start="3088.28" data-end="3090.53">whereas before you think about you know</span> <span data-start="3090.53" data-end="3092.359">even before ajax every different thing</span> <span data-start="3092.359" data-end="3095.359">you did record every a reload like that</span> <span data-start="3095.359" data-end="3097.01">would obviously be longer than that for</span> <span data-start="3097.01" data-end="3099.619">every every bit of time and there's a</span> <span data-start="3099.619" data-end="3101.119">little tool out there this on zai Jian</span> <span data-start="3101.119" data-end="3103.49">on Ben's I that allow you to kind of</span> <span data-start="3103.49" data-end="3104.9">play around with that just click on</span> <span data-start="3104.9" data-end="3106.43">these things and kind of see how you</span> <span data-start="3106.43" data-end="3108.74">feel when you're working with these</span> <span data-start="3108.74" data-end="3111.08">different kind of time lapses and you</span> <span data-start="3111.08" data-end="3113.359">really notice the difference you know</span> <span data-start="3113.359" data-end="3115.369">particularly around here been you know</span> <span data-start="3115.369" data-end="3117.26">thinks is a really high tuned individual</span> <span data-start="3117.26" data-end="3118.82">so he even knows the difference up here</span> <span data-start="3118.82" data-end="3122">but you really notice it really really</span> <span data-start="3122" data-end="3126.29">matters the other kind of thing that we</span> <span data-start="3126.29" data-end="3128.33">have to do is make sure that everything</span> <span data-start="3128.33" data-end="3130.7">a user does is sacred and so we see that</span> <span data-start="3130.7" data-end="3132.23">in different UI is with</span> <span data-start="3132.23" data-end="3134.359">you know saving stayed and restoring our</span> <span data-start="3134.359" data-end="3136.94">sessions now and getting rid of the</span> <span data-start="3136.94" data-end="3139.07">notion of actually saving something and</span> <span data-start="3139.07" data-end="3141.53">we all know how frustrating this is like</span> <span data-start="3141.53" data-end="3143.24">the web has this notion of sessions but</span> <span data-start="3143.24" data-end="3145.46">users don't care about it and it drives</span> <span data-start="3145.46" data-end="3147.29">me nuts when I go to something like a</span> <span data-start="3147.29" data-end="3149.18">travel side and I get a phone call and I</span> <span data-start="3149.18" data-end="3151.22">come back and says sorry all that stuff</span> <span data-start="3151.22" data-end="3153.08">you put in like got to do it again and</span> <span data-start="3153.08" data-end="3155.54">we run into this again and again and</span> <span data-start="3155.54" data-end="3159.29">again and so we have to make sure that</span> <span data-start="3159.29" data-end="3160.76">we actually do a better job and these</span> <span data-start="3160.76" data-end="3162.29">are just kind of two there's millions of</span> <span data-start="3162.29" data-end="3163.1">things we could talk about with</span> <span data-start="3163.1" data-end="3165.26">interaction design but if we make sure</span> <span data-start="3165.26" data-end="3167.99">that we do good on the responsiveness</span> <span data-start="3167.99" data-end="3170.03">which we can now do on the web and make</span> <span data-start="3170.03" data-end="3172.76">sure we really take good care of users</span> <span data-start="3172.76" data-end="3176.6">input we can get a long way so it feels</span> <span data-start="3176.6" data-end="3179.03">like when we first started to do browser</span> <span data-start="3179.03" data-end="3180.77">apps like nothing changed for like ten</span> <span data-start="3180.77" data-end="3183.17">years in the browser I was incredibly</span> <span data-start="3183.17" data-end="3185.15">frustrated in place for us as web</span> <span data-start="3185.15" data-end="3186.56">developers to try and innovate and</span> <span data-start="3186.56" data-end="3189.08">deliver great applications and then Ajax</span> <span data-start="3189.08" data-end="3191.33">came along which made the winter a</span> <span data-start="3191.33" data-end="3193.07">little bit nicer to live with the</span> <span data-start="3193.07" data-end="3194.92">browser still weren't really helping us</span> <span data-start="3194.92" data-end="3198.26">but now we've got all of these fantastic</span> <span data-start="3198.26" data-end="3200.09">technologies that all these great you</span> <span data-start="3200.09" data-end="3201.109">know speakers are going to be talking</span> <span data-start="3201.109" data-end="3202.25">around you guys are going to be using</span> <span data-start="3202.25" data-end="3204.44">though enable us to finally deliver</span> <span data-start="3204.44" data-end="3206.81">these expectations that are going to</span> <span data-start="3206.81" data-end="3208.609">take us to the next level and they're</span> <span data-start="3208.609" data-end="3210.26">just going to make the web amazing and</span> <span data-start="3210.26" data-end="3212.21">make people's lives actually a lot</span> <span data-start="3212.21" data-end="3214.91">better and so you know the web has a ton</span> <span data-start="3214.91" data-end="3216.89">of stuff going for it right now I'm</span> <span data-start="3216.89" data-end="3219.35">incredibly excited about where we're</span> <span data-start="3219.35" data-end="3222.08">going and most importantly you've got</span> <span data-start="3222.08" data-end="3224.21">job security on your side because</span> <span data-start="3224.21" data-end="3227.06">there's a TV show in the US that's a</span> <span data-start="3227.06" data-end="3229.58">sci-fi show and if you zoom into the</span> <span data-start="3229.58" data-end="3232.07">user experience of the the show this is</span> <span data-start="3232.07" data-end="3236.3">in like 2500 they use JavaScript so make</span> <span data-start="3236.3"
