<p><span data-start="619.82" data-end="625.22">A service worker is a script installed via a web page that runs in the background.</span> <span data-start="625.22" data-end="630.829">It gives you the power to control asset caching, to handle requests from pages and workers</span> <span data-start="630.829" data-end="637.779">when offline, and to respond to incoming push notifications.</span> <span data-start="637.779" data-end="643.91">Service worker is a type of worker, so it doesn't have access to the DOM, AJAX or local</span> <span data-start="643.91" data-end="649.899">storage but it does have post message for communicating with clients, fetch for accessing</span> <span data-start="649.899" data-end="655.089">the network and IndexedDB for storage.</span> <span data-start="655.089" data-end="660.569">Service worker has a life cycle which starts with registration, when the file is downloaded</span> <span data-start="660.569" data-end="668">and executed; it then enters the installation phase when the install event is triggered,</span> <span data-start="668" data-end="672.81">and if there is already an older version installed and it's actively controlling clients, the</span> <span data-start="672.81" data-end="680.509">service worker enters what's called the waiting phase until all clients have disconnected.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="680.509" data-end="685.99">When it's safe to start controlling new clients the activate event is triggered and the service</span> <span data-start="685.99" data-end="689.25">worker enters the activation phase.</span> <span data-start="689.25" data-end="696">Finally, when the activation phase is over, the service worker is known as running, and</span> <span data-start="696" data-end="700.99">able respond to client network requests via the fetch event handler.</span> <span data-start="700.99" data-end="708.1">Now, service worker also has new toys including a cache API for storing network requests and</span> <span data-start="708.1" data-end="713.92">responses, a clients API for managing connective clients, which are pages and workers, and</span> <span data-start="713.92" data-end="719.949">a push API for managing push notifications from remote servers.</span> <span data-start="719.949" data-end="723.819">So with that out of the way we can get down to business.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="723.819" data-end="729.139">How do we avoid the next zombie apocalypse?</span> <span data-start="729.139" data-end="734.709">Or here are some things I wish I had known before I started with service worker.</span> <span data-start="734.709" data-end="740.959">Rule number 1, in no particular order, understand how promises work but don't use them, use</span> <span data-start="740.959" data-end="748.579">async/await if you can instead.</span> <span data-start="748.579" data-end="753.959">Using async/await can really help make things more legible.</span> <span data-start="753.959" data-end="758.17">Although very few browsers support native async/await, it's just syntactic sugar over</span> <span data-start="758.17" data-end="763.519">generators and promises, and every one that supports service worker will also support</span> <span data-start="763.519" data-end="768.069">async/await.</span> <span data-start="768.069" data-end="773.58">Using Babel with the async-to-generator plugin will do the transformation for you but be</span> <span data-start="773.58" data-end="783.66">aware that this code cannot be uglified — you should use Babili which is another plugin</span> <span data-start="783.66" data-end="788.1">for Babel that you can use for minification instead.</span> <span data-start="788.1" data-end="803.22">Two, don't use while the page is loading.</span> <span data-start="803.22" data-end="809.26">Wait for the window on load event or some other signal before registering.</span> <span data-start="809.26" data-end="813.329">Rule number three: know your dependencies.</span> <span data-start="813.329" data-end="819.809">During the installation phase, passing a promise to event.waituntil will delay service worker</span> <span data-start="819.809" data-end="822.269">activation until it's resolved.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="822.269" data-end="828.709">However, if it's rejected, the service worker will be thrown away and marked redundant.</span> <span data-start="828.709" data-end="834.059">Now, since the installation phase is when you want to pre-cache all your assets, any</span> <span data-start="834.059" data-end="839.089">asset that fails to load will cause a rejection.</span> <span data-start="839.089" data-end="843.619">In this sense, you can think of pre-cached assets as hard dependencies, so you should</span> <span data-start="843.619" data-end="846.699">beware.</span> <span data-start="846.699" data-end="851.41">Rule number 4: cache smarter.</span> <span data-start="851.41" data-end="857.92">When upgrading a service worker, it's common practice to pre-cache assets in a new, uniquely</span> <span data-start="857.92" data-end="863.41">named cache before deleting any old caches during the activation phase.</span> <span data-start="863.41" data-end="869.839">Now, in most cases this is a really good approach but if you release very often you can avoid</span> <span data-start="869.839" data-end="878.559">wasting storage and bandwidth by only fetching new assets and then recycling the old ones.</span> <span data-start="878.559" data-end="883.139">Now you can first create more than one cache to separate versioned assets from those that</span> <span data-start="883.139" data-end="890.079">won't change, and copy versioned assets from the old cache if they already exist.</span> <span data-start="890.079" data-end="899.749">Now, obviously this is not as neat as cache at all, but it is much more efficient.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="899.749" data-end="907.569">Rule number 5: avoid forcing activation for major changes.</span> <span data-start="907.569" data-end="913.939">Forcing activation after an update can break already connected clients if the new service</span> <span data-start="913.939" data-end="918.49">worker is very different from the old version.</span> <span data-start="918.49" data-end="924.36">So you can avoid calling self-.skipWaiting after a major change and consider actually</span> <span data-start="924.36" data-end="932.38">prompting the user to trigger a manual refresh, and that way there won't be any breakage.</span> <span data-start="932.38" data-end="937.399">Rule number 6, use a library for messaging.</span> <span data-start="937.399" data-end="941.75">Sending messages between a service worker and its clients is actually kind of weird.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="941.75" data-end="949.97">The API is a bit hard to work with but using a library like Swivel makes it a lot easier.</span> <span data-start="949.97" data-end="955.11">Number 7: never rename the service worker file.</span> <span data-start="955.11" data-end="959.11">Once the service worker has been installed and activated, it will need to be updated,</span> <span data-start="959.11" data-end="966.309">of course, but often we cache the HTML file that triggers the registration so it would</span> <span data-start="966.309" data-end="973">be difficult to install a new service worker if it had a new name from that HTML file.</span> <span data-start="973" data-end="977.42">So you can avoid this chicken and egg problem by making sure that the service worker script</span> <span data-start="977.42" data-end="982.82">file name is never unique, it's always the same.</span> <span data-start="982.82" data-end="987.93">Along with that, rule number 8: you have to set correct cache headers because, of course,</span> <span data-start="987.93" data-end="992.809">if the service worker script file names are static and the browser fetches the script</span> <span data-start="992.809" data-end="997.519">through the browser cache before going to the network you will need to correctly set</span> <span data-start="997.519" data-end="1002.959">cache control headers to prevent the browser from caching outdated versions.</span> <span data-start="1002.959" data-end="1011.22">As a precaution, to avoid accidentally installing a service worker for days, weeks or months,</span> <span data-start="1011.22" data-end="1018.12">caches will be bypassed if the script is older than 24 hours, regardless of what you set.</span> <span data-start="1018.12" data-end="1024.339">Now, cash invalidation is always tricky as we know, so in the future browsers will be</span> <span data-start="1024.339" data-end="1029.89">using cache busting always by default to ensure that the service worker script files are always</span> <span data-start="1029.89" data-end="1033.2">up-to-date.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1033.2" data-end="1037.99">Rule number 9: invalidate your service worker when updated.</span> <span data-start="1037.99" data-end="1042.57">The service worker will be updated if it is byte different from previous versions.</span> <span data-start="1042.57" data-end="1048.63">Now, a simple pattern you can use to treat the service worker as a boot loader by using</span> <span data-start="1048.63" data-end="1054.82">import scripts and version dependencies, and that's all you have to have in your service</span> <span data-start="1054.82" data-end="1055.87">worker file.</span> <span data-start="1055.87" data-end="1060.97">Rule number 10: add a feature flag or kill switch.</span> <span data-start="1060.97" data-end="1064.49">This one is important.</span> <span data-start="1064.49" data-end="1070.67">Having an easy way to disable existing service workers is a life saver really.</span> <span data-start="1070.67" data-end="1075.83">Add a feature flag to control on registration.</span> <span data-start="1075.83" data-end="1084.16">Keep a no op service worker handy in case you have to have a quick deploy, or even better,</span> <span data-start="1084.16" data-end="1093.04">have a service worker phone home to check its version then force an update if it's outdated.</span> <span data-start="1093.04" data-end="1096.92">Rule number 11: don't cache bad responses.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1365.32" data-end="1369.09">Undefined as not a function.</span> <span data-start="1369.09" data-end="1375.05">Unfortunately a catch was also added to the promised chain in order to report install</span> <span data-start="1375.05" data-end="1380.43">errors, but the error was never thrown further up the chain.</span> <span data-start="1380.43" data-end="1386.7">And the service worker was installed instead of thrown away.</span> <span data-start="1386.7" data-end="1393.16">That explains how some clients became infected with a broken service worker, and based on</span> <span data-start="1393.16" data-end="1399.41">the number of errors reported it's clear that most of the infected were soon cured, but</span> <span data-start="1399.41" data-end="1407.48">it's still a mystery to me as to why or how a small number became permanently cursed.</span> <span data-start="1407.48" data-end="1414.13">Now, even after trying to install an empty service worker, then eventually a kill switch</span> <span data-start="1414.13" data-end="1419.75">to unregister it completely, that broken file still haunts me and probably will until every</span> <span data-start="1419.75" data-end="1423.27">one of those devices is retired.</span> <span data-start="1423.27" data-end="1428.83">[Laughter] Now, even if the details are lost on you,</span> <span data-start="1428.83" data-end="1438.08">I hope I've made my case that service worker is a complex beast.</span> <span data-start="1438.08" data-end="1443.86">It is awesome, but it's kind of awesome like the way a chainsaw is awesome.</span> <span data-start="1443.86" data-end="1448.27">[Laughter] It's really powerful, and really easy to lose</span> <span data-start="1448.27" data-end="1453.12">a hand, a foot, maybe some toes.</span> </p>
