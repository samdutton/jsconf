<p><span data-start="8.3" data-end="13.139">hey everyone so I'm Alex I'm from the</span> <span data-start="13.139" data-end="15.87">kendo UI team and i'm here to present to</span> <span data-start="15.87" data-end="20.58">you the kendo UI framework I certainly</span> <span data-start="20.58" data-end="22.92">think that you want to get things done</span> <span data-start="22.92" data-end="24.56">because the other session is about</span> <span data-start="24.56" data-end="27.33">Arduino and QR drones in it's totally</span> <span data-start="27.33" data-end="30.15">awesome and I think that this would be</span> <span data-start="30.15" data-end="34.14">more like getting things done stuff so</span> <span data-start="34.14" data-end="39.899">about can do you I well here's a summary</span> <span data-start="39.899" data-end="42.27">of what I'll talk about so why do we</span> <span data-start="42.27" data-end="45.96">build the kendo UI framework what's</span> <span data-start="45.96" data-end="49.68">currently present in the framework then</span> <span data-start="49.68" data-end="53.039">we'll do a quick demo of the of some of</span> <span data-start="53.039" data-end="56.94">the features then we'll talk about the</span> <span data-start="56.94" data-end="60.449">future and after that you'll be allowed</span> <span data-start="60.449" data-end="65.64">to ask questions so why can do you I</span> <span data-start="65.64" data-end="68.909">it's a framework and there's plenty of</span> <span data-start="68.909" data-end="72.18">them around and you might have noticed</span> <span data-start="72.18" data-end="75.6">that there's one for everything so</span> <span data-start="75.6" data-end="78.99">here's a quick list of some of randomly</span> <span data-start="78.99" data-end="82.53">chosen very popular frameworks it</span> <span data-start="82.53" data-end="84.93">there's everything like there's a</span> <span data-start="84.93" data-end="88.259">taxonomy of framework of features like</span> <span data-start="88.259" data-end="90.9">there's frameworks about templating in</span> <span data-start="90.9" data-end="94.409">there's quite a lot of them and there</span> <span data-start="94.409" data-end="97.049">are also components like jQuery UI which</span> <span data-start="97.049" data-end="100.74">doesn't have a grid and charts and there</span> <span data-start="100.74" data-end="104.189">are different volumes that are providing</span> <span data-start="104.189" data-end="108">such functionality and if you do watch</span> <span data-start="108" data-end="111.81">project and you want all this like</span> <span data-start="111.81" data-end="114.77">template in Cannes UI widgets and</span> <span data-start="114.77" data-end="117.78">charting and grids what do you have to</span> <span data-start="117.78" data-end="120.119">do you have to pull all different</span> <span data-start="120.119" data-end="123.6">versions of these frameworks and there</span> <span data-start="123.6" data-end="125.67">might be incompatibilities they marked</span> <span data-start="125.67" data-end="128.94">different licensing models there there's</span> <span data-start="128.94" data-end="130.47">quite so</span> <span data-start="130.47" data-end="135.05">few things that might go wrong and that</span> <span data-start="135.05" data-end="140.64">could really burden your work so we have</span> <span data-start="140.64" data-end="144.81">a non unified framework so there's a</span> <span data-start="144.81" data-end="147.65">framework for all of these features but</span> <span data-start="147.65" data-end="153.15">they are not in the same place we most</span> <span data-start="153.15" data-end="155.13">of these frameworks are written by</span> <span data-start="155.13" data-end="158.55">really smart and talented individuals</span> <span data-start="158.55" data-end="160.83">but they don't really have a roadmap</span> <span data-start="160.83" data-end="166.23">that they fall and now some of them do</span> <span data-start="166.23" data-end="170.01">but most of them don't and of course</span> <span data-start="170.01" data-end="173.43">there's the support part of it so if you</span> <span data-start="173.43" data-end="175.23">want support you have to purchase it</span> <span data-start="175.23" data-end="178.38">most no most commonly from a different</span> <span data-start="178.38" data-end="180.84">company that for example for jQuery UI</span> <span data-start="180.84" data-end="184.02">you have to purchase it the support from</span> <span data-start="184.02" data-end="185.97">my pen tool which is a great company but</span> <span data-start="185.97" data-end="190.85">it's still different a different persons</span> <span data-start="190.85" data-end="194.09">who are not writing called codes in the</span> <span data-start="194.09" data-end="197.91">jQuery why so if you have a professional</span> <span data-start="197.91" data-end="201.269">project you usually don't want to risk</span> <span data-start="201.269" data-end="204.3">anything and you don't want to waste</span> <span data-start="204.3" data-end="207.78">your time fixing other people's books in</span> <span data-start="207.78" data-end="211.19">the components so we had a talk about</span> <span data-start="211.19" data-end="215.54">one hour go with the guy he told me</span> <span data-start="215.54" data-end="220.53">we're using that that tree view from a</span> <span data-start="220.53" data-end="223.68">tree view plugin but we had to fix other</span> <span data-start="223.68" data-end="226.799">people's code in order to get our</span> <span data-start="226.799" data-end="229.79">application going so that's a problem</span> <span data-start="229.79" data-end="235.23">and our intense with Jake with kendo UI</span> <span data-start="235.23" data-end="240.33">is go from this to this so one framework</span> <span data-start="240.33" data-end="242.34">one unified that contains all the</span> <span data-start="242.34" data-end="246.51">functionality needs about for your next</span> <span data-start="246.51" data-end="249.66">vacation with support and with</span> <span data-start="249.66" data-end="254.01">predictable schedule and let me tell him</span> <span data-start="254.01" data-end="256.47">these things so we haven't missed a</span> <span data-start="256.47" data-end="258.78">release in the last three</span> <span data-start="258.78" data-end="262.68">earth at all so we say it's one release</span> <span data-start="262.68" data-end="266.97">four months that's it we ship another</span> <span data-start="266.97" data-end="269.25">thing to notice telerik the company I</span> <span data-start="269.25" data-end="273.389">work for is worth lira noun for its</span> <span data-start="273.389" data-end="275.52">support so you get support from</span> <span data-start="275.52" data-end="278.46">developers of the frameworks that you</span> <span data-start="278.46" data-end="282.84">use you publish about you submit a bug</span> <span data-start="282.84" data-end="286.68">gets fixed and that's 24 hours for so</span> <span data-start="286.68" data-end="291.84">you get it in on the next day most so</span> <span data-start="291.84" data-end="294.54">let's delve in some technical stuff so</span> <span data-start="294.54" data-end="298.22">what is scandal you I can do I is a</span> <span data-start="298.22" data-end="301.49">framework built on top of jQuery and</span> <span data-start="301.49" data-end="306.96">well we use a lot of html5 features but</span> <span data-start="306.96" data-end="311.13">black attacks but also new JavaScript</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="311.13" data-end="314.85">API is that have come with html5</span> <span data-start="314.85" data-end="318.72">movement and it's also quite a lot of</span> <span data-start="318.72" data-end="322.229">css3 features so we'll keep the buzzword</span> <span data-start="322.229" data-end="326.49">bingo let's say and with after all the</span> <span data-start="326.49" data-end="329.46">targets the create a unified framework</span> <span data-start="329.46" data-end="332.46">that contains all this stuff so what are</span> <span data-start="332.46" data-end="334.22">the components of this framework so</span> <span data-start="334.22" data-end="337.65">firstly we have UI widgets there is</span> <span data-start="337.65" data-end="340.53">currently 13 UI widgets and we point out</span> <span data-start="340.53" data-end="345.75">plenty more most notably we have a fully</span> <span data-start="345.75" data-end="349.979">functional grids and a chart right now</span> <span data-start="349.979" data-end="352.53">we're improving the child support pie</span> <span data-start="352.53" data-end="355.2">chart with our next release which will</span> <span data-start="355.2" data-end="359.16">be next week we also have a data source</span> <span data-start="359.16" data-end="362.61">which abstracts away all the data</span> <span data-start="362.61" data-end="364.65">operations so we have this source that</span> <span data-start="364.65" data-end="368.25">pulls data from XML or remote services</span> <span data-start="368.25" data-end="373.77">or perhaps in the future from down I</span> <span data-start="373.77" data-end="379.289">think and it strikes the sorting the</span> <span data-start="379.289" data-end="382.47">filtering the grouping of this data for</span> <span data-start="382.47" data-end="384.87">all other parts of the compound</span> <span data-start="384.87" data-end="388.35">of the framework this is single point of</span> <span data-start="388.35" data-end="390.39">failure if you have a problem with your</span> <span data-start="390.39" data-end="394.77">data you know is the date source we also</span> <span data-start="394.77" data-end="397.68">have templates which we spent quite a</span> <span data-start="397.68" data-end="400.08">lot for which we spent quite a lot of</span> <span data-start="400.08" data-end="403.02">time and just for making them really</span> <span data-start="403.02" data-end="408.81">really fast so let me show that so this</span> <span data-start="408.81" data-end="415.41">is a</span> <span data-start="415.42" data-end="423.86">that's not visible on the screen it</span> <span data-start="423.87" data-end="430.03">okay they're fast so next what are the</span> <span data-start="430.03" data-end="432.88">benefits of this framework after all we</span> <span data-start="432.88" data-end="436.11">want to hear for unified framework that</span> <span data-start="436.11" data-end="439.24">has less blue code so each component of</span> <span data-start="439.24" data-end="440.59">the framework knows about the other</span> <span data-start="440.59" data-end="444.28">components and this means that the grid</span> <span data-start="444.28" data-end="447.66">will know about the data source and you</span> <span data-start="447.66" data-end="450.07">simply attach data source to the great</span> <span data-start="450.07" data-end="452.25">you won't have to write any code that</span> <span data-start="452.25" data-end="456.66">merges the two and also the grid can</span> <span data-start="456.66" data-end="460.15">fully understand templates and tempting</span> <span data-start="460.15" data-end="464.47">language it's built for speed which you</span> <span data-start="464.47" data-end="468.43">didn't see but i'll be sure to show you</span> <span data-start="468.43" data-end="472.15">to you at the booth downstairs if you</span> <span data-start="472.15" data-end="474.64">come and visit us it's familiar to</span> <span data-start="474.64" data-end="477.61">jquery dance because our IP eyes are</span> <span data-start="477.61" data-end="480.7">really close to the jquery development</span> <span data-start="480.7" data-end="484.78">model with chaining and their each</span> <span data-start="484.78" data-end="487.84">widget is simply a plug-in a jquery</span> <span data-start="487.84" data-end="492.82">plugin that can extend your HTML we've</span> <span data-start="492.82" data-end="494.83">gotten aggressive roadmaps already set</span> <span data-start="494.83" data-end="498.61">and they're supported so let's do them</span> <span data-start="498.61" data-end="501.55">the source of the demo is available at</span> <span data-start="501.55" data-end="504.04">give her and that's a short year of that</span> <span data-start="504.04" data-end="512.26">and here it is so that's basic page that</span> <span data-start="512.26" data-end="517.8">uses the candle component so we have a</span> <span data-start="517.8" data-end="521.26">html5 doctype etc we've got to style</span> <span data-start="521.26" data-end="523.42">sheets one that handles all the</span> <span data-start="523.42" data-end="527.14">positioning and layout that's the kind</span> <span data-start="527.14" data-end="530.44">of common CSS and one that handles the</span> <span data-start="530.44" data-end="534.04">teaming of the library so right now we</span> <span data-start="534.04" data-end="538.63">have three different teams but with farm</span> <span data-start="538.63" data-end="541.48">on improving that situation</span> <span data-start="541.48" data-end="544.13">after that we've got the only dependency</span> <span data-start="544.13" data-end="548.18">of jQuery and all the components of the</span> <span data-start="548.18" data-end="550.39">framework bundled together in one file</span> <span data-start="550.39" data-end="554.05">and that's it with that you can start</span> <span data-start="554.05" data-end="558.26">writing can do code instead of watching</span> <span data-start="558.26"
