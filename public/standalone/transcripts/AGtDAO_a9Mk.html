data-start="821.82" data-end="822.33">we gave you</span> <span data-start="822.33" data-end="824.19">we're gonna say this piece of art is</span> <span data-start="824.19" data-end="825.3">something you might be interested in</span> <span data-start="825.3" data-end="827.49">based on what was strongest in your</span> <span data-start="827.49" data-end="830.04">classifications and then whoop and then</span> <span data-start="830.04" data-end="832.529">we created a path through other pieces</span> <span data-start="832.529" data-end="834.63">of art that's sort of like provided this</span> <span data-start="834.63" data-end="836.13">sort of like trail that you could follow</span> <span data-start="836.13" data-end="840.17">from one our piece of art to the next</span> <span data-start="840.17" data-end="842.88">this was an educational project so what</span> <span data-start="842.88" data-end="844.65">we really wanted to do was to provide</span> <span data-start="844.65" data-end="846.69">people a way to question the technology</span> <span data-start="846.69" data-end="849.27">and have it be personal so that people</span> <span data-start="849.27" data-end="851.85">could have a further more articulate</span> <span data-start="851.85" data-end="854.1">discussion in the community so we also</span> <span data-start="854.1" data-end="855.3">wanted to highlight where our</span> <span data-start="855.3" data-end="857.7">technologies failed I'll go into that a</span> <span data-start="857.7" data-end="860.85">little bit and then also we provided</span> <span data-start="860.85" data-end="863.04">details about how the artwork was chosen</span> <span data-start="863.04" data-end="865.02">a very technical level if people wanted</span> <span data-start="865.02" data-end="867.51">to get them out as well</span> <span data-start="867.51" data-end="868.89">so cool so one of the things that we</span> <span data-start="868.89" data-end="871.17">really wanted to do was to say you know</span> <span data-start="871.17" data-end="873.12">what are the ways that we can use to</span> <span data-start="873.12" data-end="876.36">find art that we can match to people and</span> <span data-start="876.36" data-end="878.31">so one of the techniques that we came</span> <span data-start="878.31" data-end="879.45">across was something called reverse</span> <span data-start="879.45" data-end="881.39">image search and so reverse image search</span> <span data-start="881.39" data-end="884.37">essentially you take an image you use an</span> <span data-start="884.37" data-end="887.88">object detection neural network and you</span> <span data-start="887.88" data-end="890.13">kind of short-circuit it to provide you</span> <span data-start="890.13" data-end="893.46">with numbers instead of names of things</span> <span data-start="893.46" data-end="895.5">and then with those numbers you can sort</span> <span data-start="895.5" data-end="897">of compare them to other objects and</span> <span data-start="897" data-end="899.73">find in the data set other objects that</span> <span data-start="899.73" data-end="901.2">look the same so I'll just kind of let</span> <span data-start="901.2" data-end="905.22">that let that picture clean itself one</span> <span data-start="905.22" data-end="906.42">of the object neural the neural networks</span> <span data-start="906.42" data-end="908.55">are used was called vgg 16 it's 16</span> <span data-start="908.55" data-end="910.74">layers you slice off the last layer that</span> <span data-start="910.74" data-end="912.18">basically tells you what the thing is</span> <span data-start="912.18" data-end="914.52">and you're left with it with a giant</span> <span data-start="914.52" data-end="917.03">vector for every object that's numbers</span> <span data-start="917.03" data-end="919.89">here's another example of finding stuff</span> <span data-start="919.89" data-end="921.65">that's similar to the vase on the left</span> <span data-start="921.65" data-end="924">so once you've got these numbers you</span> <span data-start="924" data-end="925.32">basically have coordinates in this</span> <span data-start="925.32" data-end="927.6">multi-dimensional space and you can use</span> <span data-start="927.6" data-end="931.41">traditional distance algorithms to see</span> <span data-start="931.41" data-end="934.29">what's close to what and then once you</span> <span data-start="934.29" data-end="936.24">do something called PCA analysis or</span> <span data-start="936.24" data-end="937.68">principal component analysis you can</span> <span data-start="937.68" data-end="939.9">slam you know four thousand dimensions</span> <span data-start="939.9" data-end="942.12">down into two dimensions using this</span> <span data-start="942.12" data-end="945.24">algorithm which essentially maintains</span> <span data-start="945.24" data-end="947.7">closeness of points in multi-dimensional</span> <span data-start="947.7" data-end="950.37">space in the two dimensional translation</span> <span data-start="950.37" data-end="952.23">and then once you're in two dimensions</span> <span data-start="952.23" data-end="953.55">you can use traditional graphing</span> <span data-start="953.55" data-end="955.62">algorithm or graph algorithms to find</span> <span data-start="955.62" data-end="957.81">shortest paths like you would to find a</span> <span data-start="957.81" data-end="960.9">route through a city so in this case we</span> <span data-start="960.9" data-end="962.61">have a picture of a person you may have</span> <span data-start="962.61" data-end="965.28">heard of him and the and a vase on the</span> <span data-start="965.28" data-end="966.69">right hand side and we tried to find</span> <span data-start="966.69" data-end="968.7">items in the museum collection that</span> <span data-start="968.7" data-end="970.14">would sort of like transition from one</span> <span data-start="970.14" data-end="972.15">to the next I'm not sure how convincing</span> <span data-start="972.15" data-end="974.45">this is I kind of think it's convincing</span> <span data-start="974.45" data-end="977.34">maybe it's like bias on me for selecting</span> <span data-start="977.34" data-end="979.83">this but anyway you kind of get the</span> <span data-start="979.83" data-end="982.68">picture this is how we selected art so</span> <span data-start="982.68" data-end="986.49">lessons learned we had to try a lot of</span> <span data-start="986.49" data-end="989.61">different ways to try to find things</span> <span data-start="989.61" data-end="991.92">that would work — Matt — convincingly</span> <span data-start="991.92" data-end="994.02">match you to something that's in the art</span> <span data-start="994.02" data-end="995.97">right — a piece of art and once we got</span> <span data-start="995.97" data-end="997.35">to this point we're like yeah that's</span> <span data-start="997.35" data-end="998.76">pretty good Zuckerberg looks like that</span> <span data-start="998.76" data-end="1001.18">guy so okay we're like</span> <span data-start="1001.18" data-end="1004.24">we're done alright but there's also</span> <span data-start="1004.24" data-end="1009.88">mistakes that are made and I should have</span> <span
