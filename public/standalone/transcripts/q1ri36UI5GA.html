data-end="236.199">strictly a front-end guy like having</span> <span data-start="236.199" data-end="238.06">done C since college I'm describing</span> <span data-start="238.06" data-end="240.79">myself and then I jumped into it and I</span> <span data-start="240.79" data-end="243.18">was like alright I can do this right but</span> <span data-start="243.18" data-end="247.75">it it's hard and the people who know see</span> <span data-start="247.75" data-end="250.299">here are gonna be like well you can</span> <span data-start="250.299" data-end="252.849">leave I'm sorry cuz it sucks</span> <span data-start="252.849" data-end="254.859">and it's frustrating and but it's</span> <span data-start="254.859" data-end="257.079">awesome because when you get into it</span> <span data-start="257.079" data-end="258.31">when you get back into it and you feel</span> <span data-start="258.31" data-end="261.039">you see stuff working and you run a test</span> <span data-start="261.039" data-end="264.61">of a JavaScript module versus a C module</span> <span data-start="264.61" data-end="266.38">and you get like you know</span> <span data-start="266.38" data-end="268.36">orders of magnitude speed-up you feel</span> <span data-start="268.36" data-end="271.57">like a badass right so the third point I</span> <span data-start="271.57" data-end="273.07">think is the most important which is C</span> <span data-start="273.07" data-end="277.3">in C++ code actually exists and runs and</span> <span data-start="277.3" data-end="279.46">works right now whereas we're working</span> <span data-start="279.46" data-end="281.65">with JavaScript which doesn't have any</span> <span data-start="281.65" data-end="284.35">libraries right so the reason I'm giving</span> <span data-start="284.35" data-end="285.61">this talk and the reason that you guys</span> <span data-start="285.61" data-end="288.7">keep writing writing add-ons is to make</span> <span data-start="288.7" data-end="291.1">libraries for node right instead of</span> <span data-start="291.1" data-end="292.45">writing them in JavaScript which is</span> <span data-start="292.45" data-end="295.36">really fun and really cool use the ones</span> <span data-start="295.36" data-end="297.01">that are already there and

data-end="302.77">finally you can speak intelligently</span> <span data-start="302.77" data-end="305.26">about why you hate to write C and C++</span> <span data-start="305.26" data-end="310.09">which I do all the time so so for the</span> <span data-start="310.09" data-end="312.16">for the majority of these examples I'm</span> <span data-start="312.16" data-end="314.92">gonna be using bcrypt people familiar</span> <span data-start="314.92" data-end="315.55">with bcrypt</span> <span data-start="315.55" data-end="318.58">pretty much so essentially it allows you</span> <span

data-start="1236.23" data-end="1236.65">here</span> <span data-start="1236.65" data-end="1239.47">but as you guys dig in like you know I'm</span> <span data-start="1239.47" data-end="1240.49">trying to get the conversation started</span> <span data-start="1240.49" data-end="1242.11">here so I know about this stuff when you</span> <span data-start="1242.11" data-end="1243.7">run into it like please let's starts</span> <span data-start="1243.7" data-end="1245.08">talking about it</span> <span data-start="1245.08" data-end="1248.71">so all right there's lots more slides</span> <span data-start="1248.71" data-end="1250.9">but let's let's stop and kind of look at</span> <span data-start="1250.9" data-end="1251.95">some code here and see if we can get</span> <span data-start="1251.95" data-end="1254.8">through at least a little bit right all</span> <span data-start="1254.8" data-end="1258.31">right so I've got I've got bcrypt here</span> <span data-start="1258.31" data-end="1259.96">right</span> <span data-start="1259.96" data-end="1262.5">there's several files here there is</span> <span data-start="1262.5" data-end="1265.15">there's a there's a dot H file which is</span> <span data-start="1265.15" data-end="1268.21">the headers for Blowfish and bcrypt</span> <span data-start="1268.21" data-end="1271.27">there's bcrypt CC which is the actual</span> <span data-start="1271.27" data-end="1273.1">implementation of bcrypt it has those</span> <span data-start="1273.1" data-end="1275.26">two that gin salt and that encrypt</span> <span data-start="1275.26" data-end="1276.91">function and see that I showed before</span> <span data-start="1276.91" data-end="1283.6">and there's Blowfish here so this is the</span> <span data-start="1283.6" data-end="1287.23">that's the the best extent of the C</span> <span data-start="1287.23" data-end="1289.72">library that's it right and then these</span> <span data-start="1289.72" data-end="1293.2">two files are your node add-on so these</span> <span data-start="1293.2" data-end="1295.27">five files if you put the right things</span> <span data-start="1295.27" data-end="1297.34">in them you get this little module that</span> <span data-start="1297.34" data-end="1299.2">will do B crypt for you and I think</span> <span data-start="1299.2" data-end="1299.95">that's really cool</span> <span data-start="1299.95" data-end="1303.46">so let's see how far I can get hang on</span> <span data-start="1303.46" data-end="1313.88">just a second</span> <span data-start="1313.89" data-end="1317.58">hello can hear alright cool cool uh</span> <span data-start="1317.58" data-end="1320.11">those are my slides let's get rid of</span> <span data-start="1320.11" data-end="1324.76">those this is Emacs oh god help me if I</span> <span data-start="1324.76" data-end="1328.57">can't get through this but yeah I'm</span> <span data-start="1328.57" data-end="1330.88">gonna blow them up um let me just find</span> <span data-start="1330.88" data-end="1336.4">what I need first let's look at the H</span> <span data-start="1336.4" data-end="1341.85">file which I don't have open this week</span> <span data-start="1341.85" data-end="1346.08">alright so source the Crypt node H</span> <span data-start="1346.08" data-end="1348.22">alright so here's our here's our header</span> <span data-start="1348.22" data-end="1349.57">file right here's what we want our</span> <span data-start="1349.57" data-end="1352.15">module to do it's gonna have a class</span> <span data-start="1352.15" data-end="1355.21">it's gonna be called bcrypt oh yeah</span> <span data-start="1355.21" data-end="1364.36">sorry there we go yeah all right I do I</span> <span data-start="1364.36" data-end="1365.92">do use Emacs I don't have to blow it up</span> <span data-start="1365.92" data-end="1371.47">very often so so here we go you've got</span> <span data-start="1371.47" data-end="1374.05">your bcrypt object and you've got uu</span> <span data-start="1374.05" data-end="1376.24">subclassing object wraps so that it will</span> <span data-start="1376.24" data-end="1378.64">behave sanely when you want it to stick</span> <span data-start="1378.64" data-end="1381.19">around right and there's there's three</span> <span data-start="1381.19" data-end="1382.78">there's three functions here right</span> <span data-start="1382.78" data-end="1385.15">there's there's a static version of</span> <span data-start="1385.15" data-end="1386.56">initialize which we'll see in just a</span> <span data-start="1386.56" data-end="1388.14">second that's how you're going to</span> <span data-start="1388.14" data-end="1390.97">essentially initialize your module and</span> <span data-start="1390.97" data-end="1393.99">populate it with methods there's a new</span> <span data-start="1393.99" data-end="1396.73">function which is your constructor for</span> <span data-start="1396.73" data-end="1398.92">this bcrypt object and javascript when</span> <span data-start="1398.92" data-end="1400.81">you call new bcrypt it's gonna call this</span> <span data-start="1400.81" data-end="1403.21">new function okay and there's encrypt</span> <span data-start="1403.21" data-end="1406.78">which is the the v8 version of this</span> <span data-start="1406.78" data-end="1408.34">encrypt function that you're gonna call</span> <span data-start="1408.34" data-end="1409.93">so these are if you remember the slides</span> <span data-start="1409.93" data-end="1411.82">that's the extent of what this module</span> <span data-start="1411.82" data-end="1414.55">does you get an object create one called</span> <span data-start="1414.55" data-end="1417.19">encrypt that's it right so this is the</span> <span data-start="1417.19" data-end="1420.96">extent of what we need for this now</span> <span data-start="1420.96" data-end="1428.88">let's look at the C file</span> <span data-start="1428.89" data-end="1432.11">okay I'm gonna I'm gonna go pretty fast</span> <span data-start="1432.11" data-end="1435.53">there's not a lot to look at here oh if</span> <span data-start="1435.53" data-end="1443.41">this is the wrong file sorry all right</span> <span data-start="1443.42" data-end="1445.94">here's what the C code looks like couple</span> <span data-start="1445.94" data-end="1448.73">headers don't worry about that using</span> <span data-start="1448.73" data-end="1450.53">namespace so you don't have to type v8</span> <span data-start="1450.53" data-end="1452.66">colon colon everywhere note colon colon</span> <span data-start="1452.66" data-end="1453.26">everywhere</span> <span data-start="1453.26" data-end="1455.179">here's your initialize function let me</span> <span data-start="1455.179" data-end="1456.44">start let me start with an it actually</span> <span data-start="1456.44" data-end="1459.35">here's an it way at the bottom it has an</span> <span data-start="1459.35" data-end="1462.74">extern it's called it in it and it gets</span> <span data-start="1462.74" data-end="1464.51">a handle object which is your target</span> <span data-start="1464.51" data-end="1468.38">this maps directly to module dot exports</span> <span data-start="1468.38" data-end="1470.66">it's the it's the JavaScript version of</span> <span data-start="1470.66" data-end="1472.76">that or is the C++ version of that so</span> <span data-start="1472.76" data-end="1474.26">we're gonna hang methods off of here and</span> <span data-start="1474.26" data-end="1476.54">when you do require bcrypt this is the</span> <span data-start="1476.54" data-end="1478.13">object that you're going to get and all</span> <span data-start="1478.13" data-end="1479.6">we do in this init function like I said</span> <span data-start="1479.6" data-end="1481.429">this is just a portal in is we</span> <span data-start="1481.429" data-end="1483.41">initialize it by passing it in to</span> <span data-start="1483.41" data-end="1486.86">initialize right here's where we get in</span> <span data-start="1486.86" data-end="1490.76">this â€” v8 I'm you know I can't do too</span> <span data-start="1490.76" data-end="1492.11">much to explain this because I have five</span> <span data-start="1492.11" data-end="1494.96">minutes but here the here are the things</span> <span data-start="1494.96" data-end="1496.1">that are happening here right we're</span> <span data-start="1496.1" data-end="1497.929">making a function template and what this</span> <span data-start="1497.929" data-end="1499.49">says is we're making a new function</span> <span data-start="1499.49" data-end="1501.559">template and what we're passing it in is</span> <span data-start="1501.559" data-end="1505.429">our function new that's this we're</span> <span data-start="1505.429" data-end="1506.9">telling it we're making a new JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1506.9" data-end="1508.34">function template that's going to be</span> <span data-start="1508.34" data-end="1511.46">mapped directly to this c++ new function</span> <span data-start="1511.46" data-end="1514.669">okay so when we when we call new bcrypt</span> <span data-start="1514.669" data-end="1517.28">it's going to call this we have to do</span> <span data-start="1517.28" data-end="1519.02">some some v8 stuff like set some</span> <span data-start="1519.02" data-end="1521.11">internal fields you'll learn about that</span> <span data-start="1521.11" data-end="1523.58">there's some other this is our Jen salt</span> <span data-start="1523.58" data-end="1526.64">function which I commented out and note</span> <span data-start="1526.64" data-end="1529.19">set prototype method is a one of those</span> <span data-start="1529.19" data-end="1532.64">handy macros that node gives you to do</span> <span data-start="1532.64" data-end="1535.13">these types of things easily so it's</span> <span data-start="1535.13" data-end="1536.96">going to take our function template it's</span> <span data-start="1536.96" data-end="1538.22">going to create a new property call</span> <span data-start="1538.22" data-end="1540.23">encrypt and encrypt is going to match</span> <span data-start="1540.23" data-end="1542.84">map directly to our encrypt function</span> <span data-start="1542.84" data-end="1543.98">that we're going to look at in just a</span> <span data-start="1543.98" data-end="1546.049">second so when you call encrypt on this</span> <span data-start="1546.049" data-end="1548.57">object it's going to map to this C++</span> <span data-start="1548.57" data-end="1551.66">function so so there's that and then</span> <span data-start="1551.66" data-end="1554.15">finally so what we have now what we have</span> <span data-start="1554.15" data-end="1554.97">now is</span> <span data-start="1554.97" data-end="1558.33">a new a new constructor essentially</span> <span data-start="1558.33" data-end="1559.679">right when we do new bcrypt</span> <span data-start="1559.679" data-end="1561.09">that's this this is a function template</span> <span data-start="1561.09" data-end="1565.53">right we've mapped it to encrypt so</span> <span data-start="1565.53" data-end="1566.94">we've got a function called encrypt and</span> <span data-start="1566.94" data-end="1570.299">then what we what we're creating now is</span> <span data-start="1570.299" data-end="1572.429">a new symbol called bcrypt</span> <span data-start="1572.429" data-end="1575.7">mapping it to our constructor and then</span> <span data-start="1575.7" data-end="1576.299">we're good to go</span> <span data-start="1576.299" data-end="1578.13">we've got our constructor here we've got</span> <span data-start="1578.13" data-end="1579.299">our encrypt function here</span> <span data-start="1579.299" data-end="1580.95">we hooked them up and then we've</span> <span data-start="1580.95" data-end="1582.9">attached that off of this target target</span> <span data-start="1582.9" data-end="1586.32">that set B Cribs get function cool</span> <span data-start="1586.32" data-end="1590.33">pretty much sweet all right</span> <span data-start="1590.33" data-end="1595.44">so new is really simple we create our</span> <span data-start="1595.44" data-end="1598.46">handle scope we always need those we</span> <span data-start="1598.46" data-end="1603.27">create a new bcrypt C++ object and then</span> <span data-start="1603.27" data-end="1605.52">we wrap it so this is a function that</span> <span data-start="1605.52" data-end="1607.47">comes off of object wrap and it says</span> <span data-start="1607.47" data-end="1611.07">take the C++ function and wrap this</span> <span data-start="1611.07" data-end="1613.14">handle around it and the handle that we</span> <span data-start="1613.14" data-end="1616.34">want is the context of this new function</span> <span data-start="1616.34" data-end="1619.35">okay so our thought this is going to</span> <span data-start="1619.35" data-end="1620.789">return our handle we're gonna pass it</span> <span data-start="1620.789" data-end="1622.47">into wrap and now we have a JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1622.47" data-end="1625.02">handle with our C object underneath and</span> <span data-start="1625.02" data-end="1626.76">they're gonna go together until they get</span> <span data-start="1626.76" data-end="1630.179">collected okay and then we return our</span> <span data-start="1630.179" data-end="1632.49">object you have to do this in you don't</span> <span data-start="1632.49" data-end="1634.32">have to do this explicitly in JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1634.32" data-end="1637.919">you have to do this in C++ to return</span> <span data-start="1637.919" data-end="1639.799">your object when you do constructors</span> <span data-start="1639.799" data-end="1642.179">encrypt this is the meat of it this is</span> <span data-start="1642.179" data-end="1644.159">the only thing that this this module</span> <span data-start="1644.159" data-end="1648.99">does handle scope unwrap our bcrypt</span> <span data-start="1648.99" data-end="1650.94">object because this we're calling bcrypt</span> <span data-start="1650.94" data-end="1654.78">dot encrypt unwrap it by calling unwrap</span> <span data-start="1654.78" data-end="1656.28">and we got we have to tell it it's a</span> <span data-start="1656.28" data-end="1658.89">bcrypt object right you've seen this now</span> <span data-start="1658.89" data-end="1660.96">we have our c++ object now we're gonna</span> <span data-start="1660.96" data-end="1663.12">pull the arguments out the first one is</span> <span data-start="1663.12" data-end="1666.09">our password second one is our salt all</span> <span data-start="1666.09" data-end="1670.02">of this is dealing with c conversion</span> <span data-start="1670.02" data-end="1673.2">from j s to C types all of this okay</span> <span data-start="1673.2" data-end="1675.6">turn it into a string because it's of</span> <span data-start="1675.6" data-end="1678.48">type handle value value is the highest</span> <span data-start="1678.48" data-end="1679.98">you know the highest
