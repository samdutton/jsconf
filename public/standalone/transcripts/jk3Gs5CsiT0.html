customize</span> <span data-start="48.37" data-end="51.16">the website and it's not that they only</span> <span data-start="51.16" data-end="53.44">can change the color and the icons they</span> <span data-start="53.44" data-end="55.6">can do full fledge customization to</span> <span data-start="55.6" data-end="58.54">really implement their brand identity</span> <span data-start="58.54" data-end="61.149">here for example some examples for</span> <span data-start="61.149" data-end="65.02">example the deal on london olympics 2012</span> <span data-start="65.02" data-end="68.619">they use our system and for example this</span> <span data-start="68.619" data-end="71.17">side is done with server-side javascript</span> <span data-start="71.17" data-end="72.97">pulling in running the

data-start="78.25" data-end="79.72">plastic shoes currently there are</span> <span data-start="79.72" data-end="82.09">customers of us totally different</span> <span data-start="82.09" data-end="85.36">experience then here is its Burton</span> <span data-start="85.36" data-end="87.46">snowboard so if your snow bunny fan you</span> <span data-start="87.46" data-end="89.229">can go to

up</span> <span data-start="94.119" data-end="95.53">because actually say and try to</span> <span data-start="95.53" data-end="99.31">implement at that store then for I one</span> <span data-start="99.31" data-end="101.35">here in Germany and nekem on my command</span> <span data-start="101.35" data-end="103.659">runs on our platform the whole online</span> <span data-start="103.659" data-end="105.159">traffic what they're doing is running</span> <span data-start="105.159" data-end="106.45">through the platform what about should</span> <span data-start="106.45" data-end="110.02">describe over the next minutes and last</span> <span data-start="110.02" data-end="112.54">example as Oliver they have also known</span> <span data-start="112.54"

it's it's not a cookie cutter</span> <span data-start="119.07" data-end="121.329">customization and that's the question</span> <span data-start="121.329" data-end="123.189">will come later is where we where we</span> <span data-start="123.189" data-end="126.009">then use the server side JavaScript just</span> <span data-start="126.009" data-end="127.869">to give you one number is overall we</span> <span data-start="127.869" data-end="129.429">currently deliver roughly in an average</span> <span data-start="129.429" data-end="133.03">day 40 million pages and all these pages</span> <span data-start="133.03" data-end="134.47">are basically rear ended with a</span> <span data-start="134.47" data-end="137.59">server-side JavaScript ok some of them</span> <span data-start="137.59" data-end="138.42">are rendered but</span> <span data-start="138.42" data-end="140.88">one of them are cached but a lot of them</span> <span data-start="140.88" data-end="143.3">are really rendered that's also why I</span> <span data-start="143.3" data-end="146.67">called this the untold story because</span> <span data-start="146.67" data-end="148.14">we're doing this basically a little bit</span> <span data-start="148.14" data-end="150.51">in a secret so even so now server-side</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="150.51" data-end="152.55">JavaScript gets a little bit popularity</span> <span data-start="152.55" data-end="155.1">actually be doing is quite quite for a</span> <span data-start="155.1" data-end="157.23">lot while and we're doing is in the</span> <span data-start="157.23" data-end="159.12">software service environment also what I</span> <span data-start="159.12" data-end="161.069">want to like to talk about what it</span> <span data-start="161.069" data-end="163.05">really means the constraint in a service</span> <span data-start="163.05" data-end="165.9">night in a in a software service</span> <span data-start="165.9" data-end="168.3">environment our constraints are there</span> <span data-start="168.3" data-end="170.4">and what we have to what we should have</span> <span data-start="170.4" data-end="173.58">to acknowledge it's a little bit about</span> <span data-start="173.58" data-end="179.4">the history so everything started back</span> <span data-start="179.4" data-end="182.25">actually in 2004 that's where we</span> <span data-start="182.25" data-end="185.06">actually were founded as a company and</span> <span data-start="185.06" data-end="187.59">what we did we started with an existing</span> <span data-start="187.59" data-end="189.95">ecommerce system which was a classical</span> <span data-start="189.95" data-end="192.87">on-premise software and we said you want</span> <span data-start="192.87" data-end="194.489">to bring this into a software service</span> <span data-start="194.489" data-end="196.68">environment so before customization was</span> <span data-start="196.68" data-end="198.51">stunning done with full fledged java</span> <span data-start="198.51" data-end="201.12">programming and we wanted to find a way</span> <span data-start="201.12" data-end="204.15">how can we bring a customization concept</span> <span data-start="204.15" data-end="206.07">on top of it so that people can</span> <span data-start="206.07" data-end="208.56">configure the business logic and</span> <span data-start="208.56" data-end="211.29">implement it on their own storefronts</span> <span data-start="211.29" data-end="214.32">and also wanted to do things like how</span> <span data-start="214.32" data-end="217.59">can we do background processing of jobs</span> <span data-start="217.59" data-end="219.66">how we can do integration into back-end</span> <span data-start="219.66" data-end="222.03">system so transferring data how can</span> <span data-start="222.03" data-end="223.35">reduce the web service calls so</span> <span data-start="223.35" data-end="224.64">basically everything what you typically</span> <span data-start="224.64" data-end="226.5">have when you want to customize on the</span> <span data-start="226.5" data-end="229.829">server so at that time it was clear we</span> <span data-start="229.829" data-end="232.38">want to have a separate programming</span> <span data-start="232.38" data-end="234.239">language we don't want to open up java</span> <span data-start="234.239" data-end="236.459">java you can do just too much much</span> <span data-start="236.459" data-end="238.739">things in the wrong way we have to run</span> <span data-start="238.739" data-end="240.57">that thing we have to guarantee service</span> <span data-start="240.57" data-end="243">level agreements so there it was clear</span> <span data-start="243" data-end="244.68">that you want to put a specific</span> <span data-start="244.68" data-end="247.62">customization language on top so</span> <span data-start="247.62" data-end="249.15">requirements what we had this verse</span> <span data-start="249.15" data-end="251.579">first of all they were a small team and</span> <span data-start="251.579" data-end="253.859">wanted use something out of the box you</span> <span data-start="253.859" data-end="255.68">wanted to use an own language</span> <span data-start="255.68" data-end="257.85">want to use definitely something open</span> <span data-start="257.85" data-end="259.709">source so that we can debug it that we</span> <span data-start="259.709" data-end="262.5">can fix it it was also that we wanted to</span> <span data-start="262.5" data-end="264.48">have a good control of the execution</span> <span data-start="264.48" data-end="267">that's also one reason why we said it</span> <span data-start="267" data-end="268.62">should be an interpreted language so</span> <span data-start="268.62" data-end="270.93">that we can interfere and better</span> <span data-start="270.93" data-end="273.48">integrate and intercept the execution</span> <span data-start="273.48" data-end="275.91">and also because we had an existing</span> <span data-start="275.91" data-end="277.47">large java system we wanted to have</span> <span data-start="277.47" data-end="279.33">something which fits very well in the</span> <span data-start="279.33" data-end="282.39">child environment absence had time clay</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="282.39" data-end="285.3">JavaScript with lino had a good stable</span> <span data-start="285.3" data-end="287.1">codebase how it's used in a lot of</span> <span data-start="287.1" data-end="288.21">approach that we had fairly good</span> <span data-start="288.21" data-end="291.35">confident in used to going that approach</span> <span data-start="291.35" data-end="293.67">options would have been cheap hyphen</span> <span data-start="293.67" data-end="295.53">project was not very active at that time</span> <span data-start="295.53" data-end="298.05">crocus I was actually not aware it's a</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="298.05" data-end="300.6">PHP interpreter in Java was not aware of</span> <span data-start="300.6" data-end="303.54">that project at a time groovy was pretty</span> <span data-start="303.54" data-end="305.79">coming up at that time but it was not</span> <span data-start="305.79" data-end="307.47">finished yet so it was unclear how</span> <span data-start="307.47" data-end="309.03">popular it would be that would have been</span> <span data-start="309.03" data-end="310.86">another option and actually at that time</span> <span data-start="310.86" data-end="313.38">they existed even a Java interpreter but</span> <span data-start="313.38" data-end="315.18">that was a little bit of a skeptical</span> <span data-start="315.18" data-end="317.61">about it so that's why we choose and</span> <span data-start="317.61" data-end="319.62">JavaScript and as a coincident when you</span> <span data-start="319.62" data-end="322.08">think about 2005 that's also very basic</span> <span data-start="322.08" data-end="325.29">the whole HX started and ver basically</span> <span data-start="325.29" data-end="327.12">JavaScript moved actually from this low</span> <span data-start="327.12" data-end="330.03">dirty language to really a fully accept</span> <span data-start="330.03" data-end="331.59">the length which again into a check so</span> <span data-start="331.59" data-end="333.33">it was a good timing that you also said</span> <span data-start="333.33" data-end="335.1">okay let's pick up JavaScript at that</span> <span data-start="335.1" data-end="339.81">time so with that one we did one that</span> <span data-start="339.81" data-end="342.12">overlies and we try to be not a full</span> <span data-start="342.12" data-end="344.04">book cramming environment and just a</span> <span data-start="344.04" data-end="345.96">little bit of customization everything</span> <span data-start="345.96" data-end="349.08">so my only comment is was on this flush</span> <span data-start="349.08" data-end="351.51">it away are not worth to talk about it</span> <span data-start="351.51" data-end="354.27">and then we came up to the tutor or</span> <span data-start="354.27" data-end="356.43">release and that's what we basically</span> <span data-start="356.43" data-end="358.89">using since 2006 what we have basically</span> <span data-start="358.89" data-end="362.07">in our product what you hear is just a</span> <span data-start="362.07" data-end="364.56">little snippet out of our reference</span> <span data-start="364.56" data-end="366.48">applications or reference application is</span> <span data-start="366.48" data-end="369.03">very showcase a store on here's a little</span> <span data-start="369.03" data-end="371.58">bit thing but you can see how we have a</span> <span data-start="371.58" data-end="373.83">customer we get to the customers profile</span> <span data-start="373.83" data-end="376.47">to the address book then we can get out</span> <span data-start="376.47" data-end="378.12">of the address book we can get an</span> <span data-start="378.12" data-end="381.24">address or a product list is here use</span> <span data-start="381.24" data-end="383.43">for example as a gift registry we can</span> <span data-start="383.43" data-end="384.07">here</span> <span data-start="384.07" data-end="386.74">taken an address out of the address book</span> <span data-start="386.74" data-end="388.78">inserted as the default shipping address</span> <span data-start="388.78" data-end="390.84">so that's something very how you do then</span> <span data-start="390.84" data-end="393.67">customization off the business logic on</span> <span data-start="393.67" data-end="398.17">this on the server so now I want to go a</span> <span data-start="398.17" data-end="400.3">little bit more indeed in interesting</span> <span data-start="400.3" data-end="402.94">part is or let's start with the API</span> <span data-start="402.94" data-end="405.37">capability so first of all it's clay you</span> <span data-start="405.37" data-end="407.5">have took all the business objects</span> <span data-start="407.5" data-end="409.33">available you have products you have a</span> <span data-start="409.33" data-end="411.94">catalog you have a basket order profile</span> <span data-start="411.94" data-end="414.55">you can have called methods on on these</span> <span data-start="414.55" data-end="417.16">things you can run for example but your</span> <span data-start="417.16" data-end="419.73">product searches you have there's a</span> <span data-start="419.73" data-end="423.04">search model you just specify your your</span> <span data-start="423.04" data-end="425.47">parameters and then you do a search you</span> <span data-start="425.47" data-end="428.44">also need for integration we need data</span> <span data-start="428.44" data-end="430.96">processing capabilities so what we using</span> <span data-start="430.96" data-end="433.63">the ephah extender which Rhino supports</span> <span data-start="433.63" data-end="435.13">were using that heavily so that</span> <span data-start="435.13" data-end="437.59">customers can import data with it an</span> <span data-start="437.59" data-end="441.19">export data and process the XML data for</span> <span data-start="441.19" data-end="443.05">communication we have web servers to</span> <span data-start="443.05" data-end="444.64">have a little bit more details about it</span> <span data-start="444.64" data-end="447.85">you can make HTTP calls ftp calls SFTP</span> <span data-start="447.85" data-end="450.61">calls so that people can integrate their</span> <span data-start="450.61" data-end="453.37">back-end systems what Pierre we have</span> <span data-start="453.37" data-end="456.55">form framework your generation we do</span> <span data-start="456.55" data-end="458.74">click stream tracking that's all in a</span> <span data-start="458.74" data-end="461.11">web tier and then also custom business</span> <span data-start="461.11" data-end="462.91">objects and that's maybe something will</span> <span data-start="462.91" data-end="464.68">quickly go a little bit more details is</span> <span data-start="464.68" data-end="466.51">so one thing what you may be and don't</span> <span data-start="466.51" data-end="469.63">see here you don't see sickle so there's</span> <span data-start="469.63" data-end="471.55">a good reason why we don't provide cycle</span> <span data-start="471.55" data-end="473.14">access because we are again we're in the</span> <span data-start="473.14" data-end="475.3">software service environment we want to</span> <span data-start="475.3" data-end="476.95">change the infrastructure when we want</span> <span data-start="476.95" data-end="478.48">to decide that we go to a different</span> <span data-start="478.48" data-end="481.09">database technology we want to do it</span> <span data-start="481.09" data-end="482.59">without interfering to give our</span> <span data-start="482.59" data-end="483.88">customers so we are completely</span> <span data-start="483.88" data-end="485.92">abstracting this one so that's why there</span> <span data-start="485.92" data-end="487.57">is no sickle here on the list instead</span> <span data-start="487.57" data-end="490.12">what we provide a mechanism then that</span> <span data-start="490.12" data-end="491.59">customers can model their little</span> <span data-start="491.59" data-end="493.48">business objects and say this should be</span> <span data-start="493.48" data-end="495.16">go into the database and we manage</span> <span data-start="495.16" data-end="497.56">everything other things you won't find</span> <span data-start="497.56" data-end="500.2">here is my system access we have a</span> <span data-start="500.2" data-end="501.61">little bit something in that direction</span> <span data-start="501.61" data-end="503.29">but it's also something which can be</span> <span data-start="503.29" data-end="505.81">problematic you don't find that you can</span> <span data-start="505.81" data-end="508.27">start processes or sub do something in</span> <span data-start="508.27" data-end="510.139">fretting it's really mad</span> <span data-start="510.139" data-end="512.3">that you yet we provide the big building</span> <span data-start="512.3" data-end="514.19">blocks and

data-end="1184.11">so when I would do design something now</span> <span data-start="1184.11" data-end="1186.3">nowadays I would more often for example</span> <span data-start="1186.3" data-end="1188.79">use closures so what I can write where</span> <span data-start="1188.79" data-end="1190.83">more compact more efficient code and</span> <span data-start="1190.83" data-end="1192.99">also another thing was that it would</span> <span data-start="1192.99" data-end="1197.27">more use these native objects and and</span> <span data-start="1197.27" data-end="1199.92">erase more often when we first came to</span> <span data-start="1199.92" data-end="1201.66">this looked at this JavaScript review</span> <span data-start="1201.66"

and nowadays I were to go a</span> <span data-start="1213.18" data-end="1215.64">different approach and really really use</span> <span data-start="1215.64" data-end="1218.04">much more often these
