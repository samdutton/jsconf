<p><span data-start="43.719" data-end="46">Sheila I am a developer advocate and all</span> <span data-start="46" data-end="50.079">the desk so all of this is a 3d computer</span> <span data-start="50.079" data-end="52.17">software company if you guys don't know</span> <span data-start="52.17" data-end="55.3">so basically we have built a lot of</span> <span data-start="55.3" data-end="58.39">products around 3d and also in the</span> <span data-start="58.39" data-end="60.76">browser so I was I just wanted to show</span> <span data-start="60.76" data-end="64.42">you guys this today so I'm gonna go</span> <span data-start="64.42" data-end="68.08">through a very simple and very small</span> <span data-start="68.08" data-end="71.67">example for for writing 3d on the web</span> <span data-start="71.67" data-end="76.45">and it's basically gonna resemble this</span> <span data-start="76.45" data-end="79.03">I'm gonna only take you through from</span> <span data-start="79.03" data-end="83.14">step 1 through 4 here and from step 4 to</span> <span data-start="83.14" data-end="85.439">5 really requires a lot of study and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="85.439" data-end="89.34">I'll show you what I exactly mean later</span> <span data-start="89.34" data-end="92.35">so basically it's really on the web is</span> <span data-start="92.35" data-end="97.14">WebGL and WebGL 101 it's based on a</span> <span data-start="97.14" data-end="99.79">WebGL is based on something called open</span> <span data-start="99.79" data-end="102.46">to you yes it's not the same thing but</span> <span data-start="102.46" data-end="105.13">it's a very similar syntax if you guys</span> <span data-start="105.13" data-end="107.439">have any experience it's meant for the</span> <span data-start="107.439" data-end="109.06">browser's and it's very very difficult</span> <span data-start="109.06" data-end="112.719">and I'm gonna show you guys exactly what</span> <span data-start="112.719" data-end="117">it is here is a very simple simple</span> <span data-start="117" data-end="120.49">sample code of drawing one triangle with</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="120.49" data-end="123.61">WebGL it's about 100 lines of code and</span> <span data-start="123.61" data-end="129.55">you get a triangle like this so if this</span> <span data-start="129.55" data-end="131.23">is geo programming so it's basically</span> <span data-start="131.23" data-end="134.5">calling API an API and draws from the</span> <span data-start="134.5" data-end="135.01">GPU</span> <span data-start="135.01" data-end="135.88">so if you</span> <span data-start="135.88" data-end="140.41">doing very graphics heavy stuff on the</span> <span data-start="140.41" data-end="143.92">browser this is what you want to use and</span> <span data-start="143.92" data-end="146.77">luckily there are a lot of ways to</span> <span data-start="146.77" data-end="149.02">simplify this there's a lot of existing</span> <span data-start="149.02" data-end="152.92">libraries and frameworks that lets you</span> <span data-start="152.92" data-end="155.11">do this so today I'm just gonna talk</span> <span data-start="155.11" data-end="157.44">about something that is very versatile</span> <span data-start="157.44" data-end="162.97">an easier way of 3d on the web so there</span> <span data-start="162.97" data-end="164.17">are a lot of different libraries to</span> <span data-start="164.17" data-end="166.09">choose from there's like three J's Babel</span> <span data-start="166.09" data-end="168.61">and J has a frame it sometimes someone</span> <span data-start="168.61" data-end="169.93">from Mozilla is gonna talk about a</span> <span data-start="169.93" data-end="171.31">frames I don't like too thick and steal</span> <span data-start="171.31" data-end="173.92">their thunder there are game engines</span> <span data-start="173.92" data-end="176.86">like unity that exports to WebGL but</span> <span data-start="176.86" data-end="179.02">it's very it's for very very specific</span> <span data-start="179.02" data-end="181.03">use cases so I'm just gonna talk about</span> <span data-start="181.03" data-end="182.35">something that's very versatile right</span> <span data-start="182.35" data-end="185.29">here which is three gears and this is a</span> <span data-start="185.29" data-end="188.68">link to say so three kids basically</span> <span data-start="188.68" data-end="191.05">abstract away in triangles in GL</span> <span data-start="191.05" data-end="193.51">programming instead of doing all that</span> <span data-start="193.51" data-end="196.48">like this is these three lines are doing</span> <span data-start="196.48" data-end="199.06">more stuff than what that hundred lines</span> <span data-start="199.06" data-end="201.79">did back there so in to draw a cylinder</span> <span data-start="201.79" data-end="205.27">in 3d space you basically specify a</span> <span data-start="205.27" data-end="207.49">number of triangles that makes up a</span> <span data-start="207.49" data-end="210.52">cylinder instead of writing all those</span> <span data-start="210.52" data-end="213.91">triangles by yourself with vertices you</span> <span data-start="213.91" data-end="217.99">could just vark cylinder equals new 3d</span> <span data-start="217.99" data-end="223.57">mesh and new cylinder geometry so if you</span> <span data-start="223.57" data-end="225.25">want to draw a square it's like a score</span> <span data-start="225.25" data-end="228.91">square of geometry so to get started</span> <span data-start="228.91" data-end="231.76">with three j/s there are four things</span> <span data-start="231.76" data-end="233.26">that you need you need asking a scene</span> <span data-start="233.26" data-end="236.709">camera renderer and your control and you</span> <span data-start="236.709" data-end="239.35">want to fill stuff in your scene and you</span> <span data-start="239.35" data-end="241.51">want to animate the scene so that's like</span> <span data-start="241.51" data-end="246.51">very basic 3d scene things that you need</span> <span data-start="246.51" data-end="248.65">so here I'm gonna talk about three</span> <span data-start="248.65" data-end="250.45">functions so the innate function is</span> <span data-start="250.45" data-end="252.28">gonna init initialize the scene camera</span> <span data-start="252.28" data-end="254.41">renderer and controls the field ceiling</span> <span data-start="254.41" data-end="255.97">thing is gonna put stuff in the scene</span> <span data-start="255.97" data-end="259.42">and then I'm gonna animate it it should</span> <span data-start="259.42" data-end="262.18">be quite straightforward so in three.js</span> <span data-start="262.18" data-end="266.65">when you initialize the scene there's a</span> <span data-start="266.65" data-end="268.75">news and three scene and</span> <span data-start="268.75" data-end="271.48">you get a camera which is a which I'm</span> <span data-start="271.48" data-end="273.61">gonna use a perspective camera here is a</span> <span data-start="273.61" data-end="277.99">very very commonly used 3d camera as</span> <span data-start="277.99" data-end="280.51">opposed to orthographic camera which is</span> <span data-start="280.51" data-end="283">like viewing 2d on 3d but we don't have</span> <span data-start="283" data-end="286.36">to go to go into deep here you passing a</span> <span data-start="286.36" data-end="288.4">bunch of variables basically the inner</span> <span data-start="288.4" data-end="290.98">clipping form complained outer clipping</span> <span data-start="290.98" data-end="293.71">pointing and how big you want you want</span> <span data-start="293.71" data-end="297.97">your camera to view and then you passing</span> <span data-start="297.97" data-end="299.95">the review you instantiate the renderer</span> <span data-start="299.95" data-end="303.07">and set the color of the renderer and</span> <span data-start="303.07" data-end="306.91">the size and then for the control here</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="306.91" data-end="309.34">I'm using again a very generic 3d</span> <span data-start="309.34" data-end="313.69">control that that is commonly used in 3d</span> <span data-start="313.69" data-end="315.97">scenes and they in the end you just use</span> <span data-start="315.97" data-end="317.59">your renderer to render your scene and</span> <span data-start="317.59" data-end="321.64">camera so in the beginning after you</span> <span data-start="321.64" data-end="323.23">initialize everything it's very it's</span> <span data-start="323.23" data-end="325.99">it's just a scene it's it's not special</span> <span data-start="325.99" data-end="329.14">at all right now so the next step what I</span> <span data-start="329.14" data-end="332.88">did is you fill seeing basically I've</span> <span data-start="332.88" data-end="337">instantiated a bunch of particles all in</span> <span data-start="337" data-end="339.58">all with the 3js material and this is</span> <span data-start="339.58" data-end="344.02">very very basic 3d mesh and it's a</span> <span data-start="344.02" data-end="347.35">particle it's it's the particle geometry</span> <span data-start="347.35" data-end="349.36">and particle material is you know</span> <span data-start="349.36" data-end="350.95">basically what you want to passing as</span> <span data-start="350.95" data-end="354.49">parameters and I said I randomized the</span> <span data-start="354.49" data-end="356.71">positions and randomized the directions</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="356.71" data-end="359.29">I want to take because I want to animate</span> <span data-start="359.29" data-end="362.62">those particles and I add that particles</span> <span data-start="362.62" data-end="366.58">into the scene so I have a randomized</span> <span data-start="366.58" data-end="369.4">set of particles in the 3d space we</span> <span data-start="369.4" data-end="371.17">can't really do anything right now yet</span> <span data-start="371.17" data-end="373.21">it's still nothing special it's it</span> <span data-start="373.21" data-end="377.47">doesn't move but we're getting there so</span> <span data-start="377.47" data-end="379.11">the last thing I want to do is the enemy</span> <span data-start="379.11" data-end="384.58">animating is less of a actual animating</span> <span data-start="384.58" data-end="386.53">you want to consider it less as</span> <span data-start="386.53" data-end="391.78">animating the objects but more to tell</span> <span data-start="391.78" data-end="393.88">the browser what to do each time it</span> <span data-start="393.88" data-end="396.31">calls request animation frame so request</span> <span data-start="396.31" data-end="397.57">animation frame there's something that</span> <span data-start="397.57" data-end="399.64">you know whenever the browser refreshes</span> <span data-start="399.64" data-end="401.59">the frame you</span> <span data-start="401.59" data-end="403.84">it will call the function within</span> <span data-start="403.84" data-end="406.72">requestanimationframe so in computer</span> <span data-start="406.72" data-end="408.7">vendor animation it needs to be 60</span> <span data-start="408.7" data-end="410.17">frames per second and that's exactly</span> <span data-start="410.17" data-end="412.05">what requests and information frame does</span> <span data-start="412.05" data-end="414.4">with a lot of graphics programmers they</span> <span data-start="414.4" data-end="416.77">like still use this at timeout which is</span> <span data-start="416.77" data-end="422.38">something that I really so basically the</span> <span data-start="422.38" data-end="424.9">in my code I'm gonna call animate in the</span> <span data-start="424.9" data-end="429.61">request animation frame function so</span> <span data-start="429.61" data-end="432.1">again I'm up</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="432.1" data-end="434.59">I added my control so I I'm updating my</span> <span data-start="434.59" data-end="437.98">controls and I run a four loop through</span> <span data-start="437.98" data-end="442.27">each of the particles and I move the</span> <span data-start="442.27" data-end="445.42">particles every time the the</span> <span data-start="445.42" data-end="447.76">requestanimationframe is called and then</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="447.76" data-end="451.27">I also said a boundary where if the</span> <span data-start="451.27" data-end="453.27">particle reaches an edge it bounces back</span> <span data-start="453.27" data-end="456.34">so it's still very simple code and I</span> <span data-start="456.34" data-end="462.67">render it again each time I enemy so</span> <span data-start="462.67" data-end="465.16">here it's moving very slowly and this is</span> <span data-start="465.16" data-end="471.59">a 3d scene so I can use orbit controls</span> <span data-start="471.6" data-end="476.08">so yeah this is still very very basic so</span> <span data-start="476.08" data-end="478.45">this is a source code and if you want to</span> <span data-start="478.45" data-end="480.85">get a VR like effect you basically</span> <span data-start="480.85" data-end="483.85">replace the camera the some of the</span> <span data-start="483.85" data-end="486.4">parameters in the camera and replace the</span> <span data-start="486.4" data-end="487.93">control with something called device</span> <span data-start="487.93" data-end="490.56">orientation controls so basically that</span> <span data-start="490.56" data-end="494.05">hooks up your camera your your phone or</span> <span data-start="494.05" data-end="499.12">or VR device orientation with with the</span> <span data-start="499.12" data-end="501.76">scene so here's the demo if you guys</span> <span data-start="501.76" data-end="504.22">have cured ghosts and sienar I encourage</span> <span data-start="504.22" data-end="505.69">you to try it I'm just gonna give you</span> <span data-start="505.69" data-end="513.3">guys a minute</span> <span data-start="513.31" data-end="516.43">it's basically goes to a website that I</span> <span data-start="516.43" data-end="529.33">built for this</span> <span data-start="529.34" data-end="531.92">so if you have a phone that you</span> <span data-start="531.92" data-end="535.27">purchased after 2014</span> <span data-start="535.27" data-end="539.12">you should have 3d enabled and be able</span> <span data-start="539.12" data-end="546.76">to see it rendered with the devices okay</span> <span data-start="546.76" data-end="552.74">so everyone got it so again this is step</span> <span data-start="552.74" data-end="555.62">four to really make really cool</span> <span data-start="555.62" data-end="560.089">animations in the in a 3d space I'm</span> <span data-start="560.089" data-end="562.16">gonna show you guys what we've done and</span> <span data-start="562.16" data-end="565.88">and this may be some inspiration of what</span> <span data-start="565.88" data-end="568.91">you could really do with three days so</span> <span data-start="568.91" data-end="570.95">so this is the library that we've both</span> <span data-start="570.95" data-end="577.52">on top of three years with this is like</span> <span data-start="577.52" data-end="580.97">a computer-aided design model and and I</span> <span data-start="580.97" data-end="583.76">mean the browser so you can look at how</span> <span data-start="583.76" data-end="586.43">just how good the rendering is and the</span> <span data-start="586.43" data-end="589.49">materials are so you can zoom into each</span> <span data-start="589.49" data-end="597.95">of the particle where the and basically</span> <span data-start="597.95" data-end="600.77">look at these engineering drawings and</span> <span data-start="600.77" data-end="605.089">this was built with a with a industrial</span> <span data-start="605.089" data-end="607.25">design this model was strong with the</span> <span data-start="607.25" data-end="610.82">industrial design software so everything</span> <span data-start="610.82" data-end="612.74">that was in the was in the design</span> <span data-start="612.74" data-end="615.73">actually got ported into the browser and</span> <span data-start="615.73" data-end="619.64">and it's the library behind it is three</span> <span data-start="619.64" data-end="620.99">years and that's why I'm talking about</span> <span data-start="620.99" data-end="624.73">it today so with this you can basically</span> <span data-start="624.73" data-end="628.67">where we have tied a bunch of JavaScript</span> <span data-start="628.67" data-end="631.55">functions with this everything is</span> <span data-start="631.55" data-end="634.07">basically a JavaScript object so we have</span> <span data-start="634.07" data-end="636.709">typed a lot of JavaScript functions so</span> <span data-start="636.709" data-end="639.49">you can do like expo fold or rotate and</span> <span data-start="639.49" data-end="642.17">this what this basically is doing is</span> <span data-start="642.17" data-end="644.27">doing a transferring transformation to</span> <span data-start="644.27" data-end="651.13">your to the object in your 3d scene and</span> <span data-start="651.13" data-end="654.5">it's just very significant how far we've</span> <span data-start="654.5" data-end="657.68">gotten to to render 3d and in the</span> <span data-start="657.68" data-end="659.69">website because in a website because</span> <span data-start="659.69" data-end="663.02">this we have not done any optim</span> <span data-start="663.02" data-end="666.98">optimization to render this because we</span> <span data-start="666.98" data-end="670.73">what we what we do as a company is we do</span> <span data-start="670.73" data-end="672.77">imaging engineering data so none of</span> <span

data-end="679.7">like we don't we don't reduce the number</span> <span data-start="679.7" data-end="688.4">of Polly's in in this drawing so so</span> <span data-start="688.4" data-end="692.12">there's a bunch of demos we have also</span> <span data-start="692.12" data-end="695.02">like both a lot of functions with these</span> <span data-start="695.02" data-end="699.28">type of 3d models you could

data-end="719.12">like you can section this whatever model</span> <span data-start="719.12" data-end="723.95">3d model you have so sometimes I would</span> <span data-start="723.95"

data-end="730.79">little bit on WebGL and said that WebGL</span> <span data-start="730.79" data-end="732.89">isn't really promising this is like a</span> <span data-start="732.89"

<span data-start="789.26" data-end="791.27">you can't really do it with anything any</span> <span data-start="791.27" data-end="796.01">other technology and let's see I just</span> <span
