<p><span data-start="97.02" data-end="102.03">It's a choose-your-own-adventure that breaks you out of the monotony of the article, and</span> <span data-start="102.03" data-end="114.9">lets and I think  the best way to convey something is through</span> <span data-start="114.9" data-end="119.56">telling a story whether that's through educating, or entertaining, or persuading.</span> <span data-start="119.56" data-end="126.79">And if you think about it, we tell so many stories in our lives, whether that's through</span> <span data-start="126.79" data-end="132">movies, photographs, or tweets, and what all of these have in common is that they break</span> <span data-start="132" data-end="139.01">the story into pieces arranged in a very specific way where you move sequentially through time.</span> <span data-start="139.01" data-end="144.58">One of the best known forms of telling stories in a sequential format that pre-dates the</span> <span data-start="144.58" data-end="150.26">Internet and the moving image is, of course, comics.</span> <span data-start="150.26" data-end="155.71">Eisner uses the term comics.</span> <span data-start="155.71" data-end="169.42">And Scott McCloud gets at this in understanding comics Scott McCloud says, where taken individually,</span> <span data-start="169.42" data-end="178.31">the pictures on the left are just pictures but when they become part of a sequence, even</span> <span data-start="178.31" data-end="184.65">that sequence is only two, the art is of the image is transformed into the art of comics.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="184.65" data-end="189.049">He goes on to define what we talk about when we talk about comics.</span> <span data-start="189.049" data-end="199.94">He says</span> <span data-start="199.94" data-end="202.3">comics have been around for a very long time.</span> <span data-start="202.3" data-end="205.75">In fact, they predate the Internet by centuries.</span> <span data-start="205.75" data-end="221.439">Here's a comic from 32 centuries ago.  â€”  and think other side of the world, archeologists</span> <span data-start="221.439" data-end="227.92">have found ancient paintings in Mexico created 2700 years later organized similarly.</span> <span data-start="227.92" data-end="232.909">Even though this isn't a modern comic, what we're looking at is still a story that goes</span> <span data-start="232.909" data-end="238.48">on a deliberate chronological order where you start on the left and you go to the top</span> <span data-start="238.48" data-end="239.48">right.</span> <span data-start="239.48" data-end="244.129">There's no panel borders like we're used to, but there are clear divisions of scene.</span> <span data-start="244.129" data-end="251.5">Now I have no idea when or where the first comic was created in history but the one mention</span> <span data-start="251.5" data-end="257.84">that's a huge deal in the history of comics and sequential art is the invention of printing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="257.84" data-end="263.58">Printing turned the art form that would be a diversion for the rich and powerful and</span> <span data-start="263.58" data-end="266.98">allowed it to be enjoyed by anyone.</span> <span data-start="266.98" data-end="274.82">So given the legacy of comics as a art form, how has the Internet changed our relationship</span> <span data-start="274.82" data-end="281.08">to sequential art, and what it it mean for us to go from print comics to post-print comics</span> <span data-start="281.08" data-end="283.44">in the digital age.</span> <span data-start="283.44" data-end="289.88">For us at Bustle, one of the first steps that we took to comics is an made the story called</span> <span data-start="289.88" data-end="299.57">Sunday Comics, which we produce once a week, sometimes they were told over a series of</span> <span data-start="299.57" data-end="302.93">a few weeks, and sometimes they were just one offs.</span> <span data-start="302.93" data-end="308.22">They were for fun to make, and some fun to watch.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="308.22" data-end="313.22">So we thought how do we take this further.</span> <span data-start="313.22" data-end="318.45">And bring a similar experience to the web without making them difficult to produces.</span> <span data-start="318.45" data-end="322.68">We didn't want to just adopt the shape of the previous technology of comics that we</span> <span data-start="322.68" data-end="324.82">were already acquainted with.</span> <span data-start="324.82" data-end="331.6">For example, you could just scan in an article and say you brought comics to the web.</span> <span data-start="331.6" data-end="334.65">But to me, that was not very interesting.</span> <span data-start="334.65" data-end="341.8">I wanted to bring a single unbroken reading line while taking advantage of all the things</span> <span data-start="341.8" data-end="344.52">that the browser had to offer.</span> <span data-start="344.52" data-end="349.87">I set out to create stories in the form of sequential art on an infinitive canvas along</span> <span data-start="349.87" data-end="352.56">the y-axis.</span> <span data-start="352.56" data-end="357.47">So this is the comic experience that we had in its final form.</span> <span data-start="357.47" data-end="368.81">We wanted it to recontextualize the sequential art while emotionally engaging the audience.</span> <span data-start="368.81" data-end="372.63">For example, notice that there's this interesting parallax effect where things that are closer</span> <span data-start="372.63" data-end="376.4">scroll more quickly than things in the background.</span> <span data-start="376.4" data-end="382.22">Everything is designed to take advantage of the beautiful Retina displays.</span> <span data-start="382.22" data-end="385.75">And when you move your mouse, things move around with you and you can change your perspective</span> <span data-start="385.75" data-end="391.44">from within the frame.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="391.44" data-end="395.83">It gets the viewer involved and you have to interact with it to see everything in its</span> <span data-start="395.83" data-end="396.86">full glory.</span> <span data-start="396.86" data-end="400.12">Sometimes you even have to move it around to see the text.</span> <span data-start="400.12" data-end="404.31">If you're on a laptop or a phone, you can go to bustle.com/comics right now and check</span> <span data-start="404.31" data-end="408.73">it out by yourself while I'm going through this.</span> <span data-start="408.73" data-end="412.19">So how do we do this?</span> <span data-start="412.19" data-end="418.6">And, of course, the answer is: The solution to most things on the web.</span> <span data-start="418.6" data-end="419.96">I'm just kidding.</span> <span data-start="419.96" data-end="422.979">There's zero React involved.</span> <span data-start="422.979" data-end="424.72">[ Laughter ]</span> <span data-start="424.72" data-end="428.19">It's SVGs.</span> <span data-start="428.19" data-end="429.19">It's not on brand.</span> <span data-start="429.19" data-end="430.37">React not on brand.</span> <span data-start="430.37" data-end="431.37">Okay.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="431.37" data-end="436.31">So SVGs are a good tool to have and especially for storytelling because they're resolution</span> <span data-start="436.31" data-end="440.38">independent, and so they're sharp on in display which means you don't have to do any image</span> <span data-start="440.38" data-end="442.5">replacement for different resolutions.</span> <span data-start="442.5" data-end="448.84">And, of course, they're easily scalable for responsive designs, to you don't have to produce</span> <span data-start="448.84" data-end="453.08">a bunch of different asserts for different screens and they're super easy to animate,</span> <span data-start="453.08" data-end="458.22">which makes them the most fun.</span> <span data-start="458.22" data-end="462.8">The fact that SVG allows us to create these incredibly rich narratives is mind-blowing.</span> <span data-start="462.8" data-end="467.93">They're truly one of the coolest things that you can play around with as a developer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="467.93" data-end="470.28">So how is this built?</span> <span data-start="470.28" data-end="475.84">The first step was to get the parallax working, and if you're thinking to yourself, why parallax,</span> <span data-start="475.84" data-end="484.22">first of all, why not, and second of all, it creates a depth of scene and a sense of</span> <span data-start="484.22" data-end="485.22">physicality.</span> <span data-start="485.22" data-end="493.51">When police report, why not allow your visitors to visit your site on their own initiative.</span> <span data-start="493.51" data-end="498.72">Instead of getting static images, you got a 3D presentation controlled by your own scrolling.</span> <span data-start="498.72" data-end="503.96">If given the chance, why not use the opportunity to tell stories in an engaging and interactive</span> <span data-start="503.96" data-end="505.66">way?</span> <span data-start="505.66" data-end="513.32">In practice, instead of calculating in parallax movement in JavaScript, we challenged ourselves</span> <span data-start="513.32" data-end="523.08">to do as much as in CSS as possible, shout out to CSSConf EU.</span> <span data-start="523.08" data-end="533.1">So activate 3D space in an element that needs to be given, then enables 3D space for each</span> <span data-start="533.1" data-end="534.1">tiled elements.</span> <span data-start="534.1" data-end="538.56">So you define the height in the perspective style properties of the parent element and</span> <span data-start="538.56" data-end="546.01">that would lock the perspective to its super creating a 3D viewport with a fixed origin.</span> <span data-start="546.01" data-end="550.49">The scrolling speed of the parallax elements is achieved by applying the translate-z function</span> <span data-start="550.49" data-end="555.94">to the transform-property of the child element, come places the elements along the z-axis</span> <span data-start="555.94" data-end="560.01">by placing them farther away or closer to the user.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="560.01" data-end="565.76">After experimentation, we picked the maximum distance to be background layer.</span> <span data-start="565.76" data-end="571.49">The maximum layer sits at that distance and we evenly distribute the remaining layers</span> <span data-start="571.49" data-end="574.83">from background to foreground.</span> <span data-start="574.83" data-end="579.75">And here's what it looks like Illustrator where there's seven years, and those layers</span> <span data-start="579.75" data-end="589.59">are distributed evenly between the foreground and the background.</span> <span data-start="589.59" data-end="594.24">Because we're using perspective to achieve the parallax movement effect, when we move</span> <span data-start="594.24" data-end="599.45">things farther along the z-axis, they're narrowly going to get smaller, but illustrators have</span> <span data-start="599.45" data-end="607.9">already drawn to scale to make this inappropriate, so we need to do a depth correction so that</span> <span data-start="607.9" data-end="612.68">it answer to be rendered at its original size.</span> <span data-start="612.68" data-end="619.37">On the left, we have the scale transform applied versus on the right there is no scale transform.</span> <span data-start="619.37" data-end="624.28">The good news is that as things move farther away, they get smaller at a predictable rate</span> <span data-start="624.28" data-end="628.94">so we can apply a scale transform to render it at its original size.</span> <span data-start="628.94" data-end="633.281">This way we get the parallax effect of moving things along the z-axis without the size distortion.</span> <span data-start="633.281" data-end="639.26">The advantage of this is we just set a few CSS properties and the browser takes care</span> <span data-start="639.26" data-end="643.6">of everything else, and there's very minimal JavaScript required to set up the comic.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="643.6" data-end="647.94">So, again, this is how the scene will look, with and without depth correction.</span> <span data-start="647.94" data-end="652.52">So on the right we can see what happens when we translate things on the z-axis without</span> <span data-start="652.52" data-end="653.74">applying the scale.</span> <span data-start="653.74" data-end="665.17">And on the right, is the depth correction with the depth correction with the scale applied.</span> <span data-start="665.17" data-end="671.79">It also means that we're going to apply a larger scale factor to compensate.</span> <span data-start="671.79" data-end="675.8">Now even though this seems like fun and games and browser support is generally excellent</span> <span data-start="675.8" data-end="680.67">for SVGs, it's a whole other story when you apply CSS transforms to them.</span> <span data-start="680.67" data-end="685.94">This is especially painful when it comes to animations because scale, position, and rotation,</span> <span data-start="685.94" data-end="688.7">and skew are so fundamental.</span> <span data-start="688.7" data-end="696.87">When you apply transforms to an element inside the SVG, their browser bugs and inconsistencies.</span> <span data-start="696.87" data-end="701.46">This gif is from an excellent article in CSS Tricks can be which shows how the same animation</span> <span data-start="701.46" data-end="703.45">looks on different browsers.</span> <span data-start="703.45" data-end="712.53">IE and Opera, don't honor transforms at all on SVG elements, instead you must assign the</span> <span data-start="712.53" data-end="713.95">attribute.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="713.95" data-end="719.51">We could use tools like animation platform, but what's the fun in using a third-party</span> <span data-start="719.51" data-end="723.61">library instead of figuring out how to do it on your own.</span> <span data-start="723.61" data-end="730.4">So our solution was to explore the SVG where each element becomes becomes an SVG on its</span> <span data-start="730.4" data-end="737.76">own and this allows us to transform it reliably across all browsers.</span> <span data-start="737.76" data-end="748.4">This is what the SVG looks like with six layers making up the scene on the right.</span> <span data-start="748.4" data-end="753.01">And then on the left, we have that same SVG with each of those six layers exploded into</span> <span data-start="753.01" data-end="756.81">their own SVG elements and they're all stacked on top of each other to make it look like</span> <span data-start="756.81" data-end="762.64">the original.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="762.64" data-end="765.67">Another cool thing about these comics is the movement in them.</span> <span data-start="765.67" data-end="769.09">As you move your mouse, or your phone, everything moves with you.</span> <span data-start="769.09" data-end="772.81">The closer the layer it is to you, the more it moves, the farther away it is, it moves</span> <span data-start="772.81" data-end="777.68">less and less, just like in the real world where things that are farther from us move</span> <span data-start="777.68" data-end="779.2">farther away.</span> <span data-start="779.2" data-end="784.22">These were one of the Sacramento that we wanted to add because we didn't want the designers</span> <span data-start="784.22" data-end="788.3">to think about how to animate the movement and just have it done for them automatically</span> <span data-start="788.3" data-end="790.061">based on the numbers of layers they use.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="790.061" data-end="797.31">What's good is that the effect gives you a sense of being in the scene.</span> <span data-start="797.31" data-end="801.1">And as an anecdote, the designers started putting things in their illustrations where</span> <span data-start="801.1" data-end="805.46">you have to interact with it to see what's going on in the whole story.</span> <span data-start="805.46" data-end="810.37">So how did we manage to get the page to respond to the mouse and the gyroscope movements?</span> <span data-start="810.37" data-end="816.15">With the help of our good friend from our math days, logarithm scale, which is a non-linear</span> <span data-start="816.15" data-end="822.279">scale when there's a large range of quantities, earthquakes, for example, which is not unlike</span> <span data-start="822.279" data-end="826.92">shaking your phone, or moving your mouse in the real world.</span> <span data-start="826.92" data-end="833.661">So this is how it's like the mouse moving on a logarithmic scale that we actually used</span> <span data-start="833.661" data-end="835.48">to transform each layer.</span> <span data-start="835.48" data-end="843.339">And then you apply the shift to an event listener based on device orientation or mouse movement.</span> <span data-start="843.339" data-end="848.9">As a visual example of how log scale works, as the mouse moves in the center, the layers</span> <span data-start="848.9" data-end="853.24">move quite a bit but as you get closer to the edges of the browser, they move less and</span> <span data-start="853.24" data-end="859.55">less because you don't want things to fly off the screen, again, just like in an earthquake.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="859.55" data-end="862.69">What's also cool is you have to move your mouse around to see what's in the mirror,</span> <span data-start="862.69" data-end="868.38">or to see what's in the background behind in the window on the left.</span> <span data-start="868.38" data-end="874.22">And an important goal of this project was to allow our designers to be productive in</span> <span data-start="874.22" data-end="875.69">the tools they already know.</span> <span data-start="875.69" data-end="884.38">One of the reasons for using SVGs is that our designers are  â€”  Adobe Illustrator.</span> <span data-start="884.38" data-end="888.82">One thing we could have done was spend half a year building an online comics editor but</span> <span data-start="888.82" data-end="893.37">Adobe's already done for that by making a graphics editor and our designers already</span> <span data-start="893.37" data-end="894.6">know how to use them.</span> <span data-start="894.6" data-end="900.48">And one thing that's cool for me personally is even though they each have their constraints,</span> <span data-start="900.48" data-end="905.86">they each have their process for design.</span> <span data-start="905.86" data-end="913.54">Allison Gore starts with a loose plan, figures out how the panels are set up and relate to</span> <span data-start="913.54" data-end="917.94">each other, and then moves on the Illustrator and deconstructs the layers to figure out</span> <span data-start="917.94" data-end="919.53">how their interaction works.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="919.53" data-end="923.62">These are some examples of her work.</span> <span data-start="923.62" data-end="929.11">It's cool to see the behind-the-scenes.</span> <span data-start="929.11" data-end="934.19">Austin sometimes draws out his main characters in paper and then moves in to Illustrator</span> <span data-start="934.19" data-end="936.33">to draw out the whole scene.</span> <span data-start="936.33" data-end="941.8">An interesting thing about Austin's work is he uses a lot of color and I asked him about</span> <span data-start="941.8" data-end="947.21">it, he says it's because he's from New Orleans and he group surrounded by beautiful colors.</span> <span data-start="947.21" data-end="953.58">And since he moved to New York City, he myself how colorful things are, so he tries to remind</span> <span data-start="953.58" data-end="955.74">himself of home and work.</span> <span data-start="955.74" data-end="964.2">Allyssa tries to get forms on paper to list their most iconic moments.</span> <span data-start="964.2" data-end="971.71">And she also draws out the scene and writes out lots of notes even before drawing the</span> <span data-start="971.71" data-end="973.32">scene out in Illustrator.</span> <span data-start="973.32" data-end="978.43">She draws lamps, and says, this is what the Netflix logo looks like, or this is what my</span> <span data-start="978.43" data-end="980.66">table should look like.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="980.66" data-end="986.28">Allyssa also believes that you shouldn't draw everything out for the audience, and let them</span> <span data-start="986.28" data-end="989.87">figure out things on your own.</span> <span data-start="989.87" data-end="995.75">She thinks that minimalism goes a long way when it comes to comics.</span> <span data-start="995.75" data-end="1000.529">Don draws out some parts of the story and tries to make sense of the story before doing</span> <span data-start="1000.529" data-end="1006.94">anything else and sometimes ends up working with the writer to change the story entirely</span> <span data-start="1006.94" data-end="1011.85">based on her first impression of not making any sense.</span> <span data-start="1011.85" data-end="1015.59">She tries to figure out the characters' emotions on details.</span> <span data-start="1015.59" data-end="1020.74">She also feels like she's playing God when trying to figure out when the character in</span> <span data-start="1020.74" data-end="1025.01">the background, or what does the color look like, or what the character looks like, or</span> <span data-start="1025.01" data-end="1031.99">what their hair looks like.</span> <span data-start="1031.99" data-end="1039.579">Bear likes to draw her characters with different emotions from different viewpoints whether</span> <span data-start="1039.579" data-end="1041.209">she lays things out.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1041.209" data-end="1047.13">It's been very rewarding to work on these things because for relatively little engineering</span> <span data-start="1047.13" data-end="1052.48">work, we can help designers create these experiences that they've never made before and that our</span> <span data-start="1052.48" data-end="1054.95">viewers have never seen before.</span> <span data-start="1054.95" data-end="1061.77">And I'm personally a huge fan of the meeting the audience, your designers, and your collaborators,</span> <span data-start="1061.77" data-end="1063.32">where they are today.</span> <span data-start="1063.32" data-end="1066.74">And so the most important lesson that I want you to take away from this talk is meet your</span> <span data-start="1066.74" data-end="1068.23">users where they are.</span> <span data-start="1068.23" data-end="1073.74">I know we all have instincts to rewrite everything and create all these new tools but it's really,</span> <span data-start="1073.74" data-end="1077.23">really important to think about how to leverage existing tools.</span> <span data-start="1077.23" data-end="1081.11">And SVGs are a perfect example of that.</span> <span data-start="1081.11" data-end="1083.33">You probably already work with designers.</span> <span data-start="1083.33" data-end="1084.929">They already know Illustrator.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1084.929" data-end="1089.92">What are some ideas that you have that if you were to get out of SVGs, what would you</span> <span data-start="1089.92" data-end="1090.92">do?</span> <span data-start="1090.92" data-end="1094.85">I showed you two examples here with interactive flowcharts and comics.</span> <span data-start="1094.85" data-end="1098.74">Both of these have super simple rules that designers can follow.</span> <span data-start="1098.74" data-end="1103.6">Figure out your layers, export to SVG, done.</span> <span data-start="1103.6" data-end="1106.99">It's also to note that setting constraints is okay.</span> <span data-start="1106.99" data-end="1110.94">Some of the designers were definitely a little hesitant about not having enough control over</span> <span data-start="1110.94" data-end="1115.78">the animation, or the depth, or the movement, or wanting to be able to animate certain things</span> <span data-start="1115.78" data-end="1117.16">differently.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1117.16" data-end="1121.99">But the answer I always gave was the same as, I'm sure, some of you have given once</span> <span data-start="1121.99" data-end="1123.8">or twice, PRs are welcome.</span> <span data-start="1123.8" data-end="1130.83">But all joking aside, I think having constraints and having to work within limits creates more</span> <span data-start="1130.83" data-end="1134.21">opportunity for creativity and innovation.</span> <span data-start="1134.21" data-end="1139.76">The way they're using parallax to enhance the story in these two examples is mind blowing.</span> <span data-start="1139.76" data-end="1148.53">And, again, it's been super rewarding being a part of it.</span> <span data-start="1148.53" data-end="1152.67">So the question that I have for all of us is, what are some things that we can do by</span> <span data-start="1152.67" data-end="1155.33">using Illustrator as a development tool almost?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1155.33" data-end="1162.47">Or are there other file formats that people already can use to harness the power of JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1162.47" data-end="1163.47">to enhance, and augment?</span> <span data-start="1163.47" data-end="1164.47">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="1164.47" data-end="1165.47">[ Applause ]</span> <span data-start="1165.47" data-end="1166.47">Where's the party?</span> <span data-start="1166.47" data-end="1167.47">Malte to the rescue!</span> <span data-start="1167.47" data-end="1168.47">That was awesome.</span> <span data-start="1168.47" data-end="1169.47">Mind blown!</span> <span data-start="1169.47" data-end="1170.47">That was amazing.</span> <span data-start="1170.47" data-end="1171.47">We're going to wait a little bit for a few minutes, again, to let other people from the</span> <span data-start="1171.47" data-end="1172.47">other room to attend the talk from the very beginning but we have more coming up which</span> <span data-start="1172.47" data-end="1173.47">is awesome.</span> <span data-start="1173.47" data-end="1174.47">Thank you very much, Zahra, that was amazing.</span> </p>
