<p><span data-start="10.37" data-end="12.2">Thank you very much for coming.</span> <span data-start="12.2" data-end="15.29">And I first need to introduce myself.</span> <span data-start="15.29" data-end="18.5">I'm Ziran from the UK.</span> <span data-start="18.5" data-end="23.07">And today's talk I would like to walk you through our practices and also our choices</span> <span data-start="23.07" data-end="30.81">of technologies in building endtoend IoT system with privacy in mind.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="30.81" data-end="36.04">So, to start the talk, I would like to present to you a use case.</span> <span data-start="36.04" data-end="38.77">And we are going to use this use case throughout the talk today.</span> <span data-start="38.77" data-end="45.74">What we are going to do is go behind the scenes of the use case and look at the technology</span> <span data-start="45.74" data-end="48.149">challenges and our solutions.</span> <span data-start="48.149" data-end="55">So, first we would like to look at how to build an IoT system okay, our use case basically</span> <span data-start="55" data-end="56.84">is holiday homes.</span> <span data-start="56.84" data-end="58.32">Holiday result.</span> <span data-start="58.32" data-end="64.08">I think most of you has spent a holiday, rent a home on a big holiday resort.</span> <span data-start="64.08" data-end="67.2">We're talking about this kind of scenario.</span> <span data-start="67.2" data-end="74.14">So, to start the first step is how to build an IoT system for one single holiday home.</span> <span data-start="74.14" data-end="78.86">So, in our case we are basically using the web of things technology.</span> <span data-start="78.86" data-end="86.95">So, we are going to attach Mozilla IoT platform and the web.</span> <span data-start="86.95" data-end="95.96">Once the IoT is built for one holiday home, we're going to go further.</span> <span data-start="95.96" data-end="98.08">How can we connect all of these homes together?</span> <span data-start="98.08" data-end="108.12">And furthermore, can we introduce some intelligence when we view the holiday when we view the</span> <span data-start="108.12" data-end="112.71">connect the holiday homes together and build the IoT for the whole holiday resort.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="112.71" data-end="118.92">So, here, and we have the main case is to respect user's privacy.</span> <span data-start="118.92" data-end="122.96">So, here we're going to look at learning.</span> <span data-start="122.96" data-end="127.771">And then we're going to look at the architecture for the whole IoT system and share with you</span> <span data-start="127.771" data-end="130.7">our current work status.</span> <span data-start="130.7" data-end="137.7">So, holiday homes, in this scenario, I think only two main parties.</span> <span data-start="137.7" data-end="141.54">One is the holiday makers.</span> <span data-start="141.54" data-end="145.739">The other is the owner of a holiday resort.</span> <span data-start="145.739" data-end="151.409">The owner could be just like another company or agent.</span> <span data-start="151.409" data-end="160.4">So, what's does the holiday owner have in his mind when building IoT for their holiday</span> <span data-start="160.4" data-end="162.959">resort?</span> <span data-start="162.959" data-end="168.519">I think one essential thing is is the holiday home very smart.</span> <span data-start="168.519" data-end="174.9">Is it controlled and how to provide the services?</span> <span data-start="174.9" data-end="181.09">And then when you build this, it has to be, you know, have to be complying with the legal</span> <span data-start="181.09" data-end="182.09">requirement.</span> <span data-start="182.09" data-end="185.569">Respect the user's privacy.</span> <span data-start="185.569" data-end="195.739">And the last, but not least, so, what is is it a solution that causes the effect here?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="195.739" data-end="201.92">And does it provide a longterm benefit?</span> <span data-start="201.92" data-end="209.56">And from the holiday maker's point of view, I guess, for us, is just the easy access and</span> <span data-start="209.56" data-end="214.579">easy control over the holiday utilities and the facilities.</span> <span data-start="214.579" data-end="218.45">And also, we want to be relaxed and not being watched.</span> <span data-start="218.45" data-end="225.389">We don't want anyone to monitor how we use our electricity, how many washes we do every</span> <span data-start="225.389" data-end="228.749">day, you know, during holiday time.</span> <span data-start="228.749" data-end="236.29">So, let's look at how to build IoT for one single holiday home.</span> <span data-start="236.29" data-end="241.879">And with privacy in mind.</span> <span data-start="241.879" data-end="244.2">How is privacy doing in IoT?</span> <span data-start="244.2" data-end="246.95">So, how is IoT actually doing with privacy, really?</span> <span data-start="246.95" data-end="253.18">So, the concerns are about the risks that the Internet of things has imposed on data</span> <span data-start="253.18" data-end="256.431">protection and the personal privacy has been raised for many years.</span> <span data-start="256.431" data-end="266.35">And a survey from ICO in 2016 has stated that six in ten Internet of things devices do not</span> <span data-start="266.35" data-end="270.15">properly tell customers how their personal information is being used.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="270.15" data-end="273.74">This is pretty worrying.</span> <span data-start="273.74" data-end="280.25">The good news is that the government and also the industry, they are taking actions.</span> <span data-start="280.25" data-end="285.62">For example, in the EU, GDPR, I think everyone heard about GDPR here?</span> <span data-start="285.62" data-end="286.62">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="287.62" data-end="291.05">So, GDPR came in force in May last year.</span> <span data-start="291.05" data-end="297.34">So, this new EU regulation basically is to protect personal data in law.</span> <span data-start="297.34" data-end="304.639">And also, when you design you know, when you design and create new IoT solutions, we need</span> <span data-start="304.639" data-end="308.86">to have data protection by design in mind.</span> <span data-start="308.86" data-end="315.819">Previously known as privacy by design.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="315.819" data-end="322.77">So, for for IoT developers, this legislation has a significant impact on how we deploy</span> <span data-start="322.77" data-end="329.04">our technologies and what kind of services we are building.</span> <span data-start="329.04" data-end="335.37">So, we actually are thinking that, well, open web platform actually permits the enhanced</span> <span data-start="335.37" data-end="338.539">privacy compared to other technology stacks.</span> <span data-start="338.539" data-end="348.129">So, we think actually GDPR is not only a challenge for web IoT, but also a very good opportunity.</span> <span data-start="348.129" data-end="356.56">So, we have been talking actually when we build our web of things for when we build</span> <span data-start="356.56" data-end="360.96">our IoT actually and mainly based on web of things tech technology.</span> <span data-start="360.96" data-end="363.34">What is, of things?</span> <span data-start="363.34" data-end="366.36">Web of things let's just quote from Wikipedia.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="366.36" data-end="374.319">It's a software architectural style and the programming patterns that are along the real-world</span> <span data-start="374.319" data-end="377.55">objective to talk to the worldwide web.</span> <span data-start="377.55" data-end="379.38">It's a tough level.</span> <span data-start="379.38" data-end="384.79">When look at really what issues are in this.</span> <span data-start="384.79" data-end="391.139">If you are in IoT, you know for the major concerns in IoT is interoperability.</span> <span data-start="391.139" data-end="397.879">Because, you know, we have like hardware and software from different vendors and manufacturers.</span> <span data-start="397.879" data-end="401.49">Suddenly we want to connect them together.</span> <span data-start="401.49" data-end="405.52">And they are not nice to follow the same specifications, the same standard.</span> <span data-start="405.52" data-end="408.22">Probably not even talk the same language.</span> <span data-start="408.22" data-end="410.86">So, how do you connect them together?</span> <span data-start="410.86" data-end="416.319">So, web of things basically addresses this issue by providing an application layer solution.</span> <span data-start="416.319" data-end="421.81">So, aside from the difference in the network layer physically.</span> <span data-start="421.81" data-end="427.53">This is an application solution.</span> <span data-start="427.53" data-end="438.009">Which means that which means actually it has to on the Internet of things, it has to talk.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="438.009" data-end="444.199">So, the scope actually, bearing in mind the scope of IoT is a lot broader.</span> <span data-start="444.199" data-end="448.199">Not everything in IoT nicely connects.</span> <span data-start="448.199" data-end="457.4">So, we would like to think that web of things actually is an option for application layer</span> <span data-start="457.4" data-end="461.61">solutions for the traditional IoT particle stack.</span> <span data-start="461.61" data-end="471.05">So, the web of things basically has been a specification by the W3C and there's some</span> <span data-start="471.05" data-end="475.31">implementation work by Mozilla and Google.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="475.31" data-end="481.58">And some things are actively involved in this implementation work as well.</span> <span data-start="481.58" data-end="484.789">And standardization works.</span> <span data-start="484.789" data-end="496.319">So, here we have actually a loosely web of things solution for the home.</span> <span data-start="496.319" data-end="498.78">And we actually talk about things.</span> <span data-start="498.78" data-end="512.26">So, can I basically you connect all your things together, manage them and connect to the cloud.</span> <span data-start="512.26" data-end="519">And we talk about controlling your things from your smart devices like mobile phone,</span> <span data-start="519" data-end="521.28">through progressive application.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="521.28" data-end="526.62">We talk about to have a new device, a new thing.</span> <span data-start="526.62" data-end="531.91">To connect and embody and connect to your network through web tools.</span> <span data-start="531.91" data-end="540.36">so, now we will look at each of those components in detail.</span> <span data-start="540.36" data-end="542.7">The first is the gateway.</span> <span data-start="542.7" data-end="549.57">I guess any of you attended the Mozilla web of things workshop this morning?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="549.57" data-end="550.57">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="550.57" data-end="557.97">So, this gentleman, what was your impression on yes.</span> <span data-start="557.97" data-end="562.13">It's actually quite impressive as a platform and it is open sourced.</span> <span data-start="562.13" data-end="565.07">So, this morning actually the workshop, I was there, actually.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="565.07" data-end="570.1">I think it's mainly talking about a way to stay connected to things.</span> <span data-start="570.1" data-end="572.67">But actually, it's more than that.</span> <span data-start="572.67" data-end="573.85">It's basically three paths.</span> <span data-start="573.85" data-end="577.97">We have the cloud over here.</span> <span data-start="577.97" data-end="586.19">The cloud is a districted collection of cloud services and provided by Mozilla to connect</span> <span data-start="586.19" data-end="588.42">devices across a geographic area.</span> <span data-start="588.42" data-end="592.23">And then we have syncs framework.</span> <span data-start="592.23" data-end="598.61">This syncs framework basically is a collection of reusable components to help you build your</span> <span data-start="598.61" data-end="600.11">own web things.</span> <span data-start="600.11" data-end="603.51">And we should directly expose the web of things API.</span> <span data-start="603.51" data-end="605.14">So, actually Mozilla created this API.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="605.14" data-end="606.14">They created a document.</span> <span data-start="606.14" data-end="607.8">Look it up, that's what they're following.</span> <span data-start="607.8" data-end="611.029">And coming to the things gateway.</span> <span data-start="611.029" data-end="621.76">The things gateway is an open implementation and which the tool is existing for access</span> <span data-start="621.76" data-end="622.76">to the web.</span> <span data-start="622.76" data-end="628.76">So, we can actually see that the backhand of the things are for JS.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="628.76" data-end="632.89">This is for JS developers, this is good news.</span> <span data-start="632.89" data-end="636.97">And NodeJS backend talking to the frontend through the API.</span> <span data-start="636.97" data-end="641.75">And through the secure web socket.</span> <span data-start="641.75" data-end="648.76">Apart from JS supported, web of things actually produced another concept called adapter.</span> <span data-start="648.76" data-end="652.48">This adapter is actually a language adapter.</span> <span data-start="652.48" data-end="659.99">It's programming things using another language such as Python.</span> <span data-start="659.99" data-end="662.49">Look at the security side.</span> <span data-start="662.49" data-end="672.35">So, basically the web of the Mozilla things, they gave the framework, actually.</span> <span data-start="672.35" data-end="676.23">They're going to have you establish the HTTPS where Mozilla tunneling is.</span> <span data-start="676.23" data-end="691.04">And also, if you are considered this is a type of structure for the situation.</span> <span data-start="691.04" data-end="698.329">So, actually can tell you how it is actually less encrypted.</span> <span data-start="698.329" data-end="703.06">So, you establish the tunnel from your gateway to your cloud server.</span> <span data-start="703.06" data-end="704.209">And let's consider another situation.</span> <span data-start="704.209" data-end="708.53">So, if you actually not on site, you're offsite.</span> <span data-start="708.53" data-end="711.51">You're actually somewhere remotely.</span> <span data-start="711.51" data-end="714.06">And there you want to access your things at home.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="714.06" data-end="719.529">In this case, actually Mozilla provides this bike tunnel.</span> <span data-start="719.529" data-end="726.57">Back handed tunnel from your cloud server to your gateway.</span> <span data-start="726.57" data-end="727.94">And the other thing, this is a security side.</span> <span data-start="727.94" data-end="734.06">And the other locater specification authorization is they actually follow you.</span> <span data-start="734.06" data-end="739.36">So, the token, because you can choose a different text token, the token they are using is a</span> <span data-start="739.36" data-end="741.88">JSON web token.</span> <span data-start="741.88" data-end="748.61">Yeah, show this is a snapshot from one of our applications.</span> <span data-start="748.61" data-end="753.959">So, this shows that actually this screen pops up on the owner.</span> <span data-start="753.959" data-end="758.99">What happens is when you go to the applications, you want to exercise your things.</span> <span data-start="758.99" data-end="764.72">So, the things here are mainly like the sensors in your home.</span> <span data-start="764.72" data-end="768.42">And the home screen, you have this pop up.</span> <span data-start="768.42" data-end="771.79">And you can grant the scope for the token.</span> <span data-start="771.79" data-end="774.1">It allows you to access certain things.</span> <span data-start="774.1" data-end="784.16">Or I can actually further you can actually grant a read access.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="784.16" data-end="785.779">You can grant rights access.</span> <span data-start="785.779" data-end="793.72">An owner cannot only do this, they can also delete and then revoke these tokens.</span> <span data-start="793.72" data-end="796.199">So, this actually is a privacy.</span> <span data-start="796.199" data-end="804.92">We can say, you know, you don't get my content or the scope if you don't ask me.</span> <span data-start="804.92" data-end="810.519">And the whole progress application, I'm sure they are down here.</span> <span data-start="810.519" data-end="816.92">We use the P tab for mainly for mobile phones to control devices.</span> <span data-start="816.92" data-end="826.449">So, P tableau is a website that creates a native app for user experiences.</span> <span data-start="826.449" data-end="833.509">They basically address the issues in the native mobile applications on the write side and</span> <span data-start="833.509" data-end="835.709">this new design concept in APIs.</span> <span data-start="835.709" data-end="838.79">But it's the way I've seen here.</span> <span data-start="838.79" data-end="841.85">Basically, you can add it to the screen to promote it.</span> <span data-start="841.85" data-end="845.569">This is basically a native application feature.</span> <span data-start="845.569" data-end="849.17">And they can do offline features offline functionality.</span> <span data-start="849.17" data-end="854.17">So, although the functionality is limited, it can still show you, you know, what is already</span> <span data-start="854.17" data-end="855.17">historically there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="855.17" data-end="856.48">You can still control something.</span> <span data-start="856.48" data-end="860.829">So, this offline connection for us is quite interesting.</span> <span data-start="860.829" data-end="867.17">Because it's actually allowing you to give us the possibility to minimize and install</span> <span data-start="867.17" data-end="870.74">and use the data as much as possible.</span> <span data-start="870.74" data-end="876.12">Also, you have to know give you the possibility to know what data is reserved in my device,</span> <span data-start="876.12" data-end="878.819">what is up there?</span> <span data-start="878.819" data-end="885.649">So, this feature is basically a chip that by I deploy a collection of technologies.</span> <span data-start="885.649" data-end="888.91">A service worker.</span> <span data-start="888.91" data-end="895.709">So, one thing is we need to talk about another aspect of security is you can unleash your</span> <span data-start="895.709" data-end="901.06">page through HTTPS.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="901.06" data-end="905.17">So, we talk about having a new device.</span> <span data-start="905.17" data-end="906.74">Onboarding with Bluetooth.</span> <span data-start="906.74" data-end="911.139">Bluetooth is basically based on Bluetooth low energy.</span> <span data-start="911.139" data-end="919.77">So, the idea here is that we use the web of Bluetooth APIs to discover and connect another</span> <span data-start="919.77" data-end="921.459">web of Bluetooth devices.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="921.459" data-end="927.76">And after that, when the authentication is finished, we pass the WiFi information to</span> <span data-start="927.76" data-end="929.86">the new device.</span> <span data-start="929.86" data-end="933.16">And then the new device is connected to the network through WiFi.</span> <span data-start="933.16" data-end="938.73">So, the web, that was the reason we chose it because the other thing is with the server.</span> <span data-start="938.73" data-end="941.06">And we have HTTPS.</span> <span data-start="941.06" data-end="947.35">And the other thing is if we want to start Bluetooth in discovery, you have to do it</span> <span data-start="947.35" data-end="948.47">through a user gesture.</span> <span data-start="948.47" data-end="953.3">This is another aspect of privacy.</span> <span data-start="953.3" data-end="963.97">So, we had we had IoT build out of one single holiday homes.</span> <span data-start="963.97" data-end="966.81">And we were thinking to how to connect them together.</span> <span data-start="966.81" data-end="970.04">Connecting them together is pretty standard.</span> <span data-start="970.04" data-end="975.12">Because you can get the cloud server and you can actually view that cloud connect and cloud</span> <span data-start="975.12" data-end="979.959">server which in this case Mozilla, they have actually prioritized that.</span> <span data-start="979.959" data-end="987.44">Whether we look at the solution, we particularly look at how scalable the solution is.</span> <span data-start="987.44" data-end="994.079">Can we expand what we have in this holiday result use case?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="994.079" data-end="1000.5">Can we extent it to a smart city case with millions and millions of devices?</span> <span data-start="1000.5" data-end="1001.5">Scalability.</span> <span data-start="1001.5" data-end="1006.74">And the other thing is that we know data is very, very valuable.</span> <span data-start="1006.74" data-end="1012.04">So, how do we make a good use of the user data?</span> <span data-start="1012.04" data-end="1014.68">And then we should respect their privacy.</span> <span data-start="1014.68" data-end="1020.66">So, with this in mind, actually, we want to use make good use of data.</span> <span data-start="1020.66" data-end="1024.44">We want to do statics and then we're going to do predictions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1024.44" data-end="1031.24">With this in mind, we basically are choosing learning.</span> <span data-start="1031.24" data-end="1036.26">If you have learned about federated learning?</span> <span data-start="1036.26" data-end="1038.199">Okay.</span> <span data-start="1038.199" data-end="1045.65">So, we actually made pretty much using federated learning in this IoT solution.</span> <span data-start="1045.65" data-end="1051.96">So, what happens is the learning is basically a collaborative motion learning without a</span> <span data-start="1051.96" data-end="1055.1">centralized training data.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1055.1" data-end="1065.46">So, basically the concept was initially proposed and termed by Google Paper two years back.</span> <span data-start="1065.46" data-end="1066.46">And decentralized.</span> <span data-start="1066.46" data-end="1071.87">We talk about decentralized because we mentioned that without centralized training data.</span> <span data-start="1071.87" data-end="1077.14">Which in this case is actually we talk about clients and aggregate server.</span> <span data-start="1077.14" data-end="1087.03">So, each client has their own local training model.</span> <span data-start="1087.03" data-end="1088.03">And the privacy.</span> <span data-start="1088.03" data-end="1090.74">We're going to talk more about pricing the next slide.</span> <span data-start="1090.74" data-end="1095.16">And the last point is the possible personalization for the user.</span> <span data-start="1095.16" data-end="1101.96">So, basically, you could have your local trained model and there's a possibility for you to</span> <span data-start="1101.96" data-end="1104.94">personalize this model for particular users.</span> <span data-start="1104.94" data-end="1116.36">So, if an IoT scenario, when we talk about privacy, for a client, link and a server.</span> <span data-start="1116.36" data-end="1119.12">We can talk about them together in conjunction.</span> <span data-start="1119.12" data-end="1127.7">So, the privacy features in for the learning basically matches the next three points.</span> <span data-start="1127.7" data-end="1129.26">Selective update.</span> <span data-start="1129.26" data-end="1132.39">Restrictive law, data update.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1132.39" data-end="1137.75">You don't use the you try not to get updates through raw data.</span> <span data-start="1137.75" data-end="1141.44">Rather you get through parameters.</span> <span data-start="1141.44" data-end="1147.94">And you process local data as close as possible to the data results.</span> <span data-start="1147.94" data-end="1151.21">Let's explain a little more on this in the architecture.</span> <span data-start="1151.21" data-end="1160.9">So, this is the architecture we have here to build the IoT for the whole holiday resort.</span> <span data-start="1160.9" data-end="1169.14">So, between things on the IoT gateway Mozilla gave away is enough to do communication.</span> <span data-start="1169.14" data-end="1178.41">So, we are talking about gateway or in each holiday home to collect with the cloud server.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1178.41" data-end="1181.63">You know, the server in the cloud.</span> <span data-start="1181.63" data-end="1185.501">And in this case, we called the client.</span> <span data-start="1185.501" data-end="1189.809">The client is the IoT gateway.</span> <span data-start="1189.809" data-end="1197.98">And the cloud server is the aggregate data server in the term of federated learning.</span> <span data-start="1197.98" data-end="1206.86">So, what happens here is the learning model located in each gateway, in each client.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1206.86" data-end="1209.799">And once we have the initial model.</span> <span data-start="1209.799" data-end="1212.71">So, you have it based on historical data.</span> <span data-start="1212.71" data-end="1216.372">And then train the initial model and you locate it.</span> <span data-start="1216.372" data-end="1219.4">You can actually locate them into each client.</span> <span data-start="1219.4" data-end="1222.73">And they are probably the same for the cloud server.</span> <span data-start="1222.73" data-end="1232.52">Once this is in, and the local gateways start to train their models according to the data</span> <span data-start="1232.52" data-end="1236.75">collected from this own house and update this model.</span> <span data-start="1236.75" data-end="1238.86">So, they keep on doing it.</span> <span data-start="1238.86" data-end="1246.25">And what happens, the aggregate server when it needs updated is randomly selected a certain</span> <span data-start="1246.25" data-end="1248.31">number of clients.</span> <span data-start="1248.31" data-end="1253.38">So, it's basically it's not at this time this time, this time, next time.</span> <span data-start="1253.38" data-end="1254.38">We don't know.</span> <span data-start="1254.38" data-end="1258.43">There was three of them in this time selected, another seven from another group.</span> <span data-start="1258.43" data-end="1266.89">So, the updates actually, the way that they send the updates with parameters.</span> <span data-start="1266.89" data-end="1271.29">The raw data will stay inside the house.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1271.29" data-end="1277.32">And then the cloud server basically, according to the updates collected, the cloud server,</span> <span data-start="1277.32" data-end="1281.169">the aggregate server, will update the model itself.</span> <span data-start="1281.169" data-end="1286.86">Once updated, it will also update the client models.</span> <span data-start="1286.86" data-end="1290.33">So, sorry.</span> <span data-start="1290.33" data-end="1303.95">So, with this we can actually it's actually actually we would meet with others.</span> <span data-start="1303.95" data-end="1306.58">First the data doesn't go out of your house.</span> <span data-start="1306.58" data-end="1309.63">The raw data doesn't go out of your house.</span> <span data-start="1309.63" data-end="1316.2">Second, the aggregate server still can, based on the model, is training the aggregate server,</span> <span data-start="1316.2" data-end="1321.909">started the prediction, created a prediction on statistics.</span> <span data-start="1321.909" data-end="1330">So, our work on federated learning in IoT is making progress.</span> <span data-start="1330" data-end="1334.99">At this moment we sync up the framework between the client and the server.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1334.99" data-end="1342.5">And then also we actually managed to get all kinds of flows in Raspberry Pi's 3.</span> <span data-start="1342.5" data-end="1349.52">This is just a simple example we have run on an aggregate service that we are in the</span> <span data-start="1349.52" data-end="1354.96">process of actually doing in like a utility usage in a house that the model is not fully</span> <span data-start="1354.96" data-end="1355.96">ready yet.</span> <span data-start="1355.96" data-end="1357.4">So, this is a model actually.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1357.4" data-end="1363.38">When we test the framework, we actually create it had simple model and just try to see how</span> <span data-start="1363.38" data-end="1364.76">things work.</span> <span data-start="1364.76" data-end="1370.429">So, this model basically is to recognize how to write in digits.</span> <span data-start="1370.429" data-end="1376.409">So, what happens is we show here basically the aggregate server.</span> <span data-start="1376.409" data-end="1380.61">Randomly collecting updates from three.</span> <span data-start="1380.61" data-end="1384">And selecting randomly select three clients.</span> <span data-start="1384" data-end="1388.11">And we are given parameters that actually updates the module.</span> <span data-start="1388.11" data-end="1394.77">So, what we created here is actually the statistics for the prediction accuracy.</span> <span data-start="1394.77" data-end="1400.48">So, if we actually this snapshot is around the nine or ten.</span> <span data-start="1400.48" data-end="1405.16">So, the accuracy you can see on the top is .98.</span> <span data-start="1405.16" data-end="1406.5">It's pretty good, actually.</span> <span data-start="1406.5" data-end="1419.77">We actually run we ran the accuracy pretty much on the .97, .98 mark.</span> <span data-start="1419.77" data-end="1424.98">So, this progress is seeing the progress we have inside.</span> <span data-start="1424.98" data-end="1430.15">And actually, we're updating pretty much every day.</span> <span data-start="1430.15" data-end="1435.24">So, if you're interested in this work, in our further work on this, do follow us.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1435.24" data-end="1439.4">We actually have another talk in full stack in London in July.</span> <span data-start="1439.4" data-end="1448.62">And my colleague who is an engineer will discuss this part further then.</span> <span data-start="1448.62" data-end="1453.029">So, that's pretty much my talk for today.</span> <span data-start="1453.029" data-end="1459.08">Thank you very much.</span> </p>
