<p><span data-start="14.57" data-end="18.92">I'm really excited to talk to you, and I'm going to get started by introducing myself.</span> <span data-start="18.92" data-end="24.87">My name is Max, and I'm a developer, and I'm an artist, and my day job is that like lime</span> <span data-start="24.87" data-end="27.05">a user-experience engineer.</span> <span data-start="27.05" data-end="32.57">That basically means that I'm an engineer and build things and it's directly informed</span> <span data-start="32.57" data-end="38.39">with the way that the user perceives it, and by the effect that it has on them and their</span> <span data-start="38.39" data-end="39.39">perceptions.</span> <span data-start="39.39" data-end="45.4">I also really love websites, particularly websites which are like useless or weird.</span> <span data-start="45.4" data-end="52.8">I think those are the most fun thing that you can build on a computer.</span> <span data-start="52.8" data-end="64.75">I'm talking today about building inter active experiences with WebAssembly, and I have to</span> <span data-start="64.75" data-end="70.139">level with you before we start that this talk is a little bit like a Trojan horse situation,</span> <span data-start="70.139" data-end="79.09">so I lured you into the stands with a promise of exciting web technology like WebAssembly</span> <span data-start="79.09" data-end="83.42">but I'm really going to talk to you about my favourite things which are falling sand</span> <span data-start="83.42" data-end="86.859">games, so I hope that's not a problem!</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="86.859" data-end="95.549">So, if you hasn't heard of falling sand games, they are kind of this whole genre of web games</span> <span data-start="95.549" data-end="109.24">like free flash applet kind of things where you have a palette of pixelated elements — pixelated</span> <span data-start="109.24" data-end="114.43">phenomenon.</span> <span data-start="114.43" data-end="118.45">They interactor with each other and cool things happen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="118.45" data-end="125.88">They share a lot in common with Conway's Game of Life, and, in particular, they have the</span> <span data-start="125.88" data-end="135.99">same kind of really cool behaviour behaviour where you have simple rules, and when you</span> <span data-start="135.99" data-end="141.099">let those play out, you get really amazing complex emergent behaviour.</span> <span data-start="141.099" data-end="147.45">It can be really surprising to even the person maybe who set up those rules and certainly</span> <span data-start="147.45" data-end="151.239">the person watching them play out, because you could never expect exactly what you would</span> <span data-start="151.239" data-end="155.48">get just based on reading that it does this, and these conditions are that.</span> <span data-start="155.48" data-end="157.349">It's much more complex.</span> <span data-start="157.349" data-end="164.93">Another thing I love about sand games is they have a low fidelity visual representation</span> <span data-start="164.93" data-end="166.43">of what is happening on screen.</span> <span data-start="166.43" data-end="172.67">You have a couple of coloured pixels maybe moving around a little bit but there is so</span> <span data-start="172.67" data-end="178.34">little to go off, that it lets your imagination run wild and interpret what you're seeing</span> <span data-start="178.34" data-end="186.23">with its own layer over what is going on, so you see something much more vivid in your</span> <span data-start="186.23" data-end="190.56">mind's eye than what is going on in the screen, and there is a lot of room to play with that,</span> <span data-start="190.56" data-end="192.159">and that's really fun.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="192.159" data-end="198.47">So many people oftentimes ask when they see these games like how do you win this game?</span> <span data-start="198.47" data-end="201.03">There is no win condition or score or anything like that.</span> <span data-start="201.03" data-end="204.959">The way the games work is that you're making your own objectives as you play, and that's</span> <span data-start="204.959" data-end="206.249">part of the game.</span> <span data-start="206.249" data-end="210.989">Oftentimes, that means understanding what is going on in front of you, so maybe you're</span> <span data-start="210.989" data-end="215.97">trying to figure out how a new element works, or how it interacts with another one.</span> <span data-start="215.97" data-end="222.43">You might make a hypothesis about what happens, make an experiment and test it out, or maybe</span> <span data-start="222.43" data-end="225.989">you will be like telling yourself a story, and playing it out with the elements in front</span> <span data-start="225.989" data-end="232.989">of you, and seeing what happens and imagining your mind, and so on, and so I think it's</span> <span data-start="232.989" data-end="237.569">really wonderful mode of play, and it is one where you're not only the player, but literatures</span> <span data-start="237.569" data-end="247.02">kind of a story-teller for yourself.</span> <span data-start="247.02" data-end="255.189">So my favourite falling sand game has been for a long game called the Powder Game.</span> <span data-start="255.189" data-end="260.95">And it kind of has this really interesting feature which is that when you make things</span> <span data-start="260.95" data-end="266.68">in it, right in the game, in the menu, you can upload them, and they go to a server,</span> <span data-start="266.68" data-end="269.22">and other people can browse them and see them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="269.22" data-end="274.91">It's got this long-standing weird and thriving community of people building interesting things,</span> <span data-start="274.91" data-end="277.7">and uploading them for each other.</span> <span data-start="277.7" data-end="283.411">And it's really cool to see, given like just these small tools, the kind of things that</span> <span data-start="283.411" data-end="286.11">people make for each other to play with.</span> <span data-start="286.11" data-end="291.54">So you've got like your bog standard is thousands and thousands of volcanos.</span> <span data-start="291.54" data-end="297.28">You know, it's like an infinite fourth grade science fair of different volcanos, but they're</span> <span data-start="297.28" data-end="300.74">cool, and I can see why people want to make volcanoes.</span> <span data-start="300.74" data-end="308.24">People make different destructible structures so you can load it into your browser and then</span> <span data-start="308.24" data-end="314.26">have fun setting it on fire, or pouring acid on it, and that is like a fun way to play</span> <span data-start="314.26" data-end="316.67">with somebody who you've never met.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="316.67" data-end="319.93">People get really creative.</span> <span data-start="319.93" data-end="323.94">There are all kinds of games that people make out of the simple elements they have like</span> <span data-start="323.94" data-end="330.5">mood rings, and you can see this one says it is clear it won't be accurate of your mood</span> <span data-start="330.5" data-end="331.88">unless you first vote.</span> <span data-start="331.88" data-end="334.93">There is a lot of vote-pandering in these communities.</span> <span data-start="334.93" data-end="339.89">It's a staple of how they communicate, but this is a cool game that somebody made inside</span> <span data-start="339.89" data-end="341.8">another game.</span> <span data-start="341.8" data-end="348.16">My personal favourite type of sand game upload is this entire genre called Don't Smoke where</span> <span data-start="348.16" data-end="355.43">it displays to you anatomical phenomenon that will that will happen if you smoke a cigarette,</span> <span data-start="355.43" data-end="363.27">like the lava will travel up and explode your brain.</span> <span data-start="363.27" data-end="364.82">These games are awesome.</span> <span data-start="364.82" data-end="370.94">You can see why I was fascinated with them for my entire childhood.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="370.94" data-end="377.56">As I get older and first learned to programme, as soon as I could run two for loops together,</span> <span data-start="377.56" data-end="384.72">I knew I wanted to build a falling sand game — the best one of, obviously!</span> <span data-start="384.72" data-end="392.46">I knew a bit of JavaScript and knew how to use an API, and I looked at other sand games</span> <span data-start="392.46" data-end="398.17">and how they were working and what the elements were doing had they were moving around, and</span> <span data-start="398.17" data-end="403.45">when I was re-implement ing them, I found they are really simple, and, with just a couple</span> <span data-start="403.45" data-end="408.88">of low numbers of hundreds of lines of JavaScript, I suddenly had water moving around the screen.</span> <span data-start="408.88" data-end="414.37">I was really excited, and I was having so much fun, but I realised that as I kept adding</span> <span data-start="414.37" data-end="418.62">new elements to the game, it was getting slower and slower, and I didn't have a very firm</span> <span data-start="418.62" data-end="425.61">grasp on concepts such as like functions, or having your code in more than one file,</span> <span data-start="425.61" data-end="431.21">and what I was manifesting was as I was adding more features into this big blob of code,</span> <span data-start="431.21" data-end="435.14">everything was getting more and more buggy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="435.14" data-end="439.42">You can see this blob on the right-hand side of the screen was an element that was a mistake</span> <span data-start="439.42" data-end="448.21">I made decided to domesticate and keep in the game as the given element.</span> <span data-start="448.21" data-end="451.11">I couldn't understand what was going on any more.</span> <span data-start="451.11" data-end="455.74">So I was okay, I'm going to have to do, refactor this code somehow and make it good.</span> <span data-start="455.74" data-end="459.5">I didn't know exactly what that meant but I knew I needed to be in different tiles,</span> <span data-start="459.5" data-end="463.35">so I had to set up webpack so I could have different JavaScript files.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="463.35" data-end="467.64">This is the last commit I made to the project in 2015.</span> <span data-start="467.64" data-end="470.11">Used webpack for my pending factor which never happened.</span> <span data-start="470.11" data-end="474.18">I think this is a common story.</span> <span data-start="474.18" data-end="479.18">So some time went by, and I got a cat.</span> <span data-start="479.18" data-end="481.88">I moved to California.</span> <span data-start="481.88" data-end="486.41">But other things were going on in my life but I was still thinking about sand games,</span> <span data-start="486.41" data-end="490.97">and I was noticing a lot of cool projects that were happening that were letting people</span> <span data-start="490.97" data-end="499.71">build and code in the browser, and kind of make programme one element of a larger system.</span> <span data-start="499.71" data-end="501.67">I thought that was really cool.</span> <span data-start="501.67" data-end="506.36">So I had this idea that I got excited about last year which is what if there was a falling</span> <span data-start="506.36" data-end="512.39">sand game where people could code their own elements and upload them, and then all those</span> <span data-start="512.39" data-end="516.91">elements by different people could interact, and there could be reactions that nobody ever</span> <span data-start="516.91" data-end="520.19">anticipated, and something could happen?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="520.19" data-end="524.92">So I kind of knew that I needed a different architecture diagram for my game rather than</span> <span data-start="524.92" data-end="529.38">having anything in one file and one blog, if people needed to write code, there would</span> <span data-start="529.38" data-end="537.8">be separation to an engine and maybe the different elements, and I was maybe inspired by things</span> <span data-start="537.8" data-end="543.31">like React and I thought okay, there can be an API that they talk over, and be the framework,</span> <span data-start="543.31" data-end="545.8">and then the components.</span> <span data-start="545.8" data-end="549.24">But I also knew that if I wanted people to actually code and upload their elements, there</span> <span data-start="549.24" data-end="553.21">would need to be a pleasant and easy experience, and I don't need to handle as many of the</span> <span data-start="553.21" data-end="556.35">edge cases as I could for them.</span> <span data-start="556.35" data-end="563.361">I started to prototype this and trying to move the gross logic out of the elements and</span> <span data-start="563.361" data-end="569.19">make them as easy and fun to make and make the engine, if it had to be gross, that was</span> <span data-start="569.19" data-end="570.19">fine.</span> <span data-start="570.19" data-end="573.59">I was really happy with this prototype and I was having so much fun building elements</span> <span data-start="573.59" data-end="582.51">in it, I was having a great time thought I want to keep doing it and if I know anything</span> <span data-start="582.51" data-end="588.63">about if you want someone to use your thing, it's got to be on the web as far as I'm concerned,</span> <span data-start="588.63" data-end="594.37">and so I wanted to start over and build it so that I could actually share it with people.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="594.37" data-end="597.23">So that kind of turned into Sand Spiel.</span> <span data-start="597.23" data-end="604.16">The rest of my talk is boring, if you want to do that for the next ten minutes, I'm not</span> <span data-start="604.16" data-end="605.23">going to judge you!</span> <span data-start="605.23" data-end="609.85">So, but I will give you a quick demo so you can see what it looks like.</span> <span data-start="609.85" data-end="612.89">I will press play.</span> <span data-start="612.89" data-end="614.029">You've got your different elements.</span> <span data-start="614.029" data-end="618.22">I will plant some flowers.</span> <span data-start="618.22" data-end="625.97">And then I think that people then set everything on fire, but it's okay.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="625.97" data-end="628.32">Doesn't release any carbon!</span> <span data-start="628.32" data-end="633.89">So, that's kind of what the game looks like, and you can see there is this canvas where</span> <span data-start="633.89" data-end="640.72">the simulation is happening, and there is the buttons and the UI.</span> <span data-start="640.72" data-end="648.43">So, the one of the things that I found when I was building Sand Spiel that turned out</span> <span data-start="648.43" data-end="654.82">to be critical and helped me to build it was that I decided to try to use WebAssembly.</span> <span data-start="654.82" data-end="660.13">So there is actually WebAssembly in this talk, I'm sorry.</span> <span data-start="660.13" data-end="665.24">I've said that word a couple of times now, maybe you've heard it this week, but just</span> <span data-start="665.24" data-end="671.05">to, like, rehash, WebAssembly is not really a language it's an instruction format that</span> <span data-start="671.05" data-end="676.9">you compile instructions to and has properties that people are excited about.</span> <span data-start="676.9" data-end="681.68">First of all, it's fast, so I'm not going to go into detail here because this is kind</span> <span data-start="681.68" data-end="690.8">of any kind of performance conversation, but particular ly it is, if you have a lot — it's</span> <span data-start="690.8" data-end="692.62">predictable what the performance will be.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="692.62" data-end="698.65">With JavaScript, you can make it fast, but you are relying on the way that it gets optimised,</span> <span data-start="698.65" data-end="704.49">and you need to write it in a very careful way, whereas with WebAssembly, there are much</span> <span data-start="704.49" data-end="708.05">less moving pieces, and, if you write it in a certain way, you know it will be fast on</span> <span data-start="708.05" data-end="710.75">everybody's browser.</span> <span data-start="710.75" data-end="714.62">Another important aspect of WebAssembly is that it is sandboxed.</span> <span data-start="714.62" data-end="720.92">So it is safe in WebAssembly to run code written by someone who you don't necessarily trust</span> <span data-start="720.92" data-end="727.39">on your machine, or even on your user's machine sometimes, and it's not going to steal their</span> <span data-start="727.39" data-end="729.75">passwords necessarily because it's sandboxed.</span> <span data-start="729.75" data-end="733.78">It can't reach into the rest of the system like some native code can.</span> <span data-start="733.78" data-end="737.05">I thought this was going to be an important thing for my of the game because I thought</span> <span data-start="737.05" data-end="743.38">I was going to be running people's code they wrote, and running it on other people's computers,</span> <span data-start="743.38" data-end="745">but it turns out I never got to that part.</span> <span data-start="745" data-end="746">That was ambitious.</span> <span data-start="746" data-end="750.73">In the future, this will come in handy, but just the other factors of WebAssembly were</span> <span data-start="750.73" data-end="751.92">useful to me.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="751.92" data-end="756.66">Lastly, I want to let people know that it really is ready to use.</span> <span data-start="756.66" data-end="762.28">I was surprised for this myself, but, you know, like four major browsers and some other</span> <span data-start="762.28" data-end="764.86">ones as well have already implemented it.</span> <span data-start="764.86" data-end="770.79">It works also like a mobile really well, and I was, I'm surprised by how fast it's moving</span> <span data-start="770.79" data-end="777.88">and the spec is pragmatic and informed by what browsers I we already have as far as</span> <span data-start="777.88" data-end="785.67">structure, and there is a lot of — it so is it is becoming something that you can ship.</span> <span data-start="785.67" data-end="789.589">And I had no problems with compatibility, surprisingly, with WebAssembly.</span> <span data-start="789.589" data-end="795.9">One more thing about it being ready to use is that the tooling is, at least in my experience,</span> <span data-start="795.9" data-end="797.38">was really good.</span> <span data-start="797.38" data-end="802.23">I wrote some Rust code for Sand Spiel that was compiled to WebAssembly.</span> <span data-start="802.23" data-end="808.37">The entire tool chain that I used to do that, including tools like Wasm and Pack, which</span> <span data-start="808.37" data-end="819.061">let you respect ively compile Rust code into a JavaScript file that loads it, and a tool</span> <span data-start="819.061" data-end="828.16">for kind of calling in between from WebAssembly and JavaScript, these tools are still like</span> <span data-start="828.16" data-end="830.02">in beta but nice to use.</span> <span data-start="830.02" data-end="836.75">There is a lot of shared culture and shared communication norms within the JavaScript</span> <span data-start="836.75" data-end="839.08">community and the Rust assembly community.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="839.08" data-end="842.93">If you have expectations about how a library should work and how a documentation should</span> <span data-start="842.93" data-end="847.49">be and what sort of error messages it should give you that you're used to from writing</span> <span data-start="847.49" data-end="854.18">JavaScript, go you go to write Rust in WebAssembly, you won't be shocked or horrifies because</span> <span data-start="854.18" data-end="855.47">it's a lot of the same people.</span> <span data-start="855.47" data-end="861.97">They have the same expectations you do of what a good user interface is for a tool.</span> <span data-start="861.97" data-end="866.33">This was really great, and I appreciate being able to use this.</span> <span data-start="866.33" data-end="869.912">Another really critical thing about that I want to tell you about the way that you can</span> <span data-start="869.912" data-end="874.56">use WebAssembly is that you don't have to write your whole application in it and it</span> <span data-start="874.56" data-end="878.81">happens to run in the browser and it's just a big hunk of Rust or something.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="878.81" data-end="884.31">My app is 50 per cent JavaScript and about 50 per cent Rust WebAssembly.</span> <span data-start="884.31" data-end="889.94">This was awesome because I got to put the things that needed to run many, many times</span> <span data-start="889.94" data-end="892.36">a second, and be really fast.</span> <span data-start="892.36" data-end="894.633">I got to write that in Rust and make it fast.</span> <span data-start="894.633" data-end="899.2">Then all the things that don't need to be fast because it's just like, you know, building</span> <span data-start="899.2" data-end="904.41">user interface, or triggering a network request, all those things I got to write?</span> <span data-start="904.41" data-end="909.24">JavaScript and benefit from the fact that JavaScript is really good at doing these — and</span> <span data-start="909.24" data-end="914.529">also that I got to use the whole ecosystem of React in different tools made this really</span> <span data-start="914.529" data-end="915.529">awesome.</span> <span data-start="915.529" data-end="920.09">If I had tried to write the whole thing in Rust, it would have taken longer because it's</span> <span data-start="920.09" data-end="925.75">like there's no good tools right now for building interfaces yet, not like the way there are</span> <span data-start="925.75" data-end="930.32">in JavaScript, and so being able to split my concerns here was really awesome.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="930.32" data-end="936.87">I think you can kind of imagine like the JavaScript code here is most ly just, you know, React</span> <span data-start="936.87" data-end="943.85">code like you may have seen before, and the way it interacts with Rust, is that essentially,</span> <span data-start="943.85" data-end="950.95">there is a gist-like class that has some functions, and — and from the respect of the, it, you're</span> <span data-start="950.95" data-end="952.399">calling the JavaScript functions.</span> <span data-start="952.399" data-end="959.47">I have a paint method which will draw a circle on to the screen in a certain element in a</span> <span data-start="959.47" data-end="965.04">certain radius, or I have one to reset the canvas, or to calculate a simulation.</span> <span data-start="965.04" data-end="969.36">From the JavaScript perspective, you're really just calling some methods and it happens to</span> <span data-start="969.36" data-end="971.06">be implemented in WebAssembly which is fast.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="971.06" data-end="975.63">That is some of the tools like I mention before.</span> <span data-start="975.63" data-end="981.67">So, as for the WebAssembly code, it looks like this tick method which ones one frame</span> <span data-start="981.67" data-end="982.67">per simulation.</span> <span data-start="982.67" data-end="985.47">I will show you how it works.</span> <span data-start="985.47" data-end="991.46">This is by the way what powers this part of the game, where the pixels are moving around</span> <span data-start="991.46" data-end="992.71">and interacting.</span> <span data-start="992.71" data-end="997.42">So essentially, I have a data structure which is like a big two dimensional array of all</span> <span data-start="997.42" data-end="1005.52">the data for my different cells of the grid, and it goes through, loops through each one</span> <span data-start="1005.52" data-end="1010.24">in order, and, when it gets to each one, it runs an update function based on whatever</span> <span data-start="1010.24" data-end="1017.38">the type is of the grid itself, and so you get to the third one, and it's a sand grid.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1017.38" data-end="1022.47">It's a piece of sand, so it matches to the sand update function, and the sand update</span> <span data-start="1022.47" data-end="1023.529">function is really simple.</span> <span data-start="1023.529" data-end="1032.499">It's like an if-else statement, and the way that that works is it it looks at its local</span> <span data-start="1032.499" data-end="1035.699">co-ordinate system and says what is the cell below me?</span> <span data-start="1035.699" data-end="1037.23">What is the type of that?</span> <span data-start="1037.23" data-end="1042.669">If it is empathy, then I can fall down, and I will just go down there, and I will erase</span> <span data-start="1042.669" data-end="1046.209">myself and rate myself one pixel lower.</span> <span data-start="1046.209" data-end="1051.77">If that first check failed and there is a piece of stone underneath you, then it goes</span> <span data-start="1051.77" data-end="1055.86">to the second statement, and it checks one of the diagonals and tries to fall there.</span> <span data-start="1055.86" data-end="1057.86">And it does the same thing.</span> <span data-start="1057.86" data-end="1062.529">So that is all there is to this algorithm that lets you do the sand, and kind of the</span> <span data-start="1062.529" data-end="1067.929">trick here is that it is happening on every pixel of the grid, and it is happening at</span> <span data-start="1067.929" data-end="1073.36">60 frames a second, and it starts to look like how you would imagine sand would work.</span> <span data-start="1073.36" data-end="1078.379">So there is, like, 18 other elements, and some are a little more complicated but they</span> <span data-start="1078.379" data-end="1083.21">have the same pattern of they're a single function, they call some APIs to read anywhere</span> <span data-start="1083.21" data-end="1086.24">neighbours and to write to their neighbours, and then you get different behaviour.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1086.24" data-end="1093.72">So, I mentioned this earlier, but it really was like the key to being to make this project</span> <span data-start="1093.72" data-end="1099.01">quickly, the fact that I could put things in WebAssembly that needed to be fast and</span> <span data-start="1099.01" data-end="1103.95">I could implement everything else in JavaScript, and use the ecosystem, and not have to worry</span> <span data-start="1103.95" data-end="1110.019">about all the type-checking and all of the other conditions that Rust enforces on your</span> <span data-start="1110.019" data-end="1118.539">code that can sometimes slow you down, and, so another thing that I mentioned is the network</span> <span data-start="1118.539" data-end="1127.259">code which is I also build like an upload and download functionality that I really liked,</span> <span data-start="1127.259" data-end="1131.77">and so this has been the most gratifying part of the project, so, a lot of — it's pretty</span> <span data-start="1131.77" data-end="1137.75">much middle-schoolers, but a lot of middle-schoolers play this game and draw amazing things.</span> <span data-start="1137.75" data-end="1143.899">They ignore the fact that there is a simulation attacked and use it like MS Paint and not</span> <span data-start="1143.899" data-end="1150.639">blocked in their computer lab which is maybe why they use it, but they draw awesome stuff,</span> <span data-start="1150.639" data-end="1153.1">and it's fun to see what they do.</span> <span data-start="1153.1" data-end="1159.12">I think like maybe one of the — so the most popular, there's an upvoting system and the</span> <span data-start="1159.12" data-end="1165.82">most liked and loved post is this puppy.</span> <span data-start="1165.82" data-end="1170.289">I can't explain it, but I also loved this puppy.</span> <span data-start="1170.289" data-end="1175.789">There is fan art and people remixing her and drawing her in different situation.</span> <span data-start="1175.789" data-end="1182.049">On the right, that's Super Duna Luna, the tall one.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1182.049" data-end="1191.249">In the Powder Game, there was a rule against load ing somebody else's submission.</span> <span data-start="1191.249" data-end="1198.36">We encourage forking in Sand Spiel which leads to this fun stuff.</span> <span data-start="1198.36" data-end="1203.899">Unfortunately, I mentioned that the best part of the project has been seeing the things</span> <span data-start="1203.899" data-end="1208.299">that people upload, but it's also been the worst part of the project as well.</span> <span data-start="1208.299" data-end="1214.99">Not everybody is nice, and there is like, I moderate the posts every morning and waking</span> <span data-start="1214.99" data-end="1216.52">up to it is not always fun.</span> <span data-start="1216.52" data-end="1220.879">Sometimes, I feel like this person where I feel like these people are ruining the game,</span> <span data-start="1220.879" data-end="1225.02">and I wish it had never been created so none of it would happen.</span> <span data-start="1225.02" data-end="1230.47">And so I do do some manual moderation, but it's really not sustainable, and I'm not sure</span> <span data-start="1230.47" data-end="1237.129">what to do, and so I've kind of, like, looked to where I look for to solve problems when</span> <span data-start="1237.129" data-end="1242.13">I have programming problems, and they've not been useful, like, there's no algorithm that</span> <span data-start="1242.13" data-end="1246.259">would be nice for making people be nice to each other on the internet.</span> <span data-start="1246.259" data-end="1251.07">Not even like string-matching algorithms work, I tried.</span> <span data-start="1251.07" data-end="1256.53">And like, nor do other places where who have usually solved my tough programming problems,</span> <span data-start="1256.53" data-end="1262.98">like CSS tricks, they have no button that will make people be nice to each other, unfortunately.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1262.98" data-end="1264.409">This is a problem I still have.</span> <span data-start="1264.409" data-end="1269.48">I haven't solved it, and I know there are people who have problems like this, and I'm</span> <span data-start="1269.48" data-end="1274.389">definitely curious to hear what they did or if they're just like there's all this invisible</span> <span data-start="1274.389" data-end="1277.289">work that happened behind the scenes that made it look like things are nice.</span> <span data-start="1277.289" data-end="1282.32">I definitely would be interested to talk if you think you know a solution.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1282.32" data-end="1286.389">Please do not tell me to use a neural network!</span> <span data-start="1286.389" data-end="1288.929">Thank you!</span> <span data-start="1288.929" data-end="1294.259">So, please do, I think we have a break after that, so please play with Sand Spiel if you</span> <span data-start="1294.259" data-end="1296.129">want to kill some time and chill out.</span> <span data-start="1296.129" data-end="1301.77">I have a longer form blog post that goes into more of the inspiration for the game and some</span> <span data-start="1301.77" data-end="1307.46">of the design decisions, and also into some of the technical details because I glossed</span> <span data-start="1307.46" data-end="1310.58">over some things.</span> <span data-start="1310.58" data-end="1314.74">Thank you so much!</span> </p>
