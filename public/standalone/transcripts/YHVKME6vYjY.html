<p><span data-start="230.23" data-end="237.07">This doesn't mean that all the classical periods were not continuing with the development of</span> <span data-start="237.07" data-end="247.06">their art, they continued until the industrial revolution when the introduction of the photography</span> <span data-start="247.06" data-end="257.03">and film was introduced in society, and painters stuck, they transferred their art forms in</span> <span data-start="257.03" data-end="261.05">different mediums.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="261.05" data-end="270.38">In the 1970s, a group of artists created hyper-realism to resist the mainstream photography in the</span> <span data-start="270.38" data-end="277.22">arts, and GPU used that precisely with maths and physics.</span> <span data-start="277.22" data-end="283.58">Knowing what brush or paint texture to take and to use in your art will define your final</span> <span data-start="283.58" data-end="288.3">imagery output and your audience.</span> <span data-start="288.3" data-end="294.87">But how you use do all this, a little explanation of how you can produce work might be relevant</span> <span data-start="294.87" data-end="296.13">in this case.</span> <span data-start="296.13" data-end="304.18">There are two sides that you need to take care, the geometry buffer and the fragment</span> <span data-start="304.18" data-end="306.669">buffer, or pixel buffer.</span> <span data-start="306.669" data-end="311.57">As the name described in one, one handles the geometry better and the other one handles</span> <span data-start="311.57" data-end="314.24">the fragments better.</span> <span data-start="314.24" data-end="317.15">Both are interconnected by uniform and attributes that move, data.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="317.15" data-end="322.71">They move data between both buffers.</span> <span data-start="322.71" data-end="327.93">You can transform them every single time in virtual space and in virtual time.</span> <span data-start="327.93" data-end="332.08">The amount of Kate that is loaded to these buffers  —  the amount of data that is loaded</span> <span data-start="332.08" data-end="333.59">to the buffers charges the performance budget.</span> <span data-start="333.59" data-end="339.169">You will have to be careful how you create your assets and display it in their application.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="339.169" data-end="344.46">A fine balance between them, otherwise the application might suffer the risk to get blocked</span> <span data-start="344.46" data-end="350.43">by the browser, or user security, or user experience issues.</span> <span data-start="350.43" data-end="354.58">How do we create those assets to have that balance in your application?</span> <span data-start="354.58" data-end="359.43">First, I'm going to explain about 3D modelling capturing.</span> <span data-start="359.43" data-end="366.06">There are multiple methods to create but one of the most popular ones is where you surround</span> <span data-start="366.06" data-end="373.79">your audience with multiple cameras and capture the images of that object and then get all</span> <span data-start="373.79" data-end="380.53">the data points, and put it into your modelling.</span> <span data-start="380.53" data-end="395.16">This is a hexagonal surround.</span> <span data-start="395.16" data-end="401.55">This is a complex environment, racing games, they are done this way for video game consoles,</span> <span data-start="401.55" data-end="409.16">for example, and cylindrical ones are done for human bodies or more complex shapes.</span> <span data-start="409.16" data-end="414.55">Another way is to laser scan the object.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="414.55" data-end="423.889">This method is pretty great for reverse engineering on some objects, and it's used for decoration</span> <span data-start="423.889" data-end="430.1">of cars or other objects that are industrial production.</span> <span data-start="430.1" data-end="438.419">The most classical one to create the objects is by volumetric from blueprint.</span> <span data-start="438.419" data-end="445.92">It gives less noise in the correction but it takes a lot of time to optimise, so it's</span> <span data-start="445.92" data-end="450.039">not cost-effective compared with the other two methods.</span> <span data-start="450.039" data-end="456.66">Once you have all that, with you're ready to remove the excesses by running the 3D model</span> <span data-start="456.66" data-end="467.449">tools and you take out the — manually, your team is required to arrange — misarray, and</span> <span data-start="467.449" data-end="477.53">place the normal vector perpendicular to the triangle in order to have accurate lights</span> <span data-start="477.53" data-end="482.3">and reflections in the object.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="482.3" data-end="485.31">The creation of textures is also important.</span> <span data-start="485.31" data-end="489.33">It is used methods like analysis as well.</span> <span data-start="489.33" data-end="497.169">When you take the photograph of the texture that you want to replicate, and just in an</span> <span data-start="497.169" data-end="504.36">image-processing tool like Photoshop, or something like that, and just adjust the value of the</span> <span data-start="504.36" data-end="509.139">pixels and accommodate it for being able to be scaleable.</span> <span data-start="509.139" data-end="515.25">Once you have that texture, you can reduce some information from the channels and then</span> <span data-start="515.25" data-end="520.61">you can create other textures like the normal maps, and so on.</span> <span data-start="520.61" data-end="526.11">The way how you arrange these textures in your programme are going to transform the</span> <span data-start="526.11" data-end="530.38">different visual output, so you have to be careful how you arrange them and you have</span> <span data-start="530.38" data-end="536.67">to play with those textures and adjust them, and you will see how the final material is</span> <span data-start="536.67" data-end="539.89">going to be represented in your display.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="539.89" data-end="548.63">For that, it's necessary to have knowledge of shading programme and 3D renders, whatever</span> <span data-start="548.63" data-end="549.63">it is.</span> <span data-start="549.63" data-end="550.63">It's important.</span> <span data-start="550.63" data-end="561.29">Realistic 3D are large applications, so you have to treat them like big applications in</span> <span data-start="561.29" data-end="562.55">JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="562.55" data-end="569.41">They require much data, so the loading process can be long.</span> <span data-start="569.41" data-end="575.04">There are many presentations already in this video conference where you can take information</span> <span data-start="575.04" data-end="580.6">into of how to create the large applications.</span> <span data-start="580.6" data-end="586.74">Generally speaking, the advice would be the same: you have to reduce the server calls</span> <span data-start="586.74" data-end="594.38">when loading scripts and assets as much as possible, load first scripts and styles, load</span> <span data-start="594.38" data-end="595.399">then textures.</span> <span data-start="595.399" data-end="601.45">I like to initialise the fragment shaders right after I finish loading the textures.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="601.45" data-end="607.76">And create the materials, and, right after that, I will load the geometry data, and initialise</span> <span data-start="607.76" data-end="614.279">the shaders, and grab those geometries with the fragment shaders previously created.</span> <span data-start="614.279" data-end="620.6">I like to follow this path because the declaration of both buffers is very heavy for the machine,</span> <span data-start="620.6" data-end="625.709">so you can crush the application, and your experience can get broken at that point.</span> <span data-start="625.709" data-end="631.5">Once all this process is over, the rest of the journey is going to be very smooth.</span> <span data-start="631.5" data-end="637.6">Creating lighting is important, because it adds volume to the objects to the scene.</span> <span data-start="637.6" data-end="644.38">And you need to have a lighting model that is going to be uniform in all the materials.</span> <span data-start="644.38" data-end="651.57">As smart as it is, it's not as smart as dragging and dropping, having a AAA graphics out the</span> <span data-start="651.57" data-end="652.57">box.</span> <span data-start="652.57" data-end="659.43">Indeed, it gives you some advances but you have to play with the values of your materials</span> <span data-start="659.43" data-end="663.01">until you find the right balance of it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="663.01" data-end="667.269">You will see that some materials, when the light is getting too close, the material is</span> <span data-start="667.269" data-end="672.459">going to get over illuminated, and going to burn, and in other materials, they're going</span> <span data-start="672.459" data-end="678.45">to get back, and be flat, looking very flat.</span> <span data-start="678.45" data-end="683.68">So, play with those values, and you're going to be finding your balance in there.</span> <span data-start="683.68" data-end="688.61">Other good things about TVR is that it case-by-case basis previous model like lambda illumination</span> <span data-start="688.61" data-end="697.69">or — those illuminations give some visual artefacts for you to play when you are required</span> <span data-start="697.69" data-end="701.26">to have the textures in there.</span> <span data-start="701.26" data-end="705.11">- that it requires.</span> <span data-start="705.11" data-end="713.01">The computed illumination and textures is known as back illumination.</span> <span data-start="713.01" data-end="722.94">Usually, we use that in level design where the camera is not going to get so close to</span> <span data-start="722.94" data-end="729.95">the environment, or the area that is going to be displayed, and it's a great way to save</span> <span data-start="729.95" data-end="736.399">the resources that you can use in other areas of your application like the object that it</span> <span data-start="736.399" data-end="742.22">requires to look realistic.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="742.22" data-end="747.75">In configurators, the lighting model is fixed, and it's a little bit more easier than the</span> <span data-start="747.75" data-end="755.14">work-throughs, for example, in game and level design, because light is fixed and you can</span> <span data-start="755.14" data-end="760.36">surround it with your camera all the time, so, there's no need to move the cameras for</span> <span data-start="760.36" data-end="763.709">the lights all the time when the camera moves.</span> <span data-start="763.709" data-end="772.1">So some engines, the geometries and the lights, others just code the geometries, so, depending</span> <span data-start="772.1" data-end="776.55">on that, you choose what illumination to take.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="776.55" data-end="783.74">My recommendation is that you have to target, a minimum of three lights, and the maximum</span> <span data-start="783.74" data-end="793.399">of six lights, including its own light if you're building .. .</span> <span data-start="793.399" data-end="802.589">Balance this with a material properties, and that will give you more performance space</span> <span data-start="802.589" data-end="805.86">for the geometries and textures.</span> <span data-start="805.86" data-end="808.14">Post-processing is important.</span> <span data-start="808.14" data-end="812.06">It's the second layer of the process in the pipeline.</span> <span data-start="812.06" data-end="814">But it's expensive for the machine.</span> <span data-start="814" data-end="819.12">But it gives you another advantage because you can have a layer of colour correction</span> <span data-start="819.12" data-end="823.54">or illumination, and adjustment of pixels.</span> <span data-start="823.54" data-end="829.05">You can transform at this point with the fragment shaders your image, since it's rasterized</span> <span data-start="829.05" data-end="832">already by the renderer.</span> <span data-start="832" data-end="840.11">It's one single image, and you can apply any models in there like neighbouring pixels,</span> <span data-start="840.11" data-end="847.181">and you can transform and make it more bright, move them into the dimensions, and create</span> <span data-start="847.181" data-end="850.97">all the effects that developers like to do.</span> <span data-start="850.97" data-end="857.92">Play with those values until you find your final imagery and you're happy with the visual</span> <span data-start="857.92" data-end="861.079">look that you have.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="861.079" data-end="870.57">Now, there was diversification of hardware has brought us great opportunities but also</span> <span data-start="870.57" data-end="875.57">stillness because finding the next path to take is hard.</span> <span data-start="875.57" data-end="885.17">The ways to information through these many mediums we are expecting to happen, and we're</span> <span data-start="885.17" data-end="891.11">a little bit confused in how to move around in the development process.</span> <span data-start="891.11" data-end="895.17">There is an order of development that needs to be addressed.</span> <span data-start="895.17" data-end="902.88">I recommend first to step the first step to target mobile and desktop, and, based on that,</span> <span data-start="902.88" data-end="905.21">move to other mediums.</span> <span data-start="905.21" data-end="912.97">I'm going to speak about it precisely with augmented reality with mobile devices, because</span> <span data-start="912.97" data-end="918.23">it's what it might come faster, and reaches more audience.</span> <span data-start="918.23" data-end="926.8">The reason why it is this order that I recommend, is because if the application doesn't perform</span> <span data-start="926.8" data-end="931.92">okay with your basic configuration options, it's not going to perform or look the same</span> <span data-start="931.92" data-end="939.029">either in your augmented reality application.</span> </p>
