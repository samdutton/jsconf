the</span> <span data-start="43.8" data-end="46.5">same name so if you've read that post</span> <span data-start="46.5" data-end="48.059">you probably already know what you're</span> <span

data-end="56.94">like the post it's based on it's kind of</span> <span data-start="56.94" data-end="58.469">this melange of thoughts and</span> <span data-start="58.469" data-end="60.09">philosophies

that</span> <span data-start="88.229" data-end="91.86">would be boring so instead I'll kick</span> <span data-start="91.86" data-end="94.32">things off and talk about an exciting</span> <span

data-end="122.909">catastrophe that began with the creation</span> <span data-start="122.909" data-end="126.27">of the mortgage-backed security exciting</span> <span data-start="126.27"

data-end="141.79">it's generally considered a very safe</span> <span data-start="141.79" data-end="144.01">investment most people don't default on</span> <span data-start="144.01" data-end="146.29">their loans this limits the risk</span> <span data-start="146.29" data-end="149.02">so while returns are relatively modest</span> <span data-start="149.02" data-end="152.44">they're dependable seems pretty boring</span> <span data-start="152.44" data-end="155.32">so far right here's where it gets</span> <span data-start="155.32" data-end="158.37">exciting when Congress

<p><span data-start="158.37" data-end="161.32">Investment Banking in the 90s investment</span> <span data-start="161.32" data-end="164.53">banks got all ginned up the lack of</span> <span

side came credit default</span> <span data-start="175.84" data-end="178.03">swaps where investors could bet against</span> <span data-start="178.03" data-end="179.92">the US housing market

<span data-start="185.31" data-end="189.4">that's exactly what happened as the Fed</span> <span data-start="189.4" data-end="191.08">raised interest rates in an attempt to</span> <span

data-end="196.72">accordingly which spurred defaults on a</span> <span data-start="196.72" data-end="201.13">massive scale and then markets tanked</span> <span data-start="201.13" data-end="204.16">taking the economy with them all because</span> <span data-start="204.16" data-end="206.92">investing wasn't risky or exciting</span> <span data-start="206.92" data-end="211.72">enough already this is a perfect example</span> <span data-start="211.72" data-end="213.43">to me of when boring would have been</span> <span data-start="213.43" data-end="214.6">preferable to exciting</span> <span data-start="214.6" data-end="217.93">if markets and banks had been properly</span> <span data-start="217.93" data-end="219.7">regulated and yielded

homes and just as an aside and</span> <span data-start="233.53" data-end="236.05">it's a total aside this is why ethics</span> <span data-start="236.05" data-end="238.69">and regulations are critical because</span> <span data-start="238.69" data-end="240.7">just because you can fleece someone for</span> <span data-start="240.7" data-end="242.08">everything they've got doesn't mean you</span> <span data-start="242.08" data-end="245.47">should if it sounds like I'm drawing a</span> <span data-start="245.47" data-end="247.66">parallel between the state of modern</span> <span data-start="247.66" data-end="250.03">development and this kind of crisis it's</span> <span data-start="250.03" data-end="252.55">because I am but I acknowledge that we</span> <span data-start="252.55" data-end="254.709">are not hurtling toward a comparable</span> <span data-start="254.709" data-end="256.989">crisis with even remotely similar</span> <span data-start="256.989" data-end="259.84">consequences but we are headed towards</span> <span data-start="259.84" data-end="262.57">something and the trend doesn't look so</span> <span data-start="262.57" data-end="264.7">great and part of the reason why this</span> <span data-start="264.7" data-end="266.8">trend persists at least I believe is</span> <span data-start="266.8" data-end="267.879">because we're not operating with</span> <span data-start="267.879" data-end="271">sensible defaults and more and more web</span> <span data-start="271" data-end="272.8">development has become more like</span> <span data-start="272.8" data-end="274.72">software engineering in some respects I</span> <span data-start="274.72" data-end="276.55">believe this is a welcome in logical</span> <span data-start="276.55" data-end="279.849">progression but I do sometimes wonder in</span> <span data-start="279.849" data-end="282.46">the dead of night if we're ready for all</span> <span data-start="282.46" data-end="284.28">the responsibilities that that entails</span> <span data-start="284.28" data-end="286.78">because rather than evaluating each</span> <span data-start="286.78" data-end="288.58">individual projects requirements and</span> <span data-start="288.58" data-end="291.25">adapting our choice of tools to them we</span> <span data-start="291.25" data-end="293.289">tend to dive into right into what makes</span> <span data-start="293.289" data-end="295.99">development exciting and fun for us so</span> <span data-start="295.99" data-end="297.55">to that end what do we do when we start</span> <span data-start="297.55" data-end="301.18">a new project we npm install a preferred</span> <span data-start="301.18" data-end="304.93">framework and then we might install a</span> <span data-start="304.93" data-end="306.819">client-side router for that framework</span> <span data-start="306.819" data-end="310.27">and then maybe even a state management</span> <span data-start="310.27" data-end="314.11">library for the framework of course and</span> <span data-start="314.11" data-end="316.78">before you know it a project has started</span> <span data-start="316.78" data-end="318.909">with an amount of overhead that's baked</span> <span data-start="318.909" data-end="321.219">in until you decide to migrate away from</span> <span data-start="321.219" data-end="325.06">it somehow your preference for what</span> <span data-start="325.06" data-end="326.71">makes development more exciting or</span> <span data-start="326.71" data-end="329.139">perhaps I should say more convenient or</span> <span data-start="329.139" data-end="331.36">comfortable has forced you to make</span> <span data-start="331.36" data-end="333.039">trade-offs that could make your apps</span> <span data-start="333.039" data-end="337.889">lower less accessible and less usable</span> <span data-start="337.889" data-end="339.909">when it comes to software development</span> <span data-start="339.909" data-end="341.56">there's a word that I think is really</span> <span data-start="341.56" data-end="343.949">important and that word is constraints</span> <span data-start="343.949" data-end="346.18">think of your favorite video games

data-end="362.86">so very little yet I don't think it</span> <span data-start="362.86" data-end="364.69">fully acknowledges that the constraints</span> <span data-start="364.69" data-end="366.699">game developers faced at the time we're</span> <span data-start="366.699" data-end="370.449">far more fixed than ours are now so when</span> <span data-start="370.449" data-end="372.49">developers make console games they knew</span> <span data-start="372.49" data-end="374.08">every consumer had the same hardware</span> <span data-start="374.08" data-end="375.969">those were the constraints and they were</span> <span data-start="375.969" data-end="379.779">very predictable our constraints however</span> <span data-start="379.779" data-end="382.93">make our job uniquely difficult people</span> <span data-start="382.93" data-end="384.46">access the web on a variety of devices</span> <span data-start="384.46"

are convenient and they</span> <span data-start="404.68" data-end="406.36">help us to be productive they do</span> <span data-start="406.36" data-end="409.6">sometimes confer an external cost on</span> <span data-start="409.6" data-end="411.16">users that we must acknowledge and</span> <span data-start="411.16" data-end="414.91">redress in some capacity this is</span> <span
