pleasure of giving</span> <span data-start="55.26" data-end="58.05">talks separately and hang out for three</span> <span data-start="58.05" data-end="60.27">whole days where we got along really</span> <span data-start="60.27" data-end="63.96">well so that when two months later Nadi</span> <span data-start="63.96" data-end="66.9">put up her as VG tutorials accompanying</span> <span data-start="66.9" data-end="70.5">her talks I give them into them with</span> <span data-start="70.5" data-end="74.4">vigor and as I started talking to Nadi</span> <span data-start="74.4" data-end="76.77">with questions about her tutorials</span> <span data-start="76.77" data-end="79.02">restarted somehow commiserating around</span> <span data-start="79.02" data-end="82.2">the fact that we really hadn't

<span data-start="87.09" data-end="91.47">and that was when I had an idea and I</span> <span data-start="91.47" data-end="93.84">asked Nani fully expecting to be</span> <span data-start="93.84" data-end="96.54">rejected do you want to collaborate with</span> <span data-start="96.54" data-end="101.88">me and then she said yes and that's how</span> <span data-start="101.88" data-end="105.93">they discussed started so in the</span> <span data-start="105.93" data-end="108">following week we fear doubt that we</span> <span data-start="108" data-end="110.07">both like the idea where we would create</span> <span data-start="110.07" data-end="112.59">a visualization around a specific topic</span> <span data-start="112.59" data-end="115.5">each month and do that for a year to see</span> <span data-start="115.5" data-end="117.63">how two people would create two</span> <span data-start="117.63" data-end="119.88">visualizations starting from the same</span> <span data-start="119.88" data-end="122.399">seed the topic and then diverging into</span> <span data-start="122.399" data-end="123.78">different paths based on our own</span> <span data-start="123.78" data-end="126.659">interest in history well besides sharing</span> <span data-start="126.659" data-end="128.52">the end result we also want to write</span> <span data-start="128.52" data-end="130.53">about the creation process</span> <span data-start="130.53" data-end="132.03">and we split this up into the three</span> <span data-start="132.03" data-end="134.28">pillars that we find most important data</span> <span data-start="134.28" data-end="137.79">sketches and coding and initially we</span> <span data-start="137.79" data-end="139.65">thought we could pull data sketches off</span> <span data-start="139.65" data-end="142.44">with about five to six hours a week but</span> <span data-start="142.44" data-end="144.51">yeah as usual real life doesn't really</span> <span data-start="144.51" data-end="146.91">care about your plans especially coding</span> <span data-start="146.91" data-end="150.27">plans so since starting in July 2016</span> <span data-start="150.27" data-end="152.94">we've clocked many many hours into</span> <span data-start="152.94" data-end="154.91">creating a visualization each month and</span> <span data-start="154.91" data-end="157.5">during this talk we'd like to take you</span> <span data-start="157.5" data-end="158.94">through some of the lessons that we</span> <span data-start="158.94" data-end="161.25">learned the challenges that we face now</span> <span data-start="161.25" data-end="163.23">we can tackle them and the insights that</span> <span data-start="163.23" data-end="166.8">we gathered along the way so let's start</span> <span data-start="166.8" data-end="169.68">with the data we often get asked this</span> <span data-start="169.68" data-end="172.29">question do you get your idea you get</span> <span data-start="172.29" data-end="174.12">your data first and then come up with</span> <span data-start="174.12" data-end="176.73">the idea or do you get your ideas first</span> <span data-start="176.73" data-end="180.75">and for the two of us the answer is</span> <span data-start="180.75" data-end="185.31">always always idea first so for example</span> <span data-start="185.31" data-end="187.53">for our November data sketches I</span> <span data-start="187.53" data-end="190.5">visualized every single line in the</span> <span data-start="190.5" data-end="197.1">musical called Hamilton and built a tool</span> <span data-start="197.1" data-end="199.11">where I can filter by any set of</span> <span data-start="199.11" data-end="201.35">characters their conversations and</span> <span data-start="201.35" data-end="204.78">phrases and then be able to dig into all</span> <span data-start="204.78" data-end="206.79">of the lyrics that were left in the</span> <span data-start="206.79" data-end="210.72">remaining song and the question I</span> <span data-start="210.72" data-end="213.39">started with was this how do the</span> <span data-start="213.39" data-end="215.55">relationship change between the</span> <span data-start="215.55" data-end="218.9">characters as a musical progresses and</span> <span data-start="218.9" data-end="221.67">what are the recurring phrases and who</span> <span data-start="221.67" data-end="225.57">are they associated with now as you can</span> <span data-start="225.57" data-end="227.76">probably imagine this data was not</span> <span data-start="227.76" data-end="231.6">available online anywhere so I had to go</span> <span data-start="231.6" data-end="234.12">through each of those lyrics noting</span> <span data-start="234.12" data-end="236.519">every single time a phrase occurred</span> <span data-start="236.519" data-end="240.989">across more than one song group those</span> <span data-start="240.989" data-end="244.709">phrases into themes and then go through</span> <span data-start="244.709" data-end="246.66">the lyrics again entering them into the</span> <span data-start="246.66" data-end="249.06">computer and associating them with the</span> <span data-start="249.06" data-end="251.85">right song and line number and gene</span> <span data-start="251.85" data-end="253.44">exact same thing for the characters and</span> <span data-start="253.44" data-end="256.26">conversations and then I wrote a script</span> <span data-start="256.26" data-end="258.45">to aggregate those characters in themes</span> <span data-start="258.45" data-end="260.52">by their song and line number to get my</span> <span data-start="260.52" data-end="262.03">final data set</span> <span
