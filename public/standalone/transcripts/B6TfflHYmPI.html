<span data-start="2174" data-end="2175.14">wondering i mean one of that one of</span> <span data-start="2175.14" data-end="2176.609">these we're talking some folks recently</span> <span data-start="2176.609" data-end="2178.38">bad is to doing that install an app that</span> <span data-start="2178.38" data-end="2180.27">kind of starts with a single focus that</span> <span data-start="2180.27" data-end="2182.28">they get add more capabilities to it</span> <span data-start="2182.28" data-end="2184.44">essentially becomes more the launcher of</span> <span
