let's do it</span> <span data-start="70.64" data-end="72.59">so the motivation behind this all of why</span> <span data-start="72.59" data-end="73.869">are we even looking at native technology</span> <span data-start="73.869" data-end="77.21">is to build delightful apps um so what</span> <span data-start="77.21" data-end="79.4">do I mean when I say that I I mean not</span> <span data-start="79.4" data-end="81.29">just apps that work that do what they</span> <span data-start="81.29" data-end="83.96">need to do but apps that are really cool</span> <span data-start="83.96" data-end="85.82">apps that are delightful that have a</span> <span data-start="85.82" data-end="87.92">fascinating UI that performs extremely</span> <span data-start="87.92" data-end="90.71">well beautiful touch
