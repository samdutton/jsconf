<span data-start="668.26" data-end="670.029">that's not it's quite the case we just</span> <span data-start="670.029" data-end="672.399">need to keep these people happy and they</span> <span

data-end="697.209">you have a plethora of people that are</span> <span data-start="697.209" data-end="698.889">already kind of know about your culture</span> <span data-start="698.889"

data-end="705.579">this will talk about productivity there</span> <span data-start="705.579" data-end="708.31">one last thing on here which is the fact</span> <span data-start="708.31" data-end="709.81">that when you have happy people they're</span> <span data-start="709.81" data-end="713.86">much more productive on the job so three</span> <span data-start="713.86" data-end="715.959">to four times as productive on the job</span> <span data-start="715.959" data-end="717.579">when they are happy versus when they are</span> <span data-start="717.579"

data-end="724.779">means that literally you could pretty</span> <span data-start="724.779" data-end="726.79">much take a day off of work every single</span> <span data-start="726.79" data-end="729.73">week and be just as productive by the</span> <span data-start="729.73" data-end="732.01">four-day workweek than a five day just</span> <span data-start="732.01" data-end="735.07">by having happy people so what can we do</span> <span data-start="735.07" data-end="737.74">to build this culture of growth at all</span> <span data-start="737.74" data-end="739.089">though we have a lot of wonderful things</span> <span data-start="739.089" data-end="741.37">that we do and I'm going to go through</span> <span data-start="741.37" data-end="743.68">these and give a little description and</span> <span data-start="743.68" data-end="745.6">maybe a little few tips that I have one</span> <span data-start="745.6" data-end="748">of these as well the first off is kind</span> <span data-start="748" data-end="749.89">of the easiest to do lunch and learns or</span> <span data-start="749.89" data-end="752.829">brown bag sessions so this is a simple</span> <span data-start="752.829" data-end="755.17">factor of getting together with a group</span> <span data-start="755.17" data-end="757.269">of people over lunch people bring their</span> <span data-start="757.269" data-end="759.37">lunch into a meeting room and one or</span> <span data-start="759.37" data-end="761.47">multiple people can talk about something</span> <span data-start="761.47" data-end="763.99">that they know and then it's really just</span> <span data-start="763.99" data-end="766.36">there to help disperse information or</span> <span data-start="766.36" data-end="767.98">teach something or get people kind of</span> <span data-start="767.98" data-end="770.199">enticed on on something kind of like</span> <span data-start="770.199" data-end="772.66">these talks here the next is lightning</span> <span data-start="772.66" data-end="774.97">talks once again we see this a lot in</span> <span data-start="774.97" data-end="777.67">conferences 5 to 15 minute long talks</span> <span data-start="777.67" data-end="780.04">and the really nice thing here is they</span> <span data-start="780.04" data-end="781.899">can be done really in succession so</span> <span data-start="781.899" data-end="783.339">maybe during a lunch and learn you can</span> <span data-start="783.339" data-end="785.26">have four or five different people do</span> <span data-start="785.26" data-end="788.92">smaller talks there another one that I</span> <span data-start="788.92" data-end="791.47">really enjoy working with is third-party</span> <span data-start="791.47" data-end="794.86">workshops so how many people actually</span> <span data-start="794.86" data-end="796.569">heard about the graph QL workshops or</span> <span data-start="796.569" data-end="798.1">ones are the react workshop or any other</span> <span data-start="798.1" data-end="799.18">workshops that we have</span> <span data-start="799.18" data-end="802.21">here excellent I know I saw a lot of</span> <span data-start="802.21" data-end="803.83">people at the graph QL workshop they're</span> <span data-start="803.83" data-end="805.54">here tonight as well and I thank you</span> <span data-start="805.54" data-end="808.03">guys for coming out here because that</span> <span data-start="808.03" data-end="811.92">was actually a product of my own work</span> <span data-start="811.92" data-end="815.41">using these techniques a third-party</span> <span data-start="815.41" data-end="817.57">workshop can be done in a couple ways</span> <span data-start="817.57" data-end="819.52">they can be done privately for companies</span> <span data-start="819.52" data-end="821.14">which can be quite expensive for the</span> <span data-start="821.14" data-end="823.09">companies or they can be done in a more</span> <span data-start="823.09" data-end="825.43">open way and that's how I really</span> <span data-start="825.43" data-end="826.9">presented these with it like what the</span> <span data-start="826.9" data-end="829.57">ones were like the graph QL workshop so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="829.57" data-end="833.11">I contacted even Alex who put that</span> <span data-start="833.11" data-end="835.57">workshop on and said hey my company is</span> <span data-start="835.57" data-end="837.4">working with graph QL I would love for</span> <span data-start="837.4" data-end="839.68">you guys to come out and help train my</span> <span data-start="839.68" data-end="843.07">devs on this I have a room I'll pay for</span> <span data-start="843.07" data-end="845.65">lunch all I and allow you to sell</span> <span data-start="845.65" data-end="847.39">tickets outside the company as well and</span> <span data-start="847.39" data-end="849.43">bring the public into this all we ask is</span> <span data-start="849.43" data-end="851.2">for some tickets for our own devs to the</span> <span data-start="851.2" data-end="853.15">workshop and as compensation for that</span> <span data-start="853.15" data-end="855.31">and of course since they're actually</span> <span data-start="855.31" data-end="857.56">from Tahoe or Lake Tahoe in California</span> <span data-start="857.56" data-end="860.8">and not from this area I put out my own</span> <span data-start="860.8" data-end="862.9">network to get them connected with</span> <span data-start="862.9" data-end="866.14">places like Cascadia J s so that they</span> <span data-start="866.14" data-end="867.61">could sell more tickets and they could</span> <span data-start="867.61" data-end="870.64">make money for themselves so I'm really</span> <span data-start="870.64" data-end="872.11">passionate about these ones and it's a</span> <span data-start="872.11" data-end="873.88">very nice thing you can do and bring it</span> <span data-start="873.88" data-end="875.56">in and also be become part of the</span> <span data-start="875.56" data-end="876.84">community as well</span> <span data-start="876.84" data-end="879.79">another thing is learning stiffens so</span> <span data-start="879.79" data-end="881.38">every manager really should have a</span> <span data-start="881.38" data-end="883.89">learning budget for their developers and</span> <span data-start="883.89" data-end="887.11">we're not talking about really just like</span> <span data-start="887.11" data-end="888.88">tossing money at developers so it's like</span> <span data-start="888.88" data-end="890.2">hey hey hey I want to learn this I want</span> <span data-start="890.2" data-end="891.4">to learn that but they can really spend</span> <span data-start="891.4" data-end="894.01">these types of things on such like</span> <span data-start="894.01" data-end="896.56">online tutorials for you my favorite</span> <span data-start="896.56" data-end="897.76">ones being things like front-end masters</span> <span data-start="897.76" data-end="901.72">or egghead IO Kent Dodds new testing</span> <span data-start="901.72" data-end="904.03">course or the wonderful West boss</span> <span data-start="904.03" data-end="907.18">courses that are out there but this is</span> <span data-start="907.18" data-end="909.31">just a way that we can help people grow</span> <span data-start="909.31" data-end="911.47">in their own time as well now another</span> <span data-start="911.47" data-end="914.23">one is reference libraries so books I</span> <span data-start="914.23" data-end="916.51">don't know about you but I love books</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="916.51" data-end="919.33">I love reading them I love going the</span> <span data-start="919.33" data-end="922.45">library picking out new books and having</span> <span data-start="922.45" data-end="924.04">a nice reference library at work is</span> <span data-start="924.04" data-end="925.3">great because you can have all the</span> <span data-start="925.3" data-end="929.14">online resources possible but really it</span> <span data-start="929.14" data-end="931.06">that's physical nature of the book and</span> <span data-start="931.06" data-end="932.32">allowing you to really look</span> <span data-start="932.32" data-end="934.51">it's a different experience and you can</span> <span data-start="934.51" data-end="935.83">really find

mentorship</span> <span data-start="940.66" data-end="942.82">programs so this is something that</span> <span data-start="942.82" data-end="944.5">really is kind of free but it really</span> <span data-start="944.5" data-end="946.9">just takes a lot of work you have to of</span> <span data-start="946.9" data-end="948.91">course find people that want to be</span> <span data-start="948.91" data-end="950.62">mentors find people that want to be</span> <span data-start="950.62" data-end="952.3">mentees figure out how to mesh these</span> <span data-start="952.3" data-end="954.61">people

these other</span> <span data-start="959.62" data-end="963.04">types can mentor mentee relationships</span> <span data-start="963.04" data-end="966.04">can be lifelong relationships and by</span> <span data-start="966.04" data-end="968.08">working on a program like this at your</span> <span data-start="968.08" data-end="971.08">organization you can truly be touching</span> <span

together we can</span> <span data-start="989.2" data-end="991.9">learn so I mean how many people got</span> <span data-start="991.9" data-end="993.84">their conference tickets from their jobs</span> <span data-start="993.84" data-end="996.61">having a yes that's nearly half the</span> <span data-start="996.61" data-end="1000.03">audience here it's a great thing in a</span> <span

data-end="1013.11">on to conferences I mean when you have a</span> <span data-start="1013.11" data-end="1015.12">group of your own organization going you</span> <span data-start="1015.12" data-end="1017.25">can really gather yourself together you</span> <span data-start="1017.25" data-end="1018.6">can learn from each other it becomes not</span> <span data-start="1018.6"
