<p><span data-start="5.06" data-end="6.6">Hi, everyone.</span> <span data-start="6.6" data-end="10.46">I hope you had a great lunch.</span> <span data-start="10.47" data-end="14.059">So, let's get started.</span> <span data-start="14.059" data-end="21.38">This talk is about augment ing empathy, and what I mean by that is basically that you</span> <span data-start="21.38" data-end="27.47">already have empathy, but there can be some things or tools that you use actually to augment</span> <span data-start="27.47" data-end="32.89">that a little bit more, to understand some situation s and to make things clear, and</span> <span data-start="32.89" data-end="39.48">we will be using CSS, SVG, and WebRTC to do this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="39.48" data-end="47.03">My name is she she.</span> <span data-start="47.03" data-end="56.28">Basically, I do a lot of R&D to try to look at new technologies.</span> <span data-start="56.28" data-end="66.84">Previously, I used to work at Opera.</span> <span data-start="66.84" data-end="73.91">It's a company based in Mumbai, and it does a lot of accessibility consulting, auditing,</span> <span data-start="73.91" data-end="74.91">and stuff like that.</span> <span data-start="74.91" data-end="80.73">It is also an enterprise with a social mission, and part of that mission is providing opportunities</span> <span data-start="80.73" data-end="85.84">to people with disabilities, and so much so that about 70 per cent of our staff are people</span> <span data-start="85.84" data-end="88.81">with disabilities.</span> <span data-start="88.81" data-end="98.49">One of the person in the staff is Ahmed who was born with with low vision.</span> <span data-start="98.49" data-end="103.87">Back in 2005, he met with an accident, and he lost sight in his right eye.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="103.87" data-end="106.36">So, but that didn't stop him.</span> <span data-start="106.36" data-end="111.71">He still had an interest in tech, and he ended up become a trainer and goes to a lot of different</span> <span data-start="111.71" data-end="117.85">conferences, trainings and workshops to teach people how to make their site successful.</span> <span data-start="117.85" data-end="122.76">When I got to know him, and we got talking, there were — I quickly realised there were</span> <span data-start="122.76" data-end="129.53">a lot of things which people who have low vision were confused about, particularly with</span> <span data-start="129.53" data-end="130.759">his condition.</span> <span data-start="130.759" data-end="135.98">A lot of times, people couldn't understand the way in which his vision worked or didn't</span> <span data-start="135.98" data-end="137.069">work.</span> <span data-start="137.069" data-end="143.37">We also had people who were low vision, and I talked with them as well.</span> <span data-start="143.37" data-end="150.59">I talked to their colleagues, friends and families, and caretakers as well.</span> <span data-start="150.59" data-end="157.53">One trend kept coming again and again which, a lot of times, it was difficult for for people</span> <span data-start="157.53" data-end="165.599">with low vision really to articulate what their condition was, how they basically saw</span> <span data-start="165.599" data-end="172.48">the work, and sometimes, people who didn't have low vision couldn't understand what was</span> <span data-start="172.48" data-end="173.48">happening.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="173.48" data-end="175.01">So I did a little bit more research.</span> <span data-start="175.01" data-end="179.52">I actually consulted an ophthalmologist as well to get the medical perspective from someone</span> <span data-start="179.52" data-end="183.76">who has dealt with hundreds of thousands of cases.</span> <span data-start="183.76" data-end="190.48">One thing was very, very clear: low vision is a very generic term.</span> <span data-start="190.48" data-end="196.88">If you say, "Someone has low vision," with a lot of times people assume it is a form</span> <span data-start="196.88" data-end="198.32">of myopia.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="198.32" data-end="199.81">That can be the case.</span> <span data-start="199.81" data-end="203.22">That's not always the case.</span> <span data-start="203.22" data-end="207.2">Sometimes, you have glaucoma, macular degeneration — all these things are there.</span> <span data-start="207.2" data-end="211.1">If you ask the random person on the street what is macular degeneration, they might not</span> <span data-start="211.1" data-end="214.349">know.</span> <span data-start="214.349" data-end="220.78">One thing became clear, that one of the things I could do is not help people with low vision</span> <span data-start="220.78" data-end="225.11">but actually help everyone else understand what low vision is.</span> <span data-start="225.11" data-end="227.11">That's where the simulators come in.</span> <span data-start="227.11" data-end="231.87">I said, can we make something to simulate what the vision is like?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="231.87" data-end="238.569">And, if it is possible, can we use the web to do this, and also gravy on top, if we can</span> <span data-start="238.569" data-end="245.59">use JavaScript less and SVG have CSS more, that would be more awesome.</span> <span data-start="245.59" data-end="253.74">The first condition I chose was colour blindness, and this is even more poignant here in Europe</span> <span data-start="253.74" data-end="260.139">because eight per cent of men and 0.5 of women of northern European ancestry have some form</span> <span data-start="260.139" data-end="267.169">of red-green colour blindness, and the more you talk to people who have red-green colour</span> <span data-start="267.169" data-end="272.129">blindness, the more you will see in the physical world, not just in the online world but the</span> <span data-start="272.129" data-end="277.12">physical world, there's still a lot of stuff in which you need to determine whether something</span> <span data-start="277.12" data-end="279.749">is red or green, right?</span> <span data-start="279.749" data-end="284.599">The most obvious example is traffic lights, but that's not just the case.</span> <span data-start="284.599" data-end="291.819">If you have the MacBook charger, if you charge it, and you want to look from afar whether</span> <span data-start="291.819" data-end="297.629">it is still charging, the only way to distinguish it is whether it is red or green in colour.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="297.629" data-end="299.659">That's it.</span> <span data-start="299.659" data-end="305.65">So I made a tool which you can actually simulate the different conditions.</span> <span data-start="305.65" data-end="312.59">This is using WebRTC and applying SVG on top.</span> <span data-start="312.59" data-end="318.129">The reason why it is actually pretty useful is because a lot of times, people get it wrong.</span> <span data-start="318.129" data-end="327.93">I asked a lot of people with normal 2020 vision, what would it be like to live with colour</span> <span data-start="327.93" data-end="332.539">blindness and see something red in colour, what would they see?</span> <span data-start="332.539" data-end="338.68">A lot of times, people become confused and don't know and assume it will be a desaturated</span> <span data-start="338.68" data-end="340.3">version of that image.</span> <span data-start="340.3" data-end="341.3">That's not the case.</span> <span data-start="341.3" data-end="348.999">Over here, we can see that, in one condition, you will have this bench as brown in colour.</span> <span data-start="348.999" data-end="351.46">On the other hand, you will have something light greenish in colour.</span> <span data-start="351.46" data-end="356.349">The real colour is actually red.</span> <span data-start="356.349" data-end="357.599">How do we actually do this?</span> <span data-start="357.599" data-end="368.219">I use something called SVG colour matrix, which is a set of matrix values that you provide.</span> <span data-start="368.219" data-end="370.44">It basically works like this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="370.44" data-end="372.05">You have an image.</span> <span data-start="372.05" data-end="375.58">Each and every image will have an RGBA value.</span> <span data-start="375.58" data-end="380.839">You have a matrix with a set of values over here, and all you do is matrix-multiply the</span> <span data-start="380.839" data-end="386.159">values together to form a new colour for that particular pixel.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="386.159" data-end="391.469">You can define an SVG colour filter over here.</span> <span data-start="391.469" data-end="402.21">Then the colour matrix, and values, you can write out all the values come are a-separated.</span> <span data-start="402.21" data-end="410.8">In the CSS, it is as simple as saying filter URL, hashtag, whatever.</span> <span data-start="410.8" data-end="413.949">That's all very, very nice to know, right?</span> <span data-start="413.949" data-end="420.76">But it's one thing to have an academic or mathematical perspective of how SVG colour</span> <span data-start="420.76" data-end="425.27">matrix works, and the other is to have an intuitive understanding.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="425.27" data-end="431.02">The only thing that I've seen which grants you that is experimentation, unfortunately.</span> <span data-start="431.02" data-end="436.24">You can't get it how it works, just by learning a few things.</span> <span data-start="436.24" data-end="437.479">You need to experiment.</span> <span data-start="437.479" data-end="446.379">Fortunately, if you Google, the SVG playground, where you can mix and match different values</span> <span data-start="446.379" data-end="451.53">and see what the output would be, and that gives a better perspective and a more intuitive</span> <span data-start="451.53" data-end="452.53">understanding.</span> <span data-start="452.53" data-end="458.889">I will be sharing the slides later on as well with links to some really, really nice articles</span> <span data-start="458.889" data-end="466.949">opinion let's take this opportunity to know about the matrix and put it in our pocket.</span> <span data-start="466.949" data-end="470.379">We will revisit this later on.</span> <span data-start="470.379" data-end="476.991">Now that we have a tool which can address different colour blindness conditions, one</span> <span data-start="476.991" data-end="482.389">of the things that I also — when talking with people with red-green colour blindness — I</span> <span data-start="482.389" data-end="488.96">say how do you distinguish between red and green and nothing else?</span> <span data-start="488.96" data-end="491.219">It's a bit difficult to do so.</span> <span data-start="491.219" data-end="495.93">I made something which, for lack of a better name, I called the red-green sheet.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="495.93" data-end="502.229">On the left, you have one example of the test which is generally a set of tests which is</span> <span data-start="502.229" data-end="504.68">used for people to diagnose colour blindness.</span> <span data-start="504.68" data-end="509.159">If you don't have colour blindness, you will see 74.</span> <span data-start="509.159" data-end="512.45">If you do have it, you will see something like 21.</span> <span data-start="512.45" data-end="523.33">Over here, let me just go back, you can see I've made something where you're basically</span> <span data-start="523.33" data-end="526.01">isolating things into two categories.</span> <span data-start="526.01" data-end="529.28">If something is red, it goes into the left category.</span> <span data-start="529.28" data-end="533.8">If something is green, it goes into the other category.</span> <span data-start="533.8" data-end="540.72">This is all done in real time, and it's done using CSS and SVG.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="540.72" data-end="544.43">The only JavaScript part is getting the camera output.</span> <span data-start="544.43" data-end="545.84">So this is how we do it.</span> <span data-start="545.84" data-end="551.59">The first thing that we do is apply an SVG filter, and the second thing we do is apply</span> <span data-start="551.59" data-end="553.73">a mixed blend mode of hue.</span> <span data-start="553.73" data-end="557.8">Simple, but it hides a lot of complexity behind it.</span> <span data-start="557.8" data-end="564.61">Let's revisit this, see and go into a deeper dive into what this means, and how this effect</span> <span data-start="564.61" data-end="567.21">is actually done.</span> <span data-start="567.21" data-end="570.07">To do that, let's go really, really back.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="570.07" data-end="578.81">How many people watched Looney Toons when they were a child?</span> <span data-start="578.81" data-end="580.68">Everyone.</span> <span data-start="580.68" data-end="586.43">All these cartoons use something called cell animation — "cell" standing for celluloid</span> <span data-start="586.43" data-end="595.43">- and the reason why is these were transferring sheets, and, generally speaking, in any kind</span> <span data-start="595.43" data-end="601.76">of animation, you had a bunch of characters moving around, but you also had some background</span> <span data-start="601.76" data-end="603.61">which was static.</span> <span data-start="603.61" data-end="608.92">What you could do is basically have a sheet where you just paint the background once and</span> <span data-start="608.92" data-end="613.5">be done with it, and all the other stuff you can do with the character animations and put</span> <span data-start="613.5" data-end="615.14">one layer on top.</span> <span data-start="615.14" data-end="619.86">A lot of these animations were done like this where the character animations were done by</span> <span data-start="619.86" data-end="627.15">one team, and the background animation or painting was done by some other team in parallel,</span> <span data-start="627.15" data-end="632.02">and then the final result was putting those layers on top of each other.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="632.02" data-end="637.06">This was basically an early form of what we call compositing.</span> <span data-start="637.06" data-end="643.74">Compositing and blending, the spec is based off this, but come positing and blending has</span> <span data-start="643.74" data-end="647.86">been around for a long time, even as part of SVG.</span> <span data-start="647.86" data-end="649.75">So what exactly is composting.</span> <span data-start="649.75" data-end="662.72">It is it's how to deal with — ..  what exactly is — it is named after Thomas</span> <span data-start="662.72" data-end="671.07">Duff who in 1984, they published a seminal paper on how to deal with overlapping objects</span> <span data-start="671.07" data-end="673.66">- this exact thing called compositing.</span> <span data-start="673.66" data-end="679.94">At that time, they were in the early 1980s working together on a small company called</span> <span data-start="679.94" data-end="686.39">Lucas Film which was doing a lot of pioneering work when it came to digital graphics.</span> <span data-start="686.39" data-end="693.04">They basically said in that paper that, if you have two layers, one on top of the other,</span> <span data-start="693.04" data-end="697.42">so the top layer is called a source layer, the bottom layer is called a destination,</span> <span data-start="697.42" data-end="698.42">right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="698.42" data-end="702.74">So, in that overlapped portion, you can do pretty much four things: first, none.</span> <span data-start="702.74" data-end="704.87">You don't show anything over there.</span> <span data-start="704.87" data-end="707.6">Second is the source in which you show the top layer.</span> <span data-start="707.6" data-end="712.32">Third is the destination in which you show the bottom layer, and the fourth, and more</span> <span data-start="712.32" data-end="718.41">interest interesting one, is show a combination of both the top and bottom layer, right?</span> <span data-start="718.41" data-end="722.69">And this is where opacity and alpha channels come in.</span> <span data-start="722.69" data-end="726.95">Coming back to our example, what we need to do in the first half to recreate the effect</span> <span data-start="726.95" data-end="733.37">that we saw in the colour sheet is to somehow make it black and white but own the red colour</span> <span data-start="733.37" data-end="734.37">showing.</span> <span data-start="734.37" data-end="740.82">So, in this case, what we do is, if you can see the red-green and blue channels are all</span> <span data-start="740.82" data-end="742.5">zero, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="742.5" data-end="750.11">In effect, what this matrix is doing is basically taking this image and making everything transparent</span> <span data-start="750.11" data-end="754.37">except for the colours which have a little bit of an R value.</span> <span data-start="754.37" data-end="764.07">Then we come posit it on the original image to get some of the red stuff.</span> <span data-start="764.07" data-end="772.36">Value equals zero so it is totally desaturated.</span> <span data-start="772.36" data-end="780.44">Then we composite them on top to get the black and white image with just the red showing.</span> <span data-start="780.44" data-end="784.36">All of this using SVG, nothing else.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="784.36" data-end="789.21">Now, the first part is complete.</span> <span data-start="789.21" data-end="793.88">The second thing we want to do is to understand blending and how that works.</span> <span data-start="793.88" data-end="797.89">So blending is basically how to deal with the overlapped portion in terms of colours,</span> <span data-start="797.89" data-end="799.25">and the mixing of the colours.</span> <span data-start="799.25" data-end="804.82">So, for example, we have this particular layer.</span> <span data-start="804.82" data-end="807.29">And then you have a layer on top of it over here.</span> <span data-start="807.29" data-end="811.54">So, there's a portion which is overlapping, right?</span> <span data-start="811.54" data-end="813.93">How do we deal with the colours over here?</span> <span data-start="813.93" data-end="817.75">That is the essence of blending.</span> <span data-start="817.75" data-end="823.35">In a more practical example, let's see this image.</span> <span data-start="823.35" data-end="830.87">We can have a few layers, we can mix and match them through whatever we want to achieve this</span> <span data-start="830.87" data-end="832.47">particular final layer.</span> <span data-start="832.47" data-end="836.29">This is essentially what blending is, mixing and matching different layers, to achieve</span> <span data-start="836.29" data-end="838.63">a final effect.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="838.63" data-end="839.91">Let's come back to an example.</span> <span data-start="839.91" data-end="844.78">Over and over here, we have a container div which is red in colour.</span> <span data-start="844.78" data-end="848.62">Inside this, we have the video, which is running.</span> <span data-start="848.62" data-end="852.85">Right now, we haven't applied any effects, so it's just the normal colours.</span> <span data-start="852.85" data-end="858.65">The moment we apply the SVG filter we talked about, everything is grey scale apart from</span> <span data-start="858.65" data-end="860.66">the red stuff.</span> <span data-start="860.66" data-end="863.84">Then we will apply a blank board.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="863.84" data-end="867.65">We're applying a hue.</span> <span data-start="867.65" data-end="869.36">This works in the cell space.</span> <span data-start="869.36" data-end="874.86">It will take the hue from the top layer and combine it with the saturation and luminosity</span> <span data-start="874.86" data-end="879.75">of the bottom layer, so, in this case, all the black and white stuff will be basically</span> <span data-start="879.75" data-end="888.24">a grey area, whereas the rest will be bright red, so ultimately you get this.</span> <span data-start="888.24" data-end="892.16">So it's just two lines, but it hides a lot of complexity, and it's very, very important</span> <span data-start="892.16" data-end="900.42">to know the concept of layers and how it plays into blending and compositing, and with JavaScript,</span> <span data-start="900.42" data-end="904.44">if you have a proper understanding of it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="904.44" data-end="909.23">One more thing that I worked on was macular degeneration.</span> <span data-start="909.23" data-end="920.19">Sometimes, it's called age-related macular degeneration.</span> <span data-start="920.19" data-end="923.72">If you have a visual, you can see what it actually means.</span> <span data-start="923.72" data-end="929.51">It's sometimes also pretty tragic or heart-breaking, because a lot of time, it affects people who</span> <span data-start="929.51" data-end="935.19">are older, and, by the time they have grandchildren, and sometimes, they have a hard time seeing</span> <span data-start="935.19" data-end="941.25">the faces of their grandchildren, and that's — and that's something which if someone else</span> <span data-start="941.25" data-end="946.59">comes in, that's something else which people don't get, the human aspect of how it makes</span> <span data-start="946.59" data-end="948.06">people feel.</span> <span data-start="948.06" data-end="957.43">So anyways, like I was saying, if I have to recreate this effect using SVG, or just CSS,</span> <span data-start="957.43" data-end="958.59">how do I do this?</span> <span data-start="958.59" data-end="961.351">Fortunately, in this case, I don't want to use SVG.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="961.351" data-end="967.95">I can use a radial gradient with a blend mode.</span> <span data-start="967.95" data-end="976.29">If you have a container detective which is a radial gradient which is black to transparent,</span> <span data-start="976.29" data-end="981.58">and you combine it with the video output, then you ply a mixed — apply a mixed blend</span> <span data-start="981.58" data-end="985.05">and multiply, and you get this kind of effect.</span> <span data-start="985.05" data-end="991.3">In most cases in web designs, you won't really use this, but if you take the opposite of</span> <span data-start="991.3" data-end="998.4">it in which you have transparent to black radial element and combine it with an image,</span> <span data-start="998.4" data-end="1003.73">then apply the multiplier, then you can get nice effects on images without using Photoshop,</span> <span data-start="1003.73" data-end="1007.39">which is really, really great.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1007.39" data-end="1013.96">One thing that I wanted is for you to put it on top of your headsets.</span> <span data-start="1013.96" data-end="1020.42">Nowadays, our headsets are getting cheap, and some of these allow these to use the background</span> <span data-start="1020.42" data-end="1022">to see on the other side.</span> <span data-start="1022" data-end="1024.819">Not all of them, but some allow you to do that.</span> <span data-start="1024.819" data-end="1028.11">If you do, then you can actually do this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1028.11" data-end="1035.409">You can have stereoscopic mode where you have two video elements and you can go full screen</span> <span data-start="1035.409" data-end="1041.12">and use it as part of a VR to get a more immersive experience.</span> <span data-start="1041.12" data-end="1045.24">If you want to do this, right, there are a few things that you want to do.</span> <span data-start="1045.24" data-end="1053.249">First, you want to make sure that it displays just one video on portrait mode and two videos</span> <span data-start="1053.249" data-end="1054.249">on landscape mode.</span> <span data-start="1054.249" data-end="1060.789">You have to detect whether something is in portrait mode and hide the video.</span> <span data-start="1060.789" data-end="1063.86">So it — there is a lot of stuff going on over here.</span> <span data-start="1063.86" data-end="1068.35">I also want to make sure that everything is full screen so that you don't see the browser</span> <span data-start="1068.35" data-end="1073.72">and address bar, and once you're in that full-screen mode, you don't want to switch between portrait</span> <span data-start="1073.72" data-end="1077.35">and landscape every time you're moving your head, so you want to lock the orientation</span> <span data-start="1077.35" data-end="1078.7">as well.</span> <span data-start="1078.7" data-end="1079.7">This is how we do it.</span> <span data-start="1079.7" data-end="1085.34">You can have a full-screen API, the moment something goes in full screen, we can use</span> <span data-start="1085.34" data-end="1090.14">the orientation lock API so that it doesn't switch between portrait and landscape all</span> <span data-start="1090.14" data-end="1091.95">the time.</span> <span data-start="1091.95" data-end="1097.89">One more thing that I do is I use a CSS exclusively for full screen as well, so, in this case,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1097.89" data-end="1104.769">I can use along with prefixes, the full screen pseudo element.</span> <span data-start="1104.769" data-end="1108.309">This will just be applied on full screen.</span> <span data-start="1108.309" data-end="1112.659">One more thing that I do is of course have custom CSS for the orientation.</span> <span data-start="1112.659" data-end="1117.549">If something is in portrait mode, it needs a certain set of standards apply than in landscape</span> <span data-start="1117.549" data-end="1118.549">mode.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1118.549" data-end="1124.299">Here you have the media library for orientation mode as well.</span> <span data-start="1124.299" data-end="1132.59">One thing people are not talking about but shed is the fact that in PWAs, of you a lot</span> <span data-start="1132.59" data-end="1135.49">of display modes.</span> <span data-start="1135.49" data-end="1141.389">So you can load a PWA as a normal browser tab, but once you install that PWA you can</span> <span data-start="1141.389" data-end="1144.27">open it up as a standalone app.</span> <span data-start="1144.27" data-end="1151.789">In that case, you don't have the browser address bar which means you have increased screen</span> <span data-start="1151.789" data-end="1156.69">real estate that you need to account for and do something with.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1156.69" data-end="1163.72">Hero, use the display mode standalone and see what the display mode is, and, depending</span> <span data-start="1163.72" data-end="1167.35">upon that, you can have custom CSS.</span> <span data-start="1167.35" data-end="1174.58">One of the things that I've used, and one last thing, that I leave you with is that</span> <span data-start="1174.58" data-end="1175.72">none of this actually matters.</span> <span data-start="1175.72" data-end="1180.929">It doesn't matter if you don't actually talk with people and interact with people with</span> <span data-start="1180.929" data-end="1182.32">real disabilities.</span> <span data-start="1182.32" data-end="1183.87">That's really, really important.</span> <span data-start="1183.87" data-end="1190.35">I like this tweet, which was, retweet if you're tabled and an inspiration.</span> <span data-start="1190.35" data-end="1196.119">If the person then stick around to get to know you as a person.</span> <span data-start="1196.119" data-end="1201.059">It got 630 retweets by the time I screen shotted this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1201.059" data-end="1203.09">That's a big thing.</span> <span data-start="1203.09" data-end="1208.289">When you're talking about empathy, you really need to kind of generate empathy somehow,</span> <span data-start="1208.289" data-end="1213.059">and the only way you can do it is actually to be someone's friend, or be listening to</span> <span data-start="1213.059" data-end="1218.031">a person, not academically reading things here and there, right?</span> <span data-start="1218.031" data-end="1220.539">That's one of the things about disability simulators.</span> <span data-start="1220.539" data-end="1225.029">A lot of people think that, just because I have interacted with a simulator, suddenly</span> <span data-start="1225.029" data-end="1228.75">I know everything about people with that particular disability.</span> <span data-start="1228.75" data-end="1229.85">That's not true.</span> <span data-start="1229.85" data-end="1233.179">Human interaction is always always required.</span> <span data-start="1233.179" data-end="1237.96">A lot of times, people were able-bodied, they put on a simulator, they struggle, and they</span> <span data-start="1237.96" data-end="1243.789">put it back down, and then they think everyone with that disability is just struggling 24/7.</span> <span data-start="1243.789" data-end="1245.919">That's also wrong.</span> <span data-start="1245.919" data-end="1251.559">This is a tweet who says not every person with a disability feels they are.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1251.559" data-end="1263.639">The insinuation that disability is equal to suffering .. so, when it comes to empathy,</span> <span data-start="1263.639" data-end="1269.74">one layer is yes, you need to think about what other people are finding challenging,</span> <span data-start="1269.74" data-end="1274.11">what problems people are facing, but the other side is actually to get to know what they</span> <span data-start="1274.11" data-end="1280.179">want to do, what their potential is, what they aim for, what are their goals in life,</span> <span data-start="1280.179" data-end="1282.889">and then what are you going to do about it, right?</span> <span data-start="1282.889" data-end="1289.98">These tools that I try to make, I always forms the idea that, okay, now, actually do a task</span> <span data-start="1289.98" data-end="1295.35">five times, because, by the fifth time, they're not struggling so much.</span> <span data-start="1295.35" data-end="1300.159">Then they realise that, okay, people who have these conditions have developed coping mechanisms,</span> <span data-start="1300.159" data-end="1306.029">and actually, kind of gotten used to it, and now they're taking dysfunction just like everyone</span> <span data-start="1306.029" data-end="1307.659">else.</span> <span data-start="1307.659" data-end="1315.19">So, being empathic it's recognising a few things.</span> <span data-start="1315.19" data-end="1316.869">It's multilayered.</span> <span data-start="1316.869" data-end="1321.549">You need to recognise the challenges that people face, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1321.549" data-end="1324.48">And it could be something as simple as just believing someone when they say they have</span> <span data-start="1324.48" data-end="1326.519">a problem, right?</span> <span data-start="1326.519" data-end="1331.61">It doesn't even apply to people with disabilities but every kind of marginalised group.</span> <span data-start="1331.61" data-end="1334.46">Listen and believe them when they say they have a problem.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1334.46" data-end="1337.919">The second thing is recognising the strength and potential that people have, right?</span> <span data-start="1337.919" data-end="1342.139">So, if a person really wants to do something, have faith in them.</span> <span data-start="1342.139" data-end="1350.71">I can give you a story of a person who went — who was diagnosed with low vision.</span> <span data-start="1350.71" data-end="1357.19">A lot of well-meaning well-wishers said take up pottery or handicrafts or something like</span> <span data-start="1357.19" data-end="1358.19">that.</span> <span data-start="1358.19" data-end="1361.139">It was coming from a good place but it wasn't the right advice.</span> <span data-start="1361.139" data-end="1366.899">That person wanted to go in tech and do stuff with computers.</span> <span data-start="1366.899" data-end="1372.1">Fortunately, she joined our company and is now one of the top people over there.</span> <span data-start="1372.1" data-end="1378.659">The main thing to recognise is that what other people are supposed to be doing, what people</span> <span data-start="1378.659" data-end="1382.83">are capable of doing under supporting that.</span> <span data-start="1382.83" data-end="1389.84">And ultimately, the way in which you display your empathy has to be a combination of all</span> <span data-start="1389.84" data-end="1393.84">these things, just like blend modes, like you have different layers, and you kind of</span> <span data-start="1393.84" data-end="1398.86">like mix and match between different colours, the same thing has to be happening with your</span> <span data-start="1398.86" data-end="1400.47">approach to empathy as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1400.47" data-end="1407.58">So, recognise the challenges they face; recognise they are capable, they have potential; and</span> <span data-start="1407.58" data-end="1412.269">then ultimately your action as well, because empathy without action is useless.</span> <span data-start="1412.269" data-end="1414.039">That's the thought that I will leave you with.</span> <span data-start="1414.039" data-end="1415.039">Thank you so much!</span> </p>
