<p><span data-start="482.81" data-end="485.06">You play with a zapper against a cowboy.</span> <span data-start="485.06" data-end="493.6">And this game, despite being a real 8bit NES game has full screen animations and a beautiful</span> <span data-start="493.6" data-end="497.81">country western sound track and pushes the limits of what's possible.</span> <span data-start="497.81" data-end="498.81">I was amazed.</span> <span data-start="498.81" data-end="507.58">So I talked to him, never talked to him before, and we hit it off about the NES.</span> <span data-start="507.58" data-end="518.88">I wrote a WebGL shader in JavaScript and GSL that emulates like the dying sprite system.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="518.88" data-end="523.229">If you remember playing NES you would have to blow on the card and the graphics get scrambled.</span> <span data-start="523.229" data-end="524.81">This is emulating that.</span> <span data-start="524.81" data-end="526.279">We hit it off.</span> <span data-start="526.279" data-end="532.55">And I told him about the massively multiplayer name stuff I was doing.</span> <span data-start="532.55" data-end="533.55">I did Apestronauts.</span> <span data-start="533.55" data-end="541.37">And Starwhal, a  narwhal joust.</span> <span data-start="541.37" data-end="545.74">You use the tusk to joust.</span> <span data-start="545.74" data-end="554.24">He was like, wait a minute, take your massively multiplayer stuff and my NES stuff and mash</span> <span data-start="554.24" data-end="555.24">them together.</span> <span data-start="555.24" data-end="558.32">This is the first day I met him at the festival.</span> <span data-start="558.32" data-end="561.9">And I said, absolutely let's do that.</span> <span data-start="561.9" data-end="566.64">So I went back to my flat at the conference and started coding this thing.</span> <span data-start="566.64" data-end="571.83">And the next morning I came to Andy's booth, where he's starting this game.</span> <span data-start="571.83" data-end="574.32">And this is the original version of the UI.</span> <span data-start="574.32" data-end="578.07">And I said, hey, you know, let's� I coded it last night.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="578.07" data-end="579.9">Let's try it.</span> <span data-start="579.9" data-end="584.279">And, you know, this is like� so this is Andy, you guys.</span> <span data-start="584.279" data-end="586.57">This is another photo of him.</span> <span data-start="586.57" data-end="592.231">And despite, like, both of us playing video games and partying the entire festival, we</span> <span data-start="592.231" data-end="594.67">managed to put this thing together.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="594.67" data-end="600.86">And this is like, now, like less than 48 hours from the idea we see this happen in contra.</span> <span data-start="600.86" data-end="601.86">If you remember contra.</span> <span data-start="601.86" data-end="603.73">That's the level one boss.</span> <span data-start="603.73" data-end="610.12">And we jumped up and over the end boss in contra into uncharted territory in the game.</span> <span data-start="610.12" data-end="612.76">This was the moment where I was like, this is a thing.</span> <span data-start="612.76" data-end="615.44">This is special.</span> <span data-start="615.44" data-end="620.61">And so this is, then, that same day, Andy had a talk.</span> <span data-start="620.61" data-end="624.839">Invited me on to the talk to show the thing we just collaborated on.</span> <span data-start="624.839" data-end="625.91">He's like, coding.</span> <span data-start="625.91" data-end="630.97">Like before he speaks like on stage like last minute stuff and I'm right next to him on</span> <span data-start="630.97" data-end="632.34">the far left there.</span> <span data-start="632.34" data-end="634.63">There's me in a Duck Hunt Tshirt.</span> <span data-start="634.63" data-end="637.3">So� yeah.</span> <span data-start="637.3" data-end="638.42">That was how it came to be.</span> <span data-start="638.42" data-end="639.42">Which is really cool.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="639.42" data-end="640.64">It's like the magic of festivals like in.</span> <span data-start="640.64" data-end="644.49">You meet someone and you want to collaborate.</span> <span data-start="644.49" data-end="648.39">So a little bit about the NES, and this is the part that Andy would tell you about.</span> <span data-start="648.39" data-end="649.53">He's the hardware guy.</span> <span data-start="649.53" data-end="653.55">I'll do my best without him.</span> <span data-start="653.55" data-end="659.65">The crazy thing� one very crazy thing about the NES is the entire RAM of the NES was 2</span> <span data-start="659.65" data-end="660.65">kilobytes.</span> <span data-start="660.65" data-end="664.43">Like 2048 bytes, that's like 15 Tweets.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="664.43" data-end="668.62">Entire� all of program RAM.</span> <span data-start="668.62" data-end="676.87">So what Andy did� when we do this off the physical hardware, what Andy did was he used</span> <span data-start="676.87" data-end="678.47">what's called dual port RAM.</span> <span data-start="678.47" data-end="682.589">Which is RAM that two different CPUs can read and write at the same time.</span> <span data-start="682.589" data-end="688.12">So he actually desoldered the RAM off of the NES mother board and put on his own custom</span> <span data-start="688.12" data-end="693.589">daughter board to talk to the dual port RAM over serial.</span> <span data-start="693.589" data-end="698.94">He modded the boss to have a serial plug that looks like a headphone jack and goes into</span> <span data-start="698.94" data-end="700.15">the back of the NES me.</span> <span data-start="700.15" data-end="705.65">Otherwise you can't tell it's an NES.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="705.65" data-end="707.01">This is the game genie.</span> <span data-start="707.01" data-end="711.25">It's important to distinguish this.</span> <span data-start="711.25" data-end="715.17">So the game genie modified ROM.</span> <span data-start="715.17" data-end="720.85">It sat between the cart and the NES and changed the values that are being read off the readonly</span> <span data-start="720.85" data-end="722.64">memory on the plastic card.</span> <span data-start="722.64" data-end="728.19">But our modification is directly into the RAM, the working memory of the Nintendo, which</span> <span data-start="728.19" data-end="730.9">lets you do things you could never do with a game genie.</span> <span data-start="730.9" data-end="735.64">Here are some examples what have you can do with this.</span> </p>
