<p><span data-start="38.67" data-end="41.01">Norway called cyber and if you want to</span> <span data-start="41.01" data-end="41.88">get touch with me</span> <span data-start="41.88" data-end="43.08">you should probably contact me through</span> <span data-start="43.08" data-end="47.67">Twitter so two-way bindings raise your</span> <span data-start="47.67" data-end="49.11">hand if you work with two bindings</span> <span data-start="49.11" data-end="51.33">before yeah that's quite a lot of you</span> <span data-start="51.33" data-end="53.19">which is impressive when you consider</span> <span data-start="53.19" data-end="55.32">that two-year bindings the word didn't</span> <span data-start="55.32" data-end="58.14">exist six years ago this is the Google</span> <span data-start="58.14" data-end="60.6">search trends for two-way bindings and</span> <span data-start="60.6" data-end="64.5">so in 2007 Microsoft is who developed</span> <span data-start="64.5" data-end="66.9">this stuff and they developed it for</span> <span data-start="66.9" data-end="69.39">civil light and it's so it's only in the</span> <span data-start="69.39" data-end="71.82">last two years or so that we have access</span> <span data-start="71.82" data-end="74.25">to it in in front end with JavaScript</span> <span data-start="74.25" data-end="78.509">and in the Java world to it binding is</span> <span data-start="78.509" data-end="80.46">used to connect HTML and JavaScript</span> <span data-start="80.46" data-end="83.67">together so this means that when the</span> <span data-start="83.67" data-end="85.2">user interacts with the Dom and</span> <span data-start="85.2" data-end="87.36">something changes there the change is</span> <span data-start="87.36" data-end="88.8">automatically reflected into the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="88.8" data-end="90.78">JavaScript model and if you do something</span> <span data-start="90.78" data-end="92.49">to the rascal model the change is</span> <span data-start="92.49" data-end="94.41">automatically reflected back into the</span> <span data-start="94.41" data-end="98.22">Dom so the way this is usually coded is</span> <span data-start="98.22" data-end="100.74">with a declarative binding like this one</span> <span data-start="100.74" data-end="102.959">here we say that we want to bind this</span> <span data-start="102.959" data-end="105.209">input element to the message over here</span> <span data-start="105.209" data-end="107.97">and so when the user starts typing</span> <span data-start="107.97" data-end="112.83">something here you notice that the the</span> <span data-start="112.83" data-end="115.56">text figure the Dom automatically</span> <span data-start="115.56" data-end="117">updates with the correct text but so</span> <span data-start="117" data-end="121.83">does the JavaScript and if you save what</span> <span data-start="121.83" data-end="123.119">the registry the object should be like</span> <span data-start="123.119" data-end="127.419">then the Dom automatically changes back</span> <span data-start="127.429" data-end="130.83">now quickly before we move on this this</span> <span data-start="130.83" data-end="132.18">is all I'm going to say like the</span> <span data-start="132.18" data-end="133.59">introduction stuff this is not a</span> <span data-start="133.59" data-end="135.39">tutorial or introduction to tier</span> <span data-start="135.39" data-end="136.74">bindings or to any of the two-way</span> <span data-start="136.74" data-end="138.06">binding libraries that we're going to</span> <span data-start="138.06" data-end="140.28">look at there's plenty of tutorials and</span> <span data-start="140.28" data-end="141.72">good documentation for all three of them</span> <span data-start="141.72" data-end="143.67">online so if you're interested in any of</span> <span data-start="143.67" data-end="144.99">them you should go online have a look at</span> <span data-start="144.99" data-end="145.88">it</span> <span data-start="145.88" data-end="148.17">that also means I'm going to skip some</span> <span data-start="148.17" data-end="149.97">details so if you are familiar with them</span> <span data-start="149.97" data-end="151.5">you might notice that I skipped over</span> <span data-start="151.5" data-end="153.599">some slightly important details that's</span> <span data-start="153.599" data-end="155.129">because I'm interested in how they're</span> <span data-start="155.129" data-end="158.52">working not how to use them and</span> <span data-start="158.52" data-end="160.14">the ones we're going to look at today</span> <span data-start="160.14" data-end="167.02">are angularjs and bjs and knock out</span> <span data-start="167.03" data-end="169.2">excellent okay then we'll start with</span> <span data-start="169.2" data-end="171.84">knockouts and I think we're gonna start</span> <span data-start="171.84" data-end="173.76">with a syntax so this is the syntax for</span> <span data-start="173.76" data-end="175.65">a knockout it's pretty similar to what</span> <span data-start="175.65" data-end="177.45">we saw earlier we say that we want to</span> <span data-start="177.45" data-end="180.6">data bind the text of this van to the</span> <span data-start="180.6" data-end="182.22">message and so here you can see the</span> <span data-start="182.22" data-end="184.38">result of that we could do a similar</span> <span data-start="184.38" data-end="187.29">thing with an input field so we say able</span> <span data-start="187.29" data-end="188.7">to bind the value of this input to the</span> <span data-start="188.7" data-end="190.74">same message and so when you change the</span> <span data-start="190.74" data-end="192.03">value of the input field the span</span> <span data-start="192.03" data-end="196.02">automatically changes and now for this</span> <span data-start="196.02" data-end="197.96">to work we also need some JavaScript and</span> <span data-start="197.96" data-end="200.58">so this is how you do it in knockout you</span> <span data-start="200.58" data-end="203.73">create an observable variable and this</span> <span data-start="203.73" data-end="205.5">actually returns the function you can</span> <span data-start="205.5" data-end="208.86">call this function with one argument or</span> <span data-start="208.86" data-end="210.3">zero argument if you call it with one</span> <span data-start="210.3" data-end="212.31">argument then you're going to set the</span> <span data-start="212.31" data-end="215.79">value and you notice that the preview up</span> <span data-start="215.79" data-end="216.96">in the right corner automatically</span> <span data-start="216.96" data-end="221.88">changed instantly and you can call it</span> <span data-start="221.88" data-end="223.95">with no arguments just to get the</span> <span data-start="223.95" data-end="227.4">current value so now we have with</span> <span data-start="227.4" data-end="228.93">knockout you have the ability to read</span> <span data-start="228.93" data-end="231.54">and write the message from the HTML have</span> <span data-start="231.54" data-end="232.92">every possibility to read them write it</span> <span data-start="232.92" data-end="236.1">from JavaScript we give a similar thing</span> <span data-start="236.1" data-end="239.459">with amber amber doesn't use HTML you</span> <span data-start="239.459" data-end="241.23">just handlebars instead which means that</span> <span data-start="241.23" data-end="242.82">it simplifies things quite a bit</span> <span data-start="242.82" data-end="244.59">when you just want to output message all</span> <span data-start="244.59" data-end="246.42">you have to do is wrap it in two curly</span> <span data-start="246.42" data-end="250.89">braces now to input an element you need</span> <span data-start="250.89" data-end="252.45">to use the Ember text field and then you</span> <span data-start="252.45" data-end="254.15">have to specify the value binding</span> <span data-start="254.15" data-end="257.01">slightly more text but you get the same</span> <span data-start="257.01" data-end="262.02">result if I can spell correctly em down</span> <span data-start="262.02" data-end="263.58">the JavaScript side things are slightly</span> <span data-start="263.58" data-end="266.31">different we need to create an ember</span> <span data-start="266.31" data-end="268.47">object and then anything inside the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="268.47" data-end="270.36">Enbridge object can't be bound to the</span> <span data-start="270.36" data-end="274.26">HTML and so if you want to set the</span> <span data-start="274.26" data-end="276.87">message from JavaScript we use the set</span> <span data-start="276.87" data-end="279.63">method on that email object and again</span> <span data-start="279.63" data-end="280.71">you saw that the preview up here</span> <span data-start="280.71" data-end="283.169">instantly updated and we can get the</span> <span data-start="283.169" data-end="286.56">current value using the gap method so a</span> <span data-start="286.56" data-end="289.77">knockout and amber slightly different in</span> <span data-start="289.77" data-end="291.27">syntax but they have exactly the same</span> <span data-start="291.27" data-end="292.97">functionality</span> <span data-start="292.97" data-end="297.03">so let me have angularjs angry kinda</span> <span data-start="297.03" data-end="299.13">takes the best of both worlds so uses</span> <span data-start="299.13" data-end="301.56">the curly braces from ember but it uses</span> <span data-start="301.56" data-end="302.97">the normal interpret field from angular</span> <span data-start="302.97" data-end="306.36">and from a knockout and so we have again</span> <span data-start="306.36" data-end="312.75">the same function out there and on the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="312.75" data-end="314.52">JavaScript side angler uses completely</span> <span data-start="314.52" data-end="317.22">normal objects and it uses an object</span> <span data-start="317.22" data-end="320.22">called scope and any property on the</span> <span data-start="320.22" data-end="323.1">scope can be bound to the HTML when you</span> <span data-start="323.1" data-end="324.66">want to set it all you do is set it like</span> <span data-start="324.66" data-end="327.6">any other normal javascript object but</span> <span data-start="327.6" data-end="328.89">notice that nothing happened up here in</span> <span data-start="328.89" data-end="330.9">the preview because after this you need</span> <span data-start="330.9" data-end="333.39">to call the apply function that's when</span> <span data-start="333.39" data-end="335.52">something happens now if you program</span> <span data-start="335.52" data-end="337.92">with knockout with a angler before then</span> <span data-start="337.92" data-end="339.51">you probably don't always call the apply</span> <span data-start="339.51" data-end="340.86">function because angular is pretty</span> <span data-start="340.86" data-end="343.29">clever about calling it for you but it</span> <span data-start="343.29" data-end="345.93">still needs to be done so what's going</span> <span data-start="345.93" data-end="350.46">on with this apply function well when</span> <span data-start="350.46" data-end="353.25">you just set the message angler has no</span> <span data-start="353.25" data-end="354.81">idea exactly what you've done you could</span> <span data-start="354.81" data-end="357.15">have done anything to the scope so the</span> <span data-start="357.15" data-end="359.28">way it does this is that you loop</span> <span data-start="359.28" data-end="361.53">through every property in scope and it</span> <span data-start="361.53" data-end="363.39">sees if it has changed and if it has</span> <span data-start="363.39" data-end="365.28">changed that's what it updates Dom and</span> <span data-start="365.28" data-end="367.26">then it saves the new value so it has</span> <span data-start="367.26" data-end="368.49">something to compare against the next</span> <span data-start="368.49" data-end="371.79">time the scope changes this skin has</span> <span data-start="371.79" data-end="374.85">this is what's called dirty checking so</span> <span data-start="374.85" data-end="377.31">yeah you check which elements on the</span> <span data-start="377.31" data-end="381">scope object which are dirty this kind</span> <span data-start="381" data-end="383.669">of some kind of strange side effect so</span> <span data-start="383.669" data-end="387.56">here we have a text and when it whoops</span> <span data-start="387.56" data-end="391.32">100 some text you see that the preview</span> <span data-start="391.32" data-end="394.169">on top changed instantly now we're going</span> <span data-start="394.169" data-end="396.72">to add 5,000 elements to the list on the</span> <span data-start="396.72" data-end="400.169">scope and yep there we go they're all</span> <span data-start="400.169" data-end="402.69">down here now this should have changed</span> <span data-start="402.69" data-end="404.79">anything for text but if I now type</span> <span data-start="404.79" data-end="410.44">something notice how much slower it is</span> <span data-start="410.45" data-end="414.24">so just because we added a lot of stuff</span> <span data-start="414.24" data-end="416.46">to scope angular is suddenly slower at</span> <span data-start="416.46" data-end="418.32">rendering your application and working</span> <span data-start="418.32" data-end="420.21">through it that's because when you</span> <span data-start="420.21" data-end="422.34">change the text field angler doesn't</span> <span data-start="422.34" data-end="423.81">know that he has to check every one of</span> <span data-start="423.81" data-end="425.22">the 5,000 elements to see if any of</span> <span data-start="425.22" data-end="426">those have chain</span> <span data-start="426" data-end="427.59">it has to do that for every time you</span> <span data-start="427.59" data-end="431.43">change anything now amber doesn't have</span> <span data-start="431.43" data-end="437.52">this problem number we can whoops we can</span> <span data-start="437.52" data-end="440.85">do some text and then we can add 5,000</span> <span data-start="440.85" data-end="450.99">items and yes there we go awesome yep</span> <span data-start="450.99" data-end="452.93">and still things are working perfectly</span> <span data-start="452.93" data-end="454.86">that's because every keeps track of</span> <span data-start="454.86" data-end="457.53">dependencies so it knows that when you</span> <span data-start="457.53" data-end="459.03">change the text that's what happened it</span> <span data-start="459.03" data-end="460.56">doesn't need to check any of the 5,000</span> <span data-start="460.56" data-end="463.35">elements and it's the same story for</span> <span data-start="463.35" data-end="468.75">knockout actually so yep entering some</span> <span data-start="468.75" data-end="473.39">text adding 5,000 items there you go and</span> <span data-start="473.39" data-end="476.6">just as quick as it was before</span> <span data-start="476.6" data-end="479.7">so to summarize amber and knockout the</span> <span data-start="479.7" data-end="481.71">use of several properties while angular</span> <span data-start="481.71" data-end="484.26">uses dirty-checking and that comes with</span> <span data-start="484.26" data-end="487.56">some unfortunate side effects now as you</span> <span data-start="487.56" data-end="491.37">quite noticed amber is a bit slower at</span> <span data-start="491.37" data-end="492.93">rending the 5,000 items than the other</span> <span data-start="492.93" data-end="495.21">two and so I ran the experiment several</span> <span data-start="495.21" data-end="497.58">times to find out like what performance</span> <span data-start="497.58" data-end="499.98">was for different number of items and as</span> <span data-start="499.98" data-end="501.81">you can see amber is quite a lot slower</span> <span data-start="501.81" data-end="504.78">than angular so we can't just say that</span> <span data-start="504.78" data-end="508.44">dirty-checking is low it it's slow in</span> <span data-start="508.44" data-end="510.39">some situations but it's really fast at</span> <span data-start="510.39" data-end="512.16">rendering 5,000 items because you don't</span> <span data-start="512.16" data-end="513.87">have to set up all the dependencies and</span> <span data-start="513.87"

<span data-start="728.18" data-end="730.37">example and so far it looks pretty much</span> <span data-start="730.37" data-end="732.14">the same you just use the Ember syntax</span> <span

amber kind of</span> <span data-start="755.839" data-end="758.32">struggles so this is a very simple</span> <span data-start="758.32" data-end="761.81">example where if a is true then this one</span> <span data-start="761.81" data-end="764.3">is going to return B and if a is false</span> <span data-start="764.3" data-end="766.13">it's going to return to C and we</span> <span data-start="766.13"
