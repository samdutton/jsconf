data-start="1166.619" data-end="1168.96">other library libraries are pretty rigid</span> <span data-start="1168.96" data-end="1170.97">you don't up them date them on a daily</span> <span data-start="1170.97" data-end="1173.309">base then you have the utility layer</span> <span data-start="1173.309" data-end="1176.009">which means that this is some sort of</span> <span data-start="1176.009" data-end="1181.35">here we left pad or low dash or whatever</span> <span data-start="1181.35" data-end="1183.269">and then we have your models and modules</span> <span data-start="1183.269" data-end="1187.169">on top of that and you can exchange all</span> <span data-start="1187.169" data-end="1189.059">the stuff on the top level freely</span> <span data-start="1189.059" data-end="1192.029">without having any fear that that you</span> <span data-start="1192.029" data-end="1194.009">have to change more than one file but if</span> <span data-start="1194.009" data-end="1197.789">you change anything below you have to</span> <span data-start="1197.789" data-end="1199.999">change everything that's on top of them</span> <span data-start="1199.999" data-end="1204.029">so in this one example that we had we</span> <span data-start="1204.029" data-end="1206.279">had a rod optimized utility layer I</span> <span data-start="1206.279" data-end="1208.999">think of building your own moderniser</span> <span data-start="1208.999" data-end="1212.039">build where you just have those tests in</span> <span data-start="1212.039" data-end="1216.09">it that you really like and a change</span> <span data-start="1216.09" data-end="1218.009">happened in this layer like I had to add</span> <span data-start="1218.009" data-end="1219.48">some new functionality because one of my</span> <span data-start="1219.48" data-end="1221.639">models was using this functionality this</span> <span data-start="1221.639" data-end="1223.679">meant that I had to change all the</span> <span data-start="1223.679" data-end="1225.33">modules as well because this utility</span> <span data-start="1225.33" data-end="1228.929">layer has changed and what we did to</span> <span data-start="1228.929" data-end="1231.029">overcome this since most of the models</span> <span data-start="1231.029" data-end="1233.399">just took a little tiny wee bit of the</span> <span data-start="1233.399" data-end="1233.73">city</span> <span data-start="1233.73" data-end="1236.01">italy or maybe one function or maybe two</span> <span data-start="1236.01" data-end="1239.28">functions nothing much we started tree</span> <span data-start="1239.28" data-end="1241.68">shaking this tree who is heard of tree</span> <span data-start="1241.68" data-end="1244.29">shaking in here quite a lot of what</span> <span data-start="1244.29" data-end="1247.47">everybody who hasn't heard of it this</span> <span data-start="1247.47" data-end="1251.76">works with Eggman stripped 16 Sumitra</span> <span data-start="1251.76" data-end="1255.75">between 2016 and six with a conscript</span> <span data-start="1255.75" data-end="1257.13">with the current version of ECMO script</span> <span data-start="1257.13" data-end="1260.25">um if you use egg no script modules you</span> <span data-start="1260.25" data-end="1262.71">can import them like that and there are</span> <span data-start="1262.71" data-end="1266.07">tools like roll up chess or web I guess</span> <span data-start="1266.07" data-end="1267.33">we pack the neck the current version of</span> <span data-start="1267.33" data-end="1270.45">web pack does that work as well who can</span> <span data-start="1270.45" data-end="1272.82">just import those bits and pieces that</span> <span data-start="1272.82" data-end="1274.4">you really need to if I have a huge</span> <span data-start="1274.4" data-end="1276.69">utility library and I just want to have</span> <span data-start="1276.69" data-end="1278.91">this one helper function what those</span> <span data-start="1278.91" data-end="1281.16">tools can do is extract those functions</span> <span data-start="1281.16" data-end="1284.27">so my module now has those two functions</span> <span data-start="1284.27" data-end="1287.43">included as well so instead of having a</span> <span data-start="1287.43" data-end="1290.9">broad utility labor everybody consumes</span> <span data-start="1290.9" data-end="1293.97">we pack those utilities that we needed</span> <span data-start="1293.97" data-end="1298.08">into the module and so we had lots of</span> <span data-start="1298.08" data-end="1300">highly flexible modules that we could</span> <span data-start="1300" data-end="1302.28">exchange it will and the library was</span> <span data-start="1302.28" data-end="1304.44">still underneath that was the way we did</span> <span data-start="1304.44" data-end="1309.42">it there so that's one way to go if you</span> <span data-start="1309.42" data-end="1312.03">request me to answer you what you want</span> <span data-start="1312.03" data-end="1315.45">to do with your application remember the</span> <span data-start="1315.45" data-end="1317.33">best request is regrets not being made</span> <span data-start="1317.33" data-end="1320.85">but it's all I have a few of you advises</span> <span data-start="1320.85" data-end="1323.01">that I can give you the first one is</span> <span data-start="1323.01" data-end="1324.78">create independent exchangeable</span> <span data-start="1324.78" data-end="1327.39">components so every package that you</span> <span data-start="1327.39" data-end="1329.7">have and that you can deploy without</span> <span data-start="1329.7" data-end="1331.68">touching everything else that's a win</span> <span data-start="1331.68" data-end="1333.48">for HTTP too because your check just can</span> <span data-start="1333.48" data-end="1335.01">update the version number everything</span> <span data-start="1335.01" data-end="1336.48">else is on the client and you just</span> <span data-start="1336.48" data-end="1337.95">transfer those little bits and pieces</span> <span data-start="1337.95" data-end="1339.21">over the wire that you need for the next</span> <span data-start="1339.21" data-end="1342.66">version create small and detach bundles</span> <span data-start="1342.66" data-end="1344.67">if you're going to bundle yourself try</span> <span data-start="1344.67" data-end="1347.22">to bundle them in a sensible way so they</span> <span data-start="1347.22" data-end="1350.49">don't touch anything else coat</span> <span data-start="1350.49" data-end="1352.95">application and edit weight is ok if the</span> <span data-start="1352.95" data-end="1354.75">file can stay long on the client that's</span> <span data-start="1354.75" data-end="1357.3">like me having a belly so I can go a</span> <span data-start="1357.3" data-end="1358.95">whole day without food which I did today</span> <span data-start="1358.95" data-end="1362.94">and think about long lasting</span> <span data-start="1362.94" data-end="1364.86">applications in frequency of change so</span> <span data-start="1364.86" data-end="1366.909">it's good to get a lot</span> <span data-start="1366.909" data-end="1368.95">over when you first download the webpage</span> <span data-start="1368.95" data-end="1371.229">but people are going to visit your</span> <span data-start="1371.229" data-end="1372.519">product or your application or your</span> <span data-start="1372.519" data-end="1374.7">webpage hopefully more than once so</span> <span data-start="1374.7" data-end="1376.749">everything they have there already and</span> <span data-start="1376.749" data-end="1381.789">they can use already is win and do we</span> <span data-start="1381.789" data-end="1385.629">have still to a minute I made some I</span>
