<p><span data-start="32.19" data-end="35.56">hey so my name is Dave Ulmer I with this</span> <span data-start="35.56" data-end="38.17">framework called Joe because I figured</span> <span data-start="38.17" data-end="39.37">there weren't enough mobile frameworks</span> <span data-start="39.37" data-end="40.87">out there in the world right now based</span> <span data-start="40.87" data-end="44.17">on html5 actually sorta development on</span> <span data-start="44.17" data-end="47.59">this about a year ago so it's been kind</span> <span data-start="47.59" data-end="54.07">of percolating behind the scenes you can</span> <span data-start="54.07" data-end="55.54">applaud early this that's okay that's</span> <span data-start="55.54" data-end="60.73">fine okay so yeah I've been kind of</span> <span data-start="60.73" data-end="62.53">lurking in the JavaScript community for</span> <span data-start="62.53" data-end="65.649">for some time now so this is my first</span> <span data-start="65.649" data-end="68.619">open source JavaScript project mostly I</span> <span data-start="68.619" data-end="71.05">get paid by people to do things that you</span> <span data-start="71.05" data-end="73.21">know stay proprietary and hidden behind</span> <span data-start="73.21" data-end="76.39">the scenes see I've been programming a</span> <span data-start="76.39" data-end="80.05">while pretty pretty much a geek so I'll</span> <span data-start="80.05" data-end="85.539">just move on so yeah what is joe joe is</span> <span data-start="85.539" data-end="88.96">a application framework for mobile</span> <span data-start="88.96" data-end="91.84">devices most of the cool smart phones</span> <span data-start="91.84" data-end="96.369">today have either webview with web kit</span> <span data-start="96.369" data-end="100.36">or something very much WebKit like so i</span> <span data-start="100.36" data-end="101.47">took a look around at some of the older</span> <span data-start="101.47" data-end="102.759">frameworks that have been kicking around</span> <span data-start="102.759" data-end="104.38">some of the things that I've done in the</span> <span data-start="104.38" data-end="107.11">past and kind of wondered what would an</span> <span data-start="107.11" data-end="109">application framework specifically a UI</span> <span data-start="109" data-end="111.61">framework look like if you just started</span> <span data-start="111.61" data-end="114.13">from scratch and said well if I don't</span> <span data-start="114.13" data-end="117.36">have to support IE six seven or eight</span> <span data-start="117.36" data-end="119.2">you know can you write a smaller</span> <span data-start="119.2" data-end="120.88">framework can you leverage some of the</span> <span data-start="120.88" data-end="122.679">cool stuff that's into css3 and all this</span> <span data-start="122.679" data-end="126.7">thing that we're calling html5 n turns</span> <span data-start="126.7" data-end="128.619">out you can end up with a pretty small</span> <span data-start="128.619" data-end="131.89">library so Jo has a pretty robust set of</span> <span data-start="131.89" data-end="134.62">widgets a simple data layer and gzip to</span> <span data-start="134.62" data-end="138.819">minified it's kicking around 12 k and if</span> <span data-start="138.819" data-end="140.83">you want to do how to work with</span> <span data-start="140.83" data-end="145.9">basically anything except IE anything</span> <span data-start="145.9" data-end="147.7">before ie9 it's actually working value 9</span> <span data-start="147.7" data-end="149.86">pretty well these days it's designed to</span> <span data-start="149.86" data-end="151.84">work with phonegap so how many people</span> <span data-start="151.84" data-end="153.4">are familiar with with phonegap for</span> <span data-start="153.4" data-end="156.069">mobile development all right okay</span> <span data-start="156.069" data-end="159.43">brian's brand arose very happy so Joe</span> <span data-start="159.43" data-end="161.019">was designed to sit for mobile</span> <span data-start="161.019" data-end="163.709">applications on top of the phonegap so</span> <span data-start="163.709" data-end="165.79">as you may know with phonegap</span> <span data-start="165.79" data-end="167.079">basically what it gives you is sort of a</span> <span data-start="167.079" data-end="168.909">baseline compatibility layer between all</span> <span data-start="168.909" data-end="171.64">the different mobile OS is out there but</span> <span data-start="171.64" data-end="172.9">what it doesn't ring to the party is</span> <span data-start="172.9" data-end="176.049">sort of all the cool native like widgets</span> <span data-start="176.049" data-end="178.48">and controls for for putting a nap</span> <span data-start="178.48" data-end="181.299">together so Joe is designed to sort of</span> <span data-start="181.299" data-end="186.7">sit on top of that or the great layer so</span> <span data-start="186.7" data-end="189.34">no this is you know a pretty typical</span> <span data-start="189.34" data-end="191.53">block diagram of you know the</span> <span data-start="191.53" data-end="195.519">architecture pretty simple Joe is a very</span> <span data-start="195.519" data-end="197.829">lightweight framework so you don't have</span> <span data-start="197.829" data-end="199.75">to use it for everything if you want to</span> <span data-start="199.75" data-end="201.04">fill it with the Dom directly because</span> <span data-start="201.04" data-end="203.139">you have some last-minute hacky thing</span> <span data-start="203.139" data-end="204.37">that you have to do for your app to get</span> <span data-start="204.37" data-end="207.159">it out the door go right ahead Joe Sri</span> <span data-start="207.159" data-end="208.389">they're not going to get in the way it</span> <span data-start="208.389" data-end="210.519">has no other no dependencies on any</span> <span data-start="210.519" data-end="213.76">other libraries so the big plus there is</span> <span data-start="213.76" data-end="216.48">is that you don't run into any</span> <span data-start="216.48" data-end="218.5">incompatibilities so if you want to mix</span> <span data-start="218.5" data-end="221.099">in other lives to get your app together</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="221.099" data-end="225.069">Joe's not going to get in your way if</span> <span data-start="225.069" data-end="227.47">you're using phonegap with iOS and</span> <span data-start="227.47" data-end="230.139">Android basically for those that haven't</span> <span data-start="230.139" data-end="231.9">used phonegap allows you to create</span> <span data-start="231.9" data-end="235.87">installable native ish mobile apps use</span> <span data-start="235.87" data-end="239.47">html5 technology so on these platforms</span> <span data-start="239.47" data-end="243.459">iOS and Android phone taps will give you</span> <span data-start="243.459" data-end="246.4">sort of a web view and then sort of a</span> <span data-start="246.4" data-end="248.829">native app wrapper and then inside that</span> <span data-start="248.829" data-end="250.84">webview you can put your your JavaScript</span> <span data-start="250.84" data-end="256.09">html5 CSS app and then some other mobile</span> <span data-start="256.09" data-end="258.76">platforms so I work at HP that's my day</span> <span data-start="258.76" data-end="260.919">job how many people are familiar with</span> <span data-start="260.919" data-end="264.789">webos okay cool cool that's actually</span> <span data-start="264.789" data-end="266.32">yeah all right that's a lot of hands</span> <span data-start="266.32" data-end="269.349">cool so let's go about webos is</span> <span data-start="269.349" data-end="271.479">something like PhoneGap is there mostly</span> <span data-start="271.479" data-end="274.36">as a compatibility layer webos native</span> <span data-start="274.36" data-end="276.639">apps are basically web apps or at least</span> <span data-start="276.639" data-end="280.63">they use web technology so kind of</span> <span data-start="280.63" data-end="283.36">another flashback to when the iphone</span> <span data-start="283.36" data-end="285.789">came out i was a big fan mostly because</span> <span data-start="285.789" data-end="287.32">apple got up in front of everybody and</span> <span data-start="287.32" data-end="289.419">said hey does anybody remember what they</span> <span data-start="289.419" data-end="292.96">said right right right web app so</span> <span data-start="292.96" data-end="296.2">basically Apple said the web is the SDK</span> <span data-start="296.2" data-end="298.69">this is you know new breed of smartphone</span> <span data-start="298.69" data-end="299.32">you don't</span> <span data-start="299.32" data-end="304.27">special SDK all you need our web apps so</span> <span data-start="304.27" data-end="306.4">it was all on board with that and got</span> <span data-start="306.4" data-end="307.54">well underway writing if you absolutely</span> <span data-start="307.54" data-end="309.37">sort of came back a year later and said</span> <span data-start="309.37" data-end="312.22">well web does the SDK except for this</span> <span data-start="312.22" data-end="314.19">new thing that we're calling the actual</span> <span data-start="314.19" data-end="318.85">sdk for for apple so I still bear maybe</span> <span data-start="318.85" data-end="320.02">a little bit of bitterness towards that</span> <span data-start="320.02" data-end="322">and so when webos came around and</span> <span data-start="322" data-end="325">actually said the web is the sdk and</span> <span data-start="325" data-end="327.22">then actually you know came through on</span> <span data-start="327.22" data-end="329.77">that promise that definitely attracted</span> <span data-start="329.77" data-end="333.7">me over to HP to work on that Joe is</span> <span data-start="333.7" data-end="337.54">also open source has a freebsd license</span> <span data-start="337.54" data-end="339.43">so you can pretty much do anything you</span> <span data-start="339.43" data-end="341.89">want with it and i'm really hoping to</span> <span data-start="341.89" data-end="343.48">actually get a lot more code</span> <span data-start="343.48" data-end="345.76">contributors i've had a few so far who</span> <span data-start="345.76" data-end="347.56">have mostly done a few bug fixes out a</span> <span data-start="347.56" data-end="350.35">few pieces here and there but Joe is has</span> <span data-start="350.35" data-end="353.8">reached the size where you know to sort</span> <span data-start="353.8" data-end="356.05">of get it out there and get it to beta</span> <span data-start="356.05" data-end="358.33">and have a go live definitely like to</span> <span data-start="358.33" data-end="360.94">find a couple more folks who are you</span> <span data-start="360.94" data-end="362.17">know really enthusiastic about the</span> <span data-start="362.17" data-end="363.04">approach that I'm taking with his</span> <span data-start="363.04" data-end="365.08">library and have a little spare time on</span> <span data-start="365.08" data-end="369.82">their hands to to chip in so I'm going</span> <span data-start="369.82" data-end="371.65">to go over real quick the the basic</span> <span data-start="371.65" data-end="375.04">philosophy behind Joe because it is it's</span> <span data-start="375.04" data-end="378.19">a little different so just sort of show</span> <span data-start="378.19" data-end="379.96">of hands like how much how many people</span> <span data-start="379.96" data-end="383.86">are familiar with say sencha touch okay</span> <span data-start="383.86" data-end="385.36">it's not bad sencha touch is relatively</span> <span data-start="385.36" data-end="390.07">new what about jQuery Mobile okay</span> <span data-start="390.07" data-end="391.69">actually about the same about 5050</span> <span data-start="391.69" data-end="394.84">between the two so to me these sort of</span> <span data-start="394.84" data-end="397.69">represent sort of the two polar extremes</span> <span data-start="397.69" data-end="400.77">of what we have out there right now with</span> <span data-start="400.77" data-end="404.98">sort of html5 based mobile technologies</span> <span data-start="404.98" data-end="409.27">we've got jQuery on the one side which</span> <span data-start="409.27" data-end="411.52">jquery mobile does pretty much you know</span> <span data-start="411.52" data-end="413.53">what you created except they have like</span> <span data-start="413.53" data-end="415.06">sort of a mobile widget library laying</span> <span data-start="415.06" data-end="417.82">on top of it and you know if you code in</span> <span data-start="417.82" data-end="420.12">jquery mobile you spend a lot of time</span> <span data-start="420.12" data-end="422.77">more on the HTML side and then you sort</span> <span data-start="422.77" data-end="425.17">of add the javascript kind of as you go</span> <span data-start="425.17" data-end="426.76">which is that's so that's one approach</span> <span data-start="426.76" data-end="428.77">and then on the other end of the stream</span> <span data-start="428.77" data-end="430.35">you've got something like sencha touch</span> <span data-start="430.35" data-end="432.729">which is similar to you say</span> <span data-start="432.729" data-end="435.629">sprout core or even going back to dojo</span> <span data-start="435.629" data-end="439.3">which is more JavaScript centric so</span> <span data-start="439.3" data-end="441.669">using javascript to creat your app the</span> <span data-start="441.669" data-end="443.469">fact that there's sort of a dominant in</span> <span data-start="443.469" data-end="446.379">there is sort of sort of a means to the</span> <span data-start="446.379" data-end="450.159">end rather than than a focus so Joe</span> <span data-start="450.159" data-end="453.729">leans a little bit more towards the</span> <span data-start="453.729" data-end="457.839">sencha touch side but I can do this in a</span> <span data-start="457.839" data-end="462.249">second here but yeah I'm going to skip a</span> <span data-start="462.249" data-end="464.71">slide and come back so what a lot of</span> <span data-start="464.71" data-end="465.819">these frameworks that are very</span> <span data-start="465.819" data-end="468.339">javascript heavy tend to do is come to</span> <span data-start="468.339" data-end="470.559">come to the play come to our platform</span> <span data-start="470.559" data-end="473.77">saying well javascript parts of it are</span> <span data-start="473.77" data-end="475.389">kind of hard you know prototypal</span> <span data-start="475.389" data-end="478.12">inheritance is tough and gosh you know I</span> <span data-start="478.12" data-end="480.309">we come from a better language that has</span> <span data-start="480.309" data-end="483.129">proper classes and things like that so a</span> <span data-start="483.129" data-end="485.399">lot of frameworks will create these</span> <span data-start="485.399" data-end="490.569">really sort of intricate patterns and</span> <span data-start="490.569" data-end="493.719">machinations to sort of create a what I</span> <span data-start="493.719" data-end="496.059">call a sort of a language experience</span> <span data-start="496.059" data-end="499.719">inside JavaScript you know these</span> <span data-start="499.719" data-end="501.459">libraries do some cool stuff but that</span> <span data-start="501.459" data-end="502.99">that's never really set too well with me</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="502.99" data-end="506.02">I happen to actually love JavaScript at</span> <span data-start="506.02" data-end="511.529">its core it's my personal belief that if</span> <span data-start="511.529" data-end="514.36">WebKit were more up to snuff today we</span> <span data-start="514.36" data-end="516.01">really wouldn't need sort of any UI</span> <span data-start="516.01" data-end="519.819">frameworks whatsoever and even though I</span> <span data-start="519.819" data-end="521.56">wrote 1 i'm i'm actually genuinely</span> <span data-start="521.56" data-end="523.719">hoping at some time in in the next five</span> <span data-start="523.719" data-end="526.3">years or so well i'll be using vapor jas</span> <span data-start="526.3" data-end="529.449">basically to get our apps done so</span> <span data-start="529.449" data-end="532.089">between now and absolute adoption of</span> <span data-start="532.089" data-end="536.829">vapor jas we have something like Joe Joe</span> <span data-start="536.829" data-end="538.63">has a lot of the things that I like one</span> <span data-start="538.63" data-end="540.13">of the things that I really appreciate</span> <span data-start="540.13" data-end="544">about jQuery is method chaining took me</span> <span data-start="544" data-end="548.019">a little bit to really enjoy that way of</span> <span data-start="548.019" data-end="551.649">doing things but it's very handy i also</span> <span data-start="551.649" data-end="553.449">have a constructor nesting in here now</span> <span data-start="553.449" data-end="555.699">i'll show that off in a minute when we</span> <span data-start="555.699" data-end="559.81">get to the code stuff but basically a</span> <span data-start="559.81" data-end="562.029">lot of stuff that's in Crockfords you</span> <span data-start="562.029" data-end="563.949">know javascript the good parts show of</span> <span data-start="563.949" data-end="565.06">hands everyone should know this book</span> <span data-start="565.06" data-end="565.86">right</span> <span data-start="565.86" data-end="569.02">javascript a good parts okay yeah so all</span> <span data-start="569.02" data-end="571.42">of the good parts stuff Joe is pretty</span> <span data-start="571.42" data-end="573.04">much in line with i agree with about</span> <span data-start="573.04" data-end="575.32">ninety-five percent of what is in</span> </p>
