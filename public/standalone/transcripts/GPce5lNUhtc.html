<p><span data-start="21.49" data-end="23.84">Hello, hello. Ok. Just one second, so hello everyone, my name is Anand Vemuri,</span> <span data-start="23.84" data-end="30.99">I am going to be talking about security today. Before I begin I was like to pre-vast by saying</span> <span data-start="30.99" data-end="39.01">that I'm extremely humbled to be here JSConf EU, is arguably the conference I used to work</span> <span data-start="39.01" data-end="43.48">a couple of years back, it inspired me to take JavaScript seriously for me to be on</span> <span data-start="43.48" data-end="49.17">this side of the stage is a really big honour.</span> <span data-start="49.17" data-end="55.96">So who am I, my Twitter handle is brow hat 57, a software developer who later went to</span> <span data-start="55.96" data-end="64.03">the dark side and is now doing testing and security, I work for nVisium in the DC Metro</span> <span data-start="64.03" data-end="72.159">area, I'm very passionate about Taco Bell if you are, please talk to me, we can talk</span> <span data-start="72.159" data-end="78.08">about Taco Bell. I do play the flute, if this whole developer thing doesn't work, that's</span> <span data-start="78.08" data-end="89.17">my back up. I'm a wannabe, I'm by no means an expert in this language, I do what I can,</span> <span data-start="89.17" data-end="96.609">I come to these conferences and I see these incredible talks, I'm so inspired to learn</span> <span data-start="96.609" data-end="99.1">more and more.</span> <span data-start="99.1" data-end="104.6">Just a quick show of hands here, how many of you guys write code for a living — just</span> <span data-start="104.6" data-end="109.929">raise your hand — wow, this is awesome, great, it's not surprising, as we're at a JavaScript</span> <span data-start="109.929" data-end="115.38">convention. As software developers that's pretty awesome.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="115.38" data-end="121.079">So another quick, quick show of hands, real quick, how many of you guys work on the dark</span> <span data-start="121.079" data-end="130.74">side of things in security, whether it ethical hacking, or for your own fun? So.. ok..</span> <span data-start="130.74" data-end="136.61">good a couple of you. So, as somebody who was a software developer who later became</span> <span data-start="136.61" data-end="142.12">an application security consultant, I faced a little bit of a problem, this problem was</span> <span data-start="142.12" data-end="148.33">that as a software developer you can, the word 'Software developer', basically tells</span> <span data-start="148.33" data-end="153.27">you what the person does, they develop software, it's almost a no-brainer, there is really</span> <span data-start="153.27" data-end="158.91">no good word for what I too, in terms of what my job description is, what do you call somebody</span> <span data-start="158.91" data-end="166.67">who does security, like a security guy.. or.. I don't know, maybe a consultant. The</span> <span data-start="166.67" data-end="171.33">best thing I could think of is penetration tester, that really doesn't define what I</span> <span data-start="171.33" data-end="173.9">do really well. I feel like, because</span> <span data-start="173.9" data-end="179.26">people don't necessarily understand what it is I do, I've been called a couple of things</span> <span data-start="179.26" data-end="186.92">in my career, among all of them I've been called a scan tester, scanner, security scanner</span> <span data-start="186.92" data-end="195.09">tester, vulnerability scan tester, even sometimes in jest a scan Monkey, it's a little bit alarming,</span> <span data-start="195.09" data-end="202.2">it's a common motif here where people think, people have this notion of security in that</span> <span data-start="202.2" data-end="208.25">you run a bunch of antivirus scans, or a bunch of scans in your application, you point click,</span> <span data-start="208.25" data-end="213.57">you run your application through and you create a PDF and ship it off to developers to make</span> <span data-start="213.57" data-end="221.43">their lives miserable. This couldn't be further from the truth. If you actually look at what</span> <span data-start="221.43" data-end="226.97">the English dictionary says about scanners, for starters it uses the word 'Scan' in the</span> <span data-start="226.97" data-end="232.98">definition so it's not very helpful! \{Laughter\} It defines a scanner as a person or thing</span> <span data-start="232.98" data-end="237.2">that scans. What is very interesting about this, I'm going to refer to scanners in my</span> <span data-start="237.2" data-end="242.4">talk, I'm not just talking about automated pieces of code, I'm also talking about people</span> <span data-start="242.4" data-end="254.24">that just scan, by scan I mean to glance at or read over hastily, therefore, by, by missing</span> <span data-start="254.24" data-end="260.47">out on a lot of things, if you are just running some kind of automated scanner or just glancing</span> <span data-start="260.47" data-end="264.34">over something very quickly, there is a very good chance that you are going to miss something,</span> <span data-start="264.34" data-end="270.34">something very critical. So we're talking about application security, what we typically</span> <span data-start="270.34" data-end="276.71">too is rather than look at an application and try, trying to just quickly pump out a</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="276.71" data-end="283.61">PDF, we look at an application's architecture and after every point we try to systematically</span> <span data-start="283.61" data-end="290.419">break the application, if it's a database, ok can we inject some sort of query in to</span> <span data-start="290.419" data-end="296.49">the database to get some kind of code execution, or trick the app into clicking a button that</span> <span data-start="296.49" data-end="303.379">will submit a state-changing request, or can I, you know, use some insecure direct object</span> <span data-start="303.379" data-end="307.569">reference to escalate my privileges, these are the kind of questions that run through</span> <span data-start="307.569" data-end="313.169">my mind when I use the internet, which is sometimes a curse in disguise, especially</span> <span data-start="313.169" data-end="320.3">when my credit card is going online, it's not pleasant to think about it. As someone</span> <span data-start="320.3" data-end="326.069">doing a lot of JavaScript recently, a lot of my attacks for research are focused on</span> <span data-start="326.069" data-end="332.68">the browser and the client side aspect of things, I'm looking into client side attacks,</span> <span data-start="332.68" data-end="340.11">especially with the newer frameworks, as we see them all throughout the past so many years,</span> <span data-start="340.11" data-end="345.18">when we talk about 'Client side security', the major vulnerability that comes to mind</span> <span data-start="345.18" data-end="355.49">is cross-site scripting, it's one of the most common vulnerabilities that we see all throughout,</span> <span data-start="355.49" data-end="361.81">ever since the inception of the internet we've seen vulnerable code and the problem is, cross-site</span> <span data-start="361.81" data-end="369.93">scripting attacks users like me, you or, like admins to an application that have some kind</span> <span data-start="369.93" data-end="377.33">of privileged data, cross-site describing is very dangerous in that respect, it's kind</span> <span data-start="377.33" data-end="381.809">of, you can think of it as a JavaScript injection attack on the client side, the exploits, as</span> <span data-start="381.809" data-end="389.4">we will see later on, can get very, very bad, by that I mean really, really scary.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="389.4" data-end="395.889">So what exactly is cross-site scripting? Well, it starts off with the very, very evil guy,</span> <span data-start="395.889" data-end="400.12">right and so this evil guy wants to do some really evil things, so he's going to send</span> <span data-start="400.12" data-end="408.129">a hidden URL, or a URL to a victim which contains some hidden script somewhere, you guys work</span> <span data-start="408.129" data-end="414.09">with JavaScript, I don't have to tell you, a lot of times these scripts run on your browser</span> <span data-start="414.09" data-end="419.189">and they are very transparent, you might not even know you are being attacked. The URL</span> <span data-start="419.189" data-end="426.86">contains a hidden script, the victim opens the page, when you follow the URL, you know,</span> <span data-start="426.86" data-end="432.879">the browser renders the JavaScript and then the exploit happens, whatever, whatever the</span> <span data-start="432.879" data-end="438.87">attacker told the browser to do, it's typically executes that and bad things happen.</span> <span data-start="438.87" data-end="443.229">So this is what we typically think of when we think of cross-site scripting, but it's</span> <span data-start="443.229" data-end="448.139">a very, very deep vulnerability, because, you know, it's a lot more than just this,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="448.139" data-end="456.879">I've actually met someone who conducted his full PhD thesis in just this one vulnerability,</span> <span data-start="456.879" data-end="462.029">that means it's extremely deep and complicated to talk about, cross-site scripting comes</span> <span data-start="462.029" data-end="467.83">in many different flavours, this is what you would talk about, when talking about reflective,</span> <span data-start="467.83" data-end="479.49">also stored, where you would inject some malicious script tag as a comment, every time that's</span> <span data-start="479.49" data-end="488.819">accessed the pay load persists and basically, any way, it's just a lot more dangerous, anybody</span> <span data-start="488.819" data-end="492.629">that accesses that page is now going to be vulnerable.</span> <span data-start="492.629" data-end="500.779">Then we have DOM based cross-site scripting, also very scary, manipulating HTML in the</span> <span data-start="500.779" data-end="511.119">DOM to get a cross site scripting, I think DOM-based cross-site scripting is quite interesting,</span> <span data-start="511.119" data-end="517.419">it only requires a few lines of JavaScript and HTML, the code snippet I have on a slide</span> <span data-start="517.419" data-end="523.44">it's maybe a couple of lines of HTML and JavaScript, very basic, but totally vulnerable to cross-site</span> <span data-start="523.44" data-end="531.8">scripting, so within just a very simple HTML page that's basically static we have, we already</span> <span data-start="531.8" data-end="533.519">have a vulnerability.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="533.519" data-end="542.75">So, my, my story kind of begins earlier on this year as we were doing a client assessment.</span> <span data-start="542.75" data-end="548.43">The client that we were testing used an application that had backbone JS on the front end and</span> <span data-start="548.43" data-end="553.85">it was like a Java back end. You know, they told us that, you know, they were very confident</span> <span data-start="553.85" data-end="560.399">with the application, they said, "We built this with security in mind, we parameterised</span> <span data-start="560.399" data-end="566.94">our query so you don't have to worry about SQL injection, we have done the mitigations</span> <span data-start="566.94" data-end="571.87">you won't get any attacks",. Talking on and on about all the typical things you would</span> <span data-start="571.87" data-end="580.62">want to defend against. So we said what did you too for cross-site scripting? They responded</span> <span data-start="580.62" data-end="586">with like, "Oh, you mean that pop-up thing, we tested for that, we're good." So this sort</span> <span data-start="586" data-end="591.72">of caught me by surprise for a couple of reasons, the first being that, you know, cross-site</span> <span data-start="591.72" data-end="596.81">scripting is way more than, "Just a pop-up thing", admittedly when we are testing for</span> <span data-start="596.81" data-end="605.019">cross-site slipped, we use a canonical alert pop-up to quickly see if it fires, if it does</span> <span data-start="605.019" data-end="611.519">then it's vulnerable, if it, you know, it's totally a lot more than that and when they</span> <span data-start="611.519" data-end="616.24">say that we, "We tested for that, we're good", I was really curious what they meant, they</span> <span data-start="616.24" data-end="622.18">said, "We have a third party vendor, they ran their scans, we ran our scans, we talked</span> <span data-start="622.18" data-end="631.579">to developers that knew about security, so we're good", we're like, right on! \{Laughter\}</span> <span data-start="631.579" data-end="631.589">.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="631.589" data-end="635.74">We decide to run our own scans and just see what happens, so we run the application through</span> <span data-start="635.74" data-end="651.3">Scan JS which admittedly now deprecated, didn't find anything, so cool, JS prime, another</span> <span data-start="651.3" data-end="656.459">static JavaScript analyser, these are the only real two JavaScript analyser that's I</span> <span data-start="656.459" data-end="664.97">can think of that are willing to give reliable results some of the time. So JS prime didn't</span> <span data-start="664.97" data-end="673">really find anything either, it found non-active sources and non-active syncs, so let's test.</span> <span data-start="673" data-end="682.86">So, obviously I can't show a client code, so I'm going to use a, a sample application</span> <span data-start="682.86" data-end="691.42">called wine cellar, which is basically this is a sample application built in the same</span> <span data-start="691.42" data-end="697.12">stack with the same exact vulnerabilities, the Github slide is in my link and you can</span> <span data-start="697.12" data-end="700.35">download that.</span> <span data-start="700.35" data-end="706.709">So we have the application here backbone, everything looks cool, let's play around with</span> <span data-start="706.709" data-end="712.41">it. So let us do the first evil thing and let's try that pop-up thing and let's see</span> <span data-start="712.41" data-end="722.11">if that works. So I'm just going to put a quick script alert, one script. Oh my gosh!</span> <span data-start="722.11" data-end="730.18">I thought they tested for that pop-up thing, like, this is totally not ok! \{Applause\}.</span> <span data-start="730.18" data-end="738.009">So, at this point we have demonstrated that this application is totally not pardoned against</span> <span data-start="738.009" data-end="745.36">cross-site scripting, we want to go further than that, we want to show to the developers</span> <span data-start="745.36" data-end="752.3">that cross-site scripting is actually a problem, so what do we do, there is a tool, the browser</span> <span data-start="752.3" data-end="764.3">exploitation framework or BeEF, it's a tool that we can use to basically assess the security,</span> <span data-start="764.3" data-end="770.92">exploit our cross-site scripting vulnerability, so how does it work? Well, here we go. I have</span> <span data-start="770.92" data-end="778.899">a virtual instance of kali Linux, which is running the beef server virtually, I'm going</span> <span data-start="778.899" data-end="792.509">to quickly see why this thing isn't running. What Beef will do it creates a beef hook which</span> <span data-start="792.509" data-end="798.47">allows us to hook our browser, when we hook are browser, we essentially, if we can inject</span> <span data-start="798.47" data-end="803.61">this into our victim's page we gain control to their browser and start doing really cool</span> <span data-start="803.61" data-end="813.97">things. Let's go ahead and take this script. Go back here and we'll do script sources is</span> <span data-start="813.97" data-end="821.819">equal to that.. we'll just save this guy in, it looks like it went through. Now we</span> <span data-start="821.819" data-end="829.6">can access our application on our beef panel and there we go. We see our application is</span> <span data-start="829.6" data-end="836.709">online and now we are remotely attacking our victim and we have a lot of information about</span> <span data-start="836.709" data-end="842.579">their browser as it is, we see what kind of browser, a browser.. a hooked page et cetera..</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="842.579" data-end="852.22">Probably the most powerful aspect of this is that we have a bunch of exploits we can</span> <span data-start="852.22" data-end="862.17">kick off, we have when you talk about JavaScript injection your exploits is limited to your</span> <span data-start="862.17" data-end="868.529">imagination, you can kick off whatever exploits you want, that the JavaScript language can</span> <span data-start="868.529" data-end="876.459">handle and so as people at a JavaScript conference it doesn't go with much surprise we can execute</span> <span data-start="876.459" data-end="881.019">a lot of really crazy things. If you take a look at some of these exploits we can get</span> <span data-start="881.019" data-end="887.54">cookie values for our victims and for example, if we're running an application where we're</span> <span data-start="887.54" data-end="892.97">attacking an admin we can get access to their session and attack them. We're at JSConf I’m</span> <span data-start="892.97" data-end="896.8">going to try something a little bit more bold and daring I am going to try to break into</span> <span data-start="896.8" data-end="899.449">my webcam.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="899.449" data-end="904.769">So the first thing to do this in order to do this is to run a quick permission check.</span> <span data-start="904.769" data-end="910.889">So I just kick that off, now I am going to write a quick social engineering message like,</span> <span data-start="910.889" data-end="923.29">hey, allow this for lots of money. This is not a scam. \{laughter\} do it. Hopefully if</span> <span data-start="923.29" data-end="931.459">the demo gods are happy with me today.. there we go. So we have now just asked for access</span> <span data-start="931.459" data-end="936.339">to my webcam. So I know everybody in this room is totally not going to click allow because</span> <span data-start="936.339" data-end="940.43">of course you wouldn't but if I sent it out to thousands of people there's a chance that</span> <span data-start="940.43" data-end="946.269">somebody would properly press yes so on behalf of that guy, let's take a cross-site scripting</span> <span data-start="946.269" data-end="947.469">selfie. \{laughter\}</span> <span data-start="956.61" data-end="961.089">pictures I hope these come out I don't know how my hair looks right now \{laughter\} I am</span> <span data-start="961.089" data-end="969.499">just going to run a quick, well let's see how BeEF handled that. It's going back, we</span> <span data-start="969.499" data-end="976.279">get the base encoded hex dot of the images that we have done, I am going to dump this</span> <span data-start="976.279" data-end="977.879">into a text file ever so</span> <span data-start="977.879" data-end="986.31">elegantly and just run a quick processing script. All of you front-end developers out</span> <span data-start="986.31" data-end="1000.699">there please do not judge my CSS. Hopefully if this works,.. there we go. \{laughter\}</span> <span data-start="1000.699" data-end="1003.55">\{applause\}</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1003.55" data-end="1012.879">So, we have just taken cross-site scripting and exploited our webcam. Albeit we have asked</span> <span data-start="1012.879" data-end="1019.79">for permission, but that's a social engineering component that was involved. So, what is special</span> <span data-start="1019.79" data-end="1023.949">about this? I mean scanners in these kind of security vulnerabilities have been round</span> <span data-start="1023.949" data-end="1029.579">for quite sometime, but what is concerning is the fact there are so many frameworks out</span> <span data-start="1029.579" data-end="1034.99">there that are just coming out and each of them has their own different type of vunerability</span> <span data-start="1034.99" data-end="1047.209">that's, or different types of security configuration that create a different type of attack surface.</span> <span data-start="1047.209" data-end="1051.88">It doesn't go to show, it goes to show that there's a lot that can go wrong by using your</span> <span data-start="1051.88" data-end="1057.24">own framework. There's so many different frameworks out there there's a lot you have to know about.</span> <span data-start="1057.24" data-end="1061.74">So let's take a look at Angular real quick, those of you who have used it you might have</span> <span data-start="1061.74" data-end="1067.84">used this NG bind attribute. This attribute is what people use to typically bind data</span> <span data-start="1067.84" data-end="1076.02">to a model and before Angular 1.2 there was this directive called NG bind HTML unsafe</span> <span data-start="1076.02" data-end="1084.799">which as the name of the directive says it unsafely binds HTML to model. They decided</span> <span data-start="1084.799" data-end="1090.62">to get rid of it now they have a problem, you have a lot of legacy code that's using</span> <span data-start="1090.62" data-end="1095.86">unsafe directives that is now broken because they have got rid of the model. If you go</span> <span data-start="1095.86" data-end="1103.2">to stack overflow in Google for this directive, literally the third result is somebody talking</span> <span data-start="1103.2" data-end="1110.809">about this problem the response you get is just use this sanitisation service just trust</span> <span data-start="1110.809" data-end="1116.86">everything has HTML, that's what you do. So here's what happens when you trust everything</span> <span data-start="1116.86" data-end="1128.47">as HTML. So I have an Angular app, you see a two-way data binding every angular tutorial</span> <span data-start="1128.47" data-end="1135.34">has something about that if you put bold tags it totally works. Script tags won't work because</span> <span data-start="1135.34" data-end="1141.2">it won't allow for dynamic script injection but if I try an image tag I set the source</span> <span data-start="1141.2" data-end="1148.32">to blah on error I say execute this script, before \{laughter\} before I can even finish</span> <span data-start="1148.32" data-end="1157.61">my sentence \{applause\} because of two-way data binding before I can finish my sentence</span> <span data-start="1157.61" data-end="1165.36">it executes. Every time after that if I key stroke it executes again. Which is kind of</span> <span data-start="1165.36" data-end="1171.85">a problem. This stems from a fundamental lack of understanding in the way that the framework</span> <span data-start="1171.85" data-end="1174.029">works.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1174.029" data-end="1179.6">So the strict contextual escaping service is used to properly white list things when</span> <span data-start="1179.6" data-end="1189.029">you trust everything as HTML here's what you get, and moving on to something like Meteor,</span> <span data-start="1189.029" data-end="1197.6">is full stack JavaScript is not just a client side vulnerability, a client side framework.</span> <span data-start="1197.6" data-end="1208.45">Sorry \{laughter\} Meteor was built with security in mind by default it HTML escapes everything.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1208.45" data-end="1213.929">This a great deal, nothing can totally go wrong here, this awesome. Until you actually</span> <span data-start="1213.929" data-end="1220.179">see somebody actually mess it up and they dynamically allow for anchor together as be</span> <span data-start="1220.179" data-end="1227.899">defined and so what this results in is basically if you were to name your list some kind of</span> <span data-start="1227.899" data-end="1234.659">JavaScript command it would actually fire. Different vectors and configuration you see</span> <span data-start="1234.659" data-end="1241.32">inside it itself. Nothing that a scanner will necessarily pick up on but something that</span> <span data-start="1241.32" data-end="1246.909">is definitely going to go wrong in your application if you don't look at it properly.</span> <span data-start="1246.909" data-end="1250.44">So I would be doing a huge disservice to this community by just saying that we're all kind</span> <span data-start="1250.44" data-end="1252.89">of screwed and we should give up, what can we do</span> <span data-start="1252.89" data-end="1263.809">to prevent against these kind of attacks. Contextual escaping skill a thing, and in</span> <span data-start="1263.809" data-end="1269.809">fact the same vulnerabilities can be mitigated by the same techniques in different ways.</span> <span data-start="1269.809" data-end="1274.96">So if you look at the previous backbone example all I have done in this case is basically</span> <span data-start="1274.96" data-end="1281.46">escape the values as they are getting set, and so if this code is applied, then rather</span> <span data-start="1281.46" data-end="1285.47">than actually rendering the script tag as JavaScript the browser will look at these</span> <span data-start="1285.47" data-end="1293.2">tags and basically just say that oh it's like HTML escaped it will render the actual HTML</span> <span data-start="1293.2" data-end="1300.12">escaped version of that tag which is much safer. Contextual output escaping means wherever</span> <span data-start="1300.12" data-end="1306.09">the I put is going to you escape it to that context so if it's going to JavaScript, a</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1306.09" data-end="1311.77">JavaScript escape if it's going to CSS you CSS the escape et cetera. Real quickly the</span> <span data-start="1311.77" data-end="1318.049">next topic is content security policy. It's like a secondary defence, it's a way for you</span> <span data-start="1318.049" data-end="1323.64">to specify to your browser or to your application which browser, which scripts you want your</span> <span data-start="1323.64" data-end="1330.149">browser to load. So obviously you don't want like untrusted evil scripts to load you just</span> <span data-start="1330.149" data-end="1336.419">define this policy which will block these scripts. Content security policy it's a talk</span> <span data-start="1336.419" data-end="1342.21">on it's own so we're just going to talk about it at a very high level but you can still</span> <span data-start="1342.21" data-end="1350.69">bypass this by setting a very lax policy but it's a good way to kind of prevent a lot of</span> <span data-start="1350.69" data-end="1352.11">unnecessary scripts from coming in.</span> <span data-start="1352.11" data-end="1357.85">Finally, we have server side input validation more like a tertiary measure if you are expecting</span> <span data-start="1357.85" data-end="1362.77">a phone number your request comes in with a script tag, that's not good you don't want</span> <span data-start="1362.77" data-end="1368.559">that so you should throw that away. That should happen at the server side so it can been bypassed</span> <span data-start="1368.559" data-end="1376.059">by intercepting proxy. So coming full circle here we have seen that scanners don't work</span> <span data-start="1376.059" data-end="1382.98">especially when we're talking about new frameworks and new techniques. New frameworks create</span> <span data-start="1382.98" data-end="1388.21">new attack vectors, but we have the fact that the same overarching defence of strategies</span> <span data-start="1388.21" data-end="1395.669">can still be used to mitigate the old, the new issues that arise.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1395.669" data-end="1402.01">So with that I would just like to introduce, we have developed a full JavaScript vulnerable</span> <span data-start="1402.01" data-end="1408.809">application here thank you to Ken Toller who is a colleague of mine who worked on this</span> <span data-start="1408.809" data-end="1414.529">project, you guys can check out the Github right here, it's something that you can use</span> <span data-start="1414.529" data-end="1418.82">to practice hacking on. It's vulnerable to a lot of things not just cross-site scripting</span> <span data-start="1418.82" data-end="1424.32">so you can Tweet about it, you can submit issues for things you would like to see but</span> <span data-start="1424.32" data-end="1429.76">it's a really cool project. I like to thank my mentor who basically have taught me everything</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1429.76" data-end="1437.279">I know about security, Jack, Tim and Michael, and as far as further training is concerned</span> <span data-start="1437.279" data-end="1441.24">here are a bunch of links, you guys can use to learn more about cross-site scripting,</span> <span data-start="1441.24" data-end="1447.289">a fun fact is that the Google cross-site scripting game which we have here was actually developed</span> <span data-start="1447.289" data-end="1453.48">by our next speaker, Artur Jank. He will be giving an incredible talk about some more</span> <span data-start="1453.48" data-end="1458.2">cross-site scripting you find in Angular, I hope you guys will stick round for that.</span> <span data-start="1458.2" data-end="1464.789">Thank you very much. If you have any questions, feel free to hit me up on Twitter, or contact</span> </p>
