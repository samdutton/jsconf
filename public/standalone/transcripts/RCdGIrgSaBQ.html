<p><span data-start="5.86" data-end="6.97">Thank you so much.</span> <span data-start="6.97" data-end="12.79">It's fantastic to be here, and I also just really want to thank Trent and Whitney, and</span> <span data-start="12.79" data-end="17.75">all the organisers who helped me out this morning so that I can be here on this stage,</span> <span data-start="17.75" data-end="23.1">and it's an excitement to get to close out CSSconf, because the last time I was here</span> <span data-start="23.1" data-end="28.14">on the stage, I was giving a talk which was really a call to action.</span> <span data-start="28.14" data-end="34.5">In some ways, I see this talk as perhaps a part 2 of that, or, if you haven't seen it,</span> <span data-start="34.5" data-end="38.15">answering some of the questions that I proposed at the end.</span> <span data-start="38.15" data-end="43.75">I'm going to talk about design systems but not in the normal sense we're used to hearing</span> <span data-start="43.75" data-end="50.05">about design systems, I want to talk about it through the lens of facilitation.</span> <span data-start="50.05" data-end="55.64">This is marrying two things that I love: one, design systems, and the second thing I've</span> <span data-start="55.64" data-end="60.17">come to fall in love with in the last couple of years is this topic of facilitation.</span> <span data-start="60.17" data-end="66.68">What I hope to do for you today is introduce facilitation and to show you how it is actually</span> <span data-start="66.68" data-end="73.47">an incredible and really powerful tool, and how our design systems really, although we</span> <span data-start="73.47" data-end="79.71">build them to establish consistency across our products, are actually acting as facilitators</span> <span data-start="79.71" data-end="82.3">within our organisations.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="82.3" data-end="87.58">And how this is super instrumental in , and I see is it one of the first key steps in</span> <span data-start="87.58" data-end="94.32">helping to transform our educational structures, and helping us build resilient teams as well</span> <span data-start="94.32" data-end="96.52">as products.</span> <span data-start="96.52" data-end="106.63">This is a neat facilitation tool.</span> <span data-start="106.63" data-end="112.61">You can enter the code CSS EU, and you can leave questions and upvote other people's</span> <span data-start="112.61" data-end="113.61">questions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="113.61" data-end="116.1">If I have enough time at the end, I will take a look at them.</span> <span data-start="116.1" data-end="120.23">If we don't get a look to them, this is a great starting point to find me afterwards.</span> <span data-start="120.23" data-end="123.3">Discuss and debate, tell me what you liked and didn't like.</span> <span data-start="123.3" data-end="129.08">That's what we are hear for at this conference, and that's one of the greatest reasons I believe</span> <span data-start="129.08" data-end="131.39">to gather.</span> <span data-start="131.39" data-end="138.86">As I started working on this talk, I came across this talk.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="138.86" data-end="147.87">This is how I had to start this because this is getting at the core of my trajectory in</span> <span data-start="147.87" data-end="150.79">my life and how I got to come to this point of interest.</span> <span data-start="150.79" data-end="155.66">This is really true for me: the older I get, or the longer I've been working in tech, the</span> <span data-start="155.66" data-end="161.36">more every problem seems to be a matter of getting humans to work together effectively,</span> <span data-start="161.36" data-end="164.55">and it is actually not about the tech itself.</span> <span data-start="164.55" data-end="171.01">So I started out at the beginning coding, heads down, member of a team, and through</span> <span data-start="171.01" data-end="176.28">my almost 12 years, I got to the point where I was building teams, and thinking about the</span> <span data-start="176.28" data-end="178.12">other people on my team.</span> <span data-start="178.12" data-end="181.8">And to the only thinking about the people on my team, but thinking about how we interacted</span> <span data-start="181.8" data-end="185.27">with other parts of the organisation.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="185.27" data-end="189.489">And this really drove home to me, because this is exactly what I would encounter.</span> <span data-start="189.489" data-end="195.15">It didn't matter how great my codebase was, at the end of the day, if the members of the</span> <span data-start="195.15" data-end="201.319">team, if we couldn't communicate effectively, then the process wasn't great and our products</span> <span data-start="201.319" data-end="204">weren't great at the end.</span> <span data-start="204" data-end="209.12">So this issue is actually what drove me to start to focus on organisations and structures,</span> <span data-start="209.12" data-end="215.129">and I know this is a conference about CSS, but, we work together as people, and we work</span> <span data-start="215.129" data-end="219.819">under organisations, and really, when I think about organisations, I view them as a place</span> <span data-start="219.819" data-end="224.02">which just interactions with human beings.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="224.02" data-end="230.319">This became the question that I've been driven by for the last year and a half: how do we</span> <span data-start="230.319" data-end="233.69">design our organisational structures for participation?</span> <span data-start="233.69" data-end="237.81">To actually allow for participation to happen?</span> <span data-start="237.81" data-end="243.5">And beyond that, how do we ensure that we have a balance of the bottom up with the top</span> <span data-start="243.5" data-end="244.5">down?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="244.5" data-end="248.549">And we don't end up with too much of the other?</span> <span data-start="248.549" data-end="251.72">And in comes to how we are going to work in our organisations.</span> <span data-start="251.72" data-end="256.92">Because, if we don't, our products aren't going to be as great.</span> <span data-start="256.92" data-end="263.46">And so, while I'm still writing CSS I assure you — and JavaScript — I'm also doing a lot</span> <span data-start="263.46" data-end="264.59">of other things.</span> <span data-start="264.59" data-end="270.43">I'm learning a lot about ethnography and research, and, to answer this question, I want to share</span> <span data-start="270.43" data-end="275.81">a story with you, and this is a story that, for me, really married my call twin-tracks</span> <span data-start="275.81" data-end="281.229">to action on my last talk which was really let's think about the human layer of what</span> <span data-start="281.229" data-end="282.229">we are doing, right?</span> <span data-start="282.229" data-end="288.71">Let's day about the collaboration and what our tools are enabling.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="288.71" data-end="296.389">So finning out about what happened in Taiwan and the history of Taiwan became this really</span> <span data-start="296.389" data-end="297.509">big revelation for me.</span> <span data-start="297.509" data-end="302.35">If you don't mind, I'm going to tell you a little bit about Taiwan.</span> <span data-start="302.35" data-end="308.8">In 2014, there was an occupation in Taiwan, called the Sun Flower Movement.</span> <span data-start="308.8" data-end="309.8">The.</span> <span data-start="309.8" data-end="314.909">The government of tie would be tried to pass a loafed-door deal with China.</span> <span data-start="314.909" data-end="321.21">There was a great media org called watch-out starting to live broadcast the events of the</span> <span data-start="321.21" data-end="322.47">proceeding.</span> <span data-start="322.47" data-end="327.81">When they found out, this news got on the internet, and, in less than five minutes,</span> <span data-start="327.81" data-end="332.789">students and citizens of Taiwan, decided to occupy their parliament.</span> <span data-start="332.789" data-end="338.419">This is like the US occupying the White House in Europe, occupying just the biggest seat</span> <span data-start="338.419" data-end="341.839">of government that you could find.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="341.839" data-end="348.189">And they barricaded it and sets themselves up there, and they were there for over a month.</span> <span data-start="348.189" data-end="352.74">It wasn't mayhem, it wasn't as if they weren't accomplishing anything.</span> <span data-start="352.74" data-end="358.12">They actually were leading a non-violent occupation, and one of the most most interesting things</span> <span data-start="358.12" data-end="361.9">is they showed the government how they wanted the government to respond.</span> <span data-start="361.9" data-end="367.949">They set up live streaming infrastructure, they held debates and discussions in the streets,</span> <span data-start="367.949" data-end="383.129">and this is powered by their civic [sound distort ed].</span> <span data-start="383.129" data-end="384.649">And it did lead to change.</span> <span data-start="384.649" data-end="390.93">The government was so embarrassed by what happened, that they invited one of the members</span> <span data-start="390.93" data-end="396.18">from the civic community to enter government.</span> <span data-start="396.18" data-end="403.059">[Sound distorted].</span> <span data-start="403.059" data-end="409.56">This is to me the ultimate marriage of the bottom-up power with the topdown, or the bottom-up</span> <span data-start="409.56" data-end="410.699">with the top-down power.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="410.699" data-end="415.669">They are using this legislation to do things, for example, to regulate what to do about</span> <span data-start="415.669" data-end="420.74">Uber, instead of London trying to shut it down, they took it into suggestion.</span> <span data-start="420.74" data-end="427.58">They used it to figure out what to do about air B and N — Airbnb and regulate most net</span> <span data-start="427.58" data-end="429.419">laws.</span> <span data-start="429.419" data-end="434.499">I went digging and thought there must be some amazing piece of technological piece of software</span> <span data-start="434.499" data-end="436.929">behind this, and there wasn't.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="436.929" data-end="444.969">There was a simple facilitation method, called the focus conversation method — objective,</span> <span data-start="444.969" data-end="449.59">reflective, interpretative, and decisional.</span> <span data-start="449.59" data-end="455.27">I've named this to something simple: it starts with finding facts.</span> <span data-start="455.27" data-end="457.43">We need to be clear about what those facts are.</span> <span data-start="457.43" data-end="461.36">Along with the facts, it is okay, we need to sort out the feelings.</span> <span data-start="461.36" data-end="466.9">What do people feel about in stuff?</span> <span data-start="466.9" data-end="473.61">Then, I think this is a wonderful framework to consider what you're design systems are</span> <span data-start="473.61" data-end="480.639">doing and how to go about building them in a way that doesn't lead to issues of rejection,</span> <span data-start="480.639" data-end="483.009">even though I will show you how that is a part of it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="483.009" data-end="487.629">So if we think about our design systems and we start gathering our facts, the first thing</span> <span data-start="487.629" data-end="489.909">we want to do is find out what currently exists?</span> <span data-start="489.909" data-end="491.889">Who are the stakeholders?</span> <span data-start="491.889" data-end="494.879">What is out there in our organisations that we can build off of?</span> <span data-start="494.879" data-end="497.669">Then need to find the feelings.</span> <span data-start="497.669" data-end="500.099">This is a really important one.</span> <span data-start="500.099" data-end="504.709">And one where you're probably going to get a lot of emotions, but if you working on the</span> <span data-start="504.709" data-end="509.289">design system are approaching this as an idea of I am facilitating, I'm listening, then</span> <span data-start="509.289" data-end="511.27">you can kind of step back.</span> <span data-start="511.27" data-end="513.62">We shush asking people how we think this should work.</span> <span data-start="513.62" data-end="518.419">This is a time to ask people their feelings about naming or how we should organise stuff.</span> <span data-start="518.419" data-end="520.649">Let's get the feelings out.</span> <span data-start="520.649" data-end="525.24">How do people feel about our existing design system if we had one, or existing attempt</span> <span data-start="525.24" data-end="526.269">to make one.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="526.269" data-end="527.269">What worked?</span> <span data-start="527.269" data-end="528.269">What, did not?</span> <span data-start="528.269" data-end="531.96">Once we get to this, we can generate ideas.</span> <span data-start="531.96" data-end="534.029">What is this tooling going to be?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="534.029" data-end="536.04">How is it going to work?</span> <span data-start="536.04" data-end="539.36">How will the team begin to interact with it?</span> <span data-start="539.36" data-end="543.92">Then we can document our decisions, and we should document our decisions, and they should</span> <span data-start="543.92" data-end="550.259">point back to the whole process so people can see why we made the choices that we made.</span> <span data-start="550.259" data-end="553.51">And we should be transparent.</span> <span data-start="553.51" data-end="559">So at the end of the day, facilitation is doing is really making an action or process</span> <span data-start="559" data-end="560">easier.</span> <span data-start="560" data-end="562.75">Our design systems do this, right?</span> <span data-start="562.75" data-end="565.14">They make coding easier.</span> <span data-start="565.14" data-end="567.209">You don't have to repeat the same code.</span> <span data-start="567.209" data-end="572.18">Ideally, if they are well documented, they help you find answers, the questions that</span> <span data-start="572.18" data-end="576.68">you may have, so you don't have to implement it.</span> <span data-start="576.68" data-end="583.19">And so, a facilitator is the person that is in charge of sort of designing this process,</span> <span data-start="583.19" data-end="589.31">and they think a lot about what things can they do all along the way to make the action</span> <span data-start="589.31" data-end="595.759">or the whole journey much easier?</span> <span data-start="595.759" data-end="606.509">We're trying to make design easier, coherent, less opaque.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="606.509" data-end="612.16">Our design practices that we are really using are designed to help make our processes a</span> <span data-start="612.16" data-end="620.19">lot easier, and to help us arrive at this point of shared understanding.</span> <span data-start="620.19" data-end="624.67">Stephanie Hughes has a great video called Architecting Interaction.</span> <span data-start="624.67" data-end="629.449">She's an architect but takes things from a systems point of view, and she says facilitating</span> <span data-start="629.449" data-end="634.06">is about creating contexts that are incomplete, right?</span> <span data-start="634.06" data-end="636.139">They're not quite finished.</span> <span data-start="636.139" data-end="637.37">Think about our design systems.</span> <span data-start="637.37" data-end="639.5">They are never quite finished.</span> <span data-start="639.5" data-end="640.63">That's okay.</span> <span data-start="640.63" data-end="645.37">Also, they're impermanent, which means they're going to change.</span> <span data-start="645.37" data-end="647.189">That's also okay.</span> <span data-start="647.189" data-end="649.17">Lastly, they're imperfect.</span> <span data-start="649.17" data-end="656.269">And I don't know about you, but every design system that I've built is pretty imperfect,</span> <span data-start="656.269" data-end="657.85">although while it gets the job done.</span> <span data-start="657.85" data-end="664.12">The way I like to think about this is each stage of our design system is facilitating</span> <span data-start="664.12" data-end="670.629">a context and it's creating an environment, and this is the environment where we can get</span> <span data-start="670.629" data-end="673.23">things done as people, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="673.23" data-end="678.68">That environment is helping us achieve a sense of shared understanding for that moment so</span> <span data-start="678.68" data-end="681.6">that we can move forward and make another decision.</span> <span data-start="681.6" data-end="686.73">This is a cyclical thing that we work through on our design system.</span> <span data-start="686.73" data-end="688.98">Where we start is not where we will end up.</span> <span data-start="688.98" data-end="697.029">Constantly, we are thinking about creating these environments that allow for conversation,</span> <span data-start="697.029" data-end="701.91">and allow for us to get to a point of shared understanding to take the next step forward.</span> <span data-start="701.91" data-end="706.68">So, really, what we are doing is designing the context for interactions.</span> <span data-start="706.68" data-end="710.62">I think about our design system this one level up and we think about help in the place of</span> <span data-start="710.62" data-end="716.23">our organisations, they're designing those interactions, the interactions that we have</span> <span data-start="716.23" data-end="722.399">between people in different departments, right?</span> <span data-start="722.399" data-end="728.209">This is another great talk by Jess Clark, and I highly recommend it: evolving your design</span> <span data-start="728.209" data-end="730.321">system, people, product, and process.</span> <span data-start="730.321" data-end="735.079">She talks about the different stages that the linked linked design system — Linked In</span> <span data-start="735.079" data-end="737.139">design system went through.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="880.18" data-end="884.41">When I think about this in the context of our organisations, I'm thinking about this</span> <span data-start="884.41" data-end="891.3">issue where we often have these org charts, in command-and-control pattern, even though</span> <span data-start="891.3" data-end="892.899">the universe doesn't work that way.</span> <span data-start="892.899" data-end="896.99">The universe is like this more collaborative, decentralised network.</span> <span data-start="896.99" data-end="902.93">Furthermore, what is challenging is our design systems are about the collaborative network,</span> <span data-start="902.93" data-end="909.959">and we are trying to get to that while we are existing in this extremely centralised</span> <span data-start="909.959" data-end="910.959">model.</span> <span data-start="910.959" data-end="917.939">So perhaps, to me, one of the most powerful things that our design systems do when introduced</span> <span data-start="917.939" data-end="922.8">into an organisation, is they become one of the first manifestations of a team that is</span> <span data-start="922.8" data-end="925.959">trying to work across all of these silos.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="925.959" data-end="929.839">Face it, that is really hard.</span> <span data-start="929.839" data-end="933.54">Because our structures aren't set up for that.</span> <span data-start="933.54" data-end="936.519">So you're doing an amazing job to keep pushing this through.</span> <span data-start="936.519" data-end="941.759">These are two articles that came out a couple of years ago, one is by Nathan Curtis, and</span> <span data-start="941.759" data-end="947.91">another is a response by Gina, and Nathan is looking at various models how to scale</span> <span data-start="947.91" data-end="949.16">a design system.</span> <span data-start="949.16" data-end="950.189">He talks about three.</span> <span data-start="950.189" data-end="955.93">He says there is this solitary Over Lord model, that there is one person that makes the design</span> <span data-start="955.93" data-end="962.19">system, he's super excited and focused on his team's needs — I was that person for a</span> <span data-start="962.19" data-end="963.19">while.</span> <span data-start="963.19" data-end="964.92">It's easy to be that to learn person if you punish this forward.</span> <span data-start="964.92" data-end="970.88">There's a centralised pattern which is a single central design them that produces and supports</span> <span data-start="970.88" data-end="975.309">the system and everyone else is using it; and there is a concept of a federal pattern</span> <span data-start="975.309" data-end="982.199">where multiple members of the team decide on the system together.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="982.199" data-end="990.85">While it's always best to aim for a cross-functional team where we are really pulling the people</span> <span data-start="990.85" data-end="995.449">that we need from different departments to make our design testimonies, I think if we</span> <span data-start="995.449" data-end="1002.54">take this idea of a design system as a facilitator, it is also okay happens to be if you're that</span> <span data-start="1002.54" data-end="1007.399">solitary person working on your design system.</span> <span data-start="1007.399" data-end="1015.42">What that means is that you need to design all of your processes to be incredibly open,</span> <span data-start="1015.42" data-end="1021.529">and to go out into the organisation and to find out what the people actually need, so</span> <span data-start="1021.529" data-end="1027.059">you're going to be not only the developer of the design system but a UX reserver team</span> <span data-start="1027.059" data-end="1033.069">of one, which is really hard, but that is a way to get started, and I believe by doing</span> <span data-start="1033.069" data-end="1038.439">that, you won't end up with a design system that fees like an over-Lord because the process</span> <span data-start="1038.439" data-end="1046.07">by which you designed it was more of a facilitatory process.</span> <span data-start="1046.07" data-end="1052.87">Because our organisational systems aren't set up for design systems and a lot of battle</span> <span data-start="1052.87" data-end="1058.19">of the design system is to get that buy-in so you can make your cross-functional team,</span> <span data-start="1058.19" data-end="1062.9">resistance and chaos are always going to be a part of the process.</span> <span data-start="1062.9" data-end="1065.559">We just must embrace it now.</span> <span data-start="1065.559" data-end="1067.36">All right?</span> <span data-start="1067.36" data-end="1075.08">If we can embrace this, we can also get out of it, and see how we can help facilitate</span> <span data-start="1075.08" data-end="1080.14">the processes to make this more manageable.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1080.14" data-end="1085.299">So here are two, I'm going to share two design models.</span> <span data-start="1085.299" data-end="1091.5">This is the Double Diamond design model which states as you start with a problem, you will</span> <span data-start="1091.5" data-end="1095.51">have divergent thinking, and then eventually going to define it and converge.</span> <span data-start="1095.51" data-end="1101.69">Then of you you're going to have an answer, and, again was as you generate ideas, you</span> <span data-start="1101.69" data-end="1107.37">get divergent thinking, and, as you start to test them, you're going to converge.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1107.37" data-end="1112.48">I view this as something to accept, right?</span> <span data-start="1112.48" data-end="1118.02">This might feel really chaotic to people that why do we have so much divergent thinking</span> <span data-start="1118.02" data-end="1119.02">again?</span> <span data-start="1119.02" data-end="1121.63">Can't we just all agree?</span> <span data-start="1121.63" data-end="1123.41">It's okay.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1123.41" data-end="1126.41">It's totally part of the process.</span> <span data-start="1126.41" data-end="1132.06">I think that, if we can make this clear too as facilitators, as people here to guide members</span> <span data-start="1132.06" data-end="1139.01">of our orgs through this, it helps them understand that there will be a solution at the end.</span> <span data-start="1139.01" data-end="1147.279">The other model I recently came into and wanted to share because it really helped me just</span> <span data-start="1147.279" data-end="1153.149">become Zen with chaos and resistance in organisations is this change model.</span> <span data-start="1153.149" data-end="1159.07">This comes from family therapy.</span> <span data-start="1159.07" data-end="1164.7">In our organisations, we've got this status quo, and we have to introduce we've got to</span> <span data-start="1164.7" data-end="1165.88">change.</span> <span data-start="1165.88" data-end="1167.97">This foreign element comes into play.</span> <span data-start="1167.97" data-end="1173.45">In this case, our foreign element is the design system, and the design system team.</span> <span data-start="1173.45" data-end="1178.279">As soon as any foreign element is introduced into the existing system, it's a period of</span> <span data-start="1178.279" data-end="1179.89">chaos.</span> <span data-start="1179.89" data-end="1182.419">It's absolute chaos.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1182.419" data-end="1187.179">People become emotional, they have their own feelings, they don't want to use it, they</span> <span data-start="1187.179" data-end="1193.97">say it was better the way it was before, you're constantly fighting, until suddenly this thing</span> <span data-start="1193.97" data-end="1199.23">starts to take root, and you can see this transformation into an idea, and eventually,</span> <span data-start="1199.23" data-end="1203.53">we get, it becomes part of our practice, and we integrate it, and then we end up at a new</span> <span data-start="1203.53" data-end="1204.53">level.</span> <span data-start="1204.53" data-end="1212.66">We're at this new level until the next northern element enters, and we begin this again.</span> <span data-start="1212.66" data-end="1221.22">So, ask we are building design systems, if we can really think about ways to facilitate</span> <span data-start="1221.22" data-end="1228.95">that way through chaos, and this is part of why taking on these facilitation models by</span> <span data-start="1228.95" data-end="1233.799">talking to people and not being in our solitary teams, by finding out how they're feeling</span> <span data-start="1233.799" data-end="1241.82">about stuff, really helps us make our way through the change model.</span> <span data-start="1241.82" data-end="1250.47">So, really, what we should be focusing on is the outcomes in our design systems, and</span> <span data-start="1250.47" data-end="1252.51">not the outputs.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1252.51" data-end="1255.559">Because the outcomes are actually what drive impact.</span> <span data-start="1255.559" data-end="1260.87">And the outputs and the design system I like to think about as the components, right?</span> <span data-start="1260.87" data-end="1264.279">And so you might want to have a design system that has tons of outputs.</span> <span data-start="1264.279" data-end="1269.84">You've covered all the possible component patterns, you did it, everything is in the</span> <span data-start="1269.84" data-end="1272.59">system, hurrah.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1272.59" data-end="1274.76">But that's not going to be great.</span> <span data-start="1274.76" data-end="1280.84">Because, in taking that approach, in order to do that, you might find yourself trampling</span> <span data-start="1280.84" data-end="1282.409">over people.</span> <span data-start="1282.409" data-end="1289.12">So, if we focus more on what we are hoping these things will do in our organisation,</span> <span data-start="1289.12" data-end="1297.24">such as facilitate conversation, be that spark of interaction, I think that we can design,</span> <span data-start="1297.24" data-end="1303.37">it will help us design these better systems.</span> <span data-start="1303.37" data-end="1309.25">And is to, it is really about building as much as we need when we need it.</span> <span data-start="1309.25" data-end="1314.201">What I want to say here is please don't be embarrassed about your design systems if your</span> <span data-start="1314.201" data-end="1320.82">design system is a PDF, or if your design system is a sketch file, or if your design</span> <span data-start="1320.82" data-end="1324.34">system has red line marks on it.</span> <span data-start="1324.34" data-end="1330.13">Please don't be embarrassed if your design system isn't in a fancy repo and has all these</span> <span data-start="1330.13" data-end="1333.96">amazing components that you can import.</span> <span data-start="1333.96" data-end="1338.73">You were build what you needed for that moment in time, right?</span> <span data-start="1338.73" data-end="1342.55">You were trying to focus on that outcome.</span> <span data-start="1342.55" data-end="1347.09">Starting with a PDF might get you to a point where you designed a context where at least</span> <span data-start="1347.09" data-end="1351.02">you can have discussions, and that's the what matters.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1351.02" data-end="1357.269">In the next stage, you can think about evolving it to meet the needs of your team.</span> <span data-start="1357.269" data-end="1364.299">So really, again, I cannot stress, focus on those outcomes, really assess your teams,</span> <span data-start="1364.299" data-end="1366.98">and determine what it is that you need.</span> <span data-start="1366.98" data-end="1372.71">A lot times within I really think that it is about communication and talking, and breaking</span> <span data-start="1372.71" data-end="1377.59">down those silos and the human-to-human interactions.</span> <span data-start="1377.59" data-end="1384.73">Really, when we think about designing sustainably and designing sustainable systems, it is about</span> <span data-start="1384.73" data-end="1389.36">facilitating a process which is what we are doing with our design systems.</span> <span data-start="1389.36" data-end="1394.059">We're empowering that system to deal with change.</span> <span data-start="1394.059" data-end="1400.519">This is what makes it proactive and more resilient, and able to anticipate the futures of what</span> <span data-start="1400.519" data-end="1404.71">will come.</span> <span data-start="1404.71" data-end="1411.71">In another model, it's called the viable system model, he talks about this concept of autopoeisis,</span> <span data-start="1411.71" data-end="1418.029">which is the idea that a system has everything inside of it to better itself and to get better</span> <span data-start="1418.029" data-end="1423.29">- in our body, this is the mitochondria.</span> <span data-start="1423.29" data-end="1432.23">If our design systems are facilitators, I like to think we designed this context, and</span> <span data-start="1432.23" data-end="1438.779">we have a collection of processes that we can constantly use, and employ to help our</span> <span data-start="1438.779" data-end="1440.23">design systems grow.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1440.23" data-end="1448.32">So, for me, it goes back to that focus conversation method and remembering to listen, and also</span> <span data-start="1448.32" data-end="1454.23">remembering that we are doing is looking to create these incomplete, these impermanent,</span> <span data-start="1454.23" data-end="1458.76">and these imperfect structures because that is setting up the first environment and the</span> <span data-start="1458.76" data-end="1462.419">first context for our discussions.</span> <span data-start="1462.419" data-end="1467.679">And so lastly, I want to leave you with a quote from one of my favourite heroes, this</span> <span data-start="1467.679" data-end="1474.73">is Audrey Tang, currently the digital minister in Taiwan and rub the V Taiwan process.</span> </p>
