data-start="1167.899" data-end="1169.759">let's say we have these two buttons</span> <span data-start="1169.759" data-end="1173.529">right and the buttons we can use them to</span> <span data-start="1173.529" data-end="1176.599">we can use them to make the ball go left</span> <span data-start="1176.599" data-end="1178.25">and right right</span> <span data-start="1178.25" data-end="1181.25">so let's imagine that each time we click</span> <span data-start="1181.25" data-end="1183.289">on one of these buttons it's an</span> <span data-start="1183.289" data-end="1186.35">observable right and so we have our left</span> <span data-start="1186.35" data-end="1187.73">button clicks and a right button clicks</span> <span data-start="1187.73" data-end="1190.159">and if I click on the right button you</span> <span data-start="1190.159" data-end="1192.11">we can imagine that we would get a quick</span> <span data-start="1192.11" data-end="1195.59">right so then what if we take each right</span> <span data-start="1195.59" data-end="1197.45">button click and translate it to the</span> <span data-start="1197.45" data-end="1199.73">string right and each left button click</span> <span data-start="1199.73" data-end="1201.26">and translate it to the string left</span> <span data-start="1201.26" data-end="1205.46">right so now if I quick it becomes right</span> <span data-start="1205.46" data-end="1207.59">and if I could if I click left it</span> <span data-start="1207.59" data-end="1211.64">becomes left so then let's now further</span> <span data-start="1211.64" data-end="1213.5">imagine that we make an observable that</span> <span data-start="1213.5" data-end="1215.24">uses the left click position in the</span> <span data-start="1215.24" data-end="1217.37">right position and just takes whatever</span> <span data-start="1217.37" data-end="1220.49">the last the last one to admit is so now</span> <span data-start="1220.49" data-end="1222.65">we have like a left click a left click</span> <span data-start="1222.65" data-end="1225.2">and a left click so the position is left</span> <span data-start="1225.2" data-end="1227.21">and if we had a right click then the</span> <span data-start="1227.21" data-end="1229.22">position is right so you can see that</span> <span data-start="1229.22" data-end="1231.44">basically by doing this the position is</span> <span data-start="1231.44" data-end="1233.6">now an observable of the correct</span> <span data-start="1233.6" data-end="1236.15">position for the ball to be in right now</span> <span data-start="1236.15" data-end="1237.86">the actual animation in this case is</span> <span data-start="1237.86" data-end="1240.08">being done with this library called pose</span> <span data-start="1240.08" data-end="1243.169">but um you can you could I met but it's</span> <span data-start="1243.169" data-end="1246.35">not that complicated to do so um how</span> <span data-start="1246.35" data-end="1248.09">this actually works in code and here's</span> <span data-start="1248.09" data-end="1249.44">where we're gonna introduce the library</span> <span data-start="1249.44" data-end="1251.33">that I that we used to do reactive</span> <span data-start="1251.33" data-end="1254.03">programming in JavaScript it's called rx</span> <span data-start="1254.03" data-end="1256.85">yes and we have two functions here to</span> <span

data-end="1282.77">here you have like a left button and a</span> <span data-start="1282.77" data-end="1285.409">right button that are we just looked up</span> <span data-start="1285.409" data-end="1286.909">from the Dom and then we've made an</span> <span data-start="1286.909" data-end="1290.09">event stream of both of their clicks and</span> <span data-start="1290.09" data-end="1293.9">then this is actually mapping each one</span> <span data-start="1293.9" data-end="1297.289">from a quick to a string and in actual</span> <span data-start="1297.289" data-end="1300.77">rxjs code we use this pipe operator and</span> <span data-start="1300.77" data-end="1302.539">then we put our different operations in</span> <span data-start="1302.539" data-end="1303.71">the middle and the cool thing about that</span> <span data-start="1303.71" data-end="1305.63">is you can do multiple of them so here</span> <span data-start="1305.63" data-end="1308.84">we're piping left the left and right to</span> <span data-start="1308.84" data-end="1311.15">position oh sorry</span> <span data-start="1311.15" data-end="1313.4">and then finally

<span data-start="1918.62" data-end="1920.33">model is just a higher-order component</span> <span data-start="1920.33" data-end="1923.36">that takes your view model and binds it</span> <span data-start="1923.36" data-end="1926.45">to your regular components so now this</span> <span data-start="1926.45" data-end="1927.95">component anytime the positions</span> <span data-start="1927.95" data-end="1930.92">observable updates it will rerender with</span> <span data-start="1930.92" data-end="1932.72">a new position prop and you can do the</span> <span data-start="1932.72" data-end="1937.04">same thing actually for for events you</span> <span data-start="1937.04" data-end="1938.69">can you you have these things called</span> <span data-start="1938.69" data-end="1941.63">outputs and it for an output each value</span> <span data-start="1941.63" data-end="1944.6">here is some kind of is a special type</span> <span data-start="1944.6" data-end="1946.19">of observable called a subject and you</span> <span data-start="1946.19" data-end="1948.98">saw those in the slide earlier and</span> <span data-start="1948.98" data-end="1952.34">essentially it converts it from so this</span> <span data-start="1952.34" data-end="1954.53">subject the left click subject you will</span> <span data-start="1954.53" data-end="1956.3">get in your component you'll get a</span> <span data-start="1956.3" data-end="1958.7">property called on click which is itself</span> <span data-start="1958.7" data-end="1961.58">a function that when you call will put a</span> <span data-start="1961.58" data-end="1964.25">new value on to this on click observable</span> <span data-start="1964.25" data-end="1966.77">and omit it right so this basically it</span> <span data-start="1966.77" data-end="1969.17">converts from an observable emitting of</span> <span data-start="1969.17" data-end="1971.97">a from a function to an emission</span> <span data-start="1971.97" data-end="1974.519">an event on an observable you can</span> <span data-start="1974.519" data-end="1976.529">actually and and actually you can do</span> <span data-start="1976.529" data-end="1978.57">pretty complicated stuff pretty easily</span> <span data-start="1978.57" data-end="1980.82">this is this right here is the code for</span> <span data-start="1980.82" data-end="1983.46">that entire login form that I showed you</span> <span data-start="1983.46" data-end="1985.289">a second ago we have our username and</span> <span data-start="1985.289" data-end="1988.32">our password as inputs log you know our</span> <span data-start="1988.32" data-end="1990.389">login and progress state our login</span> <span data-start="1990.389" data-end="1993.539">failure messages and then we have we</span> <span data-start="1993.539" data-end="1995.549">also have a username and password change</span> <span data-start="1995.549" data-end="1996.99">which are the outgoing and this has to</span> <span data-start="1996.99" data-end="1998.759">do with the way that react does inputs</span> <span data-start="1998.759" data-end="2000.23">where you have to both like send it the</span> <span data-start="2000.23" data-end="2001.909">new value and read the events if you</span> <span data-start="2001.909" data-end="2003.379">want to do a controlled input and you</span> <span data-start="2003.379" data-end="2004.7">have a submit button and that's all</span> <span data-start="2004.7" data-end="2007.129">that's needed to connect that login form</span> <span data-start="2007.129" data-end="2009.919">um so now we come to the final portion</span> <span data-start="2009.919" data-end="2011.929">of this talk which is called the used</span> <span data-start="2011.929" data-end="2013.37">car sales portion because I'm gonna go</span> <span data-start="2013.37" data-end="2015.049">very quickly through all the amazing</span> <span data-start="2015.049" data-end="2017.029">cool things you get when you use RX</span> <span data-start="2017.029" data-end="2018.83">react if you act now</span> <span data-start="2018.83" data-end="2023.179">so one thing it has is these view model</span> <span data-start="2023.179" data-end="2024.649">factories like let's say you want to</span> <span data-start="2024.649" data-end="2028.159">change the observables based on the</span> <span data-start="2028.159" data-end="2030.799">props external to the component changing</span> <span data-start="2030.799" data-end="2032.899">well so you can use a view model Factory</span> <span data-start="2032.899" data-end="2035.57">to do that and that you use the same</span> <span data-start="2035.57" data-end="2037.61">function the with view model and you're</span> <span data-start="2037.61" data-end="2039.5">probably wondering but what about tight</span> <span data-start="2039.5" data-end="2042.59">script because you care about your stuff</span> <span data-start="2042.59" data-end="2044.779">not breaking you are concerned about the</span> <span data-start="2044.779" data-end="2048.139">security of your so the good news</span> <span data-start="2048.139" data-end="2050.659">is that rx react is written in tight</span> <span data-start="2050.659" data-end="2053.05">script cuz I love tight script too and</span> <span data-start="2053.05" data-end="2055.73">it actually has here I'm not gonna get</span> <span data-start="2055.73" data-end="2057.139">into it but if you're in tight script it</span> <span data-start="2057.139" data-end="2058.94">has really awesome type checking where</span> <span data-start="2058.94" data-end="2061.099">like all the props have to line up and</span> <span data-start="2061.099" data-end="2062.659">all the observables have to line up and</span> <span data-start="2062.659" data-end="2064.73">like you won't mess up and whatnot</span> <span data-start="2064.73" data-end="2068.54">or so I claim what if you're like I like</span> <span data-start="2068.54" data-end="2071.3">observables but I also like reducers um</span> <span data-start="2071.3" data-end="2073.159">cuz they're very hot right now well what</span> <span data-start="2073.159" data-end="2076.49">if you could write a view model based on</span> <span data-start="2076.49" data-end="2079.369">a reducer function similar to sort of</span> <span data-start="2079.369" data-end="2081.5">the syntax of reason ml which is</span> </p>
