<span data-start="855.11" data-end="857.33">and this is what we use to make it look</span> <span data-start="857.33" data-end="859.49">like the Rays are flaring outward as</span> <span

data-end="878.24">be drawn outside of the canvas bounds</span> <span data-start="878.24" data-end="880.01">when we use our trigonometry functions</span> <span data-start="880.01" data-end="882.14">to

data-end="904.4">it'll kind of adjust a little bit and</span> <span data-start="904.4" data-end="907.13">now it's time to get drawing so first we</span> <span data-start="907.13" data-end="908.81">set

<span data-start="933.59" data-end="934.67">decides okay we're going</span> <span data-start="934.67" data-end="936.95">do that we'll calculate the x and</span> <span data-start="936.95"
