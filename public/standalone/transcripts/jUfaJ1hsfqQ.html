<p><span data-start="71.5" data-end="75.36">Let's start talking about the buzzy thing of the moment, virtual reality.</span> <span data-start="75.36" data-end="79.66">When I think of virtual reality I find it a bit overwhelming.</span> <span data-start="79.66" data-end="84.44">At least in terms of the harder choices there is a wide gamut.</span> <span data-start="84.44" data-end="89.729">You have the phone and box model where you put your phone into Google card board and</span> <span data-start="89.729" data-end="90.74">play around with it.</span> <span data-start="90.74" data-end="102.009">At the highest end you have things like Vire and hardware to show you where you are in</span> <span data-start="102.009" data-end="106.35">the room and trackers for your hands, as well.</span> <span data-start="106.35" data-end="109.61">On the software side, there is a lot of excitement.</span> <span data-start="109.61" data-end="117.74">Games with PlayStation, videos on YouTube but none of these hit the mark and make me</span> <span data-start="117.74" data-end="120.46">think I really need to get a headset.</span> <span data-start="120.46" data-end="126.119">What is missing from the conversation is its potential for making art.</span> <span data-start="126.119" data-end="131.73">Most of the mediums of art we interact with have a lot of inherent restrictions.</span> <span data-start="131.73" data-end="134.68">There is only one given painting.</span> <span data-start="134.68" data-end="137.34">You cannot replicate or easy remix it.</span> <span data-start="137.34" data-end="141.79">For music and videos, you can duplicate them but it is ultimately a one-way street and</span> <span data-start="141.79" data-end="144.52">you cannot meaningful interact with them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="144.52" data-end="147.55">For video games, you can interact but you can't change them.</span> <span data-start="147.55" data-end="152.48">You are always playing within the confines of the game.</span> <span data-start="152.48" data-end="156.73">With VR, we reached a paradigm shift.</span> <span data-start="156.73" data-end="161.209">It is interactive.</span> <span data-start="161.209" data-end="165.599">But with VR there is a large opportunity for play and exploration especially with the ability</span> <span data-start="165.599" data-end="168.629">to remix other's work.</span> <span data-start="168.629" data-end="173.79">Because it is in its infancy we have the opportunity to make interesting things.</span> <span data-start="173.79" data-end="180.819">I would like to re-create an instillation piece by Yayoi Kusama called obliteration.</span> <span data-start="180.819" data-end="188.349">Yayoi Kusama is a Japanese artist and known for large scale sculptures and instillation</span> <span data-start="188.349" data-end="189.349">pieces.</span> <span data-start="189.349" data-end="196.69">Procedure her signature motif is polka dots.</span> <span data-start="196.69" data-end="197.849">This is in Singapore.</span> <span data-start="197.849" data-end="203.01">In the center, you will see a pair of heels with flowers coming out of them and that is</span> <span data-start="203.01" data-end="204.939">at San Francisco airport.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="204.939" data-end="209.93">And then you have the mannequins covered in wigs.</span> <span data-start="209.93" data-end="217.16">If you have been on Instagram you seen her work.</span> <span data-start="217.16" data-end="222.29">Infinity room is her most famous work.</span> <span data-start="222.29" data-end="228.44">It feels like you are suspended in space which is an interesting sensation.</span> <span data-start="228.44" data-end="231.08">The piece I would like to re-create is called obliteration room.</span> <span data-start="231.08" data-end="240.769">It is an all-white room and visitors are given stickers and invited to stick them all over</span> <span data-start="240.769" data-end="243.379">the room.</span> <span data-start="243.379" data-end="245.879">This piece is radically different.</span> <span data-start="245.879" data-end="250.98">With most art pieces, there is a divided line between the viewer and artist.</span> <span data-start="250.98" data-end="259.5">The artist is mentally separated by having to know a lot about the artist, piece itself</span> <span data-start="259.5" data-end="262.67">and historical context to understand it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="262.67" data-end="272.41">Even if the viewer is allowed to interact, it is not meaningfully changed as a result.</span> <span data-start="272.41" data-end="276.9">Obliteration breaks down the barrier between the artist and viewer.</span> <span data-start="276.9" data-end="282.02">The piece changes as the visitor interacts.</span> <span data-start="282.02" data-end="287.25">I found this striking because when was the last time you saw both parents and children</span> <span data-start="287.25" data-end="288.97">having fun in a museum together?</span> <span data-start="288.97" data-end="291.66">This piece is meant for everyone.</span> <span data-start="291.66" data-end="296.04">The young, old, and the everyday person.</span> <span data-start="296.04" data-end="299.04">This is what I meant by us reaching a paradigm shift with VR.</span> <span data-start="299.04" data-end="307.02">It is not like video games where it is interact but not meaningful changed through interaction.</span> <span data-start="307.02" data-end="312.22">It is like all these things and a new medium for us to play with.</span> <span data-start="312.22" data-end="316.94">As I thought about re-creating the obliteration room, I throughout about making it personal.</span> <span data-start="316.94" data-end="323.25">Instead of having to pay to go to museums to interact with an art piece, anyone could</span> <span data-start="323.25" data-end="326.49">come into my apartment and put stickers everywhere.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="326.49" data-end="330.69">The thought of making art more accessible to a larger group of people made it really</span> <span data-start="330.69" data-end="334.001">exciting to me.</span> <span data-start="334.001" data-end="337.04">To re-create this piece, we are going to use a framework called A-Frame.</span> <span data-start="337.04" data-end="340.42">First we will create an all-white scene with white furniture.</span> <span data-start="340.42" data-end="343.27">Then we will create stickers on the fly in the scene.</span> <span data-start="343.27" data-end="347.83">Then we will add an interaction and physics to the scene to make the stickers fly around</span> <span data-start="347.83" data-end="350.09">and stick to things.</span> <span data-start="350.09" data-end="357.4">A-Frame is a WebVR framework created by Mozilla build on top of Three.js.</span> <span data-start="357.4" data-end="364.78">It is easy to set-up and has syntax that you can declare A box in HTML and it will render</span> <span data-start="364.78" data-end="368.43">A box like you are seeing.</span> <span data-start="368.43" data-end="370.91">It is really powerful, too.</span> <span data-start="370.91" data-end="375.91">You can use it to create hypnotic visualizations like this with  â€”  which kind of look like</span> <span data-start="375.91" data-end="381.24">a '60s music video.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="381.24" data-end="385.77">And you can create interact games like this where for some reason you are shooting a bunch</span> <span data-start="385.77" data-end="393.08">of smiley faces flying around in space.</span> <span data-start="393.08" data-end="399.49">It supports the full range of devices from the phone in a box model to dedicated devices</span> <span data-start="399.49" data-end="404.26">like HCC vibe with positional trackers.</span> <span data-start="404.26" data-end="406.5">So, let's get started.</span> <span data-start="406.5" data-end="412.57">We will first create the scene for us to pour walls and furniture into it.</span> <span data-start="412.57" data-end="415.6">We can start by setting up a scene by declaring a scene at the top.</span> <span data-start="415.6" data-end="421.38">You will notice I am using pug instead of regular HTML and we will declare a scene at</span> <span data-start="421.38" data-end="433.38">the top and create the floor by declaring A-plane and the dividing wall with A-box.</span> <span data-start="433.38" data-end="436.15">Now that we have set-up the structure of the room let's start adding furniture.</span> <span data-start="436.15" data-end="442.71">For the demo, we can use Google Poly which is a library of 3D models.</span> <span data-start="442.71" data-end="448.63">You can download ones and remix them or create new ones yourself and update them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="448.63" data-end="457">You can find single models which is a snake that kind of looks like a boot Emoji which</span> <span data-start="457" data-end="463.28">is fun or you can find complex ones like this where it is a composite of many models.</span> <span data-start="463.28" data-end="473.33">You have a tree, campfire, sleeping bag, and a lot of things going on in this one.</span> <span data-start="473.33" data-end="477.581">For these 3D models you will notice you get two files instead of one.</span> <span data-start="477.581" data-end="483.06">One is the object file which represents the skeleton of the model, the physical shape</span> <span data-start="483.06" data-end="487.401">of the thing, and the other is the material file which represents the skin of the model</span> <span data-start="487.401" data-end="491.06">as in the materials and the colors of the thing.</span> <span data-start="491.06" data-end="496.98">In this example, one dining set is rendered with both object and material file and the</span> <span data-start="496.98" data-end="499.35">other one is rendered with just the object file.</span> <span data-start="499.35" data-end="505.8">So you can see here that the one that is rendered with just the object file is pure white which</span> <span data-start="505.8" data-end="506.8">is what we want.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="506.8" data-end="511.68">Since that is what we want, we will be rendering all models with just the object file instead</span> <span data-start="511.68" data-end="517.13">of both the object and material file.</span> <span data-start="517.13" data-end="521.26">To load these files into our scene, we will first need to use A-Frame's asset management</span> <span data-start="521.26" data-end="522.31">system.</span> <span data-start="522.31" data-end="531.26">A-frame preloads and caches 3 D models before rendering.</span> <span data-start="531.26" data-end="539.41">With the asset management system, we can store 3D models and audio and other things.</span> <span data-start="539.41" data-end="546.54">At the top we will be declaring A assets and for each object we want to load in we will</span> <span data-start="546.54" data-end="552.61">declare A-asset item and for each item giving it a unique ID we will use later in the scene</span> <span data-start="552.61" data-end="555.8">for reference it.</span> <span data-start="555.8" data-end="560.899">Later on, the file will be declaring A entity which as a generic container for things.</span> <span data-start="560.899" data-end="563.029">It is like the div for A-frame.</span> <span data-start="563.029" data-end="576.089">We will load in an object model file we declare using the unique ID we declared earlier on.</span> <span data-start="576.089" data-end="581.889">So as we load object into our system, sometimes they will be way too big or too small and</span> <span data-start="581.889" data-end="587.13">I personally find it hard to reason about 3D spaces on a 2 D screen.</span> <span data-start="587.13" data-end="590.889">A-frame's debugging helps with this.</span> <span data-start="590.889" data-end="597.699">You can scale things up and down, move it around, just to get the riot placement.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="597.699" data-end="604.199">It is like the building in Sims when you are buying furniture and building walls and things</span> <span data-start="604.199" data-end="608.81">like that.</span> <span data-start="608.81" data-end="613.37">As you look through the Google Poly library you may not find what you want.</span> <span data-start="613.37" data-end="619.19">I was looking for a coffee table like this and this is an opportunity to create a model</span> <span data-start="619.19" data-end="622.2">of our own using primitives.</span> <span data-start="622.2" data-end="630.5">The coffee table can be broken down into a cylinder and four box elements for the legs.</span> <span data-start="630.5" data-end="636.829">You can right code like this to create a coffee table out of primitives.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="636.829" data-end="644.12">First declaring A-cylinder to create the surface, and adding in boxes for the legs, and then</span> <span data-start="644.12" data-end="650.529">wrapping in a single A-entity tag to make it clear this is just one thing.</span> <span data-start="650.529" data-end="654.68">Here is how it looks in the demo.</span> <span data-start="654.68" data-end="661.579">You can see that because we created it ourselves using primitives you can play around with</span> <span data-start="661.579" data-end="663.819">it more in the debugging interface.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="663.819" data-end="668.499">If you don't feel like the leg placement is right, or the surface could be bigger or smaller,</span> <span data-start="668.499" data-end="673.04">you can get a feel for it in the debugging interface instead of changing numbers and</span> <span data-start="673.04" data-end="675.44">refreshing constantly.</span> <span data-start="675.44" data-end="679.74">We can do the same thing for other bits of furniture, too.</span> <span data-start="679.74" data-end="683.319">I wanted to put in a console like this but I could not find a Google Poly with so I tried</span> <span data-start="683.319" data-end="691.73">to make it myself.</span> <span data-start="691.73" data-end="694.939">This one didn't turn out quite well like the other one.</span> <span data-start="694.939" data-end="701.73">I think I will try to make it better in the next version.</span> <span data-start="701.73" data-end="707.11">So far we have built our apartment, moved in, and arranged our furniture.</span> <span data-start="707.11" data-end="711.749">You can see that it is a bit eerie and hard to see because of the low contrast.</span> <span data-start="711.749" data-end="718.31">It kind of reminds me of the white room in 2001 space Odyssey but in kind of a bad way.</span> <span data-start="718.31" data-end="721.42">To make it better, let's try adding some lighting.</span> <span data-start="721.42" data-end="726.139">A-frame makes it easy to at  â€”  add lighting.</span> <span data-start="726.139" data-end="733.94">There are five types and we will use ambient and point to build our scene.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="733.94" data-end="737.22">Ambient lights affect all entities in a scene are not dependent on position.</span> <span data-start="737.22" data-end="748.309">You can use this to make sure the darkest shadow in the scene is not black but dark</span> <span data-start="748.309" data-end="749.309">gray.</span> <span data-start="749.309" data-end="753.999">Point lights affect entities all-around them in all directions and are dependent on positioning.</span> <span data-start="753.999" data-end="757.509">This is useful to simulate things like light bulbs which we will be doing in our scene.</span> <span data-start="757.509" data-end="762.41">Next, I will go over the three other lighting types briefly.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="762.41" data-end="767.07">So, spotlights are kind of like point lights but they don't light up in all directions.</span> <span data-start="767.07" data-end="773.079">They only point in one direction like a spotlight.</span> <span data-start="773.079" data-end="778.13">Directional lights simulate things like the sun and shines at a specific direction, but</span> <span data-start="778.13" data-end="780.399">it is positioned agnostic.</span> <span data-start="780.399" data-end="784.23">For our scene here, it would kind of make it look too moody like Sin City so that is</span> <span data-start="784.23" data-end="787.129">no good.</span> <span data-start="787.129" data-end="791.47">And hemisphere lights are the last one.</span> <span data-start="791.47" data-end="804.04">This might be useful for creating a hot bling video.</span> <span data-start="804.04" data-end="810.22">You can declare a type here which are ambient, directional, hemisphere or spot.</span> </p>
