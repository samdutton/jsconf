<p><span data-start="9.54" data-end="12.66">Hi, everybody.</span> <span data-start="12.67" data-end="18.609">My name is Brittany, and, like I to mention ed, I recently moved out to Denver to be an</span> <span data-start="18.609" data-end="22.679">instructor at Turing School of Software and Design.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="22.679" data-end="31.679">I've been teaching front-end web development for two years now, and one of the things we</span> <span data-start="31.679" data-end="39.2">emphasise with our students is they should be using proper vocabulary, and articulating</span> <span data-start="39.2" data-end="43.1">themselves appropriately.</span> <span data-start="43.1" data-end="48.85">Our student had a tendency to have a block of code and described it by saying things</span> <span data-start="48.85" data-end="56.68">like, "This thing called this over here, and then that moves over here, and this things</span> <span data-start="56.68" data-end="59.56">calls this and sends information over there."</span> <span data-start="59.56" data-end="63.12">We are like I don't understand what you're saying.</span> <span data-start="63.12" data-end="70.45">We were teaching them the proper terms to use and the terms they should avoid as well.</span> <span data-start="70.45" data-end="78.179">In doing so, I started to realise we have a lot of bizarre jargony words in our industry</span> <span data-start="78.179" data-end="82.829">that we use, words that I wouldn't normally think twice about.</span> <span data-start="82.829" data-end="88.67">My students would either laugh at or ask me questions about, and I realised I didn't know</span> <span data-start="88.67" data-end="90.829">how to explain some of them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="90.829" data-end="97.17">So that prompted me to do a little bit of research, and look some of the terminology</span> <span data-start="97.17" data-end="99.85">we use.</span> <span data-start="99.85" data-end="106.93">I made a tiny list of words I'm going to talk about today with all of you.</span> <span data-start="106.93" data-end="113.61">Our first example is the term "bug".</span> <span data-start="113.61" data-end="121.729">And this is one of the most classic origin stories that we have in programming.</span> <span data-start="121.729" data-end="131.76">The term "bug" was popularised in the 1940s by a Harvard University technical team.</span> <span data-start="131.76" data-end="138.68">They found an actual moth in one of their machines causing it to malfunction, so, noted</span> <span data-start="138.68" data-end="147.84">computer scientist Grace Hopper removed that moth and taped it to a bug log, if you will</span> <span data-start="147.84" data-end="152.78">with the caption "first actual case of bug being found".</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="152.78" data-end="159.849">So, this was not the very first instance of that term being used in programming.</span> <span data-start="159.849" data-end="164.69">The phrase "bugs in a computer" had been used frequently before then.</span> <span data-start="164.69" data-end="171.22">Back in that day, computers were really big, and they were really hot, so they often attracted</span> <span data-start="171.22" data-end="175.989">flies and moths that would cause the machines to malfunction.</span> <span data-start="175.989" data-end="184.019">Even though this team didn't coin the term, this incident caused the widespread popularity</span> <span data-start="184.019" data-end="191.069">of the term "bug" which led rise to the term "debugging" as well.</span> <span data-start="191.069" data-end="199.51">Since then, a couple of people have criticised the term "bug", because it distances the developers</span> <span data-start="199.51" data-end="201.15">from blame.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="201.15" data-end="206.109">It implies that it was something other than developer error that caused the programme</span> <span data-start="206.109" data-end="207.109">to malfunction.</span> <span data-start="207.109" data-end="213.37">So, some computer scientists have offered up a couple of alternatives, like "defect"</span> <span data-start="213.37" data-end="217.879">and, my favourite, "blunder".</span> <span data-start="217.879" data-end="222.93">Neither of them really took off, although I would love to see us create "blunder reports"</span> <span data-start="222.93" data-end="224.67">— I think that would be hilarious.</span> <span data-start="224.67" data-end="229.36">I think "bug" is pretty much here to stay.</span> <span data-start="229.36" data-end="233.65">That's one of the most concrete examples of an origin story that we have for a term that</span> <span data-start="233.65" data-end="235.59">we are using in programming.</span> <span data-start="235.59" data-end="240.099">Other words are a little bit hazier, or it's a little bit more difficult to track down</span> <span data-start="240.099" data-end="243.109">concrete origins of where they came from.</span> <span data-start="243.109" data-end="248.25">But they still have really interesting theories behind them, and interesting metaphors that</span> <span data-start="248.25" data-end="250.129">we can pull out of them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="250.129" data-end="255.91">One of my favourite is "throw" and "catch".</span> <span data-start="255.91" data-end="262.97">When you're programming, maybe you have some try catch blocks, and you're going to throw</span> <span data-start="262.97" data-end="267.22">an exception that is going to be caught.</span> <span data-start="267.22" data-end="275.37">The first appearance of these terms in programming was in MacLisp which is a dialect of the Lisp</span> <span data-start="275.37" data-end="277.24">language in 1972.</span> <span data-start="277.24" data-end="284.41">They had two more error-handling primitives which were throw and catch.</span> <span data-start="284.41" data-end="291.58">The lead developers working on this language at the time were American, and in America,</span> <span data-start="291.58" data-end="295.14">the sport of baseball is really popular.</span> <span data-start="295.14" data-end="301.949">I know it's not very widespread elsewhere — probably because it is incredibly boring!</span> <span data-start="301.949" data-end="309.71">— but it offers an insight to the explanation of these terms.</span> <span data-start="309.71" data-end="314.699">In baseball, a player can commit a throwing error.</span> <span data-start="314.699" data-end="321.199">The player might throw the ball just slightly out of reach for their team-mates, or the</span> <span data-start="321.199" data-end="327.56">ball might take an un-Special Constable bounce, or maybe it hits team-mate, or a base.</span> <span data-start="327.56" data-end="329.91">Any number of things could go wrong there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="329.91" data-end="336.56">But ultimately, the goal for each one of these throws, is to catch that ball, to reduce the</span> <span data-start="336.56" data-end="341.66">amount of damage that that error is actually going to do, right?</span> <span data-start="341.66" data-end="348.139">So we have the same concept in programming, where we want to catch any exceptions that</span> <span data-start="348.139" data-end="354.069">are thrown, and surface those errors as soon as possible, as provide as much information</span> <span data-start="354.069" data-end="360.449">about what went wrong so our programmes don't fail in these catastrophic ways, Day okay?</span> <span data-start="360.449" data-end="366.34">That's an example of one of the theories that is not completely set in stone.</span> <span data-start="366.34" data-end="371.12">A little bit more speculative, but still offers us a metaphor on how to think about these</span> <span data-start="371.12" data-end="377.18">terms that we work with every day.</span> <span data-start="377.18" data-end="380.06">Let's talk about foobar a little bit.</span> <span data-start="380.06" data-end="386.1">Who uses foobar bath?</span> <span data-start="386.1" data-end="387.1">Me to.</span> <span data-start="387.1" data-end="388.1">I used to.</span> <span data-start="388.1" data-end="393.59">I stopped recently, and I will get into that in a little bit.</span> <span data-start="393.59" data-end="394.97">People understand why?</span> <span data-start="394.97" data-end="395.97">Yep.</span> <span data-start="395.97" data-end="404.49">So, foobar was first used in programming by MIT's tech model railroad club, and this club</span> <span data-start="404.49" data-end="411.729">was essentially a bunch of nerds or kid playing with model train sets, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="411.729" data-end="419.72">They built this complex system for automating train sets, and these systems had a bunch</span> <span data-start="419.72" data-end="427.229">of kill switches where you would trigger one if something catastrophic was going to happen,</span> <span data-start="427.229" data-end="434.23">a train was going to crash in another train or other obstruction.</span> <span data-start="434.23" data-end="441.78">They had had little dashboard alongside their system that usually showed, like, a counter</span> <span data-start="441.78" data-end="447.069">or a clock — something of that sort — but whenever one of these kill switches was engaged,</span> <span data-start="447.069" data-end="451.5">the dashboard instead flashed the word "foo".</span> <span data-start="451.5" data-end="457.05">So thing about how "foo" was being used here to represent and denote that something terrible</span> <span data-start="457.05" data-end="460.169">happened, okay?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="460.169" data-end="464.22">This leads us into the origin of where foobar came from.</span> <span data-start="464.22" data-end="470.9">As an instructor, I do a lot of demonstrative coding for my students, and I was using foobar</span> <span data-start="470.9" data-end="478.82">for a biochemical, until one of my students, who was a veteran, was explaining that foobar</span> <span data-start="478.82" data-end="482.47">was a military slang term.</span> <span data-start="482.47" data-end="487.889">That stood for "messed up beyond all recognition", right?</span> <span data-start="487.889" data-end="493.4">So people would use this term talking about the missions that they were on, often sometimes</span> <span data-start="493.4" data-end="497.789">the severity of the injuries that soldiers sustained, right?</span> <span data-start="497.789" data-end="505.159">And, in the tech world, we decided to try to soften the definition of this acronym and</span> <span data-start="505.159" data-end="510.88">like, "It doesn't stand for it, it actually stands for fouled up beyond all repair for</span> <span data-start="510.88" data-end="516.8">our software", and we changed the spelling a little bit, but we still maintained that</span> <span data-start="516.8" data-end="520.68">phonetic composition that we have with this they remember, right?</span> <span data-start="520.68" data-end="522.409">So even — with this term.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="522.409" data-end="528.589">Even though we try to soften the way we use these terms or make them more gentle, those</span> <span data-start="528.589" data-end="533.37">original conceptions are still there, right?</span> <span data-start="533.37" data-end="537.77">This term can still be very triggering for certain people.</span> <span data-start="537.77" data-end="544.81">The software engineering community has no lack of terms with negative connotations to</span> <span data-start="544.81" data-end="545.81">them.</span> <span data-start="545.81" data-end="547.92">Think about the terms "master/slave".</span> <span data-start="547.92" data-end="554.68">We've done a decent job of trying to get that out of our vocabulary but it won't easy.</span> <span data-start="554.68" data-end="563.6">In 2003, the city of Los Angeles, or county of Los Angeles, had filed a request that manufacturers</span> <span data-start="563.6" data-end="570.51">stop using those terms in their products, and the tech industry being the tech industry</span> <span data-start="570.51" data-end="576.62">was, "No, we want to keep our terms master/slave, don't tell us what to do," and they got really</span> <span data-start="576.62" data-end="578.899">angry about it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="578.899" data-end="584.67">Los Angeles was, "Sorry, never mind, it was just a request," and kind of backed off.</span> <span data-start="584.67" data-end="592.73">But the following year, the global language monitor decided to name master/slave as the</span> <span data-start="592.73" data-end="596.37">most politically incorrect term of 2004.</span> <span data-start="596.37" data-end="599.87">Which was really great response to that incident, I thought.</span> <span data-start="599.87" data-end="607.63">"Whitelist, blacklist" — I had another scenario in class one day where one of my students</span> <span data-start="607.63" data-end="612.7">some some documentation on MDM that used a variable called "whitelist", and they were</span> <span data-start="612.7" data-end="617.35">trying to rework some of the code in that example but were putting things that should</span> <span data-start="617.35" data-end="620.92">be blocked into this whitelist array.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="620.92" data-end="626.82">As I was trying to explain to him what it meant, I was, "Think about the difference</span> <span data-start="626.82" data-end="629.901">between a whitelist and a blacklist".</span> <span data-start="629.901" data-end="635.16">I kind of stopped myself short realising how negative those terms are in the modern-day</span> <span data-start="635.16" data-end="639.16">connotations that those have nowadays.</span> <span data-start="639.16" data-end="644.9">The origin of those terms, for anyone that might not be following, they imply anything</span> <span data-start="644.9" data-end="649.2">that is white is good, and anything that is black is bad.</span> <span data-start="649.2" data-end="654.99">There are a lot of different reasons for the origins of those terms, and maybe perhaps,</span> <span data-start="654.99" data-end="659.41">when they came around, they weren't necessarily racist, or they didn't hold the connotations</span> <span data-start="659.41" data-end="664.279">that they do today, but a because they hold those connotations today, they should definitely</span> <span data-start="664.279" data-end="668.26">be removed from our vernacular as well, our vocabulary.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="668.26" data-end="670.04">I'm going on tangents here.</span> <span data-start="670.04" data-end="675.13">Let me get back to a couple of other words.</span> <span data-start="675.13" data-end="686.2">Thunks — sub routines used to inject additional logic or calculations into other sub routines.</span> <span data-start="686.2" data-end="692.68">So I teach React and Redux at Turing, and this is where we introduce our students to</span> <span data-start="692.68" data-end="699.149">thunks, they use them for asynchronous actions that they are creating.</span> <span data-start="699.149" data-end="703.05">And they're what on earth is a thunk?</span> <span data-start="703.05" data-end="710.35">A lot of people thought this term originated because of a sound.</span> <span data-start="710.35" data-end="714.99">They think clearly about a sound that would be occurring from this, so maybe it was the</span> <span data-start="714.99" data-end="723.93">sound of data hitting the information — information hitting the stack, or data hitting an accumulator</span> <span data-start="723.93" data-end="727.709">— that is what a lot of people reference this term to.</span> <span data-start="727.709" data-end="737.779">But the origin is from a late night of programming years ago where a couple of developers were</span> <span data-start="737.779" data-end="742.74">thinking really hard about how they needed this type of argument at a certain point in</span> <span data-start="742.74" data-end="747.88">execution of their programme, and they didn't have that value right away but they realised</span> <span data-start="747.88" data-end="754.76">that they could get that information in advance with a — by adding a couple of extra calculations</span> <span data-start="754.76" data-end="756.91">at compile time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="756.91" data-end="761.699">In their minds, they thought, "Okay, if we add these calculations ahead of time, now</span> <span data-start="761.699" data-end="768.769">this variable, this value, has already been thought of, it has already been thought about,"</span> <span data-start="768.769" data-end="775.3">hence "thunk" is the past-tense version of think, or past tense of think.</span> <span data-start="775.3" data-end="777.92">So that is what that term actually means here.</span> <span data-start="777.92" data-end="785.389">Shell: this was a fun one to research.</span> <span data-start="785.389" data-end="791.27">This is, this was a fun one to research.</span> <span data-start="791.27" data-end="808.079">It is a command line or our terminal, what we are actually interacting with is our shell,</span> <span data-start="808.079" data-end="814.44">and we are interacting with this shell rather than the kernel or the central core of our</span> <span data-start="814.44" data-end="816.53">operating system, right?</span> <span data-start="816.53" data-end="819.41">So nuts work the same exact way.</span> <span data-start="819.41" data-end="826.279">They have — they're a fruit, and they have this very hard external shell that does not</span> <span data-start="826.279" data-end="832.3">allow you access to that inner seed, or that inner kernel.</span> <span data-start="832.3" data-end="833.48">That's the metaphor there.</span> <span data-start="833.48" data-end="840.06">When I was researching this one, there were a lot of threads where people were getting</span> <span data-start="840.06" data-end="845.48">very philosophical about things, and really deep about what it could possibly mean.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="845.48" data-end="851.37">They were like, "Oh, the shell is like a sea shell from the ocean, and there this concept</span> <span data-start="851.37" data-end="856.46">of listeners, and you can listen to the ocean when you put a sea shell up to your ear,"</span> <span data-start="856.46" data-end="863">and people were making up these convoluted metaphors, and someone said, listen, it is</span> <span data-start="863" data-end="864.899">just a nut, that's all it is.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="927.269" data-end="934.19">But, at the same time, alongside these more humorous and more interesting terms in this</span> <span data-start="934.19" data-end="941.56">dictionary, there are a lot of upsetting words, words that very clearly indicate some of the</span> <span data-start="941.56" data-end="947.52">cultural issues that we are still dealing with today in programming.</span> <span data-start="947.52" data-end="951.329">Words like "tits on a keyboard".</span> <span data-start="951.329" data-end="967.519">"Tar and feather", "rape", these are all considered programming terms according to that dictionary,</span> <span data-start="967.519" data-end="969.74">right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="969.74" data-end="975.769">In the beginning of that book, they say, "All human cultures use slang in this three-fold</span> <span data-start="975.769" data-end="983.1">way: as a tool of communication, and of inclusion, and of exclusion."</span> <span data-start="983.1" data-end="990.74">I want to take the last part of this talk to talk a little bit about this exclusion</span> <span data-start="990.74" data-end="993.6">piece.</span> <span data-start="993.6" data-end="999.08">One of the ways in which the language that we use in programming is the most exclusion</span> <span data-start="999.08" data-end="1007.6">ry lies in how biased it is towards native English speakers, how much it favours native</span> <span data-start="1007.6" data-end="1010.8">English speakers.</span> <span data-start="1010.8" data-end="1015.88">I had a student recently who was a perfectly talented developer.</span> <span data-start="1015.88" data-end="1022.13">She was very able to write all of the code and build all of the application s, but where</span> <span data-start="1022.13" data-end="1030.11">she felt she was falling behind as a native Spanish speaker was that gasping that articulation</span> <span data-start="1030.11" data-end="1037.5">piece, so, talking about the code, and listening to others speak about it.</span> <span data-start="1037.5" data-end="1044.33">The terms and metaphors that we use that might make perfect accepts to you might be absolutely</span> <span data-start="1044.33" data-end="1046.87">meaningless to someone else.</span> <span data-start="1046.87" data-end="1055.62">There is a discussion on a GitHub thread recently where a developer was discussing how the terms</span> <span data-start="1055.62" data-end="1062.77">"property" and "attribute" translate to the exact same word in Chinese.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1062.77" data-end="1067.06">Even though they mean slightly different things when we talk about them in English.</span> <span data-start="1067.06" data-end="1074.53">So, their solution to overcome this is to prefix that word with either DOM, when they</span> <span data-start="1074.53" data-end="1080.35">were talking about a DOM property, or HTML, when they were talking about an HTML attribute.</span> <span data-start="1080.35" data-end="1085.19">That would help them avoid any confusion they might have ran into.</span> <span data-start="1085.19" data-end="1091.82">This was eye-opening to me, and I wanted to hear more stories what else was out there,</span> <span data-start="1091.82" data-end="1096.57">and how are people struggling within this industry dominated by English?</span> <span data-start="1096.57" data-end="1102.95">So I interviewed a couple of developers, and I surveyed about 30 which is still a small</span> <span data-start="1102.95" data-end="1103.96">sample set.</span> <span data-start="1103.96" data-end="1113.43">But I surveyed non-English speakers about their experiences being engineers, developers,</span> <span data-start="1113.43" data-end="1116.61">tech-based biased towards English speakers.</span> <span data-start="1116.61" data-end="1126.3">Before the themes came up was that there was a longer learning curve for these developers,</span> <span data-start="1126.3" data-end="1132.03">so not only were they trying to learn the programming language, at the same time, they</span> <span data-start="1132.03" data-end="1139.93">were trying to learn the written and spoken language that explained it in the first place.</span> <span data-start="1139.93" data-end="1145.17">Sometimes, there were no translations for certain terms that we use in programming;</span> <span data-start="1145.17" data-end="1150.67">sometimes, there would be a translation, but maybe it would cause even more confusion if</span> <span data-start="1150.67" data-end="1157.1">that translation was not a perfect one-to-one correlation with the original term.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1157.1" data-end="1163.83">A developer at the New York Times and native Polish speaker said, "I have no idea what</span> <span data-start="1163.83" data-end="1167.42">Polish people call a variable in Polish.</span> <span data-start="1167.42" data-end="1173.15">Not knowing the words in my native language definitely adds some sense of artificiality</span> <span data-start="1173.15" data-end="1175.44">to the programming terms."</span> <span data-start="1175.44" data-end="1180.8">So it is very difficult to derive meaning from terms that seem like they're mid-up,</span> <span data-start="1180.8" data-end="1187.51">terms that you have not recognised in your native language, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1187.51" data-end="1193.23">Another theme I noticed was that people had difficulty getting help also recognising when</span> <span data-start="1193.23" data-end="1199.37">they actually needed help, so, some people mentioned that it was challenging to find</span> <span data-start="1199.37" data-end="1203.89">the right search terms to use when tackling a bug that they were encountering.</span> <span data-start="1203.89" data-end="1208.4">I know I still have problems with that as a native English speaker, so there's an added</span> <span data-start="1208.4" data-end="1210.201">layer of complexity there for some people.</span> <span data-start="1210.201" data-end="1217.53">A loft people mentioned — a lot of people mentioned reading issue threads and pull requests</span> <span data-start="1217.53" data-end="1222.98">wasn't worth it because there was too much slang involved in those threads that convoluted</span> <span data-start="1222.98" data-end="1227.66">the discussion, and made it really difficult for them to follow.</span> <span data-start="1227.66" data-end="1233.82">The developer I was talking about, Ana, was also mentioning that, when she would read</span> <span data-start="1233.82" data-end="1237.44">documentation, she would have to double-check with her co-workers?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1237.44" data-end="1242.66">Do I is not not understand this because it is poorly written or do I not understand this</span> <span data-start="1242.66" data-end="1247.31">because of a gap in my English proficiency?</span> <span data-start="1247.31" data-end="1251.9">So this was another check that people had to do for themselves in order to understand</span> <span data-start="1251.9" data-end="1258.04">whether or not it was them, or something that was prewritten poorly.</span> <span data-start="1258.04" data-end="1261.96">We all know how much documentation is written poorly out there, and how many bad resources</span> <span data-start="1261.96" data-end="1267.59">there are out there, so I can't imagine having that additional challenge.</span> <span data-start="1267.59" data-end="1273.56">By far one of the biggest barriers for people seems to be community involvement, and the</span> <span data-start="1273.56" data-end="1280.75">judgment that came along with that, so, I think everyone here can agree that community</span> <span data-start="1280.75" data-end="1289.34">involvement is so essential for your growth, and your learning, and enjoyment, and success</span> <span data-start="1289.34" data-end="1290.51">in the industry, right?</span> <span data-start="1290.51" data-end="1292.4">In your career.</span> <span data-start="1292.4" data-end="1299.65">It is such a vital part of being involved in this industry that it is a shame that people</span> <span data-start="1299.65" data-end="1301.5">start to feel less out of it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1301.5" data-end="1306.02">Some people mentioned that they would have a hard time following a technical conversation,</span> <span data-start="1306.02" data-end="1310.4">not because they weren't skilled enough, or because they didn't have the technical knowledge,</span> <span data-start="1310.4" data-end="1315.31">but simply because it would be a large group of people talking very fast about a particular</span> <span data-start="1315.31" data-end="1319.77">topic, and that made it challenging for them to follow along which made it look as if they</span> <span data-start="1319.77" data-end="1322.28">didn't know what people were talking about.</span> <span data-start="1322.28" data-end="1328.07">My friend Bella mentioned that she produces materials in English, like screencasts, articles,</span> <span data-start="1328.07" data-end="1334.38">and talks, and sometimes, people will question her materials, or her technical prowess, her</span> <span data-start="1334.38" data-end="1339.13">skill set because of a spelling or grammar mistake or an accent.</span> <span data-start="1339.13" data-end="1340.98">Very simple things.</span> <span data-start="1340.98" data-end="1347.22">There's this added layer of having to prove yourself now if you have this barrier that</span> <span data-start="1347.22" data-end="1350.57">most of us are un familiar with.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1350.57" data-end="1356.731">So a lot of people did say some positive things about their community involvement but overall,</span> <span data-start="1356.731" data-end="1360.44">the tone felt kind of lonely, and I think this is something we should definitely be</span> <span data-start="1360.44" data-end="1363.1">working on as an industry.</span> <span data-start="1363.1" data-end="1367.23">And based on some of the responses that I was getting, there were definitely some things</span> <span data-start="1367.23" data-end="1371.811">that stood out to me that we could start doing, and things that people mentioned, so, one</span> <span data-start="1371.811" data-end="1378.56">of those was when you're creating resources, try to use more illustrations and charts,</span> <span data-start="1378.56" data-end="1379.72">and graphs.</span> <span data-start="1379.72" data-end="1386.06">Those are more universal, and often help clarify things where written text falls short.</span> <span data-start="1386.06" data-end="1390.8">Lynn Clark got a really great shout out from one of the respondents for all the work she's</span> <span data-start="1390.8" data-end="1391.8">been doing there.</span> <span data-start="1391.8" data-end="1397.05">If we could make an effort to do something like that, that would be super helpful.</span> <span data-start="1397.05" data-end="1401.17">Limiting the slang in issues we use in PR threads.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1401.17" data-end="1405.15">If we can aim for words that might be translated more easily in other languages.</span> <span data-start="1405.15" data-end="1411.86">It might feel sill y and robot ic at first but it will help break town barriers for developers</span> <span data-start="1411.86" data-end="1413.85">that would be super helpful.</span> <span data-start="1413.85" data-end="1418.96">Lastly, we need to be working with native speakers of other languages to create these</span> <span data-start="1418.96" data-end="1423.26">resources, to create better resources, more universal resources.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1423.26" data-end="1428.89">I'm not exactly sure just what this looks like yet, but I'm hoping to collect more data</span> <span data-start="1428.89" data-end="1432.87">and more experiences, so that we can figure that out.</span> <span data-start="1432.87" data-end="1437.79">I'm sure a lot of people here have dealt with some of these issues.</span> <span data-start="1437.79" data-end="1439.66">They've experienced these things.</span> </p>
