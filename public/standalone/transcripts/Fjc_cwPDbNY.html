data-end="437.11">new shiny app is built in Ember it's got</span> <span data-start="437.11" data-end="440.35">some tests it's maybe got 50% test</span> <span data-start="440.35" data-end="443.95">coverage better than no tests and we</span> <span data-start="443.95" data-end="446.04">start working on it and we decide well</span> <span data-start="446.04" data-end="449.08">what

test-driven</span> <span data-start="453.21" data-end="456.479">development okay sometimes we'll do</span> <span data-start="456.479" data-end="460.05">test-driven development all code</span> <span data-start="460.05" data-end="461.91">required reviews and you couldn't pass a</span> <span data-start="461.91" data-end="464.46">review without tests but generally we</span> <span data-start="464.46" data-end="465.93">wrote the test after we wrote the code</span> <span data-start="465.93" data-end="467.849">because well we're all kind of lazy</span> <span data-start="467.849" data-end="473.4">sometimes TDD says you should have three</span> <span data-start="473.4" data-end="476.61">rules of how to do your tests you can't</span> <span data-start="476.61" data-end="478.38">write any production code until you</span> <span data-start="478.38" data-end="481.169">first written a failing test then you</span> <span data-start="481.169" data-end="483.09">can't write more of a unit test than is</span> <span data-start="483.09" data-end="485.37">sufficient to fail and not compiling is</span> <span data-start="485.37" data-end="488.099">failing and finally you can't write more</span> <span data-start="488.099" data-end="489.78">production code than is sufficient to</span> <span data-start="489.78" data-end="492.18">pass the currently failing unit tests or</span> <span data-start="492.18" data-end="494.88">in my paraphrased write failing test</span> <span data-start="494.88" data-end="497.039">write code to pass fail a test and no</span> <span data-start="497.039" data-end="501.96">more repeat I don't have a demo for TDD</span> <span data-start="501.96" data-end="503.669">there was a really good talk here back</span> <span data-start="503.669" data-end="507.72">in 2014 I believe that went nitty-gritty</span> <span data-start="507.72" data-end="510.81">into how to do TDD and you should all go</span> <span data-start="510.81" data-end="515.339">watch it alright so now I've got a new</span> <span data-start="515.339" data-end="518.36">app it's got good ish test coverage</span> <span data-start="518.36" data-end="520.8">wrote a bunch of unit tests things feel</span> <span data-start="520.8" data-end="523.829">stable but what happens when I run into</span> <span data-start="523.829" data-end="527.25">things I can't read a unit test for and</span> <span data-start="527.25" data-end="529.07">that happens a lot</span> <span data-start="529.07" data-end="531.899">that's where integration testing comes</span> <span data-start="531.899" data-end="535.709">in so integration testing is built into</span> <span data-start="535.709" data-end="538.92">ember and react and angular and most</span> <span data-start="538.92" data-end="541.5">large frameworks and libraries but if</span> <span data-start="541.5" data-end="543.089">not if you're rolling your own framework</span> <span data-start="543.089" data-end="544.529">or you're in a framework that doesn't</span> <span

data-start="549.48" data-end="552.89">will do integration testing and</span> <span data-start="552.89" data-end="555.57">integration testing is going to test how</span> <span data-start="555.57" data-end="560.57">your units or modules work together so</span> <span data-start="560.57" data-end="563.22">example of a more advanced sort of</span> <span data-start="563.22" data-end="565.05">acceptance integration test would be</span> <span data-start="565.05" data-end="567.42">like visit a page enter some data click</span> <span data-start="567.42" data-end="568.86">a button and see that the data is</span> <span data-start="568.86" data-end="572.69">correct and I have a demo for this guy</span> <span data-start="572.69" data-end="575.37">sorry all my demos are an ember because</span> <span data-start="575.37" data-end="581.079">that's what I write</span> <span data-start="581.089" data-end="586.819">um so this is still using Q unit and Q</span> <span data-start="586.819" data-end="589.819">units assertion library so it's</span> <span data-start="589.819" data-end="592.67">basically just importing the module I</span> <span data-start="592.67"
