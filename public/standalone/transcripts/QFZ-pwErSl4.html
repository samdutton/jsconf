data-end="491.919">powerful new api's so I started looking</span> <span data-start="491.919" data-end="493.39">through various web API is looking for</span> <span data-start="493.39" data-end="495.01">anything that might help me make a</span> <span data-start="495.01" data-end="496.419">really annoying website to send to this</span> <span data-start="496.419" data-end="496.84">spammer</span> <span data-start="496.84" data-end="500.169">and I found some really weird ones as</span> <span data-start="500.169" data-end="502.12">you can see up here some of these like</span> <span data-start="502.12" data-end="504.19">the plaintext tag are just absurd how</span> <span data-start="504.19" data-end="505.18">many of you have heard of the plaintext</span> <span data-start="505.18" data-end="507.46">tag raise your hand okay yeah like three</span> <span data-start="507.46" data-end="511.24">four people it's absurd it it renders</span> <span data-start="511.24" data-end="512.74">everything that appears after it as</span> <span data-start="512.74" data-end="515.289">plaintext and there's no way to close it</span> <span data-start="515.289" data-end="518.589">so if you include it then all the HTML</span> <span data-start="518.589" data-end="519.789">tags afterwards will just show up in the</span> <span data-start="519.789" data-end="524.35">page I don't know what that's for but</span> <span data-start="524.35" data-end="526.839">anyway there's also a string prototype</span> <span data-start="526.839" data-end="528.43">big and quote which are they're not</span> <span data-start="528.43" data-end="530.02">really good for annoying annoying</span> <span data-start="530.02" data-end="531.28">purposes but they're just they're just</span> <span data-start="531.28" data-end="534.459">silly like if you call big on a string</span> <span data-start="534.459" data-end="537.49">it just adds a big HTML tag on both</span> <span data-start="537.49" data-end="538.87">sides of the stream</span> <span data-start="538.87" data-end="540.43">and quote just adds double quotes on</span> <span data-start="540.43" data-end="544.63">both sides yeah I looked up with the big</span> <span data-start="544.63" data-end="546.55">tag does it actually just it makes the</span> <span data-start="546.55" data-end="549.76">the size of the text one size bigger</span> <span data-start="549.76" data-end="554.62">than the parent div around it really</span> <span data-start="554.62" data-end="559.18">useful okay so in all this searching I I</span> <span data-start="559.18" data-end="561.81">finally found what I was looking for I</span> <span data-start="561.81" data-end="567.82">found it seriously the best api's window</span> <span data-start="567.82" data-end="569.82">moved to and their friends</span> <span data-start="569.82" data-end="573.07">these methods allow you to move and to</span> <span data-start="573.07" data-end="576.13">resize a browser window I thought there</span> <span data-start="576.13" data-end="577.839">was no way that these ap eyes would</span> <span data-start="577.839" data-end="580.08">still be allowed in modern web browsers</span> <span data-start="580.08" data-end="583.029">sure enough when I I tried them they</span> <span data-start="583.029" data-end="585.76">didn't work immediately and the reason</span> <span data-start="585.76" data-end="588.01">is actually kind of surprising it's the</span> <span data-start="588.01" data-end="590.2">same origin policy can you think about</span> <span data-start="590.2" data-end="592.69">why moving a window would have anything</span> <span data-start="592.69" data-end="598.519">to do with the same origin policy huh</span> <span data-start="598.529" data-end="602.35">sort of no it's actually so it's</span> <span data-start="602.35" data-end="603.91">actually more and more that if you think</span> <span data-start="603.91" data-end="604.96">about like when you're using your</span> <span data-start="604.96" data-end="607.21">browser you usually have multiple tabs</span> <span data-start="607.21" data-end="609.94">open right and so if one site like say</span> <span data-start="609.94" data-end="612.13">this site here bit MIDI were to try to</span> <span data-start="612.13" data-end="613.81">resize the window I would also be</span> <span data-start="613.81" data-end="615.7">resizing the Wikipedia tab which is</span> <span data-start="615.7" data-end="619.21">implicitly it's sort of affecting domain</span> <span data-start="619.21" data-end="620.74">on another origin and that's just not</span> <span data-start="620.74" data-end="622.21">allowed even though it's kind of a silly</span> <span data-start="622.21" data-end="623.589">thing it's like I'm just resizing it you</span> <span data-start="623.589" data-end="624.52">wouldn't think that's a big deal but</span> <span data-start="624.52" data-end="625.839">actually any kind of you know</span> <span data-start="625.839" data-end="627.55">cross-origin communication without the</span> <span data-start="627.55" data-end="629.17">site explicitly opting into it is a</span> <span data-start="629.17" data-end="630.82">violation of the same-origin policy so</span> <span data-start="630.82" data-end="632.29">at least that's how I explained to</span> <span data-start="632.29" data-end="634.12">myself why the API didn't work but I</span> <span data-start="634.12" data-end="636.61">figured out a workaround for it so if</span> <span data-start="636.61" data-end="639.07">you open a new window using window dot</span> <span data-start="639.07" data-end="642.16">open then you get this little window</span> <span data-start="642.16" data-end="643.839">that pops up and you can see the</span> <span data-start="643.839" data-end="645.55">parameters there are it's a really weird</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="645.55" data-end="647.68">API the first two parameters don't work</span> <span data-start="647.68" data-end="651.34">anymore so you just pass empty strings</span> <span data-start="651.35" data-end="653.72">the the third one is like a</span> <span data-start="653.72" data-end="657.41">comma-separated list of of properties I</span> <span data-start="657.41" data-end="659.35">don't know why it's not an object but</span> <span data-start="659.35" data-end="661.1">anyway that's what you do and then you</span> <span data-start="661.1" data-end="663.29">get this little window that pops up and</span> <span data-start="663.29" data-end="666.17">okay so that's cool now let's try to</span> <span data-start="666.17" data-end="670.9">move it around so when I wrote this code</span> <span data-start="670.9" data-end="674.45">and I ran it it didn't work again but I</span> <span data-start="674.45" data-end="675.71">noticed a little thing in the browser</span> <span data-start="675.71" data-end="679.03">that said pop-up window is blocked so</span> <span data-start="679.03" data-end="681.14">you know I did a little research figure</span> <span data-start="681.14" data-end="683.15">it out okay so what we need to do here</span> <span data-start="683.15" data-end="684.35">is we need to trigger this window</span> <span data-start="684.35" data-end="686.18">opening in response to a user initiated</span> <span data-start="686.18" data-end="689.6">event so in other words like a click or</span> <span data-start="689.6" data-end="691.76">a key a key press if we do that we're</span> <span data-start="691.76" data-end="694.54">allowed to open up windows so this works</span> <span data-start="694.54" data-end="699.78">now let's add the fun part</span> <span data-start="699.79" data-end="707.16">right so let's see it</span> <span data-start="707.17" data-end="711.38">so I have a little demo here can you see</span> <span data-start="711.38" data-end="713.06">that yeah okay cool so if I click this</span> <span data-start="713.06" data-end="717.11">button you get a window that moves on</span> <span data-start="717.11" data-end="718.58">its own and if you try to grab it and</span> <span data-start="718.58" data-end="722.84">move it around it fights you and if you</span> <span data-start="722.84" data-end="724.37">if you try to right-click on it to the</span> <span data-start="724.37" data-end="726.02">little right-click thing also the menu</span> <span data-start="726.02" data-end="731.09">moves too so okay we're off to a good</span> <span data-start="731.09" data-end="733.22">start this is pretty annoying can we do</span> <span data-start="733.22" data-end="737.06">anything else and so I thought I should</span> <span data-start="737.06" data-end="739.37">intercept oh sorry you can see my my</span> <span data-start="739.37" data-end="740.99">slides here and need to fix that okay</span> <span data-start="740.99" data-end="744.89">there we go so I thought let's intercept</span> <span data-start="744.89" data-end="746.63">all user initiated events and let's open</span> <span data-start="746.63" data-end="748.91">a window on any possible interaction</span> <span data-start="748.91" data-end="752.24">with the site at all the best part about</span> <span data-start="752.24" data-end="753.88">this is this includes things like</span> <span data-start="753.88" data-end="757.39">command W if you try to close the tab</span> <span data-start="757.39" data-end="760.37">this includes escape if you try to like</span> <span data-start="760.37" data-end="762.5">you know close if a pop-up window comes</span> <span data-start="762.5" data-end="764">up and you're like escape I need to get</span> <span data-start="764" data-end="765.44">out of this it'll actually open another</span> <span data-start="765.44" data-end="769.4">pop-up window yeah so you doesn't work</span> <span data-start="769.4" data-end="771.11">on scroll unfortunately or on any of</span> <span data-start="771.11" data-end="772.43">those other types of really common</span> <span data-start="772.43" data-end="774.35">events but like mouse move would be</span> <span data-start="774.35" data-end="775.34">really ridiculous</span> <span data-start="775.34" data-end="778.43">but it works on mouse click touch on</span> <span data-start="778.43" data-end="781.93">touch devices and all keystroke events</span> <span data-start="781.93" data-end="784.31">so let's just use that little function</span> <span data-start="784.31" data-end="785.63">we just wrote called intercept user</span> <span data-start="785.63" data-end="787.31">input and when that happens we will</span> <span data-start="787.31" data-end="788.99">prevent that whatever the default thing</span> <span data-start="788.99" data-end="790.55">the browser was going to do and well</span> <span data-start="790.55" data-end="792.29">instead call up this little open window</span> <span data-start="792.29" data-end="798.38">function to open a window so one other</span> <span data-start="798.38" data-end="802.22">trick we should add is so the pop-up</span> <span data-start="802.22" data-end="804.44">windows can sort of go behind the main</span> <span data-start="804.44" data-end="805.91">browser window if the user clicks on the</span> <span data-start="805.91" data-end="807.29">main window and then they'll be moving</span> <span data-start="807.29" data-end="808.7">in the background which wouldn't be</span> <span data-start="808.7" data-end="809.78">nearly as annoying as if they were</span> <span data-start="809.78" data-end="811.4">moving and they were all on the front of</span> <span data-start="811.4" data-end="813.92">what you're doing so we can just on any</span> <span data-start="813.92" data-end="815.54">click we can just call this little focus</span> <span data-start="815.54" data-end="817.64">windows function to bring all the</span> <span data-start="817.64" data-end="819.92">windows to the front you have to do this</span> <span data-start="819.92" data-end="821.839">in response to a user event like a click</span> <span data-start="821.839" data-end="825.58">or something but it works really nicely</span> <span data-start="825.58" data-end="828.899">ok gets worse</span> <span data-start="828.899" data-end="831.269">what if we bounce the windows off the</span> <span data-start="831.269" data-end="834.509">screen edges and so this little bit of</span> <span data-start="834.509" data-end="835.529">code here you probably gonna be able to</span> <span data-start="835.529" data-end="837.779">read it fast enough but it just detects</span> <span data-start="837.779" data-end="839.04">when the window hits an edge and then it</span> <span data-start="839.04" data-end="841.1">just inverts the direction</span> <span data-start="841.1" data-end="843.48">okay let's also play a random video in</span> <span data-start="843.48" data-end="846.569">the window so I have some good ones here</span> <span data-start="846.569" data-end="850.17">that I found the great part too is so</span> <span data-start="850.17" data-end="851.759">browsers have started to try to prevent</span> <span data-start="851.759" data-end="854.1">autoplay Auto playing video that</span> <span data-start="854.1" data-end="857.249">includes audio and if you try to do that</span> <span data-start="857.249" data-end="858.98">then the video just will get blocked</span> <span data-start="858.98" data-end="862.199">however we're setting up this site so</span> <span data-start="862.199" data-end="863.579">that the user will be tempted to</span> <span data-start="863.579" data-end="865.35">interact with it in some way initially</span> <span data-start="865.35" data-end="867.569">we're gonna put like a cute cat or</span> <span data-start="867.569" data-end="868.769">something and say you know click the cat</span> <span data-start="868.769" data-end="871.649">to get started or something we need some</span> <span data-start="871.649" data-end="873.269">way that entice them to do an initial</span> <span data-start="873.269" data-end="874.559">event in order to get these pop-ups</span> <span data-start="874.559" data-end="875.699">going and then once they've done that</span> <span data-start="875.699" data-end="877.379">we'll also be able to play sound because</span> <span data-start="877.379" data-end="880.649">they've interacted with the site so so</span> <span data-start="880.649" data-end="882.509">now we've sort of used this API but can</span> <span data-start="882.509" data-end="883.74">we do more is there anything else we can</span> <span data-start="883.74" data-end="887.22">add any other API as we can use of</span> <span data-start="887.22" data-end="891.329">course yes so I'm gonna get into a few</span> <span data-start="891.329" data-end="895.379">more api's but first one thing is one</span> <span data-start="895.379" data-end="896.579">thing is worth discussing which is the</span> <span data-start="896.579" data-end="897.99">permission model for all of these api's</span> <span data-start="897.99" data-end="900.059">as I was looking into them I realized</span> <span data-start="900.059" data-end="902.49">there's basically four models that the</span> <span data-start="902.49" data-end="904.74">browser uses for permissioning each of</span> <span data-start="904.74" data-end="907.8">these api's so i think of them in this</span> <span data-start="907.8" data-end="909.48">way so the first one is the API just</span> <span data-start="909.48" data-end="912.36">always works so API is like that are</span> <span data-start="912.36" data-end="913.92">well actually I won't tell you the API</span> <span data-start="913.92" data-end="915.059">as we'll see them as we go so there's so</span> <span data-start="915.059" data-end="916.11">many P as you can just always use</span> <span data-start="916.11" data-end="918.029">there's some that you can only use if</span> <span data-start="918.029" data-end="920.399">you're on an HTTP domain you probably</span> <span

data-end="1431.929">cross-origin right think about it like</span> <span data-start="1431.929" data-end="1433.37">every time you've included an image tag</span> <span data-start="1433.37" data-end="1434.72">you can include an image to a</span> <span data-start="1434.72" data-end="1436.19">third-party website and that image will</span> <span data-start="1436.19" data-end="1437.539">load just fine and what is that doing</span> <span data-start="1437.539" data-end="1439.429">that's making a get request now of</span> <span data-start="1439.429" data-end="1440.84">course if you try to make a if you try</span> <span data-start="1440.84" data-end="1442.19">to load one of these URLs as an image</span> <span data-start="1442.19" data-end="1443.45">it's not going to show an image

data-start="1451.789" data-end="1452.809">actually some of these half of these</span> <span data-start="1452.809" data-end="1454.549">don't work anymore but it does actually</span> <span data-start="1454.549" data-end="1456.74">log you out of google still and a few</span> <span data-start="1456.74" data-end="1460.22">other sites so this is the commercial</span> <span data-start="1460.22" data-end="1462.409">code to do that we just we just use I</span> <span data-start="1462.409" data-end="1463.85">think xhr here or something like that</span> <span data-start="1463.85" data-end="1467.929">yeah and it works</span> <span data-start="1467.929" data-end="1470.19">here's another one I discovered so let's</span> <span data-start="1470.19" data-end="1473.07">disable the back button this is really</span> <span data-start="1473.07" data-end="1474.45">fun look at what it's doing it says if</span> <span data-start="1474.45" data-end="1476.64">the user goes back they'll trigger pop</span> <span data-start="1476.64" data-end="1478.17">state so if the user goes back just send</span> <span data-start="1478.17" data-end="1486.33">them forward it's works and then here's</span> <span data-start="1486.33" data-end="1488.34">the thing though so the back button has</span> <span data-start="1488.34" data-end="1489.9">like a long press feature where you can</span> <span data-start="1489.9" data-end="1491.52">hold down the back button and it'll show</span> <span data-start="1491.52" data-end="1494.37">you multiple like previous sites you can</span> <span data-start="1494.37" data-end="1496.5">go back to like a whole list of them we</span> <span data-start="1496.5" data-end="1497.76">don't want them to be able to use that</span> <span data-start="1497.76" data-end="1500.52">to actually skip past this code that</span> <span data-start="1500.52" data-end="1502.35">we've written here so what we do is when</span> <span data-start="1502.35" data-end="1503.73">they first land on the site we fill the</span> <span data-start="1503.73" data-end="1506.85">history with extra entries so we just</span> <span data-start="1506.85" data-end="1508.98">push state a bunch of extra URLs in that</span> <span data-start="1508.98" data-end="1511.23">are our own site and then we push back</span> <span data-start="1511.23" data-end="1513.03">the original URL back on so they can't</span> <span data-start="1513.03" data-end="1514.14">tell that we've actually gone through</span> <span data-start="1514.14" data-end="1516.15">and you know iterated like added like 20</span> <span data-start="1516.15" data-end="1518.22">entries to the list and so now they</span> <span data-start="1518.22" data-end="1519.809">can't actually hold down either and and</span> <span data-start="1519.809" data-end="1526.95">try to go back okay we got more we can</span> <span data-start="1526.95" data-end="1534.16">do some embarrassing searches</span> <span data-start="1534.17" data-end="1538.29">try to keep it pg so what we do here is</span> <span data-start="1538.29" data-end="1540.69">we can actually once in a while when we</span> <span data-start="1540.69" data-end="1542.52">open up a pop-up window we'll make one</span> <span data-start="1542.52" data-end="1544.68">of those pop-ups actually point to being</span> <span data-start="1544.68" data-end="1548.73">searched and I chose being cuz you know</span> <span data-start="1548.73" data-end="1554.4">it's pretty funny on its own but you</span> <span data-start="1554.4" data-end="1555.42">know to mean heaven being in your</span> <span data-start="1555.42" data-end="1558.66">history now I'm just kidding anyway so</span> <span data-start="1558.66" data-end="1560.16">so yeah basically this is the code it's</span> <span data-start="1560.16" data-end="1561.36">a little too much to see what's going on</span> <span data-start="1561.36" data-end="1562.62">but basically it just opens a pop-up</span> <span data-start="1562.62" data-end="1564.12">window and then the interesting thing is</span> <span data-start="1564.12" data-end="1565.77">so if you open up a pop-up window and</span> <span data-start="1565.77" data-end="1567.9">it's on another domain like Bing com</span> <span data-start="1567.9" data-end="1570.12">then you I'm no longer allowed to</span> <span data-start="1570.12" data-end="1571.77">control it and move it around because</span> <span data-start="1571.77" data-end="1574.86">it's on another origin right however as</span> <span data-start="1574.86" data-end="1576.06">long as you have a reference to the</span> <span data-start="1576.06" data-end="1578.4">window you know in other words we were</span> <span data-start="1578.4" data-end="1579.9">the worse side was the one that opened</span> <span data-start="1579.9" data-end="1581.34">the window so we have a handle we have a</span> <span data-start="1581.34" data-end="1583.05">variable that references that window we</span> <span data-start="1583.05" data-end="1584.73">can't actually okay we can't actually</span> <span data-start="1584.73" data-end="1586.5">like reach into the page or do anything</span> <span data-start="1586.5" data-end="1587.88">to it or move it around but we can do is</span> <span data-start="1587.88" data-end="1589.65">set window dot location on it and</span> <span data-start="1589.65" data-end="1591.45">redirect it back to ourselves so we can</span> <span data-start="1591.45" data-end="1592.77">redirect you to Bing so that the search</span> <span data-start="1592.77" data-end="1594.93">gets added to your history and then we</span> <span data-start="1594.93" data-end="1596.34">can redirect you back to our own site so</span> <span data-start="1596.34" data-end="1597.75">the window can start to move again and</span> <span data-start="1597.75" data-end="1599.22">then redirect you to another search and</span> <span data-start="1599.22" data-end="1601.23">then just keep looping like this so the</span> <span data-start="1601.23" data-end="1602.4">window Bing windows will actually freeze</span> <span data-start="1602.4" data-end="1603.93">once in a while while they're loading</span> <span data-start="1603.93" data-end="1605.4">the Bing site but then once we once</span> <span data-start="1605.4" data-end="1607.17">they've loaded we redirect them back to</span> <span data-start="1607.17" data-end="1608.22">our own domain so that we can continue</span> <span data-start="1608.22" data-end="1611.94">moving them around your screen ok this</span> <span data-start="1611.94" data-end="1614.1">is ok I think this is the last one this</span> <span data-start="1614.1" data-end="1616.95">one is extremely surprising this</span> <span data-start="1616.95" data-end="1618.27">probably sit was going to surprise a lot</span> <span data-start="1618.27" data-end="1624.3">of you so sites that link to two sites</span> <span data-start="1624.3" data-end="1626.28">that include links that open in a new</span> <span data-start="1626.28" data-end="1629.87">tab using target equals underscore blank</span> <span data-start="1629.87" data-end="1632.19">will actually still open links in a new</span> <span data-start="1632.19" data-end="1634.83">window however that new window that has</span> <span data-start="1634.83" data-end="1637.95">been opened has a variable set called</span> <span data-start="1637.95" data-end="1641.25">window opener and that references the</span> <span data-start="1641.25" data-end="1643.98">window that opened it this only happens</span> <span data-start="1643.98" data-end="1645.6">if your so if your site has been opened</span> <span data-start="1645.6" data-end="1647.01">in a new tab you can check window dot</span> <span data-start="1647.01" data-end="1649.08">opener and that will be a pointer to</span> <span data-start="1649.08" data-end="1651.92">that window that opened to you okay so</span> <span data-start="1651.92" data-end="1653.88">like I said before they're like having a</span> <span data-start="1653.88" data-end="1655.11">pointer to a window on another origin</span> <span data-start="1655.11" data-end="1656.43">doesn't necessarily help you you can't</span> <span data-start="1656.43" data-end="1657.78">really do anything but what you can do</span> <span data-start="1657.78" data-end="1660.78">is redirect it so if anybody links to</span> <span data-start="1660.78" data-end="1663.96">our site the annoying site and it opens</span> <span data-start="1663.96" data-end="1665.22">in a new tab and a lot of site</span> <span data-start="1665.22" data-end="1666.659">do this for example facebook Messenger</span> <span data-start="1666.659" data-end="1667.65">does this when you click a link it'll</span> <span data-start="1667.65" data-end="1669.57">open in a new tab will redirect Facebook</span> <span data-start="1669.57" data-end="1673.47">to ourselves in response so this is how</span> <span data-start="1673.47" data-end="1674.57">you do that</span> <span data-start="1674.57" data-end="1676.59">it's actually really crazy that you can</span> <span data-start="1676.59" data-end="1677.82">do this so you can imagine like hooking</span> <span

data-start="1683.789" data-end="1685.77">bad however there was a way to work</span> <span data-start="1685.77" data-end="1688.559">around this you can add rel equals no</span> <span
