<span data-start="280.569" data-end="282.039">what these things allows you to do is</span> <span data-start="282.039" data-end="284.349">say okay how do I show a number or a</span> <span data-start="284.349" data-end="290.289">date in Arabic or Chinese and again it</span> <span data-start="290.289" data-end="292.509">turns out that a certain group inside</span> <span

data-end="313.93">implementations use the CLD our data so</span> <span data-start="313.93" data-end="317.069">how does this API look like we have a</span> <span data-start="317.069" data-end="320.49">int'l global object with free properties</span> <span data-start="320.49" data-end="323.379">number formats and data format kind of</span> <span data-start="323.379" data-end="325.209">describe themselves and int'l dhadka</span> <span data-start="325.209" data-end="328.18">later is actually an utility for</span> <span data-start="328.18" data-end="331.119">comparing strings so you can for</span> <span data-start="331.119" data-end="335.259">instance sort the fine names in Chinese</span> <span data-start="335.259" data-end="338.83">because it understands how the old utf-8</span> <span data-start="338.83" data-end="341.649">encoding works and how you sort things</span> <span data-start="341.649" data-end="344.83">in Chinese but we're actually not using</span> <span data-start="344.83" data-end="346.899">it at the moment because an</span> <span data-start="346.899" data-end="348.729">implementation in pure JavaScript would</span> <span data-start="348.729" data-end="351.849">be too big you know the algorithm is</span> <span data-start="351.849" data-end="353.229">really large and it requires a lot of</span> <span data-start="353.229" data-end="356.8">data so we realize we can't just use in</span> <span data-start="356.8" data-end="359.289">the browser so for now not gonna talk</span> <span data-start="359.289" data-end="362.639">about it so how do you actually use this</span> <span data-start="362.639" data-end="366.069">well it's really simple you create an</span> <span data-start="366.069" data-end="369.49">instance of int'l number format this</span> <span data-start="369.49" data-end="372.339">instance has format method which taken</span> <span data-start="372.339" data-end="374.229">um takes a number and gives you a string</span> <span data-start="374.229" data-end="376.539">with you know the number formatted</span> <span data-start="376.539" data-end="379.449">correctly if you don't specify anything</span> <span data-start="379.449" data-end="383.019">it will use the locale that the user</span> <span data-start="383.019" data-end="386.139">chose for the system or the browser but</span> <span data-start="386.139" data-end="388.509">you can even specify it if you want so</span> <span data-start="388.509" data-end="390.579">instance if your application has you</span> <span data-start="390.579" data-end="392.74">know an option to change the language of</span> <span data-start="392.74" data-end="396.879">the application say goes for daytime</span> <span data-start="396.879" data-end="399.249">formatting you create an instance of</span> <span data-start="399.249" data-end="402.009">int'l daytime formats it also has a</span> <span data-start="402.009" data-end="403.93">floor admitted with six the date</span> <span data-start="403.93" data-end="406.569">instance and it gives you back a string</span> <span data-start="406.569" data-end="409.029">we know the month in the day in the</span> <span data-start="409.029" data-end="412.69">right order and</span> <span data-start="412.7" data-end="417.53">so again you can specify more options if</span> <span data-start="417.53" data-end="420.56">you want and it'll give you a date</span> <span data-start="420.56" data-end="422.48">format it in a way that's more readable</span> <span data-start="422.48" data-end="424.97">by human you can even include the day of</span> <span data-start="424.97" data-end="428.77">the week or a long version of the month</span> <span data-start="428.77" data-end="433.52">so now that we have this int'l OPI that</span> <span data-start="433.52" data-end="435.56">we know will probably work in both</span> <span data-start="435.56" data-end="437.33">circular browser we start asking</span> <span data-start="437.33" data-end="438.8">ourselves okay so in the context of</span> <span data-start="438.8" data-end="441.8">single page application where do we use</span> <span data-start="441.8" data-end="444.86">it how would have to be use it and so</span> <span data-start="444.86" data-end="447.11">give enough you know standard MVC</span> <span data-start="447.11" data-end="449.6">architecture we start asking ourselves</span> <span data-start="449.6" data-end="452.3">should we use this API in the module</span> <span data-start="452.3" data-end="455.27">well if we feed in the model then we are</span> <span data-start="455.27" data-end="457.82">kind of mixing up this logic between</span> <span data-start="457.82" data-end="460.25">localization with you know the code that</span> <span data-start="460.25" data-end="462.62">actually does netball fetching or</span> <span data-start="462.62" data-end="466.04">database access or input validation so I</span> <span data-start="466.04" data-end="469.64">cannot didn't quite fit there and so</span> <span data-start="469.64" data-end="471.35">what about the controller where the</span> <span data-start="471.35" data-end="473.24">controller actually has your business</span> <span data-start="473.24" data-end="475.01">logic you know the stuff that actually</span> <span data-start="475.01" data-end="476.96">makes your application what you're what</span> <span data-start="476.96" data-end="479.42">it is so why would you put translation</span> <span data-start="479.42" data-end="482.21">go there and when they are realizing</span> <span data-start="482.21" data-end="486.05">that you know there's a parallel to CSS</span> <span data-start="486.05" data-end="489.77">here on HTML in that we're we have raw</span> <span data-start="489.77" data-end="491.48">data that we're trying to present</span> <span data-start="491.48" data-end="494.59">somehow in a specific way to the user</span> <span data-start="494.59" data-end="497.09">the same way that you use media queries</span> <span data-start="497.09" data-end="500.3">to show different styles according to</span> <span data-start="500.3" data-end="503.15">the size of the device and with that in</span> <span data-start="503.15" data-end="506.12">mind with you know this idea of doing</span> <span data-start="506.12" data-end="508.46">things in the view and having servers a</span> <span data-start="508.46" data-end="510.41">train whistle use project we're calling</span> <span data-start="510.41" data-end="514.76">for Matias it's basically a set of</span> <span data-start="514.76" data-end="517.01">integrations with high-level view</span> <span data-start="517.01" data-end="519.56">libraries and you know you can go to</span> <span data-start="519.56" data-end="521.63">format is that I oh and there's a lot of</span> <span data-start="521.63" data-end="524.75">documentation and information there</span> <span data-start="524.75" data-end="527.06">about both the project and the int'l OPI</span> <span data-start="527.06" data-end="530.75">and so as I said we have basically</span> <span data-start="530.75" data-end="534.8">integrations with popular view engines</span> <span data-start="534.8" data-end="536.75">such as template engines like handle</span> <span data-start="536.75" data-end="541.04">version dust or react as Sebastian was</span> <span data-start="541.04" data-end="544.3">mentioning a few moments ago</span> <span data-start="544.3" data-end="546.61">so I want to show you some examples of</span> <span data-start="546.61" data-end="548.65">have these words and having you can use</span> <span data-start="548.65" data-end="551.92">it and I'm going to get them in</span> <span data-start="551.92" data-end="553.48">handlebars because I think it's probably</span> <span data-start="553.48" data-end="556.18">gonna
