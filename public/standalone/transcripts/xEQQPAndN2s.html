data-start="54.129" data-end="56.379">you're up Jace coffin alright so Felix</span> <span data-start="56.379" data-end="59.889">is basically he is very active on node</span> <span data-start="59.889" data-end="62.049">he's one of the first committers he is</span> <span data-start="62.049" data-end="63.579">super super helpful a really nice</span> <span data-start="63.579" data-end="65.68">friendly guy and he was actually going</span> <span data-start="65.68" data-end="68.32">to present this thing called node dirty</span> <span data-start="68.32" data-end="70.75">which is I love it it's a very cool key</span> <span data-start="70.75" data-end="72.85">value store that's basically it says</span> <span data-start="72.85" data-end="73.99">listen we're not going to handle the</span> <span data-start="73.99" data-end="75.189">network thing it's going to be on your</span> <span data-start="75.189" data-end="77.229">machine and it's just JavaScript all the</span> <span data-start="77.229" data-end="78.969">way down so you can use basically like</span> <span data-start="78.969" data-end="80.92">on couch you'd use actually think I've</span> <span data-start="80.92" data-end="84.909">slide for this it's basically so it's no</span> <span data-start="84.909" data-end="87.579">sequel and so basically you have</span> <span data-start="87.579" data-end="89.14">functions and you just iterate over a</span> <span data-start="89.14" data-end="91.42">huge set and it returns Keys and because</span> <span data-start="91.42" data-end="92.649">it doesn't go over the network it's</span> <span data-start="92.649" data-end="95.02">really really fast anyway so he was</span> <span data-start="95.02" data-end="96.49">going to come present this but he</span> <span data-start="96.49" data-end="102.46">totally got volcano but i did find i</span> <span data-start="102.46" data-end="103.869">tried to find a quote of someone who had</span> <span data-start="103.869" data-end="105.729">actually known about dirty i haven't</span> <span data-start="105.729" data-end="108.13">used it as much this is this is the most</span> <span data-start="108.13" data-end="113.28">authoritative opinion i could find but</span> <span data-start="113.28" data-end="115.329">there is one bug if you guys are</span> <span data-start="115.329" data-end="116.38">considering using it in your note</span> <span data-start="116.38" data-end="118.299">install and that is it's not volcano</span> <span data-start="118.299" data-end="121.329">proof so i recommend you guys proceed</span> <span data-start="121.329" data-end="124.299">with caution and in the spirit for Felix</span> <span data-start="124.299" data-end="126.31">because he couldn't be here I would like</span> <span data-start="126.31" data-end="128.89">to if possible record a video of you</span> <span data-start="128.89" data-end="132.19">guys just saying hi so this is he's a</span> <span data-start="132.19" data-end="134.349">huge leap of faith but could I was going</span> <span data-start="134.349" data-end="134.53">to</span> <span data-start="134.53" data-end="136.69">record on this you guys all iphones</span> <span data-start="136.69" data-end="138.819">don't don't gank my phone or turn off</span> <span data-start="138.819" data-end="140.23">can

pass that</span> <span data-start="145.27" data-end="149.65">around and give them a wave all right</span> <span data-start="149.65" data-end="154.15">good all right cool so while they're</span> <span data-start="154.15" data-end="156.489">doing that what I do for a living is</span> <span data-start="156.489" data-end="158.56">actually not code as a living i'm a</span> <span data-start="158.56" data-end="160.36">freelance translator i translate</span> <span data-start="160.36" data-end="162.72">japanese computer manuals into english</span> <span data-start="162.72" data-end="168.19">and so basically all my code is just as</span> <span data-start="168.19" data-end="169.75">a kind of a free time thing hopefully</span> <span data-start="169.75" data-end="171.28">that transition I would actually love to</span> <span data-start="171.28" data-end="173.86">do that in a full-time capacity but in</span> <span data-start="173.86" data-end="176.23">languages i speak two languages but a</span> <span data-start="176.23" data-end="178.84">code i'm really a mana glad I all I do</span> <span data-start="178.84" data-end="180.459">is JavaScript and I I don't want to get</span> <span data-start="180.459" data-end="182.11">blend back on you but I really love</span> <span data-start="182.11" data-end="185.17">javascript and i really love lots of the</span> <span data-start="185.17" data-end="186.76">parts about it some things i've built</span> <span data-start="186.76" data-end="189.01">before so basically before node and you</span> <span data-start="189.01" data-end="190.39">want to build an app that's like a pure</span> <span data-start="190.39" data-end="193.81">app that's only javascript basically you</span> <span data-start="193.81" data-end="196.959">end up doing bookmarklets so i did a</span> <span data-start="196.959" data-end="199.48">whole ton of bookmarklets the first</span> <span data-start="199.48" data-end="201.34">one i did was text Banda I think these</span> <span data-start="201.34" data-end="202.48">are still up so you can check them if</span> <span data-start="202.48" data-end="204.489">you want text banda is like if you guys</span> <span data-start="204.489" data-end="206.799">text expander you seen this thing it's</span> <span data-start="206.799" data-end="208.12">the same thing but it's for the web it's</span> <span data-start="208.12" data-end="209.47">a bookmarklet so you go to any webpage</span> <span data-start="209.47" data-end="211.09">you get this little bookmarklet you go</span> <span data-start="211.09" data-end="213.01">to any web page and you can save your</span> <span data-start="213.01" data-end="214.72">own like shortcuts so if you go to a web</span> <span data-start="214.72" data-end="216.01">page and you click this button and you</span> <span data-start="216.01" data-end="217.69">start typing it'll automatically expand</span> <span data-start="217.69" data-end="219.94">the things that you define into whatever</span> <span data-start="219.94" data-end="220.959">phrases so you can check that out</span> <span data-start="220.959" data-end="222.9">another thing i build is called typed in</span> <span data-start="222.9" data-end="225.519">this is basically a japanese input</span> <span data-start="225.519" data-end="227.62">method editor that's purely web-based so</span> <span data-start="227.62" data-end="229.09">even if you're like an internet cafe and</span> <span data-start="229.09" data-end="230.5">you want to type in japanese for some</span> <span data-start="230.5" data-end="232.329">reason to your clients who you know</span> <span data-start="232.329" data-end="233.92">you're late giving translations for for</span> <span data-start="233.92" data-end="235.84">example you can just go to any web page</span> <span data-start="235.84" data-end="237.04">click this bookmarklet and all the</span> <span data-start="237.04" data-end="238.359">sudden you can type in japanese even if</span> <span data-start="238.359" data-end="239.859">the OS doesn't allow it doesn't have an</span> <span data-start="239.859" data-end="241.69">input method eter another thing I built</span> <span data-start="241.69" data-end="243.01">the last thing I built was called paste</span> <span data-start="243.01" data-end="244.09">bud some of you guys may actually you</span> <span data-start="244.09" data-end="246.64">have used this this is a copy and paste</span> <span data-start="246.64" data-end="247.93">for the iPhone before the iphone had</span> <span data-start="247.93" data-end="249.7">copy and paste and basically it was a</span> <span data-start="249.7" data-end="253.6">monster javascript hack using basically</span> <span data-start="253.6" data-end="256.06">you know some tenuous very small server</span> <span data-start="256.06" data-end="259.18">code and a bookmarklet to pull text and</span> <span data-start="259.18" data-end="262.81">actually give you this pseudo totally</span> <span data-start="262.81" data-end="264.43">faked out selectable web page where you</span> <span data-start="264.43" data-end="266.19">could copy text and then send to people</span> <span data-start="266.19" data-end="268.33">but the problem is all these</span> <span data-start="268.33" data-end="270.43">projects required are we done all right</span> <span data-start="270.43" data-end="272.56">cool thank you all of these projects</span> <span data-start="272.56" data-end="274.659">required a little bit of server-side</span> <span data-start="274.659" data-end="276.879">code and I you know I just I'm not I'm</span> <span data-start="276.879" data-end="278.919">not a ruby guy and I really just want to</span> <span data-start="278.919" data-end="280.24">use JavaScript all the way down and so</span> <span data-start="280.24" data-end="282.219">when note came out I was like ecstatic</span> <span data-start="282.219" data-end="283.78">and I wanted for all these things to</span> <span data-start="283.78" data-end="285.28">build some sort of back-end and so</span> <span data-start="285.28" data-end="287.949">that's where fab comes in so let me tell</span> <span data-start="287.949" data-end="291.909">you about fab so first of all fab is a</span> <span data-start="291.909" data-end="293.229">web framework I'm sure you guys are</span> <span data-start="293.229" data-end="296.379">familiar with how those work so just to</span> <span data-start="296.379" data-end="297.669">give you a sense of what it does I'm</span> <span data-start="297.669" data-end="298.78">going to compare it to other things you</span> <span data-start="298.78" data-end="300.639">might know so for example it's small</span> <span data-start="300.639" data-end="303.219">it's more web di than Django it's just</span> <span data-start="303.219" data-end="305.5">tiny it's it's one function and the</span> <span data-start="305.5" data-end="307.3">small library of functions it doesn't</span> <span data-start="307.3" data-end="309.849">try to manage a huge thing it basically</span> <span data-start="309.849" data-end="311.44">starts small and lets you build on top</span> <span data-start="311.44" data-end="316.03">of it next is it's more rack and Sinatra</span> <span data-start="316.03" data-end="316.93">it's not just really good at building</span> <span data-start="316.93" data-end="318.849">endpoints but not good at connecting</span> <span data-start="318.849" data-end="321.31">them together Sinatra relies on rack to</span> <span data-start="321.31" data-end="322.84">connect all of these small apps together</span> <span data-start="322.84" data-end="324.099">and more people are moving to that kind</span> <span data-start="324.099" data-end="325.99">of modular style where you build a you</span> <span data-start="325.99" data-end="328.029">build an app and ryanne Sinatra and use</span> <span data-start="328.029" data-end="329.979">rack to connect them so fab is a lot</span> <span data-start="329.979" data-end="331.569">like rack in that you build these tiny</span> <span data-start="331.569" data-end="334.65">apps and all it does is connect them</span> <span data-start="334.65" data-end="337.599">it's agnostic so it's more Merv than</span> <span data-start="337.599" data-end="339.759">rails to everything is totally optional</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="339.759" data-end="341.919">I don't you know I mean you can swap</span> <span data-start="341.919" data-end="343.389">whatever you out whatever you want out</span> <span data-start="343.389" data-end="345.129">these the things that are provided with</span> <span data-start="345.129" data-end="347.71">fab are only defaults not necessarily at</span> <span data-start="347.71" data-end="348.819">all and they're all very loosely</span> <span data-start="348.819" data-end="351.19">connected finally it's extinct it's more</span> <span data-start="351.19" data-end="354.099">jQuery than ue it's basically you know</span> <span data-start="354.099" data-end="356.469">instead of having lots of methods it</span> <span data-start="356.469" data-end="358">basically you give it anything and it</span> <span data-start="358" data-end="358.99">based on what you give it it</span> <span data-start="358.99" data-end="360.58">disambiguate so what you need to do with</span> <span data-start="360.58" data-end="364.389">it so I was very inspired by a genre sex</span> <span data-start="364.389" data-end="366.61">not only is training style but you know</span> <span data-start="366.61" data-end="369.24">this kind of let's keep it keep a terse</span> <span data-start="369.24" data-end="372.159">and it's built on the good part so if</span> <span data-start="372.159" data-end="373.509">you guys love functional programming</span> <span data-start="373.509" data-end="375.279">like I do you are gonna like fab because</span> <span data-start="375.279" data-end="376.96">everything is functions you write</span> <span data-start="376.96" data-end="379.06">functions that return functions and all</span> <span data-start="379.06" data-end="380.83">fab is is just one function there's no</span> <span data-start="380.83" data-end="384.4">prototypes there's no methods all state</span> <span data-start="384.4" data-end="385.93">is decentralized so usually you have an</span> <span data-start="385.93" data-end="387.55">app and you're like a drought a drought</span> <span data-start="387.55" data-end="389.529">do this it doesn't do any of that fab</span> <span data-start="389.529" data-end="391.389">knows nothing about your appt the apps</span> <span data-start="391.389" data-end="393.159">are responsible for storing the state of</span> <span data-start="393.159" data-end="396.789">the HTTP in the app using closures also</span> <span data-start="396.789" data-end="398.77">callbacks fab is completely you can't do</span> <span data-start="398.77" data-end="401.06">a synchronous app with babbitt's only</span> <span data-start="401.06" data-end="403.49">asynchronous and that's a compromise but</span> <span data-start="403.49" data-end="404.96">what it means is that because it's</span> <span data-start="404.96" data-end="406.58">asynchronous all the way down it becomes</span> <span data-start="406.58" data-end="407.84">much easier to build things you don't</span> <span data-start="407.84" data-end="410.06">have special cases if it's synchronous</span> <span data-start="410.06" data-end="413.6">or not and it's it uses currying lot so</span> <span data-start="413.6" data-end="415.639">basically arity as a type system by</span> <span data-start="415.639" data-end="419.3">which i mean every app has an era t that</span> <span data-start="419.3" data-end="421.46">era t is how many apps it talks to so</span> <span data-start="421.46" data-end="423.2">every app takes arguments those</span> <span data-start="423.2" data-end="425">arguments are just other apps so</span> <span data-start="425" data-end="427.46">everything is a nap in the system I can</span> <span data-start="427.46" data-end="429.53">show you a little more about that so fab</span> <span data-start="429.53" data-end="431.389">as a function it's a tiny little</span> <span data-start="431.389" data-end="433.7">function and all it does is glue stuff</span> <span data-start="433.7" data-end="437.18">together it's you know this small</span> <span data-start="437.18" data-end="438.29">function that's actually probably going</span> <span data-start="438.29" data-end="439.37">to change it might actually get smaller</span> <span data-start="439.37" data-end="440.66">because there's some stuff I can take</span> <span data-start="440.66" data-end="442.669">out of it it's chainable so if you guys</span> <span data-start="442.669" data-end="444.44">like jQuery chaining as much as I do</span> <span data-start="444.44" data-end="446.78">this chains but instead of using methods</span> <span data-start="446.78" data-end="448.81">it returns a function so what I mean is</span> <span data-start="448.81" data-end="450.8">usually if you guys use jQuery used to</span> <span data-start="450.8" data-end="452">chaining what happens is you select</span> <span data-start="452" data-end="453.38">something do a method it returns the</span> <span data-start="453.38" data-end="454.7">jQuery object you select something it</span> <span data-start="454.7" data-end="456.169">doesn't write this is a function that</span> <span data-start="456.169" data-end="458.51">returns itself so the function chains to</span> <span data-start="458.51" data-end="459.86">itself and so there's no methods and so</span> <span data-start="459.86" data-end="461.99">what ends up being is just a whole mess</span> <span data-start="461.99" data-end="463.639">of parenthesis but you'll see how that</span> <span data-start="463.639" data-end="466.01">works and it's dumb so it has no it has</span> <span data-start="466.01" data-end="468.05">no logic it has no logic about apps all</span> <span data-start="468.05" data-end="469.1">it does is just connect your apps</span> <span data-start="469.1" data-end="473.03">together and by app this is the this is</span> <span data-start="473.03" data-end="474.53">the hello world app right it's very</span> <span data-start="474.53" data-end="475.64">small I'm actually going to go into the</span> <span data-start="475.64" data-end="477.86">depth a little bit later but that's</span> <span data-start="477.86" data-end="480.53">basically the smallest you can get with</span> <span data-start="480.53" data-end="483.8">fab and so what a nap a nap is just a</span> <span data-start="483.8" data-end="485.27">function the Curry's so it can either be</span> <span data-start="485.27" data-end="486.95">a response or it can return a function</span> <span data-start="486.95" data-end="489.32">that returns response or it can return a</span> <span data-start="489.32" data-end="490.43">function that return a function that</span> <span data-start="490.43" data-end="492.35">returns a response and we'll talk about</span> <span data-start="492.35" data-end="494.33">how that works it manages its own state</span> <span data-start="494.33" data-end="496.28">that doesn't there's no like unlike</span> <span data-start="496.28" data-end="497.81">jQuery like jQuery would keep events</span> <span data-start="497.81" data-end="499.19">somewhere and you can access that you</span> <span data-start="499.19" data-end="501.83">cannot introspect a fab application</span> <span data-start="501.83" data-end="505.25">because basically all apps are just very</span> <span data-start="505.25" data-end="507.35">tiny apps that do one thing and they</span> <span data-start="507.35" data-end="509.479">have they're totally isolated so they</span> <span data-start="509.479" data-end="510.77">can only see their neighbor apps they</span> <span data-start="510.77" data-end="512.209">can't refer to any sort of central state</span> <span data-start="512.209" data-end="513.65">the only central state that app would</span> <span data-start="513.65" data-end="516.11">have access to is the fab function which</span> <span data-start="516.11" data-end="518.12">is basically acts as a namespace for all</span> <span data-start="518.12" data-end="520.31">of these other apps so the fab source</span> <span data-start="520.31" data-end="521.57">looks like this this is basically the</span> <span data-start="521.57" data-end="523.25">source code looks like it's a function</span> <span data-start="523.25" data-end="525.38">at the top and then there's all of these</span> <span data-start="525.38" data-end="527.15">default apps that you can use if you</span> <span data-start="527.15" data-end="528.74">want to and you don't have to and at the</span> <span data-start="528.74" data-end="530.03">end there's defaults like if you see a</span> <span data-start="530.03" data-end="533.15">regex you know use this app this default</span> <span data-start="533.15" data-end="533.99">path app</span> <span data-start="533.99" data-end="535.37">provided by fab if you see a number</span> <span data-start="535.37" data-end="537.98">return a status that's and you can</span> <span data-start="537.98" data-end="539.93">totally override those two and so</span> <span data-start="539.93" data-end="541.61">basically what that means is and this is</span> <span data-start="541.61" data-end="543.11">probably the most salient slide for</span> <span data-start="543.11" data-end="544.91">someone who has never seen fab your apps</span> <span data-start="544.91" data-end="547.55">look like this which is kind of drawing</span> <span data-start="547.55" data-end="549.38">at the beginning what I wanted to do is</span> <span data-start="549.38" data-end="552.14">have your coat and this is valid this is</span> <span data-start="552.14" data-end="553.31">valid JavaScript code this literally</span> <span data-start="553.31" data-end="555.2">execute just as is there's no definition</span> <span data-start="555.2" data-end="557.33">language but I wanted fab to look like</span> <span data-start="557.33" data-end="560.27">markup so you're basically when you code</span> <span data-start="560.27" data-end="562.339">your site your site looks like a sitemap</span> <span data-start="562.339" data-end="565.459">and so you know everything here is you</span> <span data-start="565.459" data-end="567.26">can see these prints so we at the top</span> <span data-start="567.26" data-end="570.2">where fab equals require fab so we set</span> <span data-start="570.2" data-end="572.209">you know the fab variable to be this</span> <span data-start="572.209" data-end="575">require and then all of these that's a</span> <span data-start="575" data-end="577.04">regex that does a path and the next</span> <span data-start="577.04" data-end="578.66">thing is a node guess that's just a</span> <span data-start="578.66" data-end="579.86">middleware that adapts it for nodejs</span> <span data-start="579.86" data-end="581.57">then you have a line at path it has your</span> <span data-start="581.57" data-end="583.52">app and then you can say filter on the</span> <span data-start="583.52" data-end="585.26">method post so we only reply to posts</span> <span data-start="585.26" data-end="587.18">you can use templates this is built in</span> <span data-start="587.18" data-end="589.06">this is just wrestling's template engine</span> <span data-start="589.06" data-end="591.41">you know you can actually fetch files</span> <span data-start="591.41" data-end="593.18">from the file system there's also you</span> <span data-start="593.18" data-end="595.85">can proxy HTTP requests you know that's</span> <span data-start="595.85" data-end="597.26">based on node use you can tell by the</span> <span data-start="597.26" data-end="599.42">namespace and then it basically goes</span> <span data-start="599.42" data-end="600.92">through and if nothing matches it we</span> <span data-start="600.92" data-end="602.3">return this and if nothing matches that</span> <span data-start="602.3" data-end="604.22">original path of just a slash it returns</span> <span data-start="604.22" data-end="606.44">a 404 anyway so that's just a very quick</span> <span data-start="606.44" data-end="608.839">what a fab app looks like but basically</span> <span data-start="608.839" data-end="612.32">this is how it works you start off with</span> <span data-start="612.32" data-end="614.779">a request so HTTP someone requests and</span> <span data-start="614.779" data-end="618.2">you reply right so if you have this is</span> <span data-start="618.2" data-end="621.079">basically this whole actually I guess</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="621.079" data-end="623.54">I'll bring the app in so this is this is</span> <span data-start="623.54" data-end="625.07">the browser and this is your app does</span> <span data-start="625.07" data-end="627.2">that make sense so basically if you</span> <span data-start="627.2" data-end="629.54">separate these two things that is</span> <span data-start="629.54" data-end="633.92">inbound and this represents an outbound</span> <span data-start="633.92" data-end="637.19">function so when you to return stuff you</span> <span data-start="637.19" data-end="639.14">call this function and to call stuff</span> <span data-start="639.14" data-end="640.49">further in your app you call that</span> <span data-start="640.49" data-end="642.44">function you'll see how that how that</span> <span data-start="642.44" data-end="646.16">works so basically the idea is when I</span> <span data-start="646.16" data-end="648.589">say that we are defining apps in terms</span> <span data-start="648.589" data-end="650.36">of their arity how many apps they talk</span> <span data-start="650.36" data-end="653.48">to so this app talks to one app just has</span> <span data-start="653.48" data-end="656.39">one little bump there right so I call it</span> <span data-start="656.39" data-end="659">a unary app and so if you have an app</span> <span data-start="659" data-end="662.93">that talks to two apps so here's one</span> <span data-start="662.93" data-end="665.72">that goes out outbound here's one that</span> <span data-start="665.72" data-end="667.18">goes inbound that</span> <span data-start="667.18" data-end="670.51">is a binary app when we call this in rub</span> <span data-start="670.51" data-end="672.7">jargon we call this Middle where but i'm</span> <span data-start="672.7" data-end="673.96">going to traduce one more type of app</span> <span data-start="673.96" data-end="678.31">and that is rather predictably a ternary</span> <span data-start="678.31" data-end="680.74">app so that's an app that talks to one</span> <span data-start="680.74" data-end="683.47">app downstream and two apps upstream and</span> <span data-start="683.47" data-end="685.09">basically what that allows you to do is</span> <span data-start="685.09" data-end="686.53">branching and all sorts of stuff that</span> <span data-start="686.53" data-end="691.12">you'll see so your fab app is just</span> <span data-start="691.12" data-end="692.68">chaining these three kinds of apps</span> <span data-start="692.68" data-end="694.03">together there's nothing else there's no</span> <span data-start="694.03" data-end="695.41">methods there's no setting of anything</span> <span data-start="695.41" data-end="697">you write apps and you just put them</span> <span data-start="697" data-end="698.92">into this like fab connector and out</span> <span data-start="698.92" data-end="700.69">comes a web app that does hopefully what</span> <span data-start="700.69" data-end="705.97">you want it to so it uses currying right</span> <span data-start="705.97" data-end="709">so if you have an appt of 83 and an appt</span> <span data-start="709" data-end="712">of 81 what that means is when those two</span> <span data-start="712" data-end="713.47">apps talk together talk to each other</span> <span data-start="713.47" data-end="715.36">they create a binary app right so that's</span> <span data-start="715.36" data-end="718.99">like currying right likewise if you have</span> <span data-start="718.99" data-end="722.79">a binary app and you connect that to a</span> <span data-start="722.79" data-end="725.47">unary app what you create is another</span> <span data-start="725.47" data-end="727.54">unity app right so it's just simple math</span> <span data-start="727.54" data-end="729.01">right and so the whole idea is that when</span> <span data-start="729.01" data-end="731.05">you have these apps take other apps they</span> <span data-start="731.05" data-end="733.03">end up creating just a simple responder</span> <span data-start="733.03" data-end="734.47">that then is a unary app that can talk</span> <span data-start="734.47" data-end="738.52">to like a web server so very quickly</span> <span data-start="738.52" data-end="740.95">example apps here's hello world I showed</span> <span data-start="740.95" data-end="745.48">you that earlier here is hello world</span> <span data-start="745.48" data-end="747.73">again this time we're calling so</span> <span data-start="747.73" data-end="749.89">basically this in any and any fab app</span> <span data-start="749.89" data-end="752.98">this represents the downstream app so</span> <span data-start="752.98" data-end="754">that's basically whenever you're done</span> <span data-start="754" data-end="755.08">you want to send some information you</span> <span data-start="755.08" data-end="757.18">send it into this and it chains because</span> <span data-start="757.18" data-end="759.61">the downstream app returns a listener</span> <span data-start="759.61" data-end="761.08">that you can then send more stuff to</span> <span data-start="761.08" data-end="763.57">right so first we just send run response</span> <span data-start="763.57" data-end="765.28">you can actually you can actually chain</span> <span data-start="765.28" data-end="766.6">this in San responses it's asynchronous</span> <span data-start="766.6" data-end="768.34">you can just keep sending and then when</span> <span data-start="768.34" data-end="770.71">you see this empty thing if you're</span> <span data-start="770.71" data-end="771.94">sending nothing and when you send</span> <span data-start="771.94" data-end="773.44">nothing that means I'm done you can</span> <span data-start="773.44" data-end="775.09">close this so it's very important for</span> <span data-start="775.09" data-end="776.44">asynchronous stuff when you say you're</span> <span data-start="776.44" data-end="778.18">done it can close it and then deliver</span> <span data-start="778.18" data-end="780.13">the response so there's a parallelism</span> <span data-start="780.13" data-end="782.92">here if you if the if the upstream app</span> <span data-start="782.92" data-end="784.93">wants to say I'm done it returns it</span> <span data-start="784.93" data-end="787.12">sends nothing if the downstream app</span> <span data-start="787.12" data-end="788.41">wants to say I'm not interested in what</span> <span data-start="788.41" data-end="790">you have to say anymore it returns</span> <span data-start="790" data-end="791.53">nothing I eat it doesn't return a</span> <span data-start="791.53" data-end="792.79">listener does that make sense so it's</span> <span data-start="792.79" data-end="794.74">that parallel is kind of nice so here's</span> <span data-start="794.74" data-end="796.32">another thing this is just a jiske style</span> <span data-start="796.32" data-end="798.52">response so basically whenever you send</span> <span data-start="798.52" data-end="800.56">response it's optional you can send just</span> <span data-start="800.56" data-end="801.01">a status</span> <span data-start="801.01" data-end="802.57">you can send just headers you can send</span> <span data-start="802.57" data-end="803.86">just a body but you can send full</span> <span data-start="803.86" data-end="808.27">responses like this for example here's</span> <span data-start="808.27" data-end="810.13">hello world so it's asynchronous so you</span> <span data-start="810.13" data-end="813.25">can do stuff like this and let's skip</span> <span data-start="813.25" data-end="816.82">one here is oh okay so basically when</span> <span data-start="816.82" data-end="818.77">you have because your app is only it</span> <span data-start="818.77" data-end="820.27">only sees other apps so how do you know</span> <span data-start="820.27" data-end="822.46">like for example where do we put stuff</span> <span data-start="822.46" data-end="824.68">like the method or the URL and that</span> <span data-start="824.68" data-end="826.9">stuff basically is you call a nap so</span> <span data-start="826.9" data-end="828.58">what we're doing here is hello world 5</span> <span data-start="828.58" data-end="830.41">is returning a function that's a</span> <span data-start="830.41" data-end="832.39">listener for the downstream app that can</span> <span data-start="832.39" data-end="834.34">then call that function again right and</span> <span data-start="834.34" data-end="836.35">so when it calls it we have this thing</span> <span data-start="836.35" data-end="838">that we do and we you know talk we</span> <span data-start="838" data-end="840.04">basically echo the name of the path the</span> <span data-start="840.04" data-end="841.45">first thing that scent is the head that</span> <span data-start="841.45" data-end="844.27">contains the method the URL the headers</span> <span data-start="844.27" data-end="845.92">and the next thing that our centers body</span> <span data-start="845.92" data-end="847.45">so as long as you return something</span> <span data-start="847.45" data-end="849.37">here's another example as long as you</span> <span data-start="849.37" data-end="850.45">return a listener you can keep getting</span> <span data-start="850.45" data-end="853">events right so for example this is a</span> <span data-start="853" data-end="854.62">working app and all this stuff is is on</span> <span data-start="854.62" data-end="857.02">the fab site you can run this code all</span> <span data-start="857.02" data-end="858.4">this does it tells you how many bytes</span> <span data-start="858.4" data-end="860.32">have been sent right so that's just it</span> <span data-start="860.32" data-end="861.52">just keeps returning a listener and it</span> <span data-start="861.52" data-end="863.95">keeps counting the bites so those are</span> <span data-start="863.95" data-end="865.9">all unary apps so if you want to show</span> <span data-start="865.9" data-end="868.42">you a binary app here's an example so</span> <span data-start="868.42" data-end="870.67">here's an example of a binary app which</span> <span data-start="870.67" data-end="873.19">is middleware that takes a nap and when</span> <span data-start="873.19" data-end="875.14">that app is called it increments a</span> <span data-start="875.14" data-end="877.15">counter and then it calls that app does</span> <span data-start="877.15" data-end="878.44">that make sense so this this last line</span> <span data-start="878.44" data-end="880.57">is probably oops the most important</span> <span data-start="880.57" data-end="883.48">return app call this so you're taking</span> <span data-start="883.48" data-end="886.48">this this upstream app you're calling it</span> <span data-start="886.48" data-end="889.24">with this this in this case is the</span> <span data-start="889.24" data-end="890.89">downstream map so you're connecting</span> <span data-start="890.89" data-end="892.57">those two together so what that means is</span> <span data-start="892.57" data-end="894.82">middleware there's no overhead of like</span> <span data-start="894.82" data-end="895.81">for example middleware if you're</span> <span data-start="895.81" data-end="897.43">constantly shuttling stuff between the</span> <span data-start="897.43" data-end="899.02">upstream app in the downstream app with</span> <span data-start="899.02" data-end="899.95">this you don't have to do that because</span> <span data-start="899.95" data-end="902.44">basically when you return the listener</span> <span data-start="902.44" data-end="904.09">that this guy returns what you're doing</span> <span data-start="904.09" data-end="905.08">is you're connecting those two apps</span> <span data-start="905.08" data-end="906.88">immediately and so you don't have access</span> <span data-start="906.88" data-end="908.62">to that communication anymore which is</span> <span data-start="908.62" data-end="909.61">nice because you can avoid a lot of</span> <span data-start="909.61" data-end="911.44">overhead that way so here's an example</span> <span data-start="911.44" data-end="913.21">of a Turner app here's an app called</span> <span data-start="913.21" data-end="915.25">only Tuesday all right it has to</span> <span data-start="915.25" data-end="918.34">upstream apps yes and no and if it's</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="918.34" data-end="920.26">Tuesday it'll go to the S app and if</span> <span data-start="920.26" data-end="921.61">it's not Tuesday it'll go to the no app</span> <span data-start="921.61" data-end="923.74">so this is an example how you can use a</span> <span data-start="923.74" data-end="925.54">turning out to do switching and this is</span> <span data-start="925.54" data-end="928.21">for example how node for them sorry fab</span> <span data-start="928.21" data-end="930.52">has no idea of a router all a router is</span> <span

data-end="938.27">pattern that matches the path you give</span> <span data-start="938.27" data-end="940.46">it a matches and in non matches app and</span> <span data-start="940.46" data-end="942.08">basically if it matches it'll dish out</span> <span data-start="942.08" data-end="943.61">to either one so a router is just</span> <span data-start="943.61" data-end="945.28">chaining those Turner apps together</span> <span data-start="945.28" data-end="947.36">which you'll see so I'm going to start</span> <span data-start="947.36" data-end="949.13">with three examples here's hello world</span> <span data-start="949.13" data-end="951.92">here's datetime here's rather focus</span> <span data-start="951.92" data-end="953.21">actually change the name of these forgot</span> <span data-start="953.21" data-end="954.65">to change the slide but you can see that</span> <span data-start="954.65" data-end="955.97">we're going to build stuff it's very</span> <span data-start="955.97" data-end="957.11">very modular and i'm going to show you</span> <span data-start="957.11" data-end="959.03">one by one how it actually works and you</span> <span data-start="959.03" data-end="960.47">can actually fall around follow along if</span> <span data-start="960.47" data-end="961.91">you want if you have knowed installed</span> <span data-start="961.91" data-end="965.51">the latest version of node please you</span> <span data-start="965.51" data-end="967.93">can you can run this as i'm going so</span> <span data-start="967.93" data-end="971.06">starting with the first app hello Jas so</span> <span data-start="971.06" data-end="972.95">we want an app that does this if you</span> <span data-start="972.95" data-end="975.32">call root it returns a 404 if you call</span> <span data-start="975.32" data-end="977.45">hello it returns hello world and if you</span> <span data-start="977.45" data-end="979.73">call hello with any sort of variable</span> <span data-start="979.73" data-end="981.26">after hello it'll work just echo that</span> <span data-start="981.26" data-end="982.7">variable back to you right so here's</span> <span data-start="982.7" data-end="985.25">what this app looks like in fab here's</span> <span data-start="985.25" data-end="986.84">the node boilerplate right for running a</span> <span data-start="986.84" data-end="989.87">server we're going to add see we have</span> <span data-start="989.87" data-end="992.21">fab up there and it's calling 404 right</span> <span data-start="992.21" data-end="993.98">so this says whenever you call just</span> <span data-start="993.98" data-end="995.24">returned a 404 that's not very</span> <span data-start="995.24" data-end="997.7">interesting let's add some middleware</span> <span data-start="997.7" data-end="999.26">here is the middleware that allows you</span> <span data-start="999.26" data-end="1001.42">to use this on node and it's just knowed</span> <span data-start="1001.42" data-end="1002.95">middle with the adapter for node is</span> <span data-start="1002.95" data-end="1004.18">there's no magic it's just another</span> <span data-start="1004.18" data-end="1005.56">binary app that connects two things</span> <span data-start="1005.56" data-end="1007.09">together in this case it'll turn your</span> <span data-start="1007.09" data-end="1009.76">app into a node compatible listener all</span> <span data-start="1009.76" data-end="1011.56">right so now let's add a ternary app so</span> <span data-start="1011.56" data-end="1013.69">this is a regex pattern it calls a nap</span> <span data-start="1013.69" data-end="1016.48">on fab called fab path and basically if</span> <span data-start="1016.48" data-end="1018.37">it matches this path it dishes out this</span> <span data-start="1018.37" data-end="1020.77">way otherwise dishes out this way does</span> <span data-start="1020.77" data-end="1022.72">that make sense I'm talking really fast</span> <span data-start="1022.72" data-end="1024.67">anyone any questions feel free to shout</span> <span data-start="1024.67" data-end="1027.1">out any time I haven't timed this so I</span> <span data-start="1027.1" data-end="1028.9">if I'm going over please give me like a</span> <span data-start="1028.9" data-end="1031.15">five-minute or something ok cool so now</span> <span data-start="1031.15" data-end="1033.43">we're gonna now we're going to turn this</span> <span data-start="1033.43" data-end="1035.41">string so as you can see at any point</span> <span data-start="1035.41" data-end="1037.03">you can see whether your app is complete</span> <span data-start="1037.03" data-end="1038.89">because there's no bumps and there's no</span> <span data-start="1038.89" data-end="1041.08">divots right so this whole thing is well</span> <span data-start="1041.08" data-end="1043.66">connected what that means is if thing if</span> <span data-start="1043.66" data-end="1044.92">it starts at hello we're going to turn</span> <span data-start="1044.92" data-end="1046.51">this string which you'll see obviously</span> <span data-start="1046.51" data-end="1048.13">is going to be a template and if not</span> <span data-start="1048.13" data-end="1049.72">we're going to turn a 404 so let's</span> <span data-start="1049.72" data-end="1051.49">actually fill that template in so now we</span> <span data-start="1051.49" data-end="1053.38">have this rustic real simple template</span> <span data-start="1053.38" data-end="1054.85">engine so now I'm actually going to</span> <span data-start="1054.85" data-end="1056.14">render that string but now you can see</span> <span data-start="1056.14" data-end="1057.61">we have a little thinner our app is not</span> <span data-start="1057.61" data-end="1060.28">complete so what if it doesn't if it if</span> <span data-start="1060.28" data-end="1062.47">it matches hello we're going to put this</span> <span data-start="1062.47" data-end="1064.75">here right so now this app is complete</span> <span data-start="1064.75" data-end="1067.24">we have world so this world gets passed</span> <span data-start="1067.24" data-end="1067.79">to this the</span> <span data-start="1067.79" data-end="1069.47">which renders it right and so now our</span> <span data-start="1069.47" data-end="1071.09">app is complete so now all this is if</span> <span data-start="1071.09" data-end="1073.28">you hit the route you will get a 44 if</span> <span data-start="1073.28" data-end="1074.57">you at hello you will get a hello world</span> <span data-start="1074.57" data-end="1076.22">that's not very interesting so let's put</span> <span data-start="1076.22" data-end="1077.21">the name in so we're going to put in</span> <span data-start="1077.21" data-end="1078.95">another ternary app again this is just a</span> <span data-start="1078.95" data-end="1081.44">path app this has a regular expression</span> <span data-start="1081.44" data-end="1082.91">and you'll see there's parentheses it'll</span> <span data-start="1082.91" data-end="1084.59">capture what's in the parentheses and</span> <span data-start="1084.59" data-end="1086.6">then there's a fab app called fab</span> <span data-start="1086.6" data-end="1089.09">capture it'll return that value right so</span> <span data-start="1089.09" data-end="1090.77">this is so basically here's this ternary</span> <span data-start="1090.77" data-end="1093.05">app right here and if it doesn't match a</span> <span data-start="1093.05" data-end="1094.97">return world and if it does match it'll</span> <span data-start="1094.97" data-end="1096.68">return whatever is captured right that's</span> <span data-start="1096.68" data-end="1099.65">how we that's we built that app any</span> <span data-start="1099.65" data-end="1103.01">questions all right sorry all right</span> <span data-start="1103.01" data-end="1105.2">here's another app date this one's kind</span> <span data-start="1105.2" data-end="1107.93">of stupid basically if I get root return</span> <span data-start="1107.93" data-end="1111.71">a JSON encoded date object if I get date</span> <span data-start="1111.71" data-end="1113.93">format that into a date and if i get</span> <span data-start="1113.93" data-end="1115.91">time form of that into time ok so this</span> <span data-start="1115.91" data-end="1118.84">is how this app works no boilerplate</span> <span data-start="1118.84" data-end="1121.67">we're going to turn a new date so this</span> <span data-start="1121.67" data-end="1124.22">is a date and so basically if fab see</span> <span data-start="1124.22" data-end="1125.54">something that's not a function by</span> <span data-start="1125.54" data-end="1127.28">default it returns it as a body so we</span> <span data-start="1127.28" data-end="1128.54">take this date and we put it in the body</span> <span data-start="1128.54" data-end="1130.88">and return as a response but we need the</span> <span data-start="1130.88" data-end="1133.37">note adapter and we actually let's say</span> <span data-start="1133.37" data-end="1135.14">in this case we want a Content like so</span> <span data-start="1135.14" data-end="1136.31">we have a Content like plugin that's</span> <span data-start="1136.31" data-end="1138.44">renewed and if this case we also want</span> <span data-start="1138.44" data-end="1140.24">stringify it you can't return right node</span> <span data-start="1140.24" data-end="1141.98">needs you return a string so we have an</span> <span data-start="1141.98" data-end="1143.33">app that just all it does it just dish</span> <span data-start="1143.33" data-end="1145.04">out string fine all right so now this is</span> <span data-start="1145.04" data-end="1146.6">a working app ok but it's not very</span> <span data-start="1146.6" data-end="1148.58">interesting so let's add date and time</span> <span data-start="1148.58" data-end="1149.72">these are two paths and now we've</span> <span data-start="1149.72" data-end="1150.92">created two divots we need to fill those</span> <span data-start="1150.92" data-end="1152.86">in we're going to fill them in with</span> <span data-start="1152.86" data-end="1155.48">these strings again these are going to</span> <span data-start="1155.48" data-end="1156.65">be template strings and we're just</span> <span data-start="1156.65" data-end="1159.23">calling the these methods of the date</span> <span data-start="1159.23" data-end="1162.89">object native JavaScript all right so</span> <span data-start="1162.89" data-end="1164.39">lets you know for those who actually</span> <span data-start="1164.39" data-end="1166.25">want to put a template in right so</span> <span data-start="1166.25" data-end="1167.93">basically all template does is this it</span> <span data-start="1167.93" data-end="1170.03">talks to two apps this is why a template</span> <span data-start="1170.03" data-end="1171.14">is usually you think of a template as</span> <span data-start="1171.14" data-end="1173.3">binary it's Turner II this is why the</span> <span data-start="1173.3" data-end="1174.74">first app it calls is the template</span> <span data-start="1174.74" data-end="1176.66">string so what this means is it's</span> <span data-start="1176.66" data-end="1178.19">agnostic you can put a string in there</span> <span data-start="1178.19" data-end="1179.84">or you can dish out to a file it doesn't</span> <span data-start="1179.84" data-end="1181.55">matter all that app knows is that when</span> <span data-start="1181.55" data-end="1183.41">it calls the first app it's going to get</span> <span data-start="1183.41" data-end="1185.21">back a string right and so it uses that</span> <span data-start="1185.21" data-end="1186.47">to creative function and it caches that</span> <span data-start="1186.47" data-end="1188.66">function so all subsequent requests from</span> <span data-start="1188.66" data-end="1190.07">the second app are going to go through</span> <span data-start="1190.07" data-end="1192.65">that function all right so here's the</span> <span data-start="1192.65" data-end="1194.78">thing for both of these we want to pass</span> <span data-start="1194.78" data-end="1196.46">a date but we've already cleared the</span> <span data-start="1196.46" data-end="1197.99">date down here now what you could do is</span> <span data-start="1197.99" data-end="1199.49">you could put new day new date right</span> <span data-start="1199.49" data-end="1201.32">here but what actually fab lets you do</span> <span data-start="1201.32" data-end="1201.59">is</span> <span data-start="1201.59" data-end="1203.72">leave it empty and what that does is</span> <span data-start="1203.72" data-end="1206.48">whatever comes next to pass that all</span> <span data-start="1206.48" data-end="1208.909">right so what this means is this both is</span> <span data-start="1208.909" data-end="1209.929">going to be this is gonna be filled with</span> <span data-start="1209.929" data-end="1211.429">this date does that make sense so you</span> <span data-start="1211.429" data-end="1213.169">only have to declare the date once so</span> <span data-start="1213.169" data-end="1215.299">we're trying to keep the repetition to a</span> <span data-start="1215.299" data-end="1218.02">minimal so basically think of this as</span> <span data-start="1218.02" data-end="1220.07">optional middleware this middle where is</span> <span data-start="1220.07" data-end="1222.2">only called if it matches this URL does</span> <span data-start="1222.2" data-end="1223.159">that make sense and so it's the same</span> <span data-start="1223.159" data-end="1224.539">data object and just get Brett gets</span> <span data-start="1224.539" data-end="1226.49">rendered differently based on the URL</span> <span data-start="1226.49" data-end="1230.26">all right that makes sense any questions</span> <span data-start="1230.26" data-end="1235.64">all right cool if it matches it'll only</span> <span data-start="1235.64" data-end="1237.83">the first one yeah so that's the idea I</span> <span data-start="1237.83" data-end="1239.39">think of think of a ternary app as a</span> <span data-start="1239.39" data-end="1241.549">ternary operator in JavaScript right if</span> <span data-start="1241.549" data-end="1242.69">you have a bunch of ternary operators in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1242.69" data-end="1243.62">Java Script the first one that gets</span> <span data-start="1243.62" data-end="1244.64">called that rest of the code is not</span> <span data-start="1244.64" data-end="1246.559">evaluated the same thing that make sense</span> <span data-start="1246.559" data-end="1250.669">of it all right so actually let's start</span> <span data-start="1250.669" data-end="1252.86">focus i want to show you it's there's no</span> <span data-start="1252.86" data-end="1254.27">point in showing you stuff that's just</span> <span data-start="1254.27" data-end="1256.48">you know you could do it in Sinatra so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1256.48" data-end="1258.86">I'd like to show you if you can see this</span> <span data-start="1258.86" data-end="1262.85">but I'm gonna take three browsers all</span> <span data-start="1262.85" data-end="1263.99">right and so what i want to i built an</span> <span data-start="1263.99" data-end="1265.429">app called focus and what this app does</span> <span data-start="1265.429" data-end="1268.52">is it's asynchronous it uses long</span> <span data-start="1268.52" data-end="1269.84">polling and i'll show you how it's built</span> <span data-start="1269.84" data-end="1272.21">and basically you open it a bunch of</span> <span data-start="1272.21" data-end="1274.429">browsers and whatever browser has focus</span> <span data-start="1274.429" data-end="1276.529">it gets sent to the rest of the browsers</span> <span data-start="1276.529" data-end="1278.33">so you can well it's probably better</span> <span data-start="1278.33" data-end="1280.64">just to show you alright cool so i'm</span> <span data-start="1280.64" data-end="1282.35">going to call this there's no no magic</span> <span data-start="1282.35" data-end="1283.97">here i'm doing this real time and hope</span> <span data-start="1283.97" data-end="1287.51">it i hope it works open this in all</span> <span data-start="1287.51" data-end="1292.19">these alright cool so you guys can see</span> <span data-start="1292.19" data-end="1296.57">right just by focusing on these apps it</span> <span data-start="1296.57" data-end="1298.52">sends it in real time and if it doesn't</span> <span data-start="1298.52" data-end="1300.14">know the app like for example for coming</span> <span data-start="1300.14" data-end="1301.549">from something it doesn't send a user</span> <span data-start="1301.549" data-end="1309.289">agent it'll what's all well it's</span> <span data-start="1309.289" data-end="1312.08">supposed to say other anyway that's the</span> <span data-start="1312.08" data-end="1314.779">idea so that takes advantage of the node</span> <span data-start="1314.779" data-end="1316.07">makes a star kind of stuff really cool</span> <span data-start="1316.07" data-end="1317.149">right it's like really easy to build</span> <span data-start="1317.149" data-end="1318.95">asynchronous stuff and so but the thing</span> <span data-start="1318.95" data-end="1321.289">is frameworks usually are like the bare</span> <span data-start="1321.289" data-end="1322.82">minimum easy stuff I want to build a</span> <span data-start="1322.82" data-end="1324.08">framework that like lives on a</span> <span data-start="1324.08" data-end="1325.429">synchronous and lets you build stuff</span> <span data-start="1325.429" data-end="1328.64">like this very very easily does everyone</span> <span data-start="1328.64" data-end="1329.48">get what just happened there is that</span> <span data-start="1329.48" data-end="1331.159">cool you understand that right all right</span> <span data-start="1331.159" data-end="1333.36">not too complicated all right</span> <span data-start="1333.36" data-end="1336.48">oh you can oh wow that's a great plan</span> <span data-start="1336.48" data-end="1340.049">thank you for that appreciate it I will</span> <span data-start="1340.049" data-end="1341.549">show you the code for this here's what</span> <span data-start="1341.549" data-end="1344.64">it looks like mm-hmm okay cool no</span> <span data-start="1344.64" data-end="1346.47">boilerplate we're going to return a</span> <span data-start="1346.47" data-end="1349.559">string this is just an HTML string right</span> <span data-start="1349.559" data-end="1351.57">okay this app is done well it's not</span> <span data-start="1351.57" data-end="1353.58">really done because we need the node</span> <span

data-end="1427.86">agnostic about that so now we need to</span> <span data-start="1427.86" data-end="1430.83">send jquery well we can use a file</span> <span data-start="1430.83" data-end="1432.66">system and so this is going to dish out</span> <span data-start="1432.66" data-end="1434.82">to the file system this app is a binary</span> <span data-start="1434.82"

data-end="1446.82">so we're going to call jquery that just</span> <span data-start="1446.82" data-end="1448.86">dishes out to the file system ok all</span> <span data-start="1448.86" data-end="1451.11">right so now this app is complete but</span> <span data-start="1451.11" data-end="1452.73">it's not really because when you focus</span> <span data-start="1452.73" data-end="1454.29">like we're going to call these URLs that</span> <span data-start="1454.29" data-end="1455.88">don't exist so let's put those URLs in</span> <span data-start="1455.88"

data-end="1463.35">here's where this but this is again this</span> <span data-start="1463.35" data-end="1464.429">is like what the cool thing about this</span> <span data-start="1464.429" data-end="1465.78">is it's asynchronous so we have this</span> <span data-start="1465.78" data-end="1466.919">handler and work</span> <span data-start="1466.919" data-end="1468.629">we're just pushing

all</span> <span data-start="1472.32" data-end="1473.46">this is the whole point of long polling</span> <span data-start="1473.46" data-end="1474.899">we're going to respond when something</span> <span data-start="1474.899" data-end="1477.749">changes okay so now we just need to fill</span> <span data-start="1477.749" data-end="1480.359">in the focus part so now I rated this</span> <span data-start="1480.359" data-end="1481.95">function just for this app called</span> <span data-start="1481.95" data-end="1484.799">broadcast and it looks like this it's</span> <span

data-start="1488.999" data-end="1490.44">that returns an array of listeners right</span> <span data-start="1490.44" data-end="1491.19">because we want to keep everything</span> <span data-start="1491.19" data-end="1493.919">within this whole a paradigm it returns</span> <span data-start="1493.919" data-end="1495.48">a response immediately a blank response</span> <span data-start="1495.48" data-end="1496.859">that has nothing in it so it tells it</span> <span data-start="1496.859" data-end="1498.21">like you're done ok so I'll return it</span> <span data-start="1498.21" data-end="1499.32">200 and you don't need to do any more</span> <span data-start="1499.32" data-end="1502.769">then it'll return it'll call the</span> <span data-start="1502.769"

data-end="1511.169">cool thing about about what this does is</span> <span data-start="1511.169" data-end="1513.09">this is now totally reusable we could</span> <span data-start="1513.09" data-end="1514.23">reuse this in another app it's not</span> <span data-start="1514.23" data-end="1515.549">specific to our appt at all because we</span> <span data-start="1515.549" data-end="1517.139">built it as a binary app as middleware</span> <span data-start="1517.139" data-end="1518.789">and not as an app that you know belongs</span> <span data-start="1518.789"
