<p><span data-start="1.64" data-end="21.289">Good morning.</span> <span data-start="21.289" data-end="27.019">So I'm here with good news because we will all be game programmers very soon.</span> <span data-start="27.019" data-end="32.31">So, I'm sure a lot of you like myself got into programming in the first place because</span> <span data-start="32.31" data-end="38.85">you wanted to build the next Mario N the decade it turns out I build a lot more banking apps</span> <span data-start="38.85" data-end="40.32">than Mario.</span> <span data-start="40.32" data-end="49.17">I'm glad it's head bog a dire where we can integrate elements from video games into our</span> <span data-start="49.17" data-end="50.96">apps soon.</span> <span data-start="50.96" data-end="57.5">Not only do I think these techniques are useful that we can get from game development patterns,</span> <span data-start="57.5" data-end="66.509">you'll integrate a few of these thing in the next couple of years.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="66.509" data-end="71.14">This might make a little bit more sense if I explain my double life.</span> <span data-start="71.14" data-end="79.53">During the day I'm the no guy at Heroku, when ever any you file a note ticket, when ever</span> <span data-start="79.53" data-end="86.079">the build pack doesn't work I get yelled at, when people are confused at the Dev documentation,</span> <span data-start="86.079" data-end="93.4">that's my fault,i'm sorry this is my serious work, this is the work that I do that people's</span> <span data-start="93.4" data-end="95.99">livelihood depend on.</span> <span data-start="95.99" data-end="106.61">And so it's kind of a scary, slow development work that I do I do from 9‑5</span> <span data-start="106.61" data-end="112.62">are literally thousands of production apps that people are earning a living with that</span> <span data-start="112.62" data-end="117.99">I can look at and compare, how people are following different patterns, how some companies</span> <span data-start="117.99" data-end="120.34">are successful, while some aren't.</span> <span data-start="120.34" data-end="125.87">There's an interesting talk later how Toyota Europe is going to\h‑‑ is running right</span> <span data-start="125.87" data-end="129.46">now on Heroku, that's by ray Mcdermit, you should check it out.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="129.46" data-end="135.39">I have a unique insight on how people are building Java apps these days because I see</span> <span data-start="135.39" data-end="138">so many of them every day.</span> <span data-start="138" data-end="145.3">That's my day job, at night I work in a less serious way, I work on playful Java script,</span> <span data-start="145.3" data-end="152.659">it doesn't have a purpose or point, it's JavaScript techniques that aren't going to help you pass</span> <span data-start="152.659" data-end="156.83">questions when you're interviewing for a job, nothing that people teach at university.</span> <span data-start="156.83" data-end="163.22">It's stuff I've been interested in since I was a kid,games, graphics, audio, I play with</span> <span data-start="163.22" data-end="171.62">things like procedural generation, I play with stuff like old school 3 D rendering techniques,right,</span> <span data-start="171.62" data-end="177.12">and then, occasionally, very occasionally, some crazy company will pay me to build a</span> <span data-start="177.12" data-end="183.3">game in HTML five, this is a bigger and bigger thing a couple of years ago this wouldn't</span> <span data-start="183.3" data-end="184.3">happen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="184.3" data-end="188.06">Nobody would say, hey you build me a game in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="188.06" data-end="197.049">I'm excited about this, I think it will keep on exceller rating, this is the basis for</span> <span data-start="197.049" data-end="198.4">the talk.</span> <span data-start="198.4" data-end="200.56">And, I'm not an E.</span> <span data-start="200.56" data-end="206.83">pert, right, so I play with things at night, I am an expert at note and running note apps,</span> <span data-start="206.83" data-end="212.68">this is just my hobby, time not a game developer by trade, I love this stuff, and I think more</span> <span data-start="212.68" data-end="219.39">of us are going to become developers by trade over the next couple of years, even if not,</span> <span data-start="219.39" data-end="222.879">it's fun to learn, right, and something I think everybody should try at least once .</span> <span data-start="222.879" data-end="232.9">so, first, why should JavaScript developers, even care what game developers do?</span> <span data-start="232.9" data-end="237.689">It seems like we're worlds a part, they write thing in C plus plus while we write in interpretative</span> <span data-start="237.689" data-end="242.7">language, we're writing on bare metal, and we oar trap in the a browser and they're concerned</span> <span data-start="242.7" data-end="248.17">with players while we're concerned with users, doesn't seem like there's a whole lot of overlap</span> <span data-start="248.17" data-end="249.17">here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="249.17" data-end="255.87">To answer that question, let me take you way, way back to 2008, when J query was still new</span> <span data-start="255.87" data-end="259.28">and popular with everybody.</span> <span data-start="259.28" data-end="265.8">And this is Google maps, in 2008 as usual, pushing I limits of JavaScript this was a</span> <span data-start="265.8" data-end="272.88">cutting edge App, from our current perspective, you can see it was a little bit better than</span> <span data-start="272.88" data-end="279.17">map quest, 2 dimensional, not a lot of interactivity here.</span> <span data-start="279.17" data-end="286.49">Now, here's 2008's grand theft auto, same year, but different piece of software, instead</span> <span data-start="286.49" data-end="294.42">206 D top down camera, you is 3‑D moving cam remarks full textures and shadows, tabbed</span> <span data-start="294.42" data-end="298.58">geometric detail on building is incredible.</span> <span data-start="298.58" data-end="303.57">It's a far cry from the Google maps of the same era.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="303.57" data-end="305.45">Okay.</span> <span data-start="305.45" data-end="311.38">The four years later Google released an update to Google maps, in this new version, you have</span> <span data-start="311.38" data-end="318.6">the 3 D textures geometric details and dynamic shadows, that bringe brings me to the question</span> <span data-start="318.6" data-end="323.84">if you had to put some money on which one of these three apps is most similar, twoe</span> <span data-start="323.84" data-end="330.88">which two have the most similar architecture in my money would be on these two.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="330.88" data-end="338.12">So even though it's the same App, the Google maps of 2013 is a lot closer to a video game</span> <span data-start="338.12" data-end="344.93">grand theft auto of 2008 than to it's predecessor, similar anyely in 2004, anyone den do touch</span> <span data-start="344.93" data-end="348.79">was a big hit.</span> <span data-start="348.79" data-end="352.06">Pioneered what touch can do as a core interaction element.</span> <span data-start="352.06" data-end="357.78">And then in 2007, the iPod touch was also a big hit.</span> <span data-start="357.78" data-end="362.66">And apple is clearly responsible for the fact that nobody younger than me even knows how</span> <span data-start="362.66" data-end="366.78">to use a screen that you can't touch and drag things on.</span> <span data-start="366.78" data-end="372.77">But even though apple is responsible for making it ubiquitous, touch was really pioneer in</span> <span data-start="372.77" data-end="374.5">the the games industry.</span> <span data-start="374.5" data-end="379.82">And, do any of you remember moon patrol?</span> <span data-start="379.82" data-end="382.38">Really,?!</span> <span data-start="382.38" data-end="384.94"Audience member: Great.</span> <span data-start="384.94" data-end="390.57"Audience member: Because I was one‑year‑old when this came out, so I don't remember moon patrol,</span> <span data-start="390.57" data-end="398.37">according to Wikipedia, it was the game that pioneered Paralax, as you move the background</span> <span data-start="398.37" data-end="405.93">scrolled at different speeds to give you an illusion of depth.</span> <span data-start="405.93" data-end="411.55">Now you can't go anywhere without seeing Parallax, you can't hit a stone without hitting somebody</span> <span data-start="411.55" data-end="415.99">that put Parallax on their site, sometimes for guide and sometimes for bad,you know you</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="415.99" data-end="426.33">R decades ago something that became prevalent if games is now becoming popular in the web,</span> <span data-start="426.33" data-end="432.47">this is something you see over and over that games lead all other technologies and push</span> <span data-start="432.47" data-end="438.84">boundaries that we then come in and get to fill, once it's easier to do.</span> <span data-start="438.84" data-end="445.61">Today's game experience leads to tomorrow experience.</span> <span data-start="445.61" data-end="453.15">If you want to see what apps of tomorrow is going on you should look at games today.</span> <span data-start="453.15" data-end="457.89">How they're using to expect interfaces to behave.</span> <span data-start="457.89" data-end="460.24">So ..</span> <span data-start="460.24" data-end="464.64">you can see a lot of other examples, I've given several, every time you use Google docks,</span> <span data-start="464.64" data-end="470.83">you're now sharing virtual environment, this is what games have been doing for decades,</span> <span data-start="470.83" data-end="475.05">now document services are starting to it to, and it's like a big deal.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="475.05" data-end="479.8">So it's important for everybody to learn, of course, I'm not the first person to realize</span> <span data-start="479.8" data-end="488.77">we can learn a lot from game developer, getting spammed by Fam.us, it's a gum engine that</span> <span data-start="488.77" data-end="491.15">allows you the run apps on top of it.</span> <span data-start="491.15" data-end="500.89">Chucked the MVC framework and said we're going to build a crappy game engine, that's what</span> <span data-start="500.89" data-end="505.44">people are running interesting interactive apps with great success.</span> <span data-start="505.44" data-end="511.83">This is my favorite example of how games and Annes are colliding at least in scheme, this</span> <span data-start="511.83" data-end="519.95">is the architecture for doom 3, the important part is the second and third step, the second</span> <span data-start="519.95" data-end="525.39">step, the scene IR, it builds the description of the seen, what you're look at, what you</span> <span data-start="525.39" data-end="532.5">can see, what's in the frame, what's local your character, and fourth step is where it</span> <span data-start="532.5" data-end="540.47">renders it, reverending something in 3 D costs a lot, which operations you chose to render</span> <span data-start="540.47" data-end="546.37">are actually really important, they can make your frame rate faster or slow, in doom 3,</span> <span data-start="546.37" data-end="550.84">they actually figure out exactly which operations they need to pass to the reverend before they</span> <span data-start="550.84" data-end="555.53">render anything to make the application run as quickly as possible this is what I think</span> <span data-start="555.53" data-end="564.34">is really Fucking school, reactjs works the same way, the architecture is identical, so</span> <span data-start="564.34" data-end="570.47">instead of opening jail though the bottle next is the DOM, they build a scene, they</span> <span data-start="570.47" data-end="575.63">do a full scene builder before they run to the DOM that way the scene builder can compute</span> <span data-start="575.63" data-end="583.88">which DOM is faster to render, they're pulling ideas straight out of the world of game development.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="583.88" data-end="584.88">So it's inevitable.</span> <span data-start="584.88" data-end="590.07">You're probably already using some of this stuff today, if you're not, I guarantee you</span> <span data-start="590.07" data-end="596.13">will be, I think this is a great opportunity to become familiar with patterns that game</span> <span data-start="596.13" data-end="600.31">developers have been using for decades, when you build your next App you can have them</span> <span data-start="600.31" data-end="607.99">in your tool set that's the argument for using game techniques inside of apps, the other</span> <span data-start="607.99" data-end="613.12">reason you might want to know about game Dev you might want to build a game, I have great</span> <span data-start="613.12" data-end="618.62">news, there's never been a better time to build games with JavaScript, we have all the</span> <span data-start="618.62" data-end="624.8">basic primitives we need in the form of web APIs to start competing toe to toe with real</span> <span data-start="624.8" data-end="630.24">native experiences the gap thee between JavaScript is closing rapidly.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="630.24" data-end="635.9">I'm really excited about this, so this begs the question: Why isn't everybody doing this?</span> <span data-start="635.9" data-end="642.26">Some people are trying, some early pioneers, this is a gum called poly craft, really Polished</span> <span data-start="642.26" data-end="648.19">3 D game belt in JavaScript, you've probably seen cut the rope, probably one of the most</span> <span data-start="648.19" data-end="650.87">well known HTML 5 game to date.</span> <span data-start="650.87" data-end="657.39">And the reason that there aren't many successful story s is that we lack familiarity, tooling</span> <span data-start="657.39" data-end="660.62">and marketplace.</span> <span data-start="660.62" data-end="666.82">Game develops have a huge tool sets have familiarity with how game are built, and marketplace,e</span> <span data-start="666.82" data-end="673.71">to ship things, we don't have any of these things, I can't address all of these, I'll</span> <span data-start="673.71" data-end="677.85">provide a little familiarity to a group of JavaScripters who might be interested in build</span> <span data-start="677.85" data-end="679.96">ago game one day.</span> <span data-start="679.96" data-end="689.97">We'll look at a couple of web game development techniques, we're going to look at it specifically</span> <span data-start="689.97" data-end="695.75">in JavaScript, all of these techniques can be applied to apps, it takes a little bit</span> <span data-start="695.75" data-end="700.67">more creativity to did that, they can push things forward.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="700.67" data-end="706.26">So,the first part earn to look at when ever you're\h‑‑ pattern to look at is the game</span> <span data-start="706.26" data-end="714.37">loop this is basic core fundamental behind any game since video games were a thing.</span> <span data-start="714.37" data-end="719.34">This is sort of code that you probably would not get through code review at most shops,</span> <span data-start="719.34" data-end="724.84">right, it's a wild loop that never stops, has some conditionals in it, and you're just</span> <span data-start="724.84" data-end="729.73">doing everything in this waterfall pattern, but this is what's powering every game you've</span> <span data-start="729.73" data-end="732.62">ever used.</span> <span data-start="732.62" data-end="740.58">And the reason for that is because it makes time explicit,right, the issue with traditional</span> <span data-start="740.58" data-end="745.07">event‑based architecture that we're using in games now, you have an event, a click event,</span> <span data-start="745.07" data-end="751.18">it triggers some kind of re"A," you closed a window or moved to the next screen, the</span> <span data-start="751.18" data-end="756.62">time is implicit in that, an event happened and then you give a response, you know the</span> <span data-start="756.62" data-end="762.34">response happened after the vent, you never elevate time to a first class citizen, you</span> <span data-start="762.34" data-end="767.93">never measure time to the point where you can put so it a variable, and that's what</span> <span data-start="767.93" data-end="771.91">a game loop gives you, it lets you measure time between different iter rations of the</span> <span data-start="771.91" data-end="775.96">loop and store time into a variable.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="775.96" data-end="780.97">The other thing that it lets you the is keep moving without user input, you're just responding</span> <span data-start="780.97" data-end="785.32">strengths, you're deopinion didn't entirely on the user to push your game forward and</span> <span data-start="785.32" data-end="790.88">push any elements on the game forward and with the game loop you can respond to time</span> <span data-start="790.88" data-end="795.33">and send it to user so you don't just have are too have aen an action and reaction pattern,</span> <span data-start="795.33" data-end="803.07">I have two demos that will illustrate this.</span> <span data-start="803.07" data-end="808.1">So let's go here.</span> <span data-start="808.1" data-end="823.15">So, this is a version of a small simple game I hope it doesn't blow anybody's Ears.</span> <span data-start="823.15" data-end="829.43">So this is a game that only runs, there's no loop here, just listening to my input and</span> <span data-start="829.43" data-end="830.45">responding to the input.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="830.45" data-end="837.99">If I start pressing keys, it will start dog things, and I can move and and I can jump</span> <span data-start="837.99" data-end="838.99">and whatever.</span> <span data-start="838.99" data-end="845.611">But then, as soon as I stop, nothing happens, I could be in the middle of a jump, and it's</span> <span data-start="845.611" data-end="853.02">just there, so trying to build a game, using MVC, if we try to use backbone, this is basically</span> <span data-start="853.02" data-end="859.06">what would happen, this is\h‑‑ you're entirely dependent on the user for everything</span> <span data-start="859.06" data-end="865.29">in this environment, right, so as soon as the user ..</span> <span data-start="865.29" data-end="869.65">stops doing anything, your game is sort of pointless, right, and this is not just true</span> <span data-start="869.65" data-end="874.38">with games, this is true with anything that requires physics and motions beyond something</span> <span data-start="874.38" data-end="879.4">that you're responding to, when you see a bounce effect or nice physical scroll, flick</span> <span data-start="879.4" data-end="890.65">an icon, it has the same problem so that's without an vent loop F you go with an vent</span> <span data-start="890.65" data-end="897.839">loop, this is exactly the same game, but it's just going to keep running no matter what,</span> </p>
