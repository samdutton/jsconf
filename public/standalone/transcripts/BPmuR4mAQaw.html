<p><span data-start="47.909" data-end="55.21">This topic is so close to my heart because as many of you here in the audience, I'm a</span> <span data-start="55.21" data-end="58.43">great fan of comics myself.</span> <span data-start="58.43" data-end="63.05">I can remember when I was young, I would go to the comic book store, or maybe to the corner</span> <span data-start="63.05" data-end="70.049">shop and grab a magazine, sometimes like even hard-cover comic books, and try to learn more</span> <span data-start="70.049" data-end="75.03">about the stories and the adventures of my favourite protagonists and heroes.</span> <span data-start="75.03" data-end="78.1">I think most of you can actually relate to this.</span> <span data-start="78.1" data-end="82.46">Probably everyone can relate to this, don't you think?</span> <span data-start="82.46" data-end="87.02">I was thinking back then, when I was so enthusiastic about comics, it would be so cool to make</span> <span data-start="87.02" data-end="89.869">comic art myself.</span> <span data-start="89.869" data-end="95.7">Things turned out differently — I'm working as a software engineer, build web applications</span> <span data-start="95.7" data-end="99.21">and other things, but I like to draw in my free time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="99.21" data-end="106.509">I thought maybe I could make it a hobby or activity that I just pursue in my after-hours</span> <span data-start="106.509" data-end="109.439">after work, and I actually maybe create something?</span> <span data-start="109.439" data-end="111.9">So I had a look at what my options were.</span> <span data-start="111.9" data-end="116.92">I remember from back in the time that print comics like the traditional medium of comics</span> <span data-start="116.92" data-end="124.689">as we already know it for centuries, in fact, is something that might be worth pursuing.</span> <span data-start="124.689" data-end="128.209">And I looked at what the challenges were that I had to overcome to do this.</span> <span data-start="128.209" data-end="134.68">I realised that there were a couple of them that came into my realm as a comic artist.</span> <span data-start="134.68" data-end="138.56">First of all, I would have to find a way to publish myself, or maybe find a publisher.</span> <span data-start="138.56" data-end="144.14">I couldn't get .. to get my work out, which seemed like a laborious process.</span> <span data-start="144.14" data-end="149.59">Then I also realised that, when I actually wanted to make people aware of where my comic</span> <span data-start="149.59" data-end="155.17">is and what it does, I had to focus on print-based marketing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="155.17" data-end="163.11">Maybe I go to a fair, or tell me in person what this comic is about.</span> <span data-start="163.11" data-end="169.54">Last but not least, also I would have to go to this month or a year-long thing where I</span> <span data-start="169.54" data-end="174.29">actually draw everything, hand it into my publisher, and they edit, and they correct</span> <span data-start="174.29" data-end="180.81">it, and send it back, I have to reedit it, until I actually publish my first comic.</span> <span data-start="180.81" data-end="185.189">And this already seems like a bitch, but then I looked on the other side, how does it look</span> <span data-start="185.189" data-end="188.91">for challenge-wise for people who want to read my comic later on?</span> <span data-start="188.91" data-end="194.989">How do readers of my comic interact with this and what do they have to overcome?</span> <span data-start="194.989" data-end="198.87">I realised that first of all they have to have physical access to the medium, so they</span> <span data-start="198.87" data-end="203.189">have to go down to the book store, or at least they have to go to the door when the mail</span> <span data-start="203.189" data-end="207.659">order arrives, or pick up the package at the Post Office.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="207.659" data-end="210.69">They also have to carry around the book and actually bring it with them.</span> <span data-start="210.69" data-end="214.099">They can't even go out with a whole library of comics.</span> <span data-start="214.099" data-end="220.29">They maybe take a book or two, and this is about it because of portability concerns.</span> <span data-start="220.29" data-end="224.489">But something that really struck me when I thought about it a little bit longer was something</span> <span data-start="224.489" data-end="229.4">much more significant, and, in fact, I kind of like didn't really consider that there</span> <span data-start="229.4" data-end="235.89">is this very kind of essential prerequisite that I have to fulfil when I actually read</span> <span data-start="235.89" data-end="237.53">a printed comic.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="237.53" data-end="244.81">That is it actually requires me to have almost perfect vision.</span> <span data-start="244.81" data-end="253.109">I actually am required to be a sighted person to read a comic book from, I don't know, everything</span> <span data-start="253.109" data-end="258.22">funny — or my Mickey Mouse magazine.</span> <span data-start="258.22" data-end="260.81">This is something I found really odd to think about.</span> <span data-start="260.81" data-end="263.31">I was, "I didn't even consider this."</span> <span data-start="263.31" data-end="266.64">Because I looked like a sighted person all my life.</span> <span data-start="266.64" data-end="269.61">I never even bothered to think about it.</span> <span data-start="269.61" data-end="274.74">Then, after this, I was okay, but, actually, are there options?</span> <span data-start="274.74" data-end="276.669">Like how do you actually read comics when you're blind?</span> <span data-start="276.669" data-end="279.68">Or a visually impaired person?</span> <span data-start="279.68" data-end="284.61">I looked on the internet and I found a lot of interesting ideas of people who are already</span> <span data-start="284.61" data-end="289.1">putting into practice what I couldn't imagine even until this point.</span> <span data-start="289.1" data-end="294.41">People who actually tried to expand out of the visual realm of comics to other fields</span> <span data-start="294.41" data-end="295.49">of senses.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="295.49" data-end="303.12">One project, for example, I found interesting was some that tried to explore haptic senses</span> <span data-start="303.12" data-end="309.682">and audio senses, so people who might have never had the ability to actually read comics</span> <span data-start="309.682" data-end="315.13">but also those who might have lost their vision during their life could go back and read their</span> <span data-start="315.13" data-end="318.24">favourite stories again as they used to.</span> <span data-start="318.24" data-end="325.069">One of these projects, for example, is called Live, by Philip Meyer, and he creates a Braille-like</span> <span data-start="325.069" data-end="334.71">comic book which shows the stories in a haptic manner.</span> <span data-start="334.71" data-end="343.61">You can touch the material in front of you to understand what is going on, and to understand</span> <span data-start="343.61" data-end="346.41">where locally and spatially protagonists are currently in.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="346.41" data-end="354.86">This is an interesting web comic written by Christopher Wright who makes an intentional</span> <span data-start="354.86" data-end="360.849">effort not only to upload every single image of his strips on to his personal website,</span> <span data-start="360.849" data-end="367.25">but also includes right next to it a comic transcript that can be read by screenreader</span> <span data-start="367.25" data-end="370.349">users once they browse the website.</span> <span data-start="370.349" data-end="377.37">I think the most inspiring project in my opinion has been Comics and Power which is a comic</span> <span data-start="377.37" data-end="385.699">book store created for the blind which features several very popular comic books very well</span> <span data-start="385.699" data-end="390.759">that are narrated by a — generated by a single person in a fashion that creates this illusion</span> <span data-start="390.759" data-end="396.539">that you actually reading the comic, you're putting up the comic book reading from panel</span> <span data-start="396.539" data-end="405.25">to panel the text, but also the sound-like descriptions of any kind of noises.</span> <span data-start="405.25" data-end="406.889">And I found this really cool.</span> <span data-start="406.889" data-end="411.4">Looking at this, and actually trying to find out more about the guy who actually did this</span> <span data-start="411.4" data-end="418.479">to create this very immersive experience using audio-generated comics, I wanted to try something</span> <span data-start="418.479" data-end="419.639">similar myself.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="419.639" data-end="423.93">I wanted to dive deeper into what can you do with audio?</span> <span data-start="423.93" data-end="431.34">How can you tap the potential of audio-narrated stories and how can you make use of this quite</span> <span data-start="431.34" data-end="432.65">easily on the web?</span> <span data-start="432.65" data-end="439.009">I knew that screenreaders were a quite straightforward approach because I knew so many web pages</span> <span data-start="439.009" data-end="443.889">could be read by screenreaders if it was done right.</span> <span data-start="443.889" data-end="446.009">So I started out.</span> <span data-start="446.009" data-end="451.49">In my day-to-day work, I actually work at a consulting firm that also specialises in</span> <span data-start="451.49" data-end="458.69">helping clients with Ruby and Amber, and this would be familiar for me, I was thinking it</span> <span data-start="458.69" data-end="463.12">would be cool if it was like a JavaScript application with the Amber text stack because</span> <span data-start="463.12" data-end="465.03">this is familiar.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="465.03" data-end="470.901">Also, it actually helps me later on because it's already a fully fledged single-page application</span> <span data-start="470.901" data-end="477.409">framework to scale my application easily with co-released and co-maintained dependencies,</span> <span data-start="477.409" data-end="483.591">like data library, a testing solution, or also routed solution out of the box to make</span> <span data-start="483.591" data-end="487.699">it easier for me.</span> <span data-start="487.699" data-end="493.08">I would know that two years and three years from now, this app exists, and it should also</span> <span data-start="493.08" data-end="494.62">work and be maintainable.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="494.62" data-end="500.93">Last but not least, I also thought it would be so cool if it was like a proper JavaScript</span> <span data-start="500.93" data-end="506.65">application because then I can actually with all of this interactivity, interesting animations</span> <span data-start="506.65" data-end="513.169">for a sighted user experience that might also be very immersive and interesting to explore.</span> <span data-start="513.169" data-end="521.08">So, looking at the approach that comics Comics of Power provided, I wanted to have a similar</span> <span data-start="521.08" data-end="527.14">user story for screenreader users for those who use assistive technologies to browse the</span> <span data-start="527.14" data-end="528.18">web comic.</span> <span data-start="528.18" data-end="531.24">I wanted to write an embedded transcript.</span> <span data-start="531.24" data-end="535.43">I couldn't think about having the transcript right next to the page.</span> <span data-start="535.43" data-end="539.85">I actually wanted to have the experience that would be similar to someone coming to the</span> <span data-start="539.85" data-end="542.44">website and reading panel for panel.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="542.44" data-end="549.14">I also wanted to include annotation for imagery, not only to translate text, so people actually</span> <span data-start="549.14" data-end="554.94">can get, like, image of the scene, and last but not least, yes, I actually wanted to create</span> <span data-start="554.94" data-end="560.01">this illusion that there is this inner voice that you have when you have read something,</span> <span data-start="560.01" data-end="563.04">and that is what it actually reading to you.</span> <span data-start="563.04" data-end="567.96">I think it would be really cool to have it all generated to have proper voice acting,</span> <span data-start="567.96" data-end="573.74">but for this first version of this application, I really wanted just to have an approach to</span> <span data-start="573.74" data-end="578.6">make it as easily and accessible as possible, and a screenreader approach seemed perfect</span> <span data-start="578.6" data-end="581.51">for me.</span> <span data-start="581.51" data-end="588.99">This storytelling that a is screenreader-driven I realised was straightforward to implement</span> <span data-start="588.99" data-end="595.339">once I took advantage of HTML and the powers of area.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="595.339" data-end="599.24">In my application, for example, I have these single frames that you can see here on the</span> <span data-start="599.24" data-end="600.26">left side.</span> <span data-start="600.26" data-end="603.72">Here, for example, be you can see like a person on a boat.</span> <span data-start="603.72" data-end="608.079">They're, like, on the sea, and you can also see is a speech bubble saying "no" and just</span> <span data-start="608.079" data-end="611.97">like a sound word saying "splash".</span> <span data-start="611.97" data-end="619.57">Each of these images can be contained in several layers of images, so I can have an a background</span> <span data-start="619.57" data-end="625.35">image, a foreground image, and all kinds of other text bubbles as well that I embedded</span> <span data-start="625.35" data-end="632.9">in the single frame, and I knew that to actually make the whole scene be narrated as I would</span> <span data-start="632.9" data-end="638.339">see it as the reader, I wanted to have one single description of it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="638.339" data-end="644.77">I wanted to have one single tag, or one single labour for the screenreader to actually read.</span> <span data-start="644.77" data-end="652.519">I decided to make use of art attributes, or area labels, and this case, and, more specifically</span> <span data-start="652.519" data-end="658.15">in this case, with the area label, and the image roll, in my application to actually</span> <span data-start="658.15" data-end="664.19">make sure that everything that is told in this image, it's also available for the screenreader</span> <span data-start="664.19" data-end="665.19">users.</span> <span data-start="665.19" data-end="671.16">There is also a word of caution, though: you can use area labels when you want, if it is</span> <span data-start="671.16" data-end="678.029">necessary, if you realise that it really eases your development effort, but using area all</span> <span data-start="678.029" data-end="684.94">over your place in your application, over the use of using semantic HTML can also be</span> <span data-start="684.94" data-end="693.209">hard for screenreaders to actually read, and therefore they should only be used sparingly.</span> <span data-start="693.209" data-end="698.709">What you can also do if you know you have one single image, just use the alt attribute</span> <span data-start="698.709" data-end="703.6">of the image tag, and then you actually are on the best way to actually implement this,</span> <span data-start="703.6" data-end="708.17">because browsers are actually built in a way to support this straightforwardly with very</span> <span data-start="708.17" data-end="710.81">good support.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="710.81" data-end="716.85">And 1&1 interesting thing I found with building this web comic is realising how powerful it</span> <span data-start="716.85" data-end="724.6">is to embed not only an image but HTML, but once I do so, it becomes the screenreaders,</span> <span data-start="724.6" data-end="727.74">and it's available just by default.</span> <span data-start="727.74" data-end="738.529">Don't have to do anything but it's already there in my narrative.</span> <span data-start="738.529" data-end="745.36">I will show you how I like to test this later on in my application to see what is actually</span> <span data-start="745.36" data-end="746.36">happening.</span> <span data-start="746.36" data-end="749.07">I like to use this specific screenreader called Chrome Box.</span> <span data-start="749.07" data-end="756.92">It's like a free screenreader plugin you can plug in Chrome, and in Mac Voiceover, and</span> <span data-start="756.92" data-end="765.329">Windows user — it's a popular screenreader in the blind community.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="765.329" data-end="771.12">I think any screenreader you get started with is great for accessibility testing.</span> <span data-start="771.12" data-end="773.49">Let's see how it goes.</span> <span data-start="773.49" data-end="777.269">So, this is still a little bit quiet, I think.</span> <span data-start="777.269" data-end="780.8">Maybe let's try just how it goes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="780.8" data-end="782.56">Can you already hear something?</span> <span data-start="782.56" data-end="785.019">Here on the stage, it's a bit hard to tell.</span> <span data-start="785.019" data-end="787.709">Now we're we're on the website.</span> <span data-start="787.709" data-end="790.459">I have this frame embedded.</span> <span data-start="790.459" data-end="800.54">"Click here to maintain ..".

<p><span data-start="925.2" data-end="929.649">So this actually sets the maximum scale of the whole screen to one, meaning you cannot</span> <span data-start="929.649" data-end="935.3">zoom any more, and this is something I sometimes implement because there a user request that</span> <span data-start="935.3" data-end="939.36">every time I tap into an input field, suddenly, the whole page zooms and I can't do anything</span> <span data-start="939.36" data-end="940.36">any more.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1040.581" data-end="1041.82">It is, "What was going on?"</span> <span data-start="1041.82" data-end="1044.51">It was happening all over the country.</span> <span data-start="1044.51" data-end="1054.03">The kids had symptoms like nausea, dizziness, some even had seizures.</span> <span data-start="1054.03" data-end="1060.19">Later on, it actually occurred to everyone that just recently, a new episode of Pokémon</span> <span data-start="1060.19" data-end="1061.21">has been aired on TV.</span> <span data-start="1061.21" data-end="1063.78">It seemed there was a correlation.</span> <span data-start="1063.78" data-end="1065.97">The episode got taken down.</span> <span data-start="1065.97" data-end="1070.97">The agency broadcasting the episode went on an investigation to find out what is going</span> <span data-start="1070.97" data-end="1071.97">on.</span> <span data-start="1071.97" data-end="1077.33">They actually came to the view that this one specific scene might have been the cause of</span> <span data-start="1077.33" data-end="1082.81">this very adverse effects in so many children all over the country who watched the episode.</span> <span data-start="1082.81" data-end="1088.54">So, in the episode, I won't show the scene, obviously, because it's not safe, but in the</span> <span data-start="1088.54" data-end="1094.44">episode, there's one particular scene where you can see two different specific frames.</span> <span data-start="1094.44" data-end="1097.68">I'm showing the frames, which is totally fine.</span> <span data-start="1097.68" data-end="1104.29">First of all, the creators of the episode showed a very bright red frame right next</span> <span data-start="1104.29" data-end="1110.73">to a very bright blue frame in high frequency interchangeably for around six seconds.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1110.73" data-end="1118.01">So, this created a very strobe-like effect, and in people who have photo sensitive epilepsy</span> <span data-start="1118.01" data-end="1124.85">or those who are prone to seizures caused by strobe-like effects, this can have adverse</span> <span data-start="1124.85" data-end="1131.71">health effects, and this is something that really taught me that it's so important to</span> <span data-start="1131.71" data-end="1137.79">also watch out for this, and, in regards to strobe effects, I also realised that so many</span> <span data-start="1137.79" data-end="1143.39">people are actually out there who don't even know they have the condition because they're</span> <span data-start="1143.39" data-end="1146.36">ever exposed to any kind of lighting like that.</span> <span data-start="1146.36" data-end="1150.81">The only safe measure that you can take for making sure that no-one gets harmed is not</span> <span data-start="1150.81" data-end="1156.19">to use any of these kinds of strobe-light effects at all.</span> <span data-start="1156.19" data-end="1159.82">This is when I realised that this is what I wanted to take care of, and, last but not</span> <span data-start="1159.82" data-end="1166.66">least, make sure that animations are not autoplay by default but can also be set this way.</span> <span data-start="1166.66" data-end="1175.33">There are many other things that I as a developer can actually reassess before I can say, this</span> <span data-start="1175.33" data-end="1177.5">web application is really now accessible.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1177.5" data-end="1182.44">It's key part of accessibility to actually make place for screenreaders or users who</span> <span data-start="1182.44" data-end="1187.71">own interact with the keyboard to go through the application, but colour contrast, semantic</span> <span data-start="1187.71" data-end="1196.401">HTML, are so critical — correct heading RHD to allow people who are not sighted to navigate</span> <span data-start="1196.401" data-end="1202.67">the page and actually explore it in a very natural way, and also landmarks are one of</span> <span data-start="1202.67" data-end="1205.56">these things.</span> <span data-start="1205.56" data-end="1210.3">One other aspect I want to go into to is page navigation route changes.</span> <span data-start="1210.3" data-end="1214.5">Many of us are building these single-page applications or JavaScript applications that</span> <span data-start="1214.5" data-end="1220.63">have their very custom routing solution where a lot of things we don't get out of the box</span> <span data-start="1220.63" data-end="1226.03">that we might have had with a server-rendered app, and, in my application, this was also</span> <span data-start="1226.03" data-end="1227.03">the case.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1227.03" data-end="1232.42">If, like a user, for example, just navigated to another page, for example, to a new chapter,</span> <span data-start="1232.42" data-end="1235.22">they wouldn't get any feedback on the screenreader.</span> <span data-start="1235.22" data-end="1240.03">Instead, they might further explore with a screenreader what is going on in the page</span> <span data-start="1240.03" data-end="1246.75">but go like, "I think I changed the page," but not really sure what actually happened.</span> <span data-start="1246.75" data-end="1252.9">I actually found that, in the ecosystem that I work in, there is an add-on, like a plugin</span> <span data-start="1252.9" data-end="1259.3">that I can snore in my application called document title that helps me update the document</span> <span data-start="1259.3" data-end="1262.83">title of an application every time the route changes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1262.83" data-end="1268.53">This is a pre-requirement for the other solution I wanted to also have in my application which</span> <span data-start="1268.53" data-end="1273.77">is called "accessibility announcer" which is a simple component I can drop into my route</span> <span data-start="1273.77" data-end="1279.83">application template, and this will then keep track of changes of the document title, will</span> <span data-start="1279.83" data-end="1285.33">observe this, and every time it does change, it will make sure that screenreaders pick</span> <span data-start="1285.33" data-end="1290.4">up on the change, and can actually feed that back to the user.</span> <span data-start="1290.4" data-end="1297.76">This is now Amber-specific, but I'm very confident that, in whatever ecosystem you are building</span> <span data-start="1297.76" data-end="1301.54">an application — or be it like a vanilla JavaScript application, there's already a straightforward</span> <span data-start="1301.54" data-end="1307.23">community solution for you there that you can also as easily install, and if there is</span> <span data-start="1307.23" data-end="1313.35">not, I can also highly encourage you to start building one and maybe ask the comment that</span> <span data-start="1313.35" data-end="1316.44">you're building in it for help.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1316.44" data-end="1322.75">Interestingly, just like getting into the details of how to make that app accessible,</span> <span data-start="1322.75" data-end="1329.04">I also want to learn more about how in general we actually make apps accessible.</span> <span data-start="1329.04" data-end="1334">In her very informative talk called Don't Break the Web Melanie Sumner goes into detail</span> <span data-start="1334" data-end="1343.22">how the app is not accessible to some audiences and what we can do to make it better.</span> <span data-start="1343.22" data-end="1348.51">I think the most striking number, or the most striking summary I took away from the talk</span> <span data-start="1348.51" data-end="1350.88">are the following numbers.</span> <span data-start="1350.88" data-end="1357.81">There's been this kind of survey like this investigation of the web AEM who actually</span> <span data-start="1357.81" data-end="1363.12">explored the accessibility of one million home pages, and, more specifically, of the</span> <span data-start="1363.12" data-end="1368.48">one million most popular websites and their home pages, thinking that it is the very first</span> <span data-start="1368.48" data-end="1369.48">page anyone sees.</span> <span data-start="1369.48" data-end="1373.42">It's probably the page where you put most effort into that everyone can actually exit</span> <span data-start="1373.42" data-end="1378.97">from and further navigate from it, and looking at the popular ones to have an estimate of,</span> <span data-start="1378.97" data-end="1384.39">okay, this is like how people usually experience the web, because these are the most popular</span> <span data-start="1384.39" data-end="1386.52">websites everyone visits.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1386.52" data-end="1390.87">If you now look at this pie chart, you can see there is this one number, which is a large</span> <span data-start="1390.87" data-end="1396.16">97.89 per cent and the other one is around two per cent.</span> <span data-start="1396.16" data-end="1400.11">And looking at accessibility, the one to I understood — they want to find out, like,</span> <span data-start="1400.11" data-end="1403.41">how many of these web pages are actually functional?</span> <span data-start="1403.41" data-end="1407.23">Don't have any accessibility errors?</span> <span data-start="1407.23" data-end="1410.75">It would be so great if you could say, most of them actually are accessible.</span> <span data-start="1410.75" data-end="1415.54">Most are functional, like the most popular websites, probably put so much effort into</span> <span data-start="1415.54" data-end="1420.3">making it functionable for screenreaders and other kinds of assistive technology, but the</span> <span data-start="1420.3" data-end="1426.84">truth today still is that these two 2.2 per cent that we saw on the chart are the ones</span> <span data-start="1426.84" data-end="1433.87">that actually work according to the accessibility guidelines, and the other striking amount</span> <span data-start="1433.87" data-end="1437.6">of 98 per cent of sites accessibility-wise are broken.</span> <span data-start="1437.6" data-end="1440.01">What does it mean broken?</span> <span data-start="1440.01" data-end="1446.36">Mostly, a colour-contrast issue, so someone who is visually impaired can't read the text</span> <span data-start="1446.36" data-end="1450.62">properly or explore the elements on the first page of the website.</span> <span data-start="1450.62" data-end="1455.27">It has a lot to do with images that actually are informative but don't have an alt attribute</span> <span data-start="1455.27" data-end="1461.89">next to it, and also broken links, or empty link tags that, for example, have opened up</span> <span data-start="1461.89" data-end="1464.85">a model but actually don't lead Anne anywhere.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1464.85" data-end="1469.33">As a screenreader user, you might want to navigate to a link like that but once you</span> <span data-start="1469.33" data-end="1473.41">hit it, you realise I'm not sure, not getting back from the screenreader.</span> <span data-start="1473.41" data-end="1478.43">So what is going on?</span> <span data-start="1478.43" data-end="1485.75">And honestly, it's some kind of work, and we have to do something to actually improve</span> <span data-start="1485.75" data-end="1487.15">the situation.</span> <span data-start="1487.15" data-end="1495.28">There are things like we can install in our test suite to make it possible to actually</span> <span data-start="1495.28" data-end="1502.18">automate the process of testing our applications for accessibility, but also other tools can</span> <span data-start="1502.18" data-end="1506.81">help us to get a better feeling for it.</span> <span data-start="1506.81" data-end="1511.73">But most importantly, I think, we actually have to practise empathy and get a better</span> <span data-start="1511.73" data-end="1517.38">understanding about what the experience for other people who are not as sighted as us,</span> <span data-start="1517.38" data-end="1522.27">or not as, like, motor-skilled as us, actually experience the web.</span> <span data-start="1522.27" data-end="1526.42">Therefore, I would like to encourage you to actually get a screenreader running, and actually</span> <span data-start="1526.42" data-end="1530.24">do a real manual accessibility testing, because this is how I see it.</span> <span data-start="1530.24" data-end="1536.21">Like, if you had had like a CSS-style bark on your website, saying this is happening</span> <span data-start="1536.21" data-end="1538.39">in Firefox, you would say, wow.</span> <span data-start="1538.39" data-end="1541.2">I'm going to reproduce it this Firefox.</span> </p>
