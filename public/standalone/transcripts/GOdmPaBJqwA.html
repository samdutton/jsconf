<p><span data-start="31.75" data-end="34.77"><span class="speaker">Maureen</span>: Thank you so much to JSConf for having me here.</span> <span data-start="34.77" data-end="35.77">I'm so excited.</span> <span data-start="35.77" data-end="38.48">This is my first time to Europe at all.</span> <span data-start="38.48" data-end="40.63">I'm having a great time in Berlin.</span> <span data-start="40.63" data-end="45.45">Thank to Ben Schwarz before my talk because you said a lot of things I didn't have time</span> <span data-start="45.45" data-end="48.09">to say.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="48.09" data-end="52.6">Anyone who stayed for that talk and stayed for mine, you have good context what you're</span> <span data-start="52.6" data-end="56.42">going to talk about today.</span> <span data-start="56.42" data-end="60.239">This talk was inspired by Offline Camp.</span> <span data-start="60.239" data-end="62.289">It happened last weekend.</span> <span data-start="62.289" data-end="70.46">I got to attend that one but I attended two more before that, and in the offline first</span> <span data-start="70.46" data-end="75.08">space, and I learned a lot about really amazing projects that are impacting people's lives,</span> <span data-start="75.08" data-end="78.47">so that is what this talk is about.</span> <span data-start="78.47" data-end="82.88">But first I wanted to give an overview of what offline first is.</span> <span data-start="82.88" data-end="89.071">Really the main tenet of this is that Offline should not be treated as — this is a state</span> <span data-start="89.071" data-end="98.1">that you should be planning for and expecting from your users, not an errant condition.</span> <span data-start="98.1" data-end="102.81">We moved from designing applications from the desktop for mobile first because we wand</span> <span data-start="102.81" data-end="105.71">to design for the most constrained environment.</span> <span data-start="105.71" data-end="108.43">That is the thought behind offline first.</span> <span data-start="108.43" data-end="112.45">We want to treat the offline state as the most constrained environment, start there,</span> <span data-start="112.45" data-end="118.07">and move from that to progressively enhance the application as you get connectivity.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="118.07" data-end="126.17">The thing about bad offline states, some bad examples: this is it what you see, you're</span> <span data-start="126.17" data-end="133.651">on your app, you loose connectivity, a window pops up, blocks you don't know if what you</span> <span data-start="133.651" data-end="136.01">were doing is lost, you don't know if you lost content.</span> <span data-start="136.01" data-end="139.15">You have no idea if you can continue what you were doing in the middle of what you doing</span> <span data-start="139.15" data-end="140.81">when you lost connectivity.</span> <span data-start="140.81" data-end="150.59">This is a really bad experience for  the user.</span> <span data-start="150.59" data-end="156.55">When this site loses connectivity, it is clear you can see where you are on in the site,</span> <span data-start="156.55" data-end="174.34">the site turns grey 3 — that's a pretty good experience.</span> <span data-start="174.34" data-end="193.459">Items, and you can do things with your cart.</span> <span data-start="193.459" data-end="197.709">That's pretty cool.</span> <span data-start="197.709" data-end="205.06">Housing.com is a real estate site in India.</span> <span data-start="205.06" data-end="213.599">When you lose connectivity with that, you — nick that has been cached anything that's</span> <span data-start="213.599" data-end="219.18">been done before, if you navigate to your favourites, you didn't lose any of the listings</span> <span data-start="219.18" data-end="222.819">that you favourited in that session.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="222.819" data-end="224.529">That's a really good experience.</span> <span data-start="224.529" data-end="228.479">It greys out, obvious that you can't do a whole lot, but it lets you know you weren't</span> <span data-start="228.479" data-end="231.239">in the middle of doing anything you were in the middle of doing.</span> <span data-start="231.239" data-end="241.199">When I tell you more about how Off line First is changing lives and maybe even saving them.</span> <span data-start="241.199" data-end="247.189">You, the JavaScript community, are doing amazing things in this space, so you should pat yourselves</span> <span data-start="247.189" data-end="251.4">on the back because you're offline first and you don't know it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="251.4" data-end="252.889">These projects are really cool.</span> <span data-start="252.889" data-end="265.58">Why we would use technology for Los Angeles and London when we live in New Delhi?</span> <span data-start="265.58" data-end="267.199">Out of adversity can come innovation.</span> <span data-start="267.199" data-end="270.61">Imagine that you live in a refugee camp.</span> <span data-start="270.61" data-end="272">You have small children.</span> <span data-start="272" data-end="277.3">You want to be able to teach your children and have full daily lives as you figure out</span> <span data-start="277.3" data-end="279.96">what your next step is going to be.</span> <span data-start="279.96" data-end="284.77">Brick allows to you continue I do run your classrooms, you have a curriculum that is</span> <span data-start="284.77" data-end="291.85">managed remotely, and your teachers are allowed to make changes to this curriculum, changes</span> <span data-start="291.85" data-end="297.729">are remotely brought down from educators around the world that contribute.</span> <span data-start="297.729" data-end="299.759">And Brick makes this possible.</span> <span data-start="299.759" data-end="304.169">It is a local microserver that stores the curriculum locally and as I said, it is remotely</span> <span data-start="304.169" data-end="305.169">managed.</span> <span data-start="305.169" data-end="315.74">It is dust proof, rugged, solar powered, and it is a built-in Wi-Fi hot spot, and I can</span> <span data-start="315.74" data-end="320.89">sink your content using the cloud, and then enjoy your classes working seamlessly in low</span> <span data-start="320.89" data-end="326.62">latency or no connectivity at all.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="326.62" data-end="332.5">In Haiti, there was a horrible earthquake in 2010.</span> <span data-start="332.5" data-end="336.949">In 2014, a lot of country still didn't have electricity.</span> <span data-start="336.949" data-end="343.361">This is a huge problem, obviously, but the country relied heavily on agriculture, and</span> <span data-start="343.361" data-end="349.63">the farmers were not able to make the same profits off their crops because they couldn't</span> <span data-start="349.63" data-end="356.18">get the electricity to process the vegetables and get that ready for shipment to leave.</span> <span data-start="356.18" data-end="363.09">So they lost millions of dollars and their economy was devastated.</span> <span data-start="363.09" data-end="368.349">But not only that, just normal families couldn't access electricity to take care of their children.</span> <span data-start="368.349" data-end="373.749">So, with access to the right technology, they could rebuild those microgrids within their</span> <span data-start="373.749" data-end="377.59">communities and get electric goods back running.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="377.59" data-end="385.74">Sparkmetre did this, found in 2013, and they offer low-cost metering solutions from rural</span> <span data-start="385.74" data-end="393.27">microgrids out in small villages to existing urban central grid utilities.</span> <span data-start="393.27" data-end="398.379">Now they support grids in 15 countries adding more every day.</span> <span data-start="398.379" data-end="404.319">So they've a JavaScript front-end and they use symmetric DS to handle syncing when the</span> <span data-start="404.319" data-end="414.189">app is online, and then MQ and — for asynchronous gain, for energy metering, media processing,</span> <span data-start="414.189" data-end="417.62">and payments.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="417.62" data-end="419.91">This brings me to one of the first challenges.</span> <span data-start="419.91" data-end="422.21">I'm going to talk about three in these talks.</span> <span data-start="422.21" data-end="426.469">Offline First is a developing context and there are a lot of problems that need to be</span> <span data-start="426.469" data-end="427.77">solved.</span> <span data-start="427.77" data-end="431.05">The first one I want to talk about is syncing.</span> <span data-start="431.05" data-end="433.449">Sink conflicts are hard.</span> <span data-start="433.449" data-end="441.78">When we think about Brick's syncing capabilities or Supporting Metre selling bills out to your</span> <span data-start="441.78" data-end="447.659">families in Ural parse of Haiti, you want to make sure you've got it right not overwriting</span> <span data-start="447.659" data-end="450.039">or processing wrong data for people.</span> <span data-start="450.039" data-end="453.889">There are a few days that you can take care of this.</span> <span data-start="453.889" data-end="464.479">One solution is a JavaScript database with its ability to sync with anything that — it</span> <span data-start="464.479" data-end="469.65">allows to you read and write Day directly on to the device and sync this data when you're</span> <span data-start="469.65" data-end="472.409">back in connectivity.</span> <span data-start="472.409" data-end="480.169">This includes IBM cloud amp that is based on cache.db and another thing you can utilise</span> <span data-start="480.169" data-end="485.509">for syncing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="485.509" data-end="486.509">Back to Kenya.</span> <span data-start="486.509" data-end="492.18">This picture is a bunch of doctors who are loading patient records on to a bus to drive</span> <span data-start="492.18" data-end="493.52">out to a village.</span> <span data-start="493.52" data-end="496.9">Prepare the far away from the honestly.</span> <span data-start="496.9" data-end="503.11">This is how they were handling all their patient records.</span> <span data-start="503.11" data-end="508.039">Hundreds of pounds of paper that is very vulnerable to the elements, and this is not a sustainable</span> <span data-start="508.039" data-end="514.11">way to make sure you're saving lives of people that really, really need your help.</span> <span data-start="514.11" data-end="519.83">Before the honestly run came along, they were relying on this process.</span> <span data-start="519.83" data-end="521.729">So this application came along.</span> <span data-start="521.729" data-end="527.12">The Honestly Run did a lot of research and found out that 20 per cent of health care</span> <span data-start="527.12" data-end="533.41">professionals' time is spent just on administrative tasks, and a lot of that time is spent by</span> <span data-start="533.41" data-end="535.32">the software they were using.</span> <span data-start="535.32" data-end="540.47">They were taking these papers out to a village, making these changes to the patient records</span> <span data-start="540.47" data-end="544.66">and history, and then they had to go back and manually international of the data into</span> <span data-start="544.66" data-end="549.06">the software, and their software was crappy to deal with.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="549.06" data-end="558.399">Honestly Run let them take it out to a patient on a tablet or mobile phone, meaning they</span> <span data-start="558.399" data-end="563.94">could make changes offline or in the village, and the changes would sync when they got back</span> <span data-start="563.94" data-end="570.209">to Wi-Fi available when they were back at the honestly.</span> <span data-start="570.209" data-end="580.449">Couch TV on the front end and Node and couch TV on the backend �works when there is no</span> <span data-start="580.449" data-end="583.55">internet and syncs when there is.</span> <span data-start="583.55" data-end="591.51">Now, in the Yuko of Alaska, health care workers wanted a better way to be able to take care</span> <span data-start="591.51" data-end="599.06">of pregnant mothers and their newborn baby, because these people were rural poor, lived</span> <span data-start="599.06" data-end="601.76">far from the honestly, and depending on the time of year, it might have been impossible</span> <span data-start="601.76" data-end="605.25">to get there if an emergency happened.</span> <span data-start="605.25" data-end="610.37">And Yukon doesn't have great mobile coverage, and because these people had to think about</span> <span data-start="610.37" data-end="614.97">keeping their costs low, making sure that an application was lightweight and didn't</span> <span data-start="614.97" data-end="619.1">drive up a lot of mobile data usage was really important.</span> <span data-start="619.1" data-end="625.81">So Yukon Baby is built which gets its information out to new mothers, built with angular.</span> <span data-start="625.81" data-end="639.43">Just and Node it syncs date when a connection is stability.</span> <span data-start="639.43" data-end="644.269">It only updates when there is new information to be had, so it keeps mobile bills low too</span> <span data-start="644.269" data-end="648.36">for these people, which is awesome.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="648.36" data-end="654.589">This brings me to the next real problem with Offline First which still needs some attention.</span> <span data-start="654.589" data-end="660.35">When an application caches data locally to a device, you have to think about the privacy</span> <span data-start="660.35" data-end="666.009">concerns around the data that you are saving, so you need to think about how this is handled</span> <span data-start="666.009" data-end="671.089">and whether when you're thinking about honestly information, medical history, all that kind</span> <span data-start="671.089" data-end="676.57">of stuff, someone who is pregnant, you want to make sure that that information is not</span> <span data-start="676.57" data-end="678.589">being shared when it needs to be private.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="678.589" data-end="683.87">When you're thinking about security with offline applications, you have to think about data</span> <span data-start="683.87" data-end="691.269">validation, offering the ability to lock out so, if you're sharing a device — log out that</span> <span data-start="691.269" data-end="695.5">you can — and for apps that require really high security, you might want to consider</span> <span data-start="695.5" data-end="699.39">end-to-end encryption for your app.</span> <span data-start="699.39" data-end="703.279">So writing secure apps is hard and even harder in the browser.</span> <span data-start="703.279" data-end="711.69">Calvin is here today who wrote a cool post about security from a session session that</span> <span data-start="711.69" data-end="712.69">we had.</span> <span data-start="712.69" data-end="718.459">I encourage you out to check that Medium account and read that because it has a lot of good</span> <span data-start="718.459" data-end="720.05">information.</span> <span data-start="720.05" data-end="721.58">You might be thinking, "What about me?</span> <span data-start="721.58" data-end="726.57">I'm talking about people who live in rural areas or developing countries, you might not</span> <span data-start="726.57" data-end="731.949">be designing apps for these kind of users.</span> <span data-start="731.949" data-end="736.899">What kind of things are more relatable to what I deal with on a daily basis?</span> <span data-start="736.899" data-end="744.699">I'm from the US, and I am concerned about my current president and the administration</span> <span data-start="744.699" data-end="753.02">there, and that project came along and they wrote a really simple application that makes</span> <span data-start="753.02" data-end="758.329">it easier for governments and researchers to share their data sets with software helps</span> <span data-start="758.329" data-end="764.49">to do really using things, so the grant funded, and it's decentralised, a sharing version</span> <span data-start="764.49" data-end="772.54">tool for sinking these big data sets, and it can be used to version the data locally</span> <span data-start="772.54" data-end="776.329">and share and sync it over the internet.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="776.329" data-end="779.949">And it's open-source, so you can check it out and see what they're doing.</span> <span data-start="779.949" data-end="781.97">It is built with no JS.</span> <span data-start="781.97" data-end="788.5">By taking an online first approach to the digital preservation, this allows users to</span> <span data-start="788.5" data-end="796.529">share the data sets in a lightweight way, and, before this, they were doing it manually.</span> <span data-start="796.529" data-end="802.199">Spending a lot of money on Dropbox, or doing really manual here's a giant flash line of</span> <span data-start="802.199" data-end="805.709">information, please don't drop it in water kind of thing.</span> <span data-start="805.709" data-end="810.17">That makes it really simple for these people to share data across the globe.</span> <span data-start="810.17" data-end="811.18">That's really pivotal.</span> <span data-start="811.18" data-end="818.91">Like I said in the US, we had an issue where, in January, the whitehouse.gov deleted the</span> <span data-start="818.91" data-end="820.829">data sets that were available.</span> <span data-start="820.829" data-end="831.47">It was Tweeted, "I already grabbed it, so you can come and get it," which was awesome</span> <span data-start="831.47" data-end="833.509">because thought it was lost for every.</span> <span data-start="833.509" data-end="838.74">The next thing under threat is the environmental protection agency.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="838.74" data-end="843.089">We want to make sure this information is proved for future generations to prove these, are</span> <span data-start="843.089" data-end="844.339">true because it is important.</span> <span data-start="844.339" data-end="852.54">He can go to the website and see a lot of the data sets they have available and accessible</span> <span data-start="852.54" data-end="858.43">for you to build anything you want, build all kinds of applications using it.</span> <span data-start="858.43" data-end="863.79">So how do you convince your boss and your company, and your team, to invest in the extra</span> <span data-start="863.79" data-end="865.769">time to make the app offline first?</span> <span data-start="865.769" data-end="871.5">There are fining reasons, and Ben pointed out a lot of them in regard to performance.</span> <span data-start="871.5" data-end="877.47">So, when we look at LT capacity, the capacity has remained in the same in the US in the</span> <span data-start="877.47" data-end="878.77">last 12 months.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="878.77" data-end="884.6">The amount of users and bandwidth per user has increased things dramatically because</span> <span data-start="884.6" data-end="890.279">of things like video streaming, entertainment, video conferencing, that sort of stuff.</span> <span data-start="890.279" data-end="897.97">So this has all resulted in the past we are from to year, a 50 per cent slowing of the</span> <span data-start="897.97" data-end="903.17">speeds overall, and the US is 20 per cent slower than Europe, actually.</span> <span data-start="903.17" data-end="907.819">This is something if your users are predominantly in the US or Europe, you have to think about</span> <span data-start="907.819" data-end="911.55">how the performance of your app is.</span> <span data-start="911.55" data-end="920.529">Not only that, but 60 per cent of the world is on a 2G network and in the developing world,</span> <span data-start="920.529" data-end="923.69">two thirds are on a 2G network.</span> <span data-start="923.69" data-end="929.639">If you're building your application to work in a best-case scenario, these people won't</span> <span data-start="929.639" data-end="933.43">be able to access this.</span> <span data-start="933.43" data-end="939.85">A 4G user is also not a 4G user most of the time.</span> <span data-start="939.85" data-end="941.459">People live in variable connectivity.</span> <span data-start="941.459" data-end="947.629">They take the subway to work, take buses, they walk between skyscrapers and loose connectivity.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="947.629" data-end="954.56">You don't want them to access your app and 11 loose them because you use 40 per cent</span> <span data-start="954.56" data-end="959.11">of your users if it takes more tan three seconds for your app to load.</span> <span data-start="959.11" data-end="965.209">Aside from that, radio cell towers preserve birdie between transitioning between high</span> <span data-start="965.209" data-end="966.589">and low states.</span> <span data-start="966.589" data-end="974.639">If they might access your app, they might be accessing it during the low period of power-gridding</span> <span data-start="974.639" data-end="978.839">and you lose them because the app took too long to load.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="978.839" data-end="985.81">So, by designing for low latency first, you're making substantial improvements in performance.</span> <span data-start="985.81" data-end="989.75">It is really imperative that sue design your app for — that you design your app for performance,</span> <span data-start="989.75" data-end="998.379">and getting a baseline in spite of low connectivity is really, really important.</span> <span data-start="998.379" data-end="999.509">Let's go back to Flip cart.</span> <span data-start="999.509" data-end="1004.56">This is an example I mentioned earlier.</span> <span data-start="1004.56" data-end="1008.279">They did a few things really to increase the speed of their collection.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1008.279" data-end="1013.24">They added a splash screen, they stitched to using service worker so they could handle</span> <span data-start="1013.24" data-end="1015.1">negotiations.</span> <span data-start="1015.1" data-end="1019.96">They sort of added smoother animations to their site.</span> <span data-start="1019.96" data-end="1024.449">Because of that, they had three times less data usage overall, they had a 40 per cent</span> <span data-start="1024.449" data-end="1029.69">higher engagement rate, increased their conversion by 70 per cent, and all in all, users spent</span> <span data-start="1029.69" data-end="1037.76">more time on their platform.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1037.76" data-end="1042.18">So this brings me to one more challenge I want to talk about.</span> <span data-start="1042.18" data-end="1048.81">In regard to Offline First, design patterns are still being invented there isn't one way</span> <span data-start="1048.81" data-end="1052.93">that the user can see the offline state.</span> <span data-start="1052.93" data-end="1054.56">There's no standard for this.</span> <span data-start="1054.56" data-end="1059.26">This is still something that needs to be developed by the community.</span> <span data-start="1059.26" data-end="1066.27">Steve Travathon, one of the organisers of offline camp and is the founder of Makingmodel</span> <span data-start="1066.27" data-end="1067.27">Co.</span> <span data-start="1067.27" data-end="1073.69">He wrote a really amazing post for design patterns for offline states with three tenets</span> <span data-start="1073.69" data-end="1078.36">that he talked about: freshness, reach, and assurance.</span> <span data-start="1078.36" data-end="1082.21">When we talk about freshness, we're thinking about how fresh is the data?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1082.21" data-end="1085.79">How are you communicating the freshness of data to your users?</span> <span data-start="1085.79" data-end="1091.4">You could communicate this in a lot of different way, and you can say here's a timestamp, the</span> <span data-start="1091.4" data-end="1098.2">last time it was viewed on this day, there's an update available, so refresh your app,</span> <span data-start="1098.2" data-end="1099.21">that kind of.</span> <span data-start="1099.21" data-end="1103.39">When we are looking at Reach, we want to know is it the data reachable or not?</span> <span data-start="1103.39" data-end="1105.97">That should be clearly communicated.</span> <span data-start="1105.97" data-end="1109.72">So, is it clear that I can perform an action right now?</span> <span data-start="1109.72" data-end="1113.7">Or is it really obvious that I need to wait until I'm in connectivity to be able to do</span> <span data-start="1113.7" data-end="1119.32">this, so checking out your cart of items you want to buy, that kind of thing.</span> <span data-start="1119.32" data-end="1127.06">An assurance when we're talking about how much is my responsibility as a user to save</span> <span data-start="1127.06" data-end="1128.32">the data that I have?</span> <span data-start="1128.32" data-end="1136.59">Is to, when I lose — so, when I lose connectivity do I have the experience to stave the writing,</span> <span data-start="1136.59" data-end="1144.84">and we've experienced where we write a long paragraph, click send, and we have to start</span> <span data-start="1144.84" data-end="1145.97">over.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1145.97" data-end="1148.42">We don't want to do that to our users.</span> <span data-start="1148.42" data-end="1154.22">You want to think how are we going to communicate this in the browser.</span> <span data-start="1154.22" data-end="1155.22">Is there a save button?</span> <span data-start="1155.22" data-end="1156.56">Still still saving.</span> <span data-start="1156.56" data-end="1157.87">Is it in the middle of syncing?</span> <span data-start="1157.87" data-end="1161.7">Should I wait?</span> <span data-start="1161.7" data-end="1165.69">It's going to happen at some point.</span> <span data-start="1165.69" data-end="1170.28">So this is really still a problem that we need your help to solve and this is what the</span> <span data-start="1170.28" data-end="1177.14">JavaScript community, this is, there are many opportunities for you still to contribute.</span> <span data-start="1177.14" data-end="1182.49">This this is where you can connect with the community, there's a Slack organisation which</span> <span data-start="1182.49" data-end="1188.49">is active and you can talk to all of the people who are involved with all the projects that</span> <span data-start="1188.49" data-end="1195.32">I discussed, and offline camp is a real cool, a fun un-conference way to contribute to the</span> <span data-start="1195.32" data-end="1198.93">community, talk about the things that you're doing because the community wants to hear</span> <span data-start="1198.93" data-end="1204.49">what you're doing and contributing already and how these problems might be solved out</span> <span data-start="1204.49" data-end="1205.53">there.</span> </p>
