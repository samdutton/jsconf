didn't we</span> <span data-start="95.88" data-end="99.24">understand social games um and struck me</span> <span data-start="99.24" data-end="101.13">that social games can actually reach</span> <span data-start="101.13" data-end="103.95">each numbers of people and a very very</span> <span data-start="103.95" data-end="105.869">different target audience much broader</span> <span

data-end="118.68">through those games that's what makes it</span> <span data-start="118.68" data-end="120.45">really exciting we also started to be</span> <span data-start="120.45" data-end="122.31">really global so now our games are</span> <span data-start="122.31" data-end="123.54">played in over a hundred sixty six</span> <span data-start="123.54" data-end="125.67">countries

data-start="129.74" data-end="131.57">now if you look at console games you</span> <span data-start="131.57" data-end="133.28">know they're fun and they played a lot</span> <span data-start="133.28" data-end="136.31">but if you look at social games you see</span> <span data-start="136.31" data-end="139.01">certain pattern right social games if</span> <span data-start="139.01" data-end="140.87">you look at if you compared to TV you</span> <span data-start="140.87" data-end="143.09">know our games like cityville and</span> <span data-start="143.09" data-end="146.3">farmville

data-start="157.13" data-end="160.31">of really broad audience well let's get</span> <span data-start="160.31" data-end="167.09">started flashback so first of all in</span> <span data-start="167.09" data-end="169.94">april 2010 that was the first time where</span> <span data-start="169.94" data-end="172.64">we showed the others engine prototype</span> <span data-start="172.64" data-end="175.97">one so was a the kind of a medieval</span> <span data-start="175.97" data-end="178.16">world where you know guys were walking</span> <span data-start="178.16" data-end="182.06">around stuff like that then that was on</span> <span data-start="182.06" data-end="184.66">a mac where we displayed it then in june</span> <span data-start="184.66" data-end="188.57">2010 we did a new prototype that was you</span> <span data-start="188.57" data-end="193.01">know based in a modern word and most of</span> <span data-start="193.01" data-end="194.51">all about community it was all about</span> <span data-start="194.51" data-end="196.52">running a cross-platform so we're a</span> <span data-start="196.52" data-end="200.03">video that showed it running on ipad and</span> <span data-start="200.03" data-end="202.3">that was the exciting new scoop there</span> <span data-start="202.3" data-end="206.3">then in fifa 2011 I realized that</span> <span data-start="206.3" data-end="208.85">browser games the term browser game is</span> <span data-start="208.85" data-end="211.31">actually diluted and force founding a</span> <span data-start="211.31" data-end="213.29">new term called open web games because</span> <span data-start="213.29" data-end="215.24">that's what we wanted to build we wanted</span> <span data-start="215.24" data-end="216.61">to build games that are cross-platform</span> <span data-start="216.61" data-end="220.12">plugin free and run across any device</span> <span data-start="220.12" data-end="223.58">and I still have the feeling that we</span> <span data-start="223.58" data-end="225.8">were running faster than what technology</span> <span data-start="225.8" data-end="228.14">could give us so we're running away from</span> <span data-start="228.14" data-end="231.17">technology as our time and now it's</span> <span data-start="231.17" data-end="233.65">interesting how it's all develops now so</span> <span data-start="233.65" data-end="237.17">looking back you know from one and a</span> <span data-start="237.17" data-end="239.06">half years ago how did it browser tech</span> <span data-start="239.06" data-end="241.16">evolve and this is you know there's a</span> <span data-start="241.16" data-end="242.57">lot more stuff that's happening but this</span> <span data-start="242.57" data-end="246.08">is what really relevant to us so WebGL</span> <span data-start="246.08" data-end="249.14">let's talk about that first WebGL is</span> <span data-start="249.14" data-end="250.52">exciting and it's really exciting to us</span> <span data-start="250.52" data-end="253.91">because it allows us to you know build</span> <span data-start="253.91" data-end="256.64">stuff in 3d or you know accelerate 2d</span> <span data-start="256.64" data-end="260.06">stuff in 3d however if you look at the</span> <span data-start="260.06" data-end="261.269">adoption pattern of web</span> <span data-start="261.269" data-end="263.4">she'll when child's now almost two years</span> <span data-start="263.4" data-end="266.639">old um yes actually that also the spec</span> <span data-start="266.639" data-end="269.819">is really now has made you but the first</span> <span data-start="269.819" data-end="271.59">implementations we saw you know one and</span> <span data-start="271.59" data-end="275.069">a half years ago so um and still the</span> <span data-start="275.069" data-end="276.389">only thing we're seeing right now our</span> <span data-start="276.389" data-end="280.11">demos and not only are some of them are</span> <span data-start="280.11" data-end="281.909">really cool but they still look like the</span> <span data-start="281.909" data-end="284.25">demo scene from the 90s and now that can</span> <span data-start="284.25" data-end="286.68">be really read oh and retro and sexy but</span> <span data-start="286.68" data-end="289.77">if you want to write a new console you</span> <span data-start="289.77" data-end="291.96">know console game or something that</span> <span data-start="291.96" data-end="293.31">looks like a console game something</span> <span data-start="293.31" data-end="295.319">that's really exciting and attracts</span> <span data-start="295.319" data-end="297.69">people you know I haven't seen a single</span> <span data-start="297.69" data-end="301.62">use case for WebGL get that really you</span> <span data-start="301.62" data-end="304.52">know makes makes a huge huge experience</span> <span data-start="304.52" data-end="307.409">that's bad and I hope you can see</span> <span data-start="307.409" data-end="310.22">something soon canvas whatever canvas</span> <span data-start="310.22" data-end="315.78">our canvas is adopted broader than web</span> <span data-start="315.78" data-end="317.88">shell but we still have to issue that</span> <span data-start="317.88" data-end="320.699">for now the main use case of canvas</span> <span data-start="320.699" data-end="322.949">remains being graphs and charts and</span> <span data-start="322.949" data-end="326.729">that's very unfortunate so no canvas has</span> <span data-start="326.729" data-end="328.169">the advantage that it allows you to do</span> <span data-start="328.169" data-end="329.52">everything and the downside that it</span> <span data-start="329.52" data-end="331.86">allows you to do everything and most</span> <span data-start="331.86" data-end="333">people don't most people don't realize</span> <span data-start="333" data-end="335.49">in the game word is that as soon as you</span> <span data-start="335.49" data-end="338.31">you know have to manage your scene graph</span> <span data-start="338.31" data-end="341.099">for drawing yourself and not leave it to</span> <span data-start="341.099" data-end="344.25">the browser um you're moving all this</span> <span data-start="344.25" data-end="345.84">bottleneck that was on the browser</span> <span data-start="345.84" data-end="348.63">before in native C code and move it to</span> </p>
