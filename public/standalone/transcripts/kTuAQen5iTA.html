data-end="188.93">general it doesn't give a lot of apt</span> <span data-start="188.93" data-end="191.389">description but I like to think of it as</span> <span data-start="191.389" data-end="195.049">the ability to understand and share the</span> <span data-start="195.049" data-end="197.659">feelings of another that's not</span> <span data-start="197.659"

data-end="204.109">connect with them is really true empathy</span> <span data-start="204.109" data-end="208.01">as I see it so where did the other side</span> <span data-start="208.01" data-end="213.59">of empathy come from so as anyone who</span> <span data-start="213.59" data-end="216.22">uses Twitter there tends to be some</span> <span data-start="216.22" data-end="218.019">negative thoughts that come out</span> <span data-start="218.019" data-end="220.069">something comes something new comes out</span> <span data-start="220.069" data-end="222.29">like maybe the Instagram icon that got</span> <span data-start="222.29" data-end="224.06">released yesterday and there are many</span> <span data-start="224.06" data-end="225.65">snap judgments that people come up with</span> <span data-start="225.65" data-end="227.54">their people who instantly have</span> <span data-start="227.54" data-end="228.739">something and they take to Twitter and</span> <span data-start="228.739" data-end="230.419">it's like 140 characters firing off 10</span> <span data-start="230.419" data-end="234.919">10 11 and then this mob mentality forms</span> <span data-start="234.919" data-end="238.22">around it and it's just a layer of</span> <span data-start="238.22" data-end="239.629">negativity that's hard to get through</span> <span data-start="239.629" data-end="242.51">and it must say just really bums me out</span> <span data-start="242.51" data-end="244.849">and it's hard to see some of the</span> <span data-start="244.849" data-end="246.109">positive sides of the internet when</span> <span data-start="246.109" data-end="248.299">stuff like that happens and I wanted to</span> <span data-start="248.299" data-end="250.4">be able to see and connect with those</span> <span data-start="250.4" data-end="252.769">people and be like but if you knew the</span> <span data-start="252.769" data-end="254.72">person who worked on that would you say</span> <span data-start="254.72" data-end="256.97">to their face which you able to connect</span> <span data-start="256.97" data-end="259.789">with them that way and if you knew could</span> <span data-start="259.789" data-end="261.139">empathize with them would you say the</span> <span data-start="261.139" data-end="262.76">same thing and we've heard from Rachel</span> <span data-start="262.76" data-end="266.479">about how she was so fearful of</span> <span data-start="266.479" data-end="268.789">contributing and becoming part of the</span> <span data-start="268.789" data-end="270.32">open source community because of those</span> <span data-start="270.32" data-end="271.82">negative things that happen it's not</span> <span data-start="271.82" data-end="273.02">just Twitter</span> <span data-start="273.02" data-end="275.12">and in a lot of open communities so how</span> <span data-start="275.12" data-end="277.37">can resolve that how can we add empathy</span> <span data-start="277.37" data-end="279.47">and encourage it from our perspective</span> <span data-start="279.47" data-end="281.69">and get and receive it as well so the</span> <span data-start="281.69" data-end="283.49">other side is encouraging it as well as</span> <span data-start="283.49" data-end="286.879">be able to receive it back so it breaks</span> <span data-start="286.879" data-end="290.389">down into kind of four tenants I like to</span> <span data-start="290.389" data-end="293.72">say one of them is context constructive</span> <span data-start="293.72" data-end="295.9">feedback as rachel has mentioned before</span> <span data-start="295.9" data-end="298.46">communication is very important and last</span> <span data-start="298.46" data-end="300.74">of all caring and these are kind of what</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="300.74" data-end="302.99">I'll be going through in-depth and</span> <span data-start="302.99" data-end="307.19">describing kind of how these apply to my</span> <span data-start="307.19" data-end="310.78">everyday job and as well as how I</span> <span data-start="310.78" data-end="312.46">impacted by the open source community</span> <span data-start="312.46" data-end="314.389">and things I've learned from it as well</span> <span data-start="314.389" data-end="316.849">so I gave you all that but that</span> <span data-start="316.849" data-end="318.86">background knowledge that's basically a</span> <span data-start="318.86" data-end="323.63">context so another description that</span> <span data-start="323.63" data-end="325.969">internal external factors that influence</span> <span data-start="325.969" data-end="327.949">the decisions we make any actions we</span> <span data-start="327.949" data-end="331.31">take internally could be subconscious it</span> <span data-start="331.31" data-end="333.83">could be something or could be external</span> <span data-start="333.83" data-end="335.78">factors by the way people we've learned</span> <span data-start="335.78" data-end="339.289">from others so it relates into this</span> <span data-start="339.289" data-end="343.759">other side theory in that no one is</span> <span data-start="343.759" data-end="346.759">unoffending dated we have something that</span> <span data-start="346.759" data-end="348.11">we we have some kind of bias that we</span> <span data-start="348.11" data-end="349.34">have we may not recognize it right away</span> <span data-start="349.34" data-end="351.409">but it's there we've heard of onion</span> <span data-start="351.409" data-end="352.669">pending native frameworks but the fact</span> <span data-start="352.669" data-end="355.279">that it's not a framework but a library</span> <span data-start="355.279" data-end="357.319">or a bunch of modules is an opinion</span> <span data-start="357.319" data-end="358.4">about how they want to structure their</span> <span data-start="358.4" data-end="362.659">project we all have biases like I said</span> <span data-start="362.659" data-end="365.389">it may recognize it or not an important</span> <span data-start="365.389" data-end="367.819">part of contexts listening if someone's</span> <span data-start="367.819" data-end="369.469">trying to give you some from information</span> <span data-start="369.469" data-end="370.88">and you're not listening or we're not</span> <span data-start="370.88" data-end="373.819">listening back then it just kind of</span> <span data-start="373.819" data-end="375.83">negates the whole part of empathizing</span> <span data-start="375.83" data-end="379.719">with them and of course asking why and</span> <span data-start="379.719" data-end="383.479">asking why in a good way in an</span> <span data-start="383.479" data-end="385.849">intentional way and wanting to learn</span> <span data-start="385.849" data-end="387.65">from it and just continue asking why</span> <span data-start="387.65" data-end="390.169">until we find out and can connect with</span> <span data-start="390.169" data-end="392.509">them and not why in a condescending way</span> <span data-start="392.509" data-end="394.55">like rachel has heard from before and</span> <span data-start="394.55" data-end="398.659">kind of feigning ignorance and we can do</span> <span data-start="398.659"
