data-start="585.32" data-end="587.029">thinking wow what an incredible person</span> <span data-start="587.029" data-end="589.209">like I thought all chefs were assholes</span> <span data-start="589.209" data-end="592.01">and then they show footage of him in the</span> <span data-start="592.01" data-end="594.32">kitchen and he like every other chef is</span> <span data-start="594.32" data-end="598.279">a monster just like I mean just one of</span> <span data-start="598.279" data-end="599.93">the worst that I've ever seen just a</span> <span data-start="599.93" data-end="601.779">total train wreck in the kitchen</span> <span data-start="601.779" data-end="604.7">so as good documentarians they asked him</span> <span data-start="604.7" data-end="606.23">they say you know we're talking to this</span> <span data-start="606.23" data-end="609.23">guy and he's super like sweet thoughtful</span> <span data-start="609.23" data-end="612.02">nice poetic and then on the other hand</span> <span data-start="612.02" data-end="613.43">like we see you in the kitchen and you</span> <span data-start="613.43" data-end="617.27">were just a beast I need he kind of sits</span> <span data-start="617.27" data-end="619.97">back thoughtfully for a second and says</span> <span data-start="619.97" data-end="622.52">you know the way I'm in the kitchen is</span> <span data-start="622.52" data-end="627.11">abhorrent but that's how I learned you</span> <span data-start="627.11" data-end="628.579">know from the people who mentored me and</span> <span data-start="628.579" data-end="630.17">that's how they learned from the people</span> <span data-start="630.17" data-end="632.899">that mentored them and I don't know how</span> <span data-start="632.899" data-end="635.959">to do any different and I was just I was</span> <span data-start="635.959" data-end="637.91">just weeping as I was watching this</span> <span data-start="637.91" data-end="642.13">because I was like it me it me I feel it</span> <span data-start="642.13" data-end="646.61">and I think that's so often in this</span> <span data-start="646.61" data-end="649.97">industry we front with certainty we want</span> <span data-start="649.97" data-end="652.43">to feel smart and to feel like we know</span> <span data-start="652.43" data-end="655.19">the answers and to be certain about the</span> <span data-start="655.19" data-end="657.589">things that are ahead of us this is how</span> <span data-start="657.589" data-end="659.57">we nail job interviews this is how we</span> <span data-start="659.57" data-end="661.49">you know continue to progress in our</span> <span data-start="661.49" data-end="666.589">career etc and we use this certainty as</span> <span data-start="666.589" data-end="669.199">a cheat code we love to find like best</span> <span data-start="669.199" data-end="671.149">practices and patterns that we can use</span> <span data-start="671.149" data-end="674.27">and apply this allows us to like feel</span> <span data-start="674.27"

skill was outpacing</span> <span data-start="682.19" data-end="684.23">experience I had a lot of opinions on</span> <span data-start="684.23" data-end="686.95">things that I had not actually earned</span> <span data-start="686.95" data-end="690.64">experience in and this is problematic</span> <span data-start="690.64" data-end="693.41">now I'm about to offend maybe half of</span> <span data-start="693.41" data-end="696.68">you this is a lot like religion my early</span> <span data-start="696.68" data-end="698.93">religious experiences were were such</span> <span data-start="698.93" data-end="701.69">that I grew up Baptist and there was</span> <span data-start="701.69" data-end="704.54">such that everything was a sin or on the</span> <span data-start="704.54" data-end="706.49">front steps of a sin and the only way</span> <span data-start="706.49" data-end="707.9">that you could make it to heaven was to</span> <span data-start="707.9" data-end="709.76">never even get close to anything that</span> <span data-start="709.76" data-end="712.82">kind of looked like a sin but if you if</span> <span data-start="712.82" data-end="715.01">you were successful in that then like it</span> <span data-start="715.01" data-end="716.81">was like guarantee you were like you</span> <span data-start="716.81" data-end="720.12">were gonna go no problem</span> <span data-start="720.13" data-end="722.27">now I'm gonna offend the other half of</span> <span data-start="722.27" data-end="726.98">you um I think that all of us in this</span> <span data-start="726.98" data-end="729.08">tech field are religious about something</span> <span data-start="729.08" data-end="732.26">so maybe you were atheist agnostic not</span> <span data-start="732.26" data-end="734.81">not religious at all I think that we as</span> <span data-start="734.81" data-end="738.17">a culture have very strong and religious</span> <span data-start="738.17" data-end="740.96">opinions about the way that we develop a</span> <span data-start="740.96" data-end="744.11">code the way that we write it and the</span> <span data-start="744.11" data-end="745.7">way that we treat people when they don't</span> <span data-start="745.7" data-end="747.26">write it the way that we think it should</span> <span data-start="747.26" data-end="750.47">be written and lately we've been</span> <span data-start="750.47" data-end="752.48">starting to teach this to our robots</span> <span data-start="752.48" data-end="754.88">so now you can have blazing fast</span> <span data-start="754.88" data-end="757.339">religious criticism right into your</span> <span data-start="757.339" data-end="762.71">editor and as religious organizations</span> <span data-start="762.71" data-end="764.51">we're always on the hunt for a villain</span> <span data-start="764.51" data-end="766.37">we always want to find the bad thing</span> <span data-start="766.37" data-end="768.23">that's kind of caught the source of all</span> <span data-start="768.23" data-end="772.28">of our problems and never is it internal</span> <span data-start="772.28" data-end="773.93">we never look inside we say that it's</span> <span data-start="773.93" data-end="776.12">the customer the p.m. the owner of the</span> <span data-start="776.12" data-end="779.089">company the stakeholders we always want</span> <span data-start="779.089" data-end="781.01">to look externally that they're the</span> <span data-start="781.01" data-end="782.66">problem all of these unpredictable</span> <span data-start="782.66" data-end="785.839">sources of change that's what that's the</span> <span data-start="785.839" data-end="787.67">problem with our app if we could just be</span> <span data-start="787.67" data-end="789.83">certain and know exactly how we're</span> <span data-start="789.83" data-end="792.29">moving forward then everything would be</span> <span data-start="792.29" data-end="792.77">great</span> <span data-start="792.77" data-end="797.51">that's not how applications work so I</span> <span data-start="797.51" data-end="800.9">want to tell you right now it's okay to</span> <span data-start="800.9" data-end="803.45">be uncertain whatever level of</span> <span data-start="803.45" data-end="805.91">experience you're at it's okay to be</span> <span data-start="805.91" data-end="806.92">uncertain</span> <span data-start="806.92" data-end="810.08">honestly the greatest leaps in my career</span> <span data-start="810.08" data-end="811.1">have been</span> <span data-start="811.1" data-end="814.07">when I walked into uncertainty not</span> <span data-start="814.07" data-end="815.449">knowing what the answer was going to be</span> <span data-start="815.449" data-end="817.31">and kind of figured it out as I went</span> <span data-start="817.31" data-end="821.87">along there are no Universal rules so I</span> <span data-start="821.87" data-end="823.55">want to illustrate this it might be kind</span> <span data-start="823.55" data-end="825.98">of hard to see so so I'll illustrate it</span> <span data-start="825.98" data-end="829.759">verbally as well so this is who's who's</span> <span data-start="829.759" data-end="831.17">heard about dry code don't repeat</span> <span data-start="831.17" data-end="833.779">yourself yeah okay I'm gonna suing</span> <span data-start="833.779" data-end="835.25">everyone most of the hands went up but I</span> <span data-start="835.25" data-end="837.5">think most of you have heard about it so</span> <span data-start="837.5" data-end="840.8">um dry stands for don't repeat yourself</span> <span data-start="840.8" data-end="842.6">and this is one of the kind of first</span> <span data-start="842.6" data-end="845.54">tenets of clean great code that you</span> <span data-start="845.54" data-end="848.209">learn early on now we had a mentor come</span> <span data-start="848.209" data-end="849.829">into our company and start to talk with</span> <span data-start="849.829" data-end="851.6">us about how to make like really</span> <span data-start="851.6" data-end="854.329">adaptable agile code and this is</span> <span data-start="854.329" data-end="855.68">something that she said over and over</span> <span data-start="855.68" data-end="857.72">again as we presented some of our</span> <span data-start="857.72" data-end="860.6">solutions to theoretical problems that</span> <span data-start="860.6" data-end="863.199">were like just perfectly well abstracted</span> <span data-start="863.199" data-end="866.06">she would say that code looks so dry</span> <span data-start="866.06" data-end="870.17">that it chafes now if you're like a</span> <span data-start="870.17" data-end="872.48">runner or a cyclist like you know about</span> <span data-start="872.48" data-end="876.529">chafing it's not fun um and so I wanted</span> <span data-start="876.529" data-end="877.639">to kind of like illustrate this with</span> <span data-start="877.639" data-end="880.819">play-doh so here I have some brand new</span> <span data-start="880.819" data-end="882.74">out of the container of play-doh and</span> <span data-start="882.74" data-end="885.11">it's like very pliable it's very like it</span> <span data-start="885.11" data-end="886.85">doesn't put up a lot of fight when I try</span> <span data-start="886.85" data-end="889.49">to change its shape I can make this be</span> <span data-start="889.49" data-end="892.639">whatever I need it to be now on this</span> <span data-start="892.639" data-end="894.47">side I have some dry play-doh</span> <span data-start="894.47" data-end="896.75">now unfortunately play-doh has gotten</span> <span data-start="896.75" data-end="898.85">really good and I thought two days out</span> <span data-start="898.85" data-end="901.579">would make it very dry but it only kind</span> <span data-start="901.579" data-end="905.449">of made it kind of dry so um hopefully</span> <span data-start="905.449" data-end="908.6">this will be enough um as I so this</span> <span data-start="908.6" data-end="910.459">resists me so as I try to like squish it</span> <span data-start="910.459" data-end="914.12">it resists and if I really try to push</span> <span data-start="914.12" data-end="916.31">it you can see like cracks start to form</span> <span data-start="916.31" data-end="918.38">this is really it's it's very resistant</span> <span data-start="918.38" data-end="919.73">to the change that I'm trying to apply</span> <span data-start="919.73" data-end="921.889">to it so it kind of wants to stay in</span> <span data-start="921.889" data-end="925.79">this shape you can see you wanted to say</span> <span data-start="925.79" data-end="927.889">that does the purpose of design is to</span> <span data-start="927.889" data-end="929.93">allow you to do design later and its</span> <span data-start="929.93" data-end="932.12">primary goal is to reduce the cost of</span> <span data-start="932.12" data-end="938.23">change and in that sense dry is dead</span> <span data-start="938.23" data-end="940.639">something that's been dried out we</span> <span data-start="940.639" data-end="942.319">oftentimes have the experience of having</span> <span data-start="942.319" data-end="944.52">to rehydrate it in order to make it</span> <span data-start="944.52" data-end="946.47">in order to change it to make the thing</span> <span data-start="946.47" data-end="948.63">that it now needs to be when we get new</span> <span data-start="948.63" data-end="951.57">constraints and inevitably we will get</span> <span data-start="951.57" data-end="953.28">new constraints this is the way that</span> <span data-start="953.28" data-end="954.96">that software works this is how our</span> <span data-start="954.96" data-end="958.8">businesses and applications grow and</span> <span data-start="958.8" data-end="962.28">there's a context for all of these rules</span> <span data-start="962.28" data-end="966.03">these strong tenets of code and they can</span> <span data-start="966.03" data-end="967.89">be more or less divided into two</span> <span data-start="967.89" data-end="969.3">categories things that we know and</span> <span data-start="969.3" data-end="971.07">things that we don't know things that we</span> <span data-start="971.07" data-end="973.41">know become naturally stable and things</span> <span data-start="973.41" data-end="975.24">that we don't know need to remain</span> <span data-start="975.24" data-end="979.17">pliable for as long as possible where we</span> <span data-start="979.17" data-end="980.94">get into trouble is when we try to like</span> <span data-start="980.94" data-end="983.73">take rules from one side and use them on</span> <span data-start="983.73" data-end="986.76">the other so an example is dry write dry</span> <span data-start="986.76" data-end="989.19">is great in some cases we want a hat</span> <span data-start="989.19" data-end="992.58">like you can't build a castle I guess</span> <span data-start="992.58" data-end="994.41">you can't build a castle out of play-doh</span> <span data-start="994.41" data-end="996.06">right you need stones you need hardened</span> <span data-start="996.06" data-end="999.24">stones that's good when we move that to</span> <span data-start="999.24" data-end="1000.74">things that need to change things that</span> <span data-start="1000.74" data-end="1002.81">were uncertain about well that becomes</span> <span data-start="1002.81" data-end="1005.3">really that becomes bad it becomes hard</span> <span data-start="1005.3" data-end="1006.98">to change those things if they're dried</span> <span data-start="1006.98" data-end="1009.11">out another thing is readability</span> <span data-start="1009.11" data-end="1011.72">readability is awesome on things that</span> <span data-start="1011.72" data-end="1014.42">we're uncertain about and need to change</span> <span data-start="1014.42" data-end="1017.23">regularly but it can become a liability</span> <span data-start="1017.23" data-end="1020">in in parts of our code that are</span> <span data-start="1020" data-end="1022.07">hardened and I say that because while</span> <span data-start="1022.07" data-end="1024.14">readability is always good sometimes it</span> <span data-start="1024.14" data-end="1026.66">does take a second third or fourth seed</span> <span data-start="1026.66" data-end="1030.65">to things like performance and when you</span> <span data-start="1030.65" data-end="1033.95">try to like re readable performant code</span> <span data-start="1033.95" data-end="1040.01">you actually make it worse so in that I</span> <span data-start="1040.01" data-end="1042.14">believe that components are our</span> <span data-start="1042.14" data-end="1045.29">architecture now you can sub that for</span> <span data-start="1045.29" data-end="1046.67">modules if you're not a front-end</span> <span data-start="1046.67" data-end="1048.44">developer however most of my experiences</span> <span data-start="1048.44" data-end="1052.67">in the front-end space modules are</span> <span data-start="1052.67" data-end="1054.11">really fascinating we have these a lot</span> <span data-start="1054.11" data-end="1056.48">in in music and music provides a</span> <span data-start="1056.48" data-end="1059.27">beautiful illustration for this in a lot</span> <span data-start="1059.27" data-end="1061.34">of musical systems like a modular system</span> <span data-start="1061.34" data-end="1064.85">in music production you have a lot of</span> <span data-start="1064.85" data-end="1067.79">black boxes and these black boxes are</span> <span data-start="1067.79" data-end="1070.39">composed together to get a new sound</span> <span data-start="1070.39" data-end="1073.52">each of these boxes the implementation</span> <span data-start="1073.52" data-end="1075.32">is hidden from you and you have just an</span> <span data-start="1075.32" data-end="1077.36">interface to kind of control the you</span> <span data-start="1077.36" data-end="1077.62">know</span> <span data-start="1077.62" data-end="1082.9">the parameters of that and these modules</span> <span data-start="1082.9" data-end="1085.57">can come from very disparate places they</span> <span data-start="1085.57" data-end="1086.89">can come from different manufacturers</span> <span data-start="1086.89" data-end="1088.9">that can have very different things but</span> <span data-start="1088.9" data-end="1090.039">as long as they have a single</span> <span data-start="1090.039" data-end="1092.83">responsibility and they have a common</span> <span data-start="1092.83" data-end="1094.15">interface well they can all work</span> <span data-start="1094.15" data-end="1097.98">together to create a new sound and if</span> <span data-start="1097.98"
