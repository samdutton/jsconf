<p><span data-start="13.509" data-end="17.429">This is very short talk about doing donuts with SVG</span> <span data-start="19.539" data-end="25.499">You might think it's pretty simple if you know SVG because you know you just do a circle it's not that hard</span> <span data-start="26.199" data-end="29.129">But what I found in practice doing this is it needed math?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="30.16" data-end="35.459">And even though I did university level calculus. I've forgotten every last bit of it somewhere along the way</span> <span data-start="36.46" data-end="39.75">So I had to learn how to do maths again. Just to do donuts</span> <span data-start="40.87" data-end="43.71">When you get donuts out of math and math is probably worth it</span> <span data-start="46.51" data-end="52.379">I'm just gonna change the view here so we can see but there's a little bit of CSS just for colouring</span> <span data-start="53.02" data-end="59.879">But it's not really relevant and where it goes. I mean, I'm wearing my CSS t-shirt. There's no JavaScript in this whatsoever</span> <span data-start="65.76" data-end="67.88">So here we've got just a</span> <span data-start="68.79" data-end="70.62">regular doughnut of the top</span> <span data-start="70.62" data-end="76.55">I've got one with a half circle and we'll get a full circle so the ideal of what we were trying to achieve here was</span> <span data-start="77.16" data-end="79.459">To show progress basically we do donuts</span> <span data-start="80.16" data-end="85.1">If you're doing this for the circle. It's not too hard, but when you're trying to reduce the</span> <span data-start="85.62" data-end="89.749">The length of the line it takes a bit of thought</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="92.52" data-end="99.409">So looking at the code here what we're actually using is you've got usual stroke, width which determines</span> <span data-start="99.41" data-end="103.219">How wide something is we've got the out of circle. Which is a stroke width of 12</span> <span data-start="103.65" data-end="106.4">It is a circle so it has a radius of 12</span> <span data-start="107.31" data-end="108.72">so</span> <span data-start="108.72" data-end="111.589">Radius of 12 stroke width of 12 it takes up the entire</span> <span data-start="112.26" data-end="114.26">container</span> <span data-start="114.54" data-end="117.889">The problem is if you want to actually leave a hole in the middle of it</span> <span data-start="119.34" data-end="121.7">So looking at the red circle here</span> <span data-start="122.25" data-end="128.149">It has a stroke width of 10. It's a radius of 10, so it's slightly indented. So we can see what's going on</span> <span data-start="129.149" data-end="136.819">It has a stroke dash array now. This is something. I've not really come across before least like you can this is how you do</span> <span data-start="137.85" data-end="141.409">Like dashes in SVG so a little bit on little bit off</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="142.08" data-end="144.649">But the problem is when it applies to a circle</span> <span data-start="145.26" data-end="152.329">My first thought is maybe this would work in degrees or something like this when I looked at it. It wasn't very well documented</span> <span data-start="154.62" data-end="156.98">So I can I had to find out by trial and error</span> <span data-start="156.98" data-end="161.329">And I even found out by looking at one of my colleagues code who tried this</span> <span data-start="161.64" data-end="165.8">Came up with the solution that seemed to work, but then we found out the maths was completely wrong so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="166.8" data-end="171.199">What we really need to do is actually look at how do you calculate a?</span> <span data-start="172.38" data-end="178.88">Radius or something and that's math it's 2 PI R. So if I want something in this case. I've got my</span> <span data-start="179.94" data-end="183.169">Unpop the font size a bit that's readable enough anyway</span> <span data-start="184.56" data-end="187.55">for my red circle my stroke â€” array is</span> <span data-start="188.31" data-end="189.75">62.8318 what's that?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="191.73" data-end="197.629">What it is is I increase the size of that two times Math.PI?</span> <span data-start="198.69" data-end="203.24">x My radius, which is 10 and my answer here is</span> <span data-start="204.51" data-end="207.5">62.8318 and NASA made it all the way to</span> <span data-start="208.68" data-end="212.66">Outside our galaxy using 4 decimal places so you don't need any more than that</span> <span data-start="215.04" data-end="219.98">If I want to reduce this all I need to do is multiply that by what I don't want it to be</span> <span data-start="220.17" data-end="223.729">So if it only wants to be a half circle I can multiply by 0.5</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="224.58" data-end="226.58">So there's my result</span> <span data-start="226.65" data-end="228.65">actually</span> <span data-start="228.81" data-end="231.229">Let's put that in there 31.</span> <span data-start="233.55" data-end="237.289">4159 and now I've got a half circle</span> <span data-start="237.93" data-end="239.519">and</span> <span data-start="239.519" data-end="245.119">Then you can go with anything so my inner circle I've got here is not actually rendering right now because there's nothing there</span> <span data-start="245.94" data-end="247.94">my stroke dash array is</span> <span data-start="248.7" data-end="249.9">0</span> <span data-start="249.9" data-end="251.9">52</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="252.42" data-end="255.89">Which is basically from the start to</span> <span data-start="256.799" data-end="260.719">50 point 2 6 5 5 which is 2 pi 8</span> <span data-start="262.68" data-end="265.25">Don't show anything and then start the dash again</span> <span data-start="267.54" data-end="271.519">So 2 pi 8 let's reduce it a bit we'll go</span> <span data-start="275.58" data-end="281.72">Go by point 5 so I've now got 25.13 if I modify this</span> <span data-start="284.28" data-end="291.709">25.1327 oh and I've broke it and I'd done my math wrong</span> <span data-start="295.41" data-end="301.969">Ha ha live demo I've done something wrong all right over 25, not 23, ah</span> </p>
