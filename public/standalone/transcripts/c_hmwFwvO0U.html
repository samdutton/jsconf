sort of things are available so for</span> <span data-start="1342.91" data-end="1345.16">slack it has this little button where</span> <span data-start="1345.16" data-end="1346.48">you can click view more and you'll</span> <span data-start="1346.48" data-end="1349.27">refresh things that are there and so</span> <span data-start="1349.27" data-end="1352.09">this does not apply to say the Skype</span> <span data-start="1352.09" data-end="1354.34">using the face and Skype has something</span> <span data-start="1354.34" data-end="1356.98">that is similar but it's not quite the</span>

data-end="1382.45">use generic templates and facebook</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1382.45" data-end="1384.85">Messenger so in this case you can see</span> <span data-start="1384.85" data-end="1386.26">that there are buttons where you can</span> <span data-start="1386.26" data-end="1391.54">click and this is entirely only it's</span> <span data-start="1391.54" data-end="1393.52">something that is very Facebook specific</span> <span data-start="1393.52" data-end="1395.71">and it's really trying to exploit the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1395.71" data-end="1400.48">API and you can use ron-karr which is an</span> <span data-start="1400.48" data-end="1403.54">app that I wrote this is a library that</span> <span data-start="1403.54" data-end="1406">I wrote so what it does is it allows you</span> <span data-start="1406" data-end="1408.34">to write like send text and it gives you</span> <span data-start="1408.34" data-end="1411.36">the ellipses and you can't wait for</span> <span data-start="1411.36" data-end="1413.74">3,000 milliseconds to send the next one</span> <span data-start="1413.74" data-end="1415.51">and you can do simple things like</span> <span data-start="1415.51" data-end="1417.429">sending imagers there are a lot of</span> <span data-start="1417.429" data-end="1419.19">libraries out there and the odd differ</span> <span data-start="1419.19" data-end="1423.16">in the expressivity of the API and I</span> <span data-start="1423.16" data-end="1425.919">want to do something like being able to</span> <span data-start="1425.919" data-end="1428.08">do something like what a to express what</span> <span data-start="1428.08" data-end="1430.72">a human could have done and lastly is to</span> <span data-start="1430.72" data-end="1435.1">handle errors so you know we need to</span> <span data-start="1435.1" data-end="1437.98">make sure that so always test for</span> <span data-start="1437.98" data-end="1441.25">negative scenarios so more often than</span> <span data-start="1441.25" data-end="1443.62">not we we always expect that the API</span> <span data-start="1443.62" data-end="1445.51">that we are connecting to will always</span> <span data-start="1445.51" data-end="1446.74">give a positive result</span> <span data-start="1446.74" data-end="1448.27">make sure you have another negative use</span> <span data-start="1448.27" data-end="1453.25">case as well so that's so I'm going to</span> <span data-start="1453.25" data-end="1454.87">go through like the the problems I faced</span> <span data-start="1454.87" data-end="1458.11">when building blocks choosing what to</span> <span data-start="1458.11" data-end="1461.95">view is actually pretty hard your</span> <span data-start="1461.95" data-end="1463.63">business functions can be represented in</span> <span data-start="1463.63" data-end="1466.39">so many ways of the raw and not every</span> <span data-start="1466.39" data-end="1468.58">part of the business makes sense to</span> <span data-start="1468.58" data-end="1471.07">develop into a chatbot and if the more</span> <span data-start="1471.07" data-end="1473.53">so the next is you are encroaching the</span> <span data-start="1473.53" data-end="1475.02">personal space such as phase</span> <span data-start="1475.02" data-end="1476.73">messenger meaning that their friends are</span> <span data-start="1476.73" data-end="1478.62">there the last thing you ever want to do</span> <span data-start="1478.62" data-end="1481.2">is you you tell them more than their</span> <span data-start="1481.2" data-end="1483.09">friends tell them and they will just</span> <span data-start="1483.09" data-end="1485.46">delete your app and if you're more</span> <span data-start="1485.46" data-end="1487.41">spammy than the other BOTS people won't</span> <span data-start="1487.41" data-end="1489.45">like it too and if you try to become</span> <span data-start="1489.45" data-end="1491.76">more conversation or just make sure that</span> <span data-start="1491.76" data-end="1493.98">there are real human beings they are</span> <span data-start="1493.98" data-end="1496.23">also using the messaging app they try</span> <span data-start="1496.23" data-end="1498.3">and chat with their friends so if you</span> <span data-start="1498.3" data-end="1500.1">were to do that you set the bar very</span> <span data-start="1500.1" data-end="1503.31">high and lastly every chat messenger</span> <span data-start="1503.31" data-end="1506.22">messaging system is a medium with</span> <span data-start="1506.22" data-end="1507.81">special characteristic hence they have</span> <span data-start="1507.81" data-end="1511.56">different api's and if you support more</span> <span data-start="1511.56" data-end="1513.03">than one chat system you might want to</span> <span data-start="1513.03" data-end="1515.46">build things like micro services to</span> <span data-start="1515.46" data-end="1518.46">connect to and so instead of having one</span> <span data-start="1518.46" data-end="1520.65">app there just saw facebook Messenger</span> <span data-start="1520.65" data-end="1522.33">you have a facebook messenger interface</span> <span data-start="1522.33" data-end="1524.55">you have a pic messenger in the face</span> <span data-start="1524.55" data-end="1526.89">slight interface and they all connect to</span> <span data-start="1526.89" data-end="1529.34">a central micro service that is able to</span> <span data-start="1529.34" data-end="1531.54">figure out the responses there is</span> <span data-start="1531.54" data-end="1537.35">appropriate so just to touch on</span> <span data-start="1537.35" data-end="1541.32">conversation and structure text for</span> <span data-start="1541.32" data-end="1543.06">conversational text is less predictable</span> <span data-start="1543.06" data-end="1545.57">and potentially it's more open-ended and</span> <span data-start="1545.57" data-end="1548.49">it requires complex rules based system</span> <span data-start="1548.49" data-end="1550.71">or machine learning capabilities so my</span> <span data-start="1550.71" data-end="1552.54">recommendation is that if you cannot do</span> <span data-start="1552.54" data-end="1554.76">that you should not try to do that</span> <span data-start="1554.76" data-end="1559.2">there's this app that is really well</span> <span data-start="1559.2" data-end="1561.54">done called human in Jesse's story and</span> <span data-start="1561.54" data-end="1563.61">if you can see the dialogue you know it</span> <span data-start="1563.61" data-end="1565.11">tries to be very conversational I'm the</span> <span data-start="1565.11" data-end="1567.06">blue by the way I have not the de crayon</span> <span data-start="1567.06" data-end="1570.45">and if you you can say hey Jesse and is</span> <span data-start="1570.45" data-end="1572.73">is able to pull off a pretty decent</span> <span data-start="1572.73" data-end="1575.4">conversation with you and I realized</span> <span data-start="1575.4" data-end="1578.28">that it's is one of those it's like a</span> <span data-start="1578.28" data-end="1580.11">very it's like a little go</span> <span data-start="1580.11" data-end="1582.72">so I reply back with what I think a</span> <span data-start="1582.72" data-end="1585.66">little girl would have replied okay so</span> <span data-start="1585.66" data-end="1588.75">on on that note structured text is more</span> <span data-start="1588.75" data-end="1591.99">predictable hence it's is with limited</span> <span data-start="1591.99" data-end="1594.12">functionality but you get to control a</span> <span data-start="1594.12" data-end="1598.86">lot more so we built SG is an example of</span> <span data-start="1598.86" data-end="1601.92">a structure chat bot so it's built by me</span> <span data-start="1601.92" data-end="1605.22">and the web us G API and you can try</span> <span data-start="1605.22" data-end="1607.5">asking about upcoming events and he only</span> <span data-start="1607.5" data-end="1608.64">tells you that</span> <span data-start="1608.64" data-end="1610.23">and he also tells you things like you</span> <span data-start="1610.23" data-end="1612.51">can check the latest repository it tells</span> <span data-start="1612.51" data-end="1615.03">you about podcast by the specific things</span> <span data-start="1615.03" data-end="1616.62">then it knows what to do</span> <span data-start="1616.62" data-end="1618.57">it doesn't do more than more than just</span> <span data-start="1618.57" data-end="1622.44">three functions essentially so lastly</span> <span data-start="1622.44" data-end="1623.94">sometimes coding by yourself is not</span> <span data-start="1623.94" data-end="1626.19">necessarily the right solution depending</span> <span data-start="1626.19" data-end="1629.4">on the scope sometimes you might find</span> <span data-start="1629.4"
