<p><span data-start="225.129" data-end="232.069">Thus developers at this points are often forced to discover the not-so-glamorous parts of</span> <span data-start="232.069" data-end="233.89">React.</span> <span data-start="233.89" data-end="238.95">Oftentimes we will want to pass data as props around the app quite a bit and React advocates</span> <span data-start="238.95" data-end="245.409">for a single directional flow and things get messy when we want data in sync when two or</span> <span data-start="245.409" data-end="248.249">more components share that data.</span> <span data-start="248.249" data-end="251.79">The source of truth is only in one place.</span> <span data-start="251.79" data-end="255.349">React docs encourages us to lift state up.</span> <span data-start="255.349" data-end="261.04">If you have two children that need to access the same data and this means putting the data</span> <span data-start="261.04" data-end="264.21">in the nearest ancestor of the two components.</span> <span data-start="264.21" data-end="269.43">If these two components are very far apart in the tree, the nearest ancestor could be</span> <span data-start="269.43" data-end="272.72">at the top level of the component tree.</span> <span data-start="272.72" data-end="279.25">To complicate things even more, the immediate components, have absolutely  —  may have absolutely</span> <span data-start="279.25" data-end="282.5">no use for the props it is being passed.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="365.43" data-end="370.83">There is coupling between the components and its parents and between the component's children</span> <span data-start="370.83" data-end="373.19">that it is passing props to.</span> <span data-start="373.19" data-end="378.449">Thus, to no one surprise, this impacts performance as every update made to the data causes all</span> <span data-start="378.449" data-end="383.169">of the children to rerender which causes massive performance and speed issues.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="383.169" data-end="386.23">It is really a balancing act.</span> <span data-start="386.23" data-end="390.75">There are many great things React drink brings to the table.</span> <span data-start="390.75" data-end="395.759">It is important to find a solution for managing an application state if you are looking to</span> <span data-start="395.759" data-end="401.509">build something more complex than a to-do list.</span> <span data-start="401.509" data-end="411.31">When we are in the designing phrase of a project, we often, more often than not we want an app</span> <span data-start="411.31" data-end="413.569">to be able to scale.</span> <span data-start="413.569" data-end="418.86">We want to be able to create something maintainable for many months or years into the future and</span> <span data-start="418.86" data-end="424.599">dare I say it be nice to maintain our sanity when it comes to state management which brings</span> <span data-start="424.599" data-end="426.75">me to Redux.</span> <span data-start="426.75" data-end="431.21">The state container superhero that saves our day.</span> <span data-start="431.21" data-end="435.31">Remember the chaos that was the mess of passing data around our components?</span> <span data-start="435.31" data-end="438.96">That is what Redux successfully helps you make sense of.</span> <span data-start="438.96" data-end="444.83">Redux is a state management tool for JavaScript applications meaning I can pass data, or say</span> <span data-start="444.83" data-end="452.009">the embarrassing story about my most recent Bumble escapades to my cousin without telling</span> <span data-start="452.009" data-end="453.669">my aunt about it.</span> <span data-start="453.669" data-end="460.1">AKA I get to avoid the chaos of that story being bounced around all the components or</span> <span data-start="460.1" data-end="466.33">my many crazy uncles just to update or change one of them and this is important because</span> <span data-start="466.33" data-end="472.86">of Redux's most important principle: The global store.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="472.86" data-end="473.86">Let's talk about that.</span> <span data-start="473.86" data-end="479.28">The big thing to remember is that the entire state of the application is stored in one</span> <span data-start="479.28" data-end="486.3">central location called the store meaning that each component of your React app gets</span> <span data-start="486.3" data-end="491.389">to have direct access to the state of the application without having to send props down</span> <span data-start="491.389" data-end="497.04">to child components or using callback functions to send data back up to a parent.</span> <span data-start="497.04" data-end="499.199">That is pretty dreamy.</span> <span data-start="499.199" data-end="502.919">Redux provides essential storage that can hold data from anywhere in the application.</span> <span data-start="502.919" data-end="509.819">To put it differently, Redux completely eliminates the messy tunneling when you are passing data</span> <span data-start="509.819" data-end="516.01">down from a parent to subcomponents and manipulating that.</span> <span data-start="516.01" data-end="523.7">Today I am going to add each piece of Redux to my React app to show how that all works</span> <span data-start="523.7" data-end="524.7">together.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="524.7" data-end="530.25">So for the app I showed you earlier, you can imagine that each color is a different React</span> <span data-start="530.25" data-end="531.28">component.</span> <span data-start="531.28" data-end="537.02">Currently, with just React the data in this app flows directionally as so.</span> <span data-start="537.02" data-end="544.51">I want to add Redux so that the data transfer and state look more like this referring back</span> <span data-start="544.51" data-end="550.27">to the Redux diagram had first thing we have to build is our store.</span> <span data-start="550.27" data-end="557.94">It is crucial to remember the store in Redux is like the human brain and absolutely fundamental.</span> <span data-start="557.94" data-end="560.81">The state of the whole app lives inside the store.</span> <span data-start="560.81" data-end="565.84">To start playing with Redux we should create a store for wrapping up the state.</span> <span data-start="565.84" data-end="568.84">Shall we all together?</span> <span data-start="568.84" data-end="569.84">OK.</span> <span data-start="569.84" data-end="574.6">To get started, we will create a folder and call it Redux.</span> <span data-start="574.6" data-end="579.27">Within Redux we will then create a folder for the store.</span> <span data-start="579.27" data-end="583.37">Within the store, we will create a file and call it index.js.</span> <span data-start="583.37" data-end="590.34">Copy some code and put in there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="590.34" data-end="595.96">The create store function I have here is the function for creating the Redux store.</span> <span data-start="595.96" data-end="602.17">You may pass initial state to create store you don't have to most of the time although</span> <span data-start="602.17" data-end="608.38">it can be useful for service side rendering, traditionally the state comes from the reducers</span> <span data-start="608.38" data-end="613.851">which is what I will do here as it takes the reducer as the first argument, root reducer</span> <span data-start="613.851" data-end="615.99">in our case.</span> <span data-start="615.99" data-end="616.99">Wait.</span> <span data-start="616.99" data-end="620.39">I haven't explained what reducers do yet.</span> <span data-start="620.39" data-end="626.95">I said before that state comes from the reducer what matters now is understanding what reducers</span> <span data-start="626.95" data-end="628.82">do.</span> <span data-start="628.82" data-end="631.79">Let's go back to our diagram.</span> <span data-start="631.79" data-end="637.91">In Redux, the reducers produce the state and the state is not something you create by hand.</span> <span data-start="637.91" data-end="641.47">Reducers specify how the application state changes.</span> <span data-start="641.47" data-end="646">One of the principles of Redux is that the state is immutable and cannot change in place.</span> <span data-start="646" data-end="651.32">In play and React the local state changes in place with function setstate.</span> <span data-start="651.32" data-end="654.76">In Redux, you can't do that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="654.76" data-end="657.49">A reducer is just a JavaScript function.</span> <span data-start="657.49" data-end="663.27">It takes two parameters, the current state and an action, which is why the reducer must</span> <span data-start="663.27" data-end="668.49">be pure meaning that it returns the exact same output for the given input.</span> <span data-start="668.49" data-end="671.46">Creating a reducer is actually pretty simple.</span> <span data-start="671.46" data-end="674">So let's do that all together.</span> <span data-start="674" data-end="680.34">I will pick up where I left off and create another folder and call it reducers.</span> <span data-start="680.34" data-end="684.11">Within reducers a file index.js.</span> <span data-start="684.11" data-end="692.38">Pop in this code.</span> <span data-start="692.38" data-end="694.44">Great.</span> <span data-start="694.44" data-end="697.52">The reducer here is sort of a silly one.</span> <span data-start="697.52" data-end="700.18">Oh, I am not on the slide.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="700.18" data-end="704.13">This reducer here is sort of a silly one in that it returns the initial state without</span> <span data-start="704.13" data-end="709.41">doing anything else but definitely notice how the initial state is passed as the default</span> <span data-start="709.41" data-end="710.41">parameter.</span> <span data-start="710.41" data-end="711.41">OK.</span> <span data-start="711.41" data-end="712.61">We have seen that?</span> <span data-start="712.61" data-end="713.61">Good.</span> <span data-start="713.61" data-end="717.14">Now, reducers are without a doubt the most important concept in Redux.</span> <span data-start="717.14" data-end="718.85">Let me say it again.</span> <span data-start="718.85" data-end="724.3">Reducers produce the state of the application but this should then beg the question how</span> <span data-start="724.3" data-end="728.41">does a reducer know when to produce the next state?</span> <span data-start="728.41" data-end="731.24">Well, that is where actions come in.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="731.24" data-end="736.4">One of the principles of Redux is that the only way you can change the state is by sending</span> <span data-start="736.4" data-end="746.43">a signal to the store, the signal is an action and how do you change immutable state?</span> <span data-start="746.43" data-end="747.73">You don't.</span> <span data-start="747.73" data-end="751.24">Resulting state is a copy of the current state plus the new data.</span> <span data-start="751.24" data-end="757.71">You may be thinking whoa, Lauren, that is a lot of data to know, but the reassuring</span> <span data-start="757.71" data-end="763.04">thing is that Redux actions are nothing more than just JavaScript objects.</span> <span data-start="763.04" data-end="766">This is an example of what one might even look like.</span> <span data-start="766" data-end="767">OK.</span> <span data-start="767" data-end="768">You know the drill.</span> <span data-start="768" data-end="769.46">Let's create a simple action all together.</span> <span data-start="769.46" data-end="773.62">Again, we will create a folder.</span> <span data-start="773.62" data-end="776.37">Actions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="776.37" data-end="788.27">File index.js and prop  —  plop in it add show here.</span> <span data-start="788.27" data-end="792.5">Today I think it will be fun to add the functionality of adding a show.</span> <span data-start="792.5" data-end="797.12">Every action requires a type property for describing how the state should change and</span> <span data-start="797.12" data-end="800.42">it is really just a string.</span> <span data-start="800.42" data-end="805.041">The reducer uses that string to determine how to calculate the next state and you can</span> <span data-start="805.041" data-end="809.29">specify a payload, just as I did, if you would like.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="809.29" data-end="813.03">In my example, the payload is a new show.</span> <span data-start="813.03" data-end="814.03">OK.</span> <span data-start="814.03" data-end="815.03">Back to the diagram.</span> <span data-start="815.03" data-end="820.06">Since types are just strings and strings are as we know prone to typos and duplicates it</span> <span data-start="820.06" data-end="823.61">is better to have action types declared as constants.</span> <span data-start="823.61" data-end="831.08">It is best practice to wrap every action within a function which helps to avoid errors.</span> <span data-start="831.08" data-end="837.6">Let's also do that quickly and create a simple action creator all together.</span> <span data-start="837.6" data-end="854.16">Again, constants within constants, a file, and quite simple there.</span> <span data-start="854.16" data-end="861">Next up, I want to open up my actions folder and I am going to now use what we just created.</span> <span data-start="861" data-end="867.86">I will remove the quotes and of course I will have to import it from a local directory.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="867.86" data-end="874.9">From, I think, I called it constants/action-types.</span> <span data-start="874.9" data-end="876.16">Great.</span> <span data-start="876.16" data-end="881">Now we are using that.</span> <span data-start="881" data-end="884.93">You all still with me?</span> <span data-start="884.93" data-end="885.93">No?</span> <span data-start="885.93" data-end="886.93">OK.</span> <span data-start="886.93" data-end="892.98">If not, I think it would be important to take the time before we go any further to just</span> <span data-start="892.98" data-end="897.5">quickly recap the main Redux concepts we just implemented.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="897.5" data-end="901.6">The Redux store is in charge of orchestrating all of the moving parts.</span> <span data-start="901.6" data-end="906.65">All of the state lives in a single immutable object and as soon as the store receives an</span> <span data-start="906.65" data-end="912.24">action it triggers as a reducer and the reducer then returns to next state.</span> <span data-start="912.24" data-end="918.49">The order sort of goes like this, an action first occurs within a component, say someone</span> <span data-start="918.49" data-end="924.04">trying to add a show, or maybe filter the view, see the details or delete a component</span> <span data-start="924.04" data-end="930.42">even, then that calls the action into action type which grabs the particular reducer that</span> <span data-start="930.42" data-end="935.37">will update and modify the state, and once that state is changed, the view is rerendered</span> <span data-start="935.37" data-end="939.01">and that is how Redux works.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="939.01" data-end="940.3">Congrats.</span> <span data-start="940.3" data-end="945.97">You now know everything there is to know about how to add Redux to a React app.</span> <span data-start="945.97" data-end="953.14">You should feel ready to scale it to an app on your own except.. you may have noticed</span> <span data-start="953.14" data-end="960.75">that while we were setting up our basic, very simple beginning other Redux app, we had to</span> <span data-start="960.75" data-end="964.38">create a bunch of folders and files.</span> <span data-start="964.38" data-end="965.72">OK.</span> <span data-start="965.72" data-end="966.72">Imagine this.</span> <span data-start="966.72" data-end="971.74">You decide to add all of the functionality a traditional app has beyond just adding a</span> <span data-start="971.74" data-end="976.52">show maybe you want to filter and edit and delete it.</span> <span data-start="976.52" data-end="977.98">Whatever it is.</span> <span data-start="977.98" data-end="982.81">If we continue down this path, it would be easy to imagine how things could be messy</span> <span data-start="982.81" data-end="988.94">or complicated or confusing quickly because you will then have to edit the constants in</span> <span data-start="988.94" data-end="995.53">one file, the reducers in another, the action creators in another, and yet again go back</span> <span data-start="995.53" data-end="1002.52">and edit the actions so you are pretty much playing tennis, emotionally, physically, everything,</span> <span data-start="1002.52" data-end="1010.76">match over here because just to add one single, small piece of feature functionality equates</span> <span data-start="1010.76" data-end="1014.48">to editing and adding several different files.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1014.48" data-end="1017.57">This kind of just gives me a headache.</span> <span data-start="1017.57" data-end="1025.039">This is a way of organizing your Redux by type and that is essentially the most common</span> <span data-start="1025.039" data-end="1031.589">but you end up jumping back and forth for files related to a single piece of functionality</span> <span data-start="1031.589" data-end="1037.699">because the constants action creators are imported to the reducer file and the action</span> <span data-start="1037.699" data-end="1043.1">creator are imported into the container to be dispatched and all that becomes a little</span> <span data-start="1043.1" data-end="1045.529">annoying, wouldn't you agree?</span> <span data-start="1045.529" data-end="1052.61">What I found to be really wild was that there is actually no prescribed one way of organizing</span> <span data-start="1052.61" data-end="1054.27">our Redux files.</span> <span data-start="1054.27" data-end="1060.559">This by-type method, yes, is super common, and it is taught in a ton of tutorials but</span> <span data-start="1060.559" data-end="1062.7">it is obviously sort of flawed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1062.7" data-end="1068.47">My theory is oftentimes when you are first learning about Redux and the roles of actions</span> <span data-start="1068.47" data-end="1072.83">and reducers you start off with a really simple example.</span> <span data-start="1072.83" data-end="1077.09">Most tutorials don't take you to the next level but if you are building something with</span> <span data-start="1077.09" data-end="1082.8">React and Redux that is more complicated than a to-do list you realize quickly you may need</span> <span data-start="1082.8" data-end="1086.399">a smarter way of scaling your codebase over time.</span> <span data-start="1086.399" data-end="1090.49">These actions, constants and reducer are all related but exist in the fractured state and</span> <span data-start="1090.49" data-end="1096.44">switching back and forth from file to file only takes a few seconds.</span> <span data-start="1096.44" data-end="1102.35">I am going to give you that but it can make my head fuzzy and simply put I find it hard</span> <span data-start="1102.35" data-end="1103.35">to maintain.</span> <span data-start="1103.35" data-end="1110.309">Thus, yet again, all my English teacher organizational habits came rushing back to me and I knew</span> <span data-start="1110.309" data-end="1115.559">there had to be a way to be strategic and thoughtful with the organization of my codebases</span> <span data-start="1115.559" data-end="1116.72">architecture.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1116.72" data-end="1120.919">I dug into the research on Medium articles knowing there must be something out there</span> <span data-start="1120.919" data-end="1124.54">that would offer peace of mind and I was right.</span> <span data-start="1124.54" data-end="1128.75">There are a lot of ideas out there about it.</span> <span data-start="1128.75" data-end="1133.679">Some people suggested online a solution to the frustration might be to organize your</span> <span data-start="1133.679" data-end="1145.529">code by feature as encapsulating the component and store into a single folder following the</span> <span data-start="1145.529" data-end="1147.62">React component concept.</span> <span data-start="1147.62" data-end="1153.32">This means you would have to tie a slice of the Redux store to a container and that is</span> <span data-start="1153.32" data-end="1159.759">counterintuitive to the core of what Redux promotes.</span> <span data-start="1159.759" data-end="1165.159">Bangladesh to the drawing board I went and further research led me to discover the moment</span> <span data-start="1165.159" data-end="1171.97">you have been waiting for based on the title of this talk ducks to the rescue.</span> <span data-start="1171.97" data-end="1176.289">What are ducks?</span> <span data-start="1176.289" data-end="1188.96">Erik Rasmussen kept needing to add tuples and such for each use case and was keeping</span> <span data-start="1188.96" data-end="1195.269">them in separate files and folders, however, 95% of the time, it is only one reducer and</span> <span data-start="1195.269" data-end="1201.27">action pair that ever needs their associated action thus it makes more sense for all the</span> <span data-start="1201.27" data-end="1208.34">pieces to be bundled into isolated modules that can self-contained and packaged easily</span> <span data-start="1208.34" data-end="1209.59">into a library.</span> </p>
