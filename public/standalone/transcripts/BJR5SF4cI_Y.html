<p><span data-start="9.14" data-end="11.22">It's great to be here.</span> <span data-start="11.22" data-end="14.03">Thanks very much for coming along.</span> <span data-start="14.03" data-end="19.97">Today I'm going to be talking about visualizing enterprise data with D3.</span> <span data-start="19.97" data-end="27.029">It says enterprise in the title, but really, it's about adding visualizations to any significant</span> <span data-start="27.029" data-end="28.75">dataset.</span> <span data-start="28.75" data-end="32.029">More than a hundred rows, a hundred records in your datasets?</span> <span data-start="32.029" data-end="35.89">You may want to consider adding visualizations.</span> <span data-start="35.89" data-end="38.8">I'm using D3, awesome library.</span> <span data-start="38.8" data-end="42.399">The talk is broken up into two rough halves.</span> <span data-start="42.399" data-end="49.18">The first is demonstrating and why visualizations are break, why to add them to applications</span> <span data-start="49.18" data-end="50.28">if you can.</span> <span data-start="50.28" data-end="52.05">Why they add value.</span> <span data-start="52.05" data-end="56.5">And the second half is how you can ramp up with D3.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="56.5" data-end="58.26">D3 is a powerful library.</span> <span data-start="58.26" data-end="63.39">It has a huge amount of power and potential.</span> <span data-start="63.39" data-end="68.549">Check out the gallery after the talk, it's about every graph and visualization for any</span> <span data-start="68.549" data-end="69.96">use case.</span> <span data-start="69.96" data-end="74.32">The problem with D3 can be it has a fairly steep learning curve.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="74.32" data-end="80.06">So, the second half of the talk is just to give you an introduction into the main entry</span> <span data-start="80.06" data-end="82.89">points how to get going with D3.</span> <span data-start="82.89" data-end="86.369">There's two rough halves.</span> <span data-start="86.369" data-end="93.759">So, increasingly as developers, depending on which area and what we work on are facing</span> <span data-start="93.759" data-end="95.55">larger and larger datasets.</span> <span data-start="95.55" data-end="104.119">They're going to grow in financial, medical, social media, the data we're getting is ever</span> <span data-start="104.119" data-end="105.77">increasing.</span> <span data-start="105.77" data-end="108.04">And that's hugely valuable.</span> <span data-start="108.04" data-end="110.15">We can do so much with this information.</span> <span data-start="110.15" data-end="112.06">Specifically, things like medical data.</span> <span data-start="112.06" data-end="116.27">What insights and breakthroughs are we going to make with the huge amounts of data that</span> <span data-start="116.27" data-end="118.31">we are able to gather?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="118.31" data-end="125">The problem is that large data is hard if not impossible to understand.</span> <span data-start="125" data-end="131.37">If you're looking at a hundred rows of data, for example, it can be hard to digest.</span> <span data-start="131.37" data-end="136.23">If you're looking at a million rows, well, it's almost impossible.</span> <span data-start="136.23" data-end="137.23">Data is king.</span> <span data-start="137.23" data-end="139.12">It's absolutely king.</span> <span data-start="139.12" data-end="143.22">And we need to look at the underlying data often.</span> <span data-start="143.22" data-end="148.89">So, most of my background is from a financial background where it's not only important for</span> <span data-start="148.89" data-end="153.97">the user to confirm that the decision they're about to make for a trade, for a loan, for</span> <span data-start="153.97" data-end="157.08">a mortgage, is based on actual accurate data.</span> <span data-start="157.08" data-end="159.54">So, they need to look at that data.</span> <span data-start="159.54" data-end="163">And there's often a regulatory requirement, depending on your industry, to display that</span> <span data-start="163" data-end="164.53">data as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="164.53" data-end="166.75">So, that's great and it's important.</span> <span data-start="166.75" data-end="168.45">That's not going to change.</span> <span data-start="168.45" data-end="174.12">But I think we can add a lot more value to our users and allow them to get insights that</span> <span data-start="174.12" data-end="178.49">would be much harder otherwise with visualizations.</span> <span data-start="178.49" data-end="181.49">Humans are very visual animals.</span> <span data-start="181.49" data-end="188.73">We've evolved over, you know, thousands, hundreds of years, thousands of years, to gain insights</span> <span data-start="188.73" data-end="190.56">quickly often rapidly.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="190.56" data-end="193.93">And my favorite example of that are road signs.</span> <span data-start="193.93" data-end="200.5">We're able to gain, at a glance, often while moving at speed, useful and critical information</span> <span data-start="200.5" data-end="201.91">in just one picture.</span> <span data-start="201.91" data-end="207.58">So, I think we can probably take that concept and translate it and copy it over to whatever</span> <span data-start="207.58" data-end="209.28">application or sphere we're working in.</span> <span data-start="209.28" data-end="213.27">So, that's the aim of this talk, the first half, anyway, to convince you and even courage</span> <span data-start="213.27" data-end="214.9">you to add visualizations.</span> <span data-start="214.9" data-end="220.87">And if you can and if it makes sense for your domain and if you're not doing so already.</span> <span data-start="220.87" data-end="227.7">The data set we're going to look at as an example is Olympic information.</span> <span data-start="227.7" data-end="232.63">It's Olympic datasets of all medals won of all athletes from 2000 2012.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="232.63" data-end="234.77">It's a simple dataset.</span> <span data-start="234.77" data-end="238.83">I didn't want to get something we would struggle to understand before we could understand what</span> <span data-start="238.83" data-end="239.9">I was trying to illustrate.</span> <span data-start="239.9" data-end="241.08">This is fairly simple.</span> <span data-start="241.08" data-end="246.39">Per row, who won, how would they were, what they won and what medals they won.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="246.39" data-end="251.72">And see if we can derive any insights from this dataset.</span> <span data-start="251.72" data-end="253.57">So, we'll switch over.</span> <span data-start="253.57" data-end="257.1">I'm using you can hopefully see that?</span> <span data-start="257.1" data-end="258.1">Yep.</span> <span data-start="258.1" data-end="261.94">So, we can already see it's already ordered by total medals won.</span> <span data-start="261.94" data-end="269.29">We can see that Michael Phelps has won a significant number of medals just in those three years.</span> <span data-start="269.29" data-end="270.29">That's fine.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="270.29" data-end="273.46">We can see that Michael Phelps looks like he's on top.</span> <span data-start="273.46" data-end="278.62">But let's assume, let's pretend there's other athletes who have won not many in one year,</span> <span data-start="278.62" data-end="282.31">but many medals over many years.</span> <span data-start="282.31" data-end="284.68">It wouldn't necessarily be easy to get that information.</span> <span data-start="284.68" data-end="289.41">You would think that Michael Phelps was at the top.</span> <span data-start="289.41" data-end="294">Let's see if we can get some more information from that.</span> <span data-start="294" data-end="296.9">So, let's group this by athlete.</span> <span data-start="296.9" data-end="300.76">So, now Michael Phelps, looks like he's on top.</span> <span data-start="300.76" data-end="306.41">And aggregate by total medals won.</span> <span data-start="306.41" data-end="315.54">We can confirm that total medals won, Michael Phelps is far and away with 22 medals.</span> <span data-start="315.54" data-end="321.66">We can expand that and go further.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="321.66" data-end="323.18">That's useful, right?</span> <span data-start="323.18" data-end="325.29">But it's already required a few clicks and drags.</span> <span data-start="325.29" data-end="329.04">We could get this set up front.</span> <span data-start="329.04" data-end="333.04">But still it can be difficult.</span> <span data-start="333.04" data-end="334.16">Let's group by country.</span> <span data-start="334.16" data-end="337.34">Let's see who has won the most medals.</span> <span data-start="337.34" data-end="345.3">And so, from this we can what's with my so, the U.S., the United States is ahead by</span> <span data-start="345.3" data-end="346.93">some way.</span> <span data-start="346.93" data-end="350.76">Russia second, Germany, Australia, China and then it tails off.</span> <span data-start="350.76" data-end="352.37">So, that's useful, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="352.37" data-end="353.95">I guess we could have guessed that.</span> <span data-start="353.95" data-end="359.59">But it's clear already from this that the United States is ahead.</span> <span data-start="359.59" data-end="361.07">But that doesn't tell us how they're ahead.</span> <span data-start="361.07" data-end="363.99">It doesn't tell us which sports they're ahead in.</span> <span data-start="363.99" data-end="366.67">Did they win more bronzes than gold than anyone else?</span> <span data-start="366.67" data-end="368.58">What's the proportion?</span> <span data-start="368.58" data-end="370.84">We can get that information from here.</span> <span data-start="370.84" data-end="376.23">We can always derive the insights we can gain from visualizations from the raw data.</span> <span data-start="376.23" data-end="381.389">But it's much easier and much less resource intensive, mentally resource intensive if</span> <span data-start="381.389" data-end="383.61">we can divide that information at a glance.</span> <span data-start="383.61" data-end="389.03">So, let's take a look at how to do that.</span> <span data-start="389.03" data-end="393.49">So, the visualizations, when I say that, what do I mean?</span> <span data-start="393.49" data-end="399.6">Visualization is a process of translating raw information into graphical visualization.</span> <span data-start="399.6" data-end="403.95">What I mean is that you are taking data and making visualization format.</span> <span data-start="403.95" data-end="410.18">How it helps, in my opinion, for users data.</span> <span data-start="410.18" data-end="419.139">And visualizations as [audio breaking up] help user insights.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="419.139" data-end="425.88">So, the application that I've put together for this is going to have two halves.</span> <span data-start="425.88" data-end="431.18">On the left side it's going to have a component with the raw data and confirm what we've seen.</span> <span data-start="431.18" data-end="436.62">And on the right side, some visualization that goes along with the selected data and</span> <span data-start="436.62" data-end="443.69">what we're doing it to see if we can get a better idea of what we're looking at.</span> <span data-start="443.69" data-end="444.97">The application's pretty simple.</span> <span data-start="444.97" data-end="446.62">I won't spend too much time on this.</span> <span data-start="446.62" data-end="448.28">But we have a good component.</span> <span data-start="448.28" data-end="453.02">That's responsible for managing the grid, the configuration, what we do when we click</span> <span data-start="453.02" data-end="454.02">on resource.</span> <span data-start="454.02" data-end="458.84">We have a chart data service that will interact with the chart service on the right.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="458.84" data-end="462.551">And the grid component is also responsible for switching out the chart component, depending</span> <span data-start="462.551" data-end="464.53">on what the user is asking it to do.</span> <span data-start="464.53" data-end="469.41">It's simple and the code will be available after the talk.</span> <span data-start="469.41" data-end="470.41">But that's not the focus of the talk.</span> <span data-start="470.41" data-end="475.65">So, we'll go on to the actual application.</span> <span data-start="475.65" data-end="483.58">So, I've pre wrapped, pre wrapped three types of visualizations we can do with this data.</span> <span data-start="483.58" data-end="489.47">So, we already think and know that the U.S., Russia, Australia, China are ahead in terms</span> <span data-start="489.47" data-end="491.1">of medals won.</span> <span data-start="491.1" data-end="494">Let's see if we can dig down into that.</span> <span data-start="494" data-end="495.36">Dig a little deeper.</span> <span data-start="495.36" data-end="500.669">So, let's group, select the top ten countries by total medals won.</span> <span data-start="500.669" data-end="504.01">Not looking at the types of medals, gold, silver and bronze.</span> <span data-start="504.01" data-end="505.78">But the total counts.</span> <span data-start="505.78" data-end="507.73">And take that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="507.73" data-end="509.699">Hopefully you can see that.</span> <span data-start="509.699" data-end="513.17">So, if you can't see the label at the bottom.</span> <span data-start="513.17" data-end="519.06">On the left, United States, Germany, Australia, China, Russia, trailing off.</span> <span data-start="519.06" data-end="521.9">That confirm what is we have seen earlier.</span> <span data-start="521.9" data-end="527.06">But what I like about this starting point is visually we don't have to use too much</span> <span data-start="527.06" data-end="532.55">energy to work out that the United States is by far and away the winner here in terms</span> <span data-start="532.55" data-end="535.42">of total medals won.</span> <span data-start="535.42" data-end="538.84">Almost just under double Russia.</span> <span data-start="538.84" data-end="541.4">Looks like maybe just double Germany and Australia.</span> <span data-start="541.4" data-end="543.36">So, it's the same information we got before.</span> <span data-start="543.36" data-end="548.36">But we're able to divide that information within maybe two seconds, maybe three, maybe</span> <span data-start="548.36" data-end="549.36">more.</span> <span data-start="549.36" data-end="553.97">But ultimately, we will be able to derive a huge amount of information, which we were</span> <span data-start="553.97" data-end="558.1">able to derive before, but a lot less scanning horizontally and vertically.</span> <span data-start="558.1" data-end="563.35">We can glance at the picture, look at the label, and United States is by far, in terms</span> <span data-start="563.35" data-end="567.67">of total medals won the number one winner.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="567.67" data-end="573.37">Let's see if we can derive more information from the dataset we're looking at.</span> <span data-start="573.37" data-end="579.36">So, we're doing the same thing, but now we're breaking it down by the medal types.</span> <span data-start="579.36" data-end="586.01">And I think this is my favorite one is that it puts a distance between the United States</span> <span data-start="586.01" data-end="591.62">and the rest that isn't necessarily obvious from the raw data and grouping aggregation</span> <span data-start="591.62" data-end="593.57">or even the first visualization.</span> <span data-start="593.57" data-end="598.44">So, looking at this, you can see that the bronze is about on par with Russia.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="598.44" data-end="602.12">Silvers are about double Russia and the other countries.</span> <span data-start="602.12" data-end="605.149">But gold is almost triple everyone else.</span> <span data-start="605.149" data-end="611.32">So, not only with the United States ahead in overall, they are ahead by some way in</span> <span data-start="611.32" data-end="612.35">gold.</span> <span data-start="612.35" data-end="613.35">And silver.</span> <span data-start="613.35" data-end="615.76">And about on par with bronze.</span> <span data-start="615.76" data-end="620.69">That's a huge amount of information that we were able to derive in almost no time and</span> <span data-start="620.69" data-end="621.899">with almost no effort.</span> <span data-start="621.899" data-end="624.76">As developers, we had to put a bit of effort to do this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="624.76" data-end="629.149">But your user, by clicking on a button and selecting the information they're after is</span> <span data-start="629.149" data-end="635.35">able to derive a huge amount of information just by having the visualization to go alongside</span> <span data-start="635.35" data-end="636.48">the data.</span> <span data-start="636.48" data-end="641.33">Now, imagine translating this to aricher dataset.</span> <span data-start="641.33" data-end="643.98">Maybe looking at social media, and trends.</span> <span data-start="643.98" data-end="645.06">Complicated trends.</span> <span data-start="645.06" data-end="646.43">Not easy trends.</span> <span data-start="646.43" data-end="653.1">Medical, where hot spots are for diseases and why they are occurring.</span> <span data-start="653.1" data-end="655.99">Visualizations would help.</span> <span data-start="655.99" data-end="662.64">The last visualization, the colors are terrible.</span> <span data-start="662.64" data-end="664.7">Top ten for athletics.</span> <span data-start="664.7" data-end="675.02">The United States is first, but in terms of Jamaica and Ethiopia are in the top ten by</span> <span data-start="675.02" data-end="676.19">a significant margin.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="676.19" data-end="681.22">And given their population count relative to the United States and Russia, we can see</span> <span data-start="681.22" data-end="684.339">they are punching far above their weight in terms of population.</span> <span data-start="684.339" data-end="692.46">While not as impactful as the second, it's telling us that U.S. and Russia are ahead,</span> <span data-start="692.46" data-end="697.84">but in terms of population, much smaller countries are doing really well in athletics.</span> <span data-start="697.84" data-end="700.38">That's just with one little chart.</span> <span data-start="700.38" data-end="706.3">That's great and hopefully illustrates the point I'm trying to make.</span> <span data-start="706.3" data-end="708.62">So, that's the first half.</span> <span data-start="708.62" data-end="713.46">I encourage you to check out D3, the visualizations, what the options are.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="713.46" data-end="717.45">The second part of the talk is just to dig into D3 a little bit.</span> <span data-start="717.45" data-end="720.48">When I started D3, a little bit overwhelmed.</span> <span data-start="720.48" data-end="725.73">The documentation is there but it's definitely not geared towards beginners.</span> <span data-start="725.73" data-end="734.02">The rest of the talk is the basics of D3 and how you can get started with it and the concepts.</span> <span data-start="734.02" data-end="737.49">So, we'll start off with selection.</span> <span data-start="737.49" data-end="742.35">Like JQuery, it allows for selection of DOM elements.</span> <span data-start="742.35" data-end="748.88">At the top, I'll set up the startup point, I'm demo in a minute.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="748.88" data-end="753.22">We have the number of circles within and the D3 code is at the bottom.</span> <span data-start="753.22" data-end="754.6">We have some data.</span> <span data-start="754.6" data-end="757.81">We have five data items there.</span> <span data-start="757.81" data-end="763.01">And we're going to use D3 to select all circles and associate data with it.</span> <span data-start="763.01" data-end="764.01">Okay?</span> <span data-start="764.01" data-end="769.07">So, if we go look at that, we'll see that D3 is actually doing something with us.</span> <span data-start="769.07" data-end="771.48">That's how the code looks as it is.</span> <span data-start="771.48" data-end="774.68">And we've run the code and D3, hopefully you can read that.</span> <span data-start="774.68" data-end="778.08">I'll pull it up for those at the back.</span> <span data-start="778.08" data-end="780.95">The HTML is rendered, D3 hasn't changed what we are seeing.</span> <span data-start="780.95" data-end="783.83">But it has done something in the background.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="783.83" data-end="786.04">Let's look at the first item.</span> <span data-start="786.04" data-end="788.01">The first circle on the left.</span> <span data-start="788.01" data-end="789.01">If we selected.</span> <span data-start="789.01" data-end="791.63">I have given an ID, so we selected.</span> <span data-start="791.63" data-end="793.87">and we can go right down to the bottom.</span> <span data-start="793.87" data-end="798.02">Hopefully you can see that, maybe you have not.</span> <span data-start="798.02" data-end="805.07">Added data__ and given it a value of 2.</span> <span data-start="805.07" data-end="808.79">And the second one, 4 and 6.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="808.79" data-end="814.49">And it's found all existing DOM items and asked to select and associated the data we've</span> <span data-start="814.49" data-end="817.399">asked it to associate with it.</span> <span data-start="817.399" data-end="821.05">We can expand on that just to confirm what I'm saying.</span> <span data-start="821.05" data-end="827.2">So, we've iterated all the circles and I'll put the data item and you can hopefully see</span> <span data-start="827.2" data-end="829.69">it says 2, 4, 6, 8.</span> <span data-start="829.69" data-end="834.2">Each of the circles has the data we have given it associated with it.</span> <span data-start="834.2" data-end="839.399">And that's important because subsequent steps to manipulate the DOM items will use the data</span> <span data-start="839.399" data-end="841.04">associated with it.</span> <span data-start="841.04" data-end="845.6">You may have noticed that we have five data items, but only four circles.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="845.6" data-end="848.25">We'll come back to that in a minute.</span> <span data-start="848.25" data-end="851.66">So, let's put that away.</span> <span data-start="851.66" data-end="858.78">So, the second step here is to beg your pardon.</span> <span data-start="858.78" data-end="860.05">There.</span> <span data-start="860.05" data-end="862.14">So, we've selected it.</span> <span data-start="862.14" data-end="868.08">The second step will be to start manipulating the existing items.</span> <span data-start="868.08" data-end="871.9">So, I'll show you the code in a minute.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="871.9" data-end="872.96">That was quite quick.</span> <span data-start="872.96" data-end="874.02">It's on the slide.</span> <span data-start="874.02" data-end="879.05">We'll use the items we associated with the DOM items and scaled it.</span> <span data-start="879.05" data-end="881.96">So, for example, 2, we've times it by a value.</span> <span data-start="881.96" data-end="886.32">4, we've timed it by a value and the circles have scaled in size.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="886.32" data-end="891.37">So, this is, I guess, D3101, select DOM items.</span> <span data-start="891.37" data-end="893.279">Manipulate the DOM items with the data.</span> <span data-start="893.279" data-end="897.92">So, let's look at what we did there.</span> <span data-start="897.92" data-end="901.901">So, the second step we've selected we did before.</span> <span data-start="901.901" data-end="902.901">We've selected the circles.</span> <span data-start="902.901" data-end="904.769">We associated data with it.</span> <span data-start="904.769" data-end="907.7">And then we've changed the style of the DOM items.</span> <span data-start="907.7" data-end="913.75">So, for each item, so, D3, like JQuery, allows chaining of items.</span> <span data-start="913.75" data-end="919.81">And D3 starts at the top left and draws down and to the right.</span> <span data-start="919.81" data-end="924.45">So, we will change the height according to the data item and the width according to the</span> <span data-start="924.45" data-end="926.149">data item, so the circles get bigger.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="926.149" data-end="929.11">Depending on the size of the data.</span> <span data-start="929.11" data-end="935.23">And at the bottom, we've manipulated the margin so that as humans we expect the graph and</span> <span data-start="935.23" data-end="937.16">visualizations to go from bottom up.</span> <span data-start="937.16" data-end="941.71">We just push the margin top down and allow for the data.</span> <span data-start="941.71" data-end="944.32">If we started at the bottom and scrolled up, we wouldn't have to do that.</span> <span data-start="944.32" data-end="948.23">But like D3, like most graphing libraries, start at the top and go down.</span> <span data-start="948.23" data-end="950.519">We manipulate the library.</span> <span data-start="950.519" data-end="956.74">I have broken them out into four points to illustrate what each item is doing.</span> <span data-start="956.74" data-end="961.72">For each data item, we are manipulating one attribute of the style.</span> <span data-start="961.72" data-end="969.149">So, moving on so, that's selection and manipulating items.</span> <span data-start="969.149" data-end="973.18">That's great for when you want to manipulate existing DOM items.</span> <span data-start="973.18" data-end="977.92">As I said before, we have five data items, but only four existing images.</span> <span data-start="977.92" data-end="981.93">This brings us to the second concept, or D3 concept that I wanted to introduce.</span> <span data-start="981.93" data-end="983.899">That's the enter selection.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="983.899" data-end="987.18">On the left, existing items, that's selection.</span> <span data-start="987.18" data-end="991.76">On the right we then add new items using the enter method.</span> <span data-start="991.76" data-end="995.38">So, you'll see I have four existing items.</span> <span data-start="995.38" data-end="1002.589">The fifth one, 10, will be added by as you add enter and then manipulating the DOM item.</span> <span data-start="1002.589" data-end="1007.68">So, the top half of this code is the code we've already seen.</span> <span data-start="1007.68" data-end="1011.011">And the bottom half, we could change this, I have broken it up into separate items to</span> <span data-start="1011.011" data-end="1012.011">make it clear.</span> <span data-start="1012.011" data-end="1013.68">We use enter.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1013.68" data-end="1016.709">Everything that's not already associated, do this with it.</span> <span data-start="1016.709" data-end="1023.17">So, for every item we're not associated we add a div and we put the attributes as we</span> <span data-start="1023.17" data-end="1024.17">did before.</span> <span data-start="1024.17" data-end="1030.039">So, this is going to add a fifth circle with a height with this was how before and add</span> <span data-start="1030.039" data-end="1031.369">it to our application.</span> <span data-start="1031.369" data-end="1034.819">So, let's take a look at that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1034.819" data-end="1036.089">As I said, you can chain these.</span> <span data-start="1036.089" data-end="1041.739">And you can make it in line, but for demonstration purposes I wanted to make it clearer.</span> <span data-start="1041.739" data-end="1044.879">So, four items with the fifth circle added.</span> <span data-start="1044.879" data-end="1047.97">So, selection for existing DOM items.</span> <span data-start="1047.97" data-end="1051.85">Enter for new DOM items.</span> <span data-start="1051.85" data-end="1052.85">It's pretty simple.</span> <span data-start="1052.85" data-end="1063.09">It's just not always clear from the D3 documentation and demos what these things are actually doing.</span> <span data-start="1063.09" data-end="1066.399">The last three items I want to touch on are scales.</span> <span data-start="1066.399" data-end="1070.59">And these are how you want to scale your data both horizontally and vertically depending</span> <span data-start="1070.59" data-end="1072.01">on your data.</span> <span data-start="1072.01" data-end="1077.039">So, for example, if you've got 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, but you actually want to fill up your</span> <span data-start="1077.039" data-end="1082.159">screen with a thousand pixels horizontally and 800 pixels, add scales.</span> <span data-start="1082.159" data-end="1086.44">If you want to use dates, that's where scales come in.</span> <span data-start="1086.44" data-end="1091.1">I'm going to there's many types of scales, but the three main you're likely to use I'll</span> <span data-start="1091.1" data-end="1092.1">cover.</span> <span data-start="1092.1" data-end="1094.989">The first is an ordinal scale.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1094.989" data-end="1102.059">It maps discrete values in an array to discrete values in the array.</span> <span data-start="1102.059" data-end="1111.139">We wanted to map to RGB, we use it here.</span> <span data-start="1111.139" data-end="1117.549">Set the domain, the data, and I want the output to be red, G for green, B for blue.</span> <span data-start="1117.549" data-end="1124.509">And when you call ordinal scale, when we manipulate the items, it will return.</span> <span data-start="1124.509" data-end="1126.389">Ordinal scale of R returns red.</span> <span data-start="1126.389" data-end="1132.46">A discrete value to a discrete value, it's pretty simple, I think.</span> <span data-start="1132.46" data-end="1135.47">The second one is band scales.</span> <span data-start="1135.47" data-end="1138.47">Which is similar to ordinal, but it's a continuous range.</span> <span data-start="1138.47" data-end="1142.95">Instead of a discrete value to a discrete value, we're going from a discrete value to</span> <span data-start="1142.95" data-end="1144.519">an item on a range.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1144.519" data-end="1147.799">So, as before, we've got RGB as our data.</span> <span data-start="1147.799" data-end="1150.86">But that's going to scale between 0 and 200.</span> <span data-start="1150.86" data-end="1160.139">So, R is zero, G is 6, about halfway, I guess, and B is 133.</span> <span data-start="1160.139" data-end="1161.139">And loop over.</span> <span data-start="1161.139" data-end="1163.52">So, if we do it again, it will go to zero.</span> <span data-start="1163.52" data-end="1168.429">So, that's more useful when you want a continuous scale.</span> <span data-start="1168.429" data-end="1170.299">And lastly, the linear scale.</span> <span data-start="1170.299" data-end="1172.63">This is the one you'll probably use most often.</span> <span data-start="1172.63" data-end="1178.409">You'll use it when you want a continuous domain, numbers, dates, for example.</span> <span data-start="1178.409" data-end="1180.559">And typically, this will be your Y axis.</span> <span data-start="1180.559" data-end="1185.23">So, you've got a set amount of data items, but you want to scale it horizontally.</span> <span data-start="1185.23" data-end="1188.04">You'll use a linear scale for that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1188.04" data-end="1190.44">Here we create a linear scale.</span> <span data-start="1190.44" data-end="1192.74">We set out the main, zero and 10.</span> <span data-start="1192.74" data-end="1194.58">That's our data items.</span> <span data-start="1194.58" data-end="1197.409">So, the start and the max of our data items.</span> <span data-start="1197.409" data-end="1200.549">The range will go from zero to a thousand.</span> <span data-start="1200.549" data-end="1203.989">And we want to scale that continuously on our range.</span> <span data-start="1203.989" data-end="1206.19">So, a zero is a zero.</span> <span data-start="1206.19" data-end="1208.799">2.5, as you'd expect, given the numbers, would be 250.</span> <span data-start="1208.799" data-end="1212.559">7 would be 700 and obviously 10 would be a thousand.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1212.559" data-end="1218.399">So, it's for mapping items items that are smaller or bigger than you want to render</span> <span data-start="1218.399" data-end="1221.029">on your screen and scaling them on to a screen.</span> <span data-start="1221.029" data-end="1224.32">I hope that makes sense.</span> <span data-start="1224.32" data-end="1226.859">Those are the three main scales.</span> <span data-start="1226.859" data-end="1230.97">I would like to have gone into this a bit further, but time constraints.</span> <span data-start="1230.97" data-end="1234.72">Hopefully that gives you an instruction into D3.</span> <span data-start="1234.72" data-end="1237.94">Hopefully that introduces you to the three scales you'll likely use.</span> <span data-start="1237.94" data-end="1242.409">And encourage you to check out D3.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1242.409" data-end="1246.539">It's got a huge amount of visualizations.</span> <span data-start="1246.539" data-end="1248.039">More than I can describe here.</span> <span data-start="1248.039" data-end="1250.549">And all that you're likely to encounter.</span> <span data-start="1250.549" data-end="1254.139">All use those I've described.</span> <span data-start="1254.139" data-end="1259.22">If you're not using visualizations, consider adding them.</span> <span data-start="1259.22" data-end="1260.309">Your users will thank you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1260.309" data-end="1264.46">They can get so much more information than they would otherwise just from the raw data.</span> <span data-start="1264.46" data-end="1265.999">Thank you very much.</span> </p>
