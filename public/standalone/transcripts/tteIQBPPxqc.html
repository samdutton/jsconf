<p><span data-start="9.57" data-end="12.44">I'm Sarah Groff Hennigh-Palermo.</span> <span data-start="12.44" data-end="19.121">On Twitter, I'm super SGP, so, if you like the opinions you hear today, there are way</span> <span data-start="19.121" data-end="21.96">more of them on the internet.</span> <span data-start="21.96" data-end="27.48">So, up until very recently, I was an engineer at Kickstarter.</span> <span data-start="27.48" data-end="32.4">I left about a month ago to have a career crisis and find myself, but that's what I</span> <span data-start="32.4" data-end="34.62">used to do.</span> <span data-start="34.62" data-end="37.85">When I'm not coding for money, I'm actually coding for art.</span> <span data-start="37.85" data-end="40.68">I do live code as well.</span> <span data-start="40.68" data-end="48.67">Those SVGs I make with clojure scripts, hand made artisanal SVGs in Brooklyn.</span> <span data-start="48.67" data-end="53.32">I'm here to talk about errors.</span> <span data-start="53.32" data-end="58.41">I have a lot to say, I realised by the way, when crying writing this talk, that it's four</span> <span data-start="58.41" data-end="59.41">talks.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="59.41" data-end="65.04">Rather than make it shorter, I decided that I was going to talk really fast, so, if some</span> <span data-start="65.04" data-end="69.42">of the slides go by fast, you don't read the code, don't worry, it's going to be on the</span> <span data-start="69.42" data-end="70.42">internet.</span> <span data-start="70.42" data-end="73.79">There's lots of links with, like, details so you can see it all later.</span> <span data-start="73.79" data-end="75.82">So, let's get started.</span> <span data-start="75.82" data-end="82.61">Lately, I've become super interested in the way that we approach errors, as programmers,</span> <span data-start="82.61" data-end="87.53">as a culture, and I wasn't going to start off telling you why I got interested because</span> <span data-start="87.53" data-end="95.37">I felt it was incendiary, but I decided to go ahead and tell you now and hope you keep</span> <span data-start="95.37" data-end="97.38">on listening if you think I'm insane.</span> <span data-start="97.38" data-end="102.579">I'm interested in errors because I really hate types.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="102.579" data-end="108.369">I know that that is not, like, a really popular opinion here in 2018, right?</span> <span data-start="108.369" data-end="114.579">This idea that I, as someone who only knows some programming thinks that I know way better</span> <span data-start="114.579" data-end="119.09">than all these computer sifts who have done research and told us that types are like THE</span> <span data-start="119.09" data-end="122.149">way to do it right.</span> <span data-start="122.149" data-end="126.19">But I know that type errors are real, and so I was like, "Well, if I wasn't going to</span> <span data-start="126.19" data-end="129.9">be into these, how would I have a better way to approach errors?"</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="129.9" data-end="132.09">I decided to do some research.</span> <span data-start="132.09" data-end="135.01">Luckily, errors are really interesting.</span> <span data-start="135.01" data-end="140.29">On the one hand, they're this cursed object that explodes rockets, overdoses people on</span> <span data-start="140.29" data-end="144.19">radiation, and makes webforms refuse to submit when you need them the most.</span> <span data-start="144.19" data-end="149.579">As such, they're a danger around which every right-thinking person is furiously erecting</span> <span data-start="149.579" data-end="151.22">fences, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="151.22" data-end="156.799">But, on the other hand, errors are kind of hilarious, so, consider the case of Nuclear</span> <span data-start="156.799" data-end="158.44">Ghandi.</span> <span data-start="158.44" data-end="163">In the very first Civilisation game, for some reason, towards the end of the game, Ghandi</span> <span data-start="163" data-end="167.47">would suddenly become incredibly aggressive and start threatening to nuke everyone which,</span> <span data-start="167.47" data-end="171.55">with , if you know Ghandi, it's kind of unlike him, right?</span> <span data-start="171.55" data-end="176.16">It turned out that aggressiveness was unrepresented with an unsigned byte when Ghandi was set</span> <span data-start="176.16" data-end="184.59">to 1 and took an action like democracy, it flipped around to to 255 and gave Ghandi Max</span> <span data-start="184.59" data-end="185.59">aggression.</span> <span data-start="185.59" data-end="190.86">Players like it so much that it is still used even though the mechanism has been discovered</span> <span data-start="190.86" data-end="192.31">and understood.</span> <span data-start="192.31" data-end="196.199">Errors can make us inventive.</span> <span data-start="196.199" data-end="202.8">In Win Commander, the game completed an out-of-memory error, and the programmers could not figure</span> <span data-start="202.8" data-end="204.799">out why it was showing this error.</span> <span data-start="204.799" data-end="206.69">Sometimes, you've got to shift.</span> <span data-start="206.69" data-end="211.79">So they changed the error message to a message of congratulations and went on with their</span> <span data-start="211.79" data-end="212.79">day.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="212.79" data-end="215.5">Errors can also be delightful.</span> <span data-start="215.5" data-end="220.66">So, when I was working on my life code framework doing some animations, I forgot that rotations</span> <span data-start="220.66" data-end="223.38">needed to be stable from frame to frame.</span> <span data-start="223.38" data-end="246.34">I accidentally made a circle friend, because animation — [sound breaking up].</span> <span data-start="246.34" data-end="261.32">Sometimes, we feel this way about CSS.</span> <span data-start="261.32" data-end="272.06">You know, we [sound breaking up].</span> <span data-start="272.06" data-end="274.71">Errors can be terrible and amazing.</span> <span data-start="274.71" data-end="279.5">Maybe if they're terrible, we should just cool it and not worry about what we are missing</span> <span data-start="279.5" data-end="281.4">out on.</span> <span data-start="281.4" data-end="288.71">Something I noticed is that examples of interesting errors come from things like games and art,</span> <span data-start="288.71" data-end="292.67">and bad errors come from things like health care, and rockets.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="292.67" data-end="297.76">But fortunately, as web programmers, we're much closer to the former, even though, as</span> <span data-start="297.76" data-end="302.46">a culture, we tend to act as though we are the latter, and we really think beyond how</span> <span data-start="302.46" data-end="303.62">to fix errors.</span> <span data-start="303.62" data-end="309.91">It is not really a big surprise, actually, so, culturally and philosophically, we are</span> <span data-start="309.91" data-end="315.58">trained to deny and avoid error in pretty much every aspect of our lives.</span> <span data-start="315.58" data-end="320.78">As in the book being Wrong — which, with , by the way, is a book, when people see you reading</span> <span data-start="320.78" data-end="327.479">it, they want to talk to you — this view is common and common with heavy-hitters in history</span> <span data-start="327.479" data-end="334.88">- Plato — and it comes from the idea that errors are a product of a gap between the</span> <span data-start="334.88" data-end="339.61">true world and our flawed human minds as we attempt to interpret it.</span> <span data-start="339.61" data-end="343.54">This is the view that effectives us a yearning for correctness.</span> <span data-start="343.54" data-end="351.23">However, there is also an optimistic view of erring, and in this modern view, originating</span> <span data-start="351.23" data-end="357.82">in the Enlightenment, the idea that this gap is a perception and can be faced and overcome</span> <span data-start="357.82" data-end="360">as we move towards truth.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="360" data-end="365.3">In fact, seeing the world perfectly as it is might not even be the right goal.</span> <span data-start="365.3" data-end="370.78">As Schulz writes, seeing the world as it's not is the definition of erring but also the</span> <span data-start="370.78" data-end="374.34">essence of invention, imagination, and hope.</span> <span data-start="374.34" data-end="379.33">This gap may also just be the downside to our massively great inductive reasoning upsides.</span> <span data-start="379.33" data-end="384.94">All the short cuts we take that make humans such good planters, inventors, like intuitive</span> <span data-start="384.94" data-end="390.28">little plants, right, means we may misperceive.</span> <span data-start="390.28" data-end="392.47">We can risk it up.</span> <span data-start="392.47" data-end="397.03">I'm going to talk a little bit more today about what we mean by errors, how we deal</span> <span data-start="397.03" data-end="402.39">in JavaScript now, situate that historically, and then go ahead and see what other options</span> <span data-start="402.39" data-end="405.319">might be available to us in the future.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="405.319" data-end="406.51">What do we mean by errors?</span> <span data-start="406.51" data-end="410.82">There are a lot of different schemes that people have come up to answer this question.</span> <span data-start="410.82" data-end="416.52">A lot of the times, they split along the lines of whether it's an avoidable programmer error,</span> <span data-start="416.52" data-end="421.96">or an unavoidable universe fairly — like we see here from the first edition of Eloquent</span> <span data-start="421.96" data-end="422.96">JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="422.96" data-end="425.45">I don't think that's the most helpful way to look at it.</span> <span data-start="425.45" data-end="429.87">If errors are inevitable to us as humans, then that's just as much a universe failure</span> <span data-start="429.87" data-end="431.4">as anything else.</span> <span data-start="431.4" data-end="437.28">The framework I like comes from Slips, Mistakes, and Failures by Tomas Petricek.</span> <span data-start="437.28" data-end="439.8">This is by the magnitude.</span> <span data-start="439.8" data-end="444.26">Slips are where your idea was right and you try to encode it the right way but you made</span> <span data-start="444.26" data-end="446.28">a sin tax error or typo.</span> <span data-start="446.28" data-end="451.36">I feel these as errors we don't ship because they break right away, the linter catches</span> <span data-start="451.36" data-end="452.95">them.</span> <span data-start="452.95" data-end="457.7">The other end of the generality spectrum, we have mistakes where you made a error thinking</span> <span data-start="457.7" data-end="459.99">through the specification.</span> <span data-start="459.99" data-end="460.99">That's really fuzzy.</span> <span data-start="460.99" data-end="463.36">You like — like what does the specification even mean?</span> <span data-start="463.36" data-end="466.98">I think of a mistake has building the wrong thing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="466.98" data-end="470.9">In the middle, we have failures where you have the right idea but encoded some part</span> <span data-start="470.9" data-end="471.9">of it poorly.</span> <span data-start="471.9" data-end="476.02">This is what we are most concerned with day to day.</span> <span data-start="476.02" data-end="477.95">How do we deal with these failure-type errors?</span> <span data-start="477.95" data-end="478.95">JavaScript?</span> <span data-start="478.95" data-end="484.26">JavaScript using a type of exception handling that is about half the original system used</span> <span data-start="484.26" data-end="486.6">in PL1 in 1968.</span> <span data-start="486.6" data-end="493.52">There is PL1 up there in the language family tree descending from Fortran and Algol.</span> <span data-start="493.52" data-end="499.9">In JavaScript, exception handling arrived in ES3 and worked as it does today — we have</span> <span data-start="499.9" data-end="507.169">the error prototype to construct errors, we have the throw key word to propagate them,</span> <span data-start="507.169" data-end="512.4">we have try, catch, and finally, to create a new lexical environment to handle exceptions,</span> <span data-start="512.4" data-end="519.889">and then to clean up after their mess that wasn't be fixed by setting the lexical environment.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="519.889" data-end="524.039">One thing that surprised me in my research is there used to be a non-standard multi-catch</span> <span data-start="524.039" data-end="531.29">syntax, so instead of having to put a conditional catch, you can do catch, catch, catch, catch,</span> <span data-start="531.29" data-end="536.62">but that's not been there since Firefox 59 so that boat kind of sailed.</span> <span data-start="536.62" data-end="541.37">In addition to user-defined errors, there are six built-in error types — only five of</span> <span data-start="541.37" data-end="543">them are still thrown.</span> <span data-start="543" data-end="546.26">EvalError exists for backwards compatibility.</span> <span data-start="546.26" data-end="557.26">The biggest change arrived with early errors, strict mode, to make sure there is no code</span> <span data-start="557.26" data-end="559.32">in memory that's not going to execute.</span> <span data-start="559.32" data-end="563.64">And, to disallow code that would otherwise be allowed by the grammar.</span> <span data-start="563.64" data-end="567.88">These are reported when the programme is evaluated, not when it's run, so it's not part of our</span> <span data-start="567.88" data-end="569.56">exception-handling scheme.</span> <span data-start="569.56" data-end="574.27">Inside the exception-handling system, things are pretty much as they are in most other</span> <span data-start="574.27" data-end="578.67">languages, but in this case, common is not a synonym for opt hall.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="578.67" data-end="584.08">When the invoking function is able to use catch to respond to an error, the stack traces</span> <span data-start="584.08" data-end="590.25">available but the evoking function cannot detect code anywhere down the stack itself.</span> <span data-start="590.25" data-end="592.21">Consider this example.</span> <span data-start="592.21" data-end="596.65">There is this parse entry function which throws an exception when it can't parse a file, and</span> <span data-start="596.65" data-end="602.52">it's getting called four functions in two lines deep, maybe it's inside a library, and</span> <span data-start="602.52" data-end="604.76">this able ise all files is in your code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="604.76" data-end="610.981">When it fails in throws, we might as a programmer have an idea of a good default we can use</span> <span data-start="610.981" data-end="615.95">to continue so the parsing can keep going and we don't have to unwind the loops.</span> <span data-start="615.95" data-end="620.85">If only we had a default, we would rewrite the function to account for the fact that</span> <span data-start="620.85" data-end="625.48">you can return a default value, but I think you can see how making this the responsibility</span> <span data-start="625.48" data-end="630.74">of this inner function both breaks encapsulation, and can quickly get out of hand if you had</span> <span data-start="630.74" data-end="632.71">ideas for other sorts of interventions.</span> <span data-start="632.71" data-end="639.58">So we might be able to do something, but it doesn't matter, because it is not possible</span> <span data-start="639.58" data-end="645.49">without preprocessing the data or rerunning the entire function.</span> <span data-start="645.49" data-end="649.63">Other changes to exception handling have come obviously in JavaScript with promises and</span> <span data-start="649.63" data-end="651.12">asynch await.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="651.12" data-end="653.12">These haven't changed the basic concept, though.</span> <span data-start="653.12" data-end="654.26">They've extended it.</span> <span data-start="654.26" data-end="658.88">They've made for interesting corner cases and variations.</span> <span data-start="658.88" data-end="664.11">For instance, if you return from a nested finally, you're never going to call your outside</span> <span data-start="664.11" data-end="668.62">handler, so never print banana, which is very tragic.</span> <span data-start="668.62" data-end="671.99">Errors may also remain entirely uncaught by a chained catch.</span> <span data-start="671.99" data-end="674.35">I didn't realise this until I was messing around.</span> <span data-start="674.35" data-end="678.86">That first promise isn't going to be caught by the catch.</span> </p>
