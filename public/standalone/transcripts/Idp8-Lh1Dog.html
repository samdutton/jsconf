<p><span data-start="17.17" data-end="19.39">so hello everyone my name is Gonzalo</span> <span data-start="19.39" data-end="21.19">Cordero and i'm here to talk to you</span> <span data-start="21.19" data-end="24.85">today about why why mobile development</span> <span data-start="24.85" data-end="27.939">so before I before I go I want to get a</span> <span data-start="27.939" data-end="29.68">sense how many of you are familiar with</span> <span data-start="29.68" data-end="33.55">Yui cool how many of you are familiar</span> <span data-start="33.55" data-end="37.809">with any of the Yui mobile features cool</span> <span data-start="37.809" data-end="39.28">even better so hopefully you'll learn</span> <span data-start="39.28" data-end="43.12">something today so when I'm gonna be</span> <span data-start="43.12" data-end="45.97">covering is I'm going to talk about some</span> <span data-start="45.97" data-end="47.739">of this stuff you can start using today</span> <span data-start="47.739" data-end="51.97">to in order to create a killer mobile</span> <span data-start="51.97" data-end="54.94">apps using Yui I'm gonna show a little</span> <span data-start="54.94" data-end="56.53">peek into the what's coming to the</span> <span data-start="56.53" data-end="60.58">future and as well as you know i'll show</span> <span data-start="60.58" data-end="62.879">you a couple of cool demos as well too</span> <span data-start="62.879" data-end="68.13">so a couple of statements first Yui</span> <span data-start="68.13" data-end="71.77">philosophy in this mobile environment is</span> <span data-start="71.77" data-end="73.72">that we think that you should not be</span> <span data-start="73.72" data-end="76.24">having to write your code depending on</span> <span data-start="76.24" data-end="78.7">which device you'd apply the deploying</span> <span data-start="78.7" data-end="80.83">to we believe that you should rather</span> <span data-start="80.83" data-end="83.439">want and that cause you just work across</span> <span data-start="83.439" data-end="86.77">all your different devices and the</span> <span data-start="86.77" data-end="88.24">second thing I would like to say is that</span> <span data-start="88.24" data-end="90.609">everything that you need to create a</span> <span data-start="90.609" data-end="93.689">killer molap it's already out there</span> <span data-start="93.689" data-end="96.009">using why why so there's nothing</span> <span data-start="96.009" data-end="98.399">stopping you for creating really good</span> <span data-start="98.399" data-end="100.539">experiences on your mobile applications</span> <span data-start="100.539" data-end="102.88">and I'll show a couple of examples as</span> <span data-start="102.88" data-end="106.749">well so some of the features that you</span> <span data-start="106.749" data-end="108.45">might want to be using when you're</span> <span data-start="108.45" data-end="111.99">designing your model applications are</span> <span data-start="111.99" data-end="115.659">some of these guys right here so the</span> <span data-start="115.659" data-end="118.119">loader 414 that this is you who are now</span> <span data-start="118.119" data-end="121.17">familiar with what the loader is and why</span> <span data-start="121.17" data-end="124.27">basically what it does it's just that it</span> <span data-start="124.27" data-end="126.789">brings it lowes to your page whatever</span> <span data-start="126.789" data-end="129.399">modules you need and on the man as you</span> <span data-start="129.399" data-end="132.819">need them not only that but the loader</span> <span data-start="132.819" data-end="135.61">it's so cool and so sophisticated I will</span> <span data-start="135.61" data-end="138.04">know which device you're deploying to</span> <span data-start="138.04" data-end="140.44">and depending on what you are it will</span> <span data-start="140.44" data-end="142.81">just give you the set of files and</span> <span data-start="142.81" data-end="144.85">modules that you need just for that so</span> <span data-start="144.85" data-end="148.09">what what this means to you is a let's</span> <span data-start="148.09" data-end="150.37">say that you on your coat</span> <span data-start="150.37" data-end="154.72">the note component of why why so if you</span> <span data-start="154.72" data-end="157.54">deploy this up on the desktop then it</span> <span data-start="157.54" data-end="159.519">will give you all the desktop necessary</span> <span data-start="159.519" data-end="161.98">stuff that you need in order to work but</span> <span data-start="161.98" data-end="164.17">if you were gonna deploy your app on a</span> <span data-start="164.17" data-end="166.15">mobile device it will know that it's a</span> <span data-start="166.15" data-end="167.53">mobile device and they'll all these</span> <span data-start="167.53" data-end="170.079">serve you they know the specific stuff</span> <span data-start="170.079" data-end="172">that applies to that device so again</span> <span data-start="172" data-end="175.53">it's a pretty cool stuff and you can do</span> <span data-start="175.53" data-end="179.079">it's actually it's gonna it's about to</span> <span data-start="179.079" data-end="181.72">get way better because we're going to be</span> <span data-start="181.72" data-end="185.95">introducing soon why LS so while it is</span> <span data-start="185.95" data-end="187.209">something that we're very excited about</span> <span data-start="187.209" data-end="190.15">which is we're taking back the loader</span> <span data-start="190.15" data-end="192.67">back from the client to the server and</span> <span data-start="192.67" data-end="196">so basically what without it's going to</span> <span data-start="196" data-end="199.359">do is a all the dependencies calculation</span> <span data-start="199.359" data-end="200.53">is going to happen now in the server</span> <span data-start="200.53" data-end="202.989">which means we're gonna it's going to be</span> <span data-start="202.989" data-end="206.799">way faster is using kno jes and if we</span> <span data-start="206.799" data-end="209.47">also have this cache layer on top of</span> <span data-start="209.47" data-end="213.04">that we're basically if you request a</span> <span data-start="213.04" data-end="215.2">module that someone else has requested</span> <span data-start="215.2" data-end="218.829">before it will serve from the couch gosh</span> <span data-start="218.829" data-end="221.16">so it's going to be extremely fast and</span> <span data-start="221.16" data-end="224.65">we think you're gonna love it and so</span> <span data-start="224.65" data-end="228.03">keep an eye for that on 3 4 wireless</span> <span data-start="228.03" data-end="231.849">alright so let me just talk about the</span> <span data-start="231.849" data-end="234.489">modules some of the widgets that I think</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="234.489" data-end="236.049">I apply for more a while a little bit</span> <span data-start="236.049" data-end="237.79">the first one I'm going to talk about</span> <span data-start="237.79" data-end="241.12">transition so the transition module</span> <span data-start="241.12" data-end="244.09">basically what it does is a you will let</span> <span data-start="244.09" data-end="247.319">you define some sort of visual</span> <span data-start="247.319" data-end="250.54">representation or behavior when you move</span> <span data-start="250.54" data-end="253.359">from point A to point B or from when you</span> <span data-start="253.359" data-end="255.43">move an element from one state to the</span> <span data-start="255.43" data-end="259.239">other say you you know let's say you you</span> <span data-start="259.239" data-end="261.94">know you swipe or you flick and you want</span> <span data-start="261.94" data-end="263.41">to navigate to the next page and you</span> <span data-start="263.41" data-end="266.02">want to show some sort of feedback to</span> <span data-start="266.02" data-end="268.3">the user that you're navigating so</span> <span data-start="268.3" data-end="270.99">transition model will do that for you</span> <span data-start="270.99" data-end="273.729">you know again although the cross</span> <span data-start="273.729" data-end="275.849">browser staff and you know if it</span> <span data-start="275.849" data-end="278.56">hardware acceleration is they will use</span> <span data-start="278.56" data-end="282.01">it so you know what this means to you is</span> <span data-start="282.01" data-end="283.33">in certain</span> <span data-start="283.33" data-end="285.009">do something like this where you're</span> <span data-start="285.009" data-end="286.99">going to have you know to manually set</span> <span data-start="286.99" data-end="289.539">all these different properties for your</span> <span data-start="289.539" data-end="292.18">transition then you can just easily</span> <span data-start="292.18" data-end="294.789">apply in all of these into the node</span> <span data-start="294.789" data-end="299.25">itself that you wish to transition from</span> <span data-start="299.25" data-end="303.729">so again much simpler much cleaner you</span> <span data-start="303.729" data-end="307.09">specified the duration the value that</span> <span data-start="307.09" data-end="309.879">you're going to and this is using css3</span> <span data-start="309.879" data-end="312.81">when available on the back as well so</span> <span data-start="312.81" data-end="316.15">it's similar to that for you and the</span> <span data-start="316.15" data-end="318.33">developer you don't have to worry about</span> <span data-start="318.33" data-end="325.02">browsers vendors specific prefixes and</span> <span data-start="325.02" data-end="329.319">yeah just making your life simpler same</span> <span data-start="329.319" data-end="332.5">fashion the history API or the history</span> <span data-start="332.5" data-end="336.039">module what this does is a will let you</span> <span data-start="336.039" data-end="340.18">tweak the back and forward button on the</span> <span data-start="340.18" data-end="344.62">browser so you can apply custom actions</span> <span data-start="344.62" data-end="348.58">to those to the 22 to the buttons so</span> <span data-start="348.58" data-end="350.349">imagine that you have some sort of</span> <span data-start="350.349" data-end="353.05">built-in navigation control your mobile</span> <span data-start="353.05" data-end="355.599">app and what you want is when the user</span> <span data-start="355.599" data-end="357.639">hit the back button on the browser</span> <span data-start="357.639" data-end="359.889">button which is kind of like common now</span> <span data-start="359.889" data-end="361.629">on android devices you have the actual</span> <span data-start="361.629" data-end="364.33">physical keys to go back and forth so</span> <span data-start="364.33" data-end="366.49">what you want is just so in navigation</span> <span data-start="366.49" data-end="369.43">within your app so you can do this with</span> <span data-start="369.43" data-end="373.33">done using history again you know just a</span> <span data-start="373.33" data-end="375.46">little bit of a code example it's pretty</span> <span data-start="375.46" data-end="377.379">simple all you need to do is instantiate</span> <span data-start="377.379" data-end="380.02">the history object you can passing an</span> <span data-start="380.02" data-end="381.819">initial state if you want you don't have</span> <span data-start="381.819" data-end="386.169">to and then you can modify as you go</span> <span data-start="386.169" data-end="389.409">with add and remove all so it will give</span> <span data-start="389.409" data-end="391.69">you all these different events you can</span> <span data-start="391.69" data-end="394.3">you can subscribe to to detect</span> <span data-start="394.3" data-end="396.789">interesting moment and to change you</span> <span data-start="396.789" data-end="400.36">have to so priest and ER if you use Yui</span> <span data-start="400.36" data-end="403.659">before on how we you know we'd always</span> <span data-start="403.659" data-end="405.659">publish all these events for you to</span> <span data-start="405.659" data-end="409">tweak your application so let me just</span> <span data-start="409" data-end="411.91">show you a quick demo online on this too</span> <span data-start="411.91" data-end="419.41">tavion history so so in this case let's</span> <span data-start="419.41" data-end="421.81">say you know I created this tab control</span> <span data-start="421.81" data-end="423.61">right I'm by the way all the all the</span> <span data-start="423.61" data-end="424.87">examples are going to be showing off</span> <span data-start="424.87" data-end="427.72">today are available in the YY library so</span> <span data-start="427.72" data-end="429.73">you can just you know look on your own</span> <span data-start="429.73" data-end="432.07">time and then play around with it but</span> <span data-start="432.07" data-end="434.2">basically let's say I have a some sort</span> <span data-start="434.2" data-end="439.03">of navigation like this where it's gone</span> <span data-start="439.03" data-end="441.55">it's gonna navigate through the content</span> <span data-start="441.55" data-end="445.54">so as I go and I want to go back instead</span> <span data-start="445.54" data-end="447.52">of going back to you know the previous</span> <span data-start="447.52" data-end="449.23">pages are visited on the browser history</span> <span data-start="449.23" data-end="452.17">it's just gonna let me navigate through</span> <span data-start="452.17" data-end="455.86">my little widget here so I think pretty</span> <span data-start="455.86" data-end="458.2">honey if you're if you need to do</span> <span data-start="458.2" data-end="460.03">something custom for your mobile</span> <span data-start="460.03" data-end="463.56">application in terms of navigation and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="463.56" data-end="466.57">I'm going to be showing them at the end</span> <span data-start="466.57" data-end="468.1">that kind of capsule is everything it's</span> <span data-start="468.1" data-end="472.15">like a real life example so just holding</span> <span data-start="472.15" data-end="477.15">their hang in there okay so now we're</span> <span data-start="477.15" data-end="479.89">let me talk about events a little bit</span> <span data-start="479.89" data-end="481.39">now because I think this is a pre</span> <span data-start="481.39" data-end="485.32">interesting so event we provide you a</span> <span data-start="485.32" data-end="488.32">set of the regular events are available</span> <span data-start="488.32" data-end="490.09">right now for all the devices out there</span> <span data-start="490.09" data-end="493.84">like touch move and touch star and then</span> <span data-start="493.84" data-end="496.419">all the iOS specific ones you know</span> <span data-start="496.419" data-end="499">gesture star on your gesture change and</span> <span data-start="499" data-end="501.43">what not but on top of that we also</span> <span data-start="501.43" data-end="504.669">giving you a set of synthetic events you</span> <span data-start="504.669" data-end="508.33">can subscribe to so two of the most</span> <span data-start="508.33" data-end="510.01">interesting ones are the flick giving</span> <span data-start="510.01" data-end="513.64">and the other gestures so let's say you</span> <span data-start="513.64" data-end="516.669">wanna you know you have a something with</span> <span data-start="516.669" data-end="519.52">with media alright like like like a</span> <span data-start="519.52" data-end="521.32">carousel with pictures or something and</span> <span data-start="521.32" data-end="523.36">you want to be able just to swipe make</span> <span data-start="523.36" data-end="525.58">flick like that and just like navigate</span> <span data-start="525.58" data-end="528.61">so why why we'll give you this event</span> <span data-start="528.61" data-end="532.15">called flick you can subscribe to pass a</span> <span data-start="532.15" data-end="536.2">set of different properties and again</span> <span data-start="536.2" data-end="538.6">this is very highly customizable and you</span> <span data-start="538.6" data-end="540.23">can really achieve need</span> <span data-start="540.23" data-end="542.999">look and feel if you tweak with those</span> <span data-start="542.999" data-end="545.879">settings a little pain but then I mean</span> <span data-start="545.879" data-end="548.16">that's it's pretty simple you just pass</span> <span data-start="548.16" data-end="550.709">in the distance and the velocity and why</span> <span data-start="550.709" data-end="553.679">not and then you know it will behave</span> <span data-start="553.679" data-end="558.329">like a native if you want to have more</span> <span data-start="558.329" data-end="560.67">control what's happening on that flick</span> <span data-start="560.67" data-end="564.6">event we also provide you events you can</span> <span data-start="564.6" data-end="567.059">subscribe to take when the gesture</span> <span data-start="567.059" data-end="570.389">actually starts and when it moves and</span> <span data-start="570.389" data-end="572.67">when the user lifted at the finger of</span> <span data-start="572.67" data-end="575.399">the of the other mobile device and then</span> <span data-start="575.399" data-end="577.35">you can react to it and do you know</span> <span data-start="577.35" data-end="581.85">whatever you need to do so again pretty</span> <span data-start="581.85" data-end="585.269">highly customizable and you can</span> <span data-start="585.269" data-end="587.1">definitely achieve a lot of the native</span> <span data-start="587.1" data-end="593.1">coolness with just using web let me show</span> <span data-start="593.1" data-end="597.689">you a quick demo on the flick stuff then</span> <span data-start="597.689" data-end="614.13">you having the simulator</span> <span data-start="614.14" data-end="616.49">okay so in this case we have this little</span> <span data-start="616.49" data-end="618.86">list you know it's pretty pretty common</span> <span data-start="618.86" data-end="620.54">where you have on your mobile devices</span> <span data-start="620.54" data-end="623.3">like a list view of items right and this</span> <span data-start="623.3" data-end="627.62">is again all HTML CSS and why why what</span> <span data-start="627.62" data-end="629.66">you want to do is uh you want to show</span> <span data-start="629.66" data-end="631.22">pressing the user like I made like a</span> <span data-start="631.22" data-end="633.17">shortcut to be able to delete these</span> <span data-start="633.17" data-end="636.91">items as the user navigates really so</span> <span data-start="636.91" data-end="639.23">just going to have to use the mouse but</span> <span data-start="639.23" data-end="641.57">again get worse with your your finger on</span> <span data-start="641.57" data-end="644.36">touch event as well but as you strive to</span> <span data-start="644.36" data-end="646.16">the left we're presenting this delete</span> <span data-start="646.16" data-end="648.53">button here right here and as you delete</span> <span data-start="648.53" data-end="650.42">then we use in transition to collapse</span> <span data-start="650.42" data-end="655.37">all the list so you know not too fancy</span> <span data-start="655.37" data-end="658.37">but you get the idea and you know this</span> <span data-start="658.37" data-end="660.98">open the door opens the door to a lot of</span> <span data-start="660.98" data-end="662.51">things on your when you're thinking</span> <span data-start="662.51" data-end="665.24">about creating your mobile application</span> <span data-start="665.24"

data-end="672.68">question if do you really need to do it</span> <span data-start="672.68" data-end="675.68">using native control when you can just</span> <span data-start="675.68" data-end="678.74">do it using web using why I for example</span> <span data-start="678.74" data-end="680.96">and then it will just work across all</span> <span data-start="680.96" data-end="682.73">your devices and don't have to maintain</span> <span data-start="682.73" data-end="690.09">different code bases so</span> <span data-start="690.1" data-end="694.82">and the last which I want to talk about</span> <span data-start="694.82" data-end="696.89">before going to the demos is the</span> <span data-start="696.89" data-end="700.67">scrollview widget so scrub you basically</span> <span data-start="700.67" data-end="702.8">what gives you the scrollable content</span> <span data-start="702.8" data-end="705.56">that reacts to swipe events or touch</span> <span data-start="705.56" data-end="708.76">events you can make it horizontal</span> <span data-start="708.76" data-end="713.39">horizontal or vertically aligned and</span> <span data-start="713.39" data-end="716.36">then you did this plugins to to make it</span> <span data-start="716.36" data-end="719.09">behave the way you want it and bouncy</span> <span data-start="719.09" data-end="721.19">and whatnot and like i said i'll show</span> <span data-start="721.19" data-end="723.5">you an example in a little bit and how</span> <span data-start="723.5" data-end="724.94">do you use it it's pretty simple you</span> <span data-start="724.94" data-end="728.75">just feed a bunch of you know since or</span> <span data-start="728.75" data-end="731.83">markup that contains maybe images and</span> <span data-start="731.83" data-end="737.63">some context and then you sang she ate</span> <span data-start="737.63" data-end="739.94">the scrollview object and here you can</span> <span data-start="739.94" data-end="743.39">just tell okay so I want my flick even</span> <span data-start="743.39" data-end="746.71">to react at this minimum velocity or the</span> <span data-start="746.71" data-end="749.18">deceleration has to be this or you know</span> <span data-start="749.18" data-end="751.85">want to bounce this many pixels and</span> <span data-start="751.85" data-end="753.86">whatnot so again really highly</span> <span data-start="753.86" data-end="755.5">customizable you can really achieve</span> <span data-start="755.5" data-end="760.27">really good looking we hit like apps and</span> <span data-start="760.27" data-end="763.07">on behavior Sunday that mimic like</span> <span data-start="763.07" data-end="768.8">native which as web and to the example</span> <span data-start="768.8" data-end="772.52">okay so for the past couple of months or</span> <span data-start="772.52" data-end="775.28">so I mean working on this this is a new</span> <span data-start="775.28" data-end="777.44">yahoo local app that's going to be on</span> <span data-start="777.44" data-end="780.38">the app store soon it just something is</span> <span

data-end="789.8">you are so when we initially represented</span> <span data-start="789.8" data-end="791.839">the marks and the specs you know that</span> <span data-start="791.839" data-end="794.18">you know everyone was a moment obviously</span> <span data-start="794.18" data-end="796.01">now we have to write all of this in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="796.01" data-end="798.47">Objective C but then we as we start</span> <span data-start="798.47" data-end="800.6">going we start realizing that everything</span> <span data-start="800.6" data-end="804.44">which has been done using web on Yui and</span> <span data-start="804.44" data-end="806.6">not only that but when we decide to</span> <span data-start="806.6" data-end="809.36">launch this into Android will have to do</span> <span data-start="809.36" data-end="811.18">nothing you know just work I mean</span> <span data-start="811.18" data-end="815.72">granted the navigation its native but</span> <span data-start="815.72" data-end="817.46">you know does the only piece that will</span> <span data-start="817.46" data-end="819.72">have to write whenever we go to</span> <span data-start="819.72" data-end="824.009">android so for example this pull down to</span> <span data-start="824.009" data-end="826.98">refresh event that you know it's pretty</span> <span data-start="826.98" data-end="831.899">common in this mobile app out there we</span> <span data-start="831.899" data-end="835.62">being able to mimic using just web same</span> <span data-start="835.62" data-end="837.12">with this guy right here this is a</span> <span data-start="837.12" data-end="839.519">little scope oui je where you can just</span> <span data-start="839.519" data-end="841.56">swipe your fingers to see the different</span> <span data-start="841.56"

data-end="853.05">cannot leave this castle that looks like</span> <span data-start="853.05" data-end="857.1">iOS coverflow 20 side again you know</span> <span data-start="857.1" data-end="860.48">just using Yui 3 or web components</span> <span data-start="860.48" data-end="863.759">highly scalable so let me just show you</span> <span data-start="863.759" data-end="884.56">a demo day of the whole phone</span> <span data-start="884.57" data-end="886.79">by the way it's been it's been an</span> <span data-start="886.79" data-end="890.69">earthquake I guess so in California</span> <span data-start="890.69" data-end="897.08">centrica anyways so we have this weather</span> <span data-start="897.08" data-end="899.54">widget right here you know you see the</span> <span data-start="899.54" data-end="905.81">bounce all that is web using Yui same</span> <span data-start="905.81" data-end="908.54">with this guy right here that was</span> <span data-start="908.54"

data-start="939.11" data-end="942.47">native staff you can just use web to</span> <span data-start="942.47" data-end="944.96">achieve and to get to this production</span> <span data-start="944.96" data-end="948.95">level quality apps does it pull down to</span> <span data-start="948.95" data-end="952.97">refresh 22 to create applications and</span> <span data-start="952.97"
