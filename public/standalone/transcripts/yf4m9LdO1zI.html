<p><span data-start="76.549" data-end="81.979">Plugins are not an option for applications.</span> <span data-start="81.979" data-end="87.979">We can use Web crypto for the pin of the lock stream.</span> <span data-start="87.979" data-end="90.02">A web app.</span> <span data-start="90.02" data-end="96.979">We can secure or encrypt anything in the device.</span> <span data-start="96.979" data-end="100.86">Also websites can make use of the webcrypto api.</span> <span data-start="100.86" data-end="103.119">Before sending it to the server.</span> <span data-start="103.119" data-end="107.409">To avoid any trace of sensitive data.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="107.409" data-end="111.659">There are more valid uses.</span> <span data-start="111.659" data-end="115.409">We have a lot to cover today.</span> <span data-start="115.409" data-end="120.46">I do want to build a notes app.</span> <span data-start="120.46" data-end="122.7">It is a simple example.</span> <span data-start="122.7" data-end="127.5">We don't have to talk about the UI anymore.</span> <span data-start="127.5" data-end="130.15">Most of you have written one.</span> <span data-start="130.15" data-end="131.53">Our app will be different.</span> <span data-start="131.53" data-end="137.93">As we will be using cryptography.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="137.93" data-end="144.2">You should be familiar with arrays and how to work with promises.</span> <span data-start="144.2" data-end="146.98">You will know the basis of the webcrypto api.</span> <span data-start="146.98" data-end="154.93">And with the storage with only a few lines of code.</span> <span data-start="154.93" data-end="160.069">It will work in Firefox and Chrome.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="160.069" data-end="165.69">As I said before, we don't care about the Ui.</span> <span data-start="165.69" data-end="168.019">Let's start by taking a closer look at the storage.</span> <span data-start="168.019" data-end="169.23">I picked localforage.</span> <span data-start="169.23" data-end="173.68">Localforage is great.</span> <span data-start="173.68" data-end="187.22">You can pass any data and automatically get a promised based Api for free.</span> <span data-start="187.22" data-end="189.489">This is how we would use the storage Api.</span> <span data-start="189.489" data-end="196.45">It doesn't care about a particular format.</span> <span data-start="196.45" data-end="202">But as maintainers of the Api, we start to think of a few things that could go wrong</span> <span data-start="202" data-end="203.13">here.</span> <span data-start="203.13" data-end="206.159">Let's say we are about data corruption.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="206.159" data-end="214.79">Not particular about losing data but wrong data.</span> <span data-start="214.79" data-end="220.379">The first thing that comes to mind is add some integrity checking.</span> <span data-start="220.379" data-end="226.97">As it turns out, hash functions are excellent for providing the integrity.</span> <span data-start="226.97" data-end="234.599">You have seen it before when downloading.</span> <span data-start="234.599" data-end="239.36">You would calculate the hash and compare it to the hash digest.</span> <span data-start="239.36" data-end="241.769">To check for corruptions.</span> <span data-start="241.769" data-end="245.28">If it was corrupted you would throw it away and redownload it.</span> <span data-start="245.28" data-end="248.329">We use the Sha-256.</span> <span data-start="248.329" data-end="254.599">A cryptographic hash function.</span> <span data-start="254.599" data-end="259.2">Given the same input, hash functions return the same output.</span> <span data-start="259.2" data-end="268.03">If only 1 would change, it returns a different result.</span> <span data-start="268.03" data-end="270.83">32 bytes or 256 bits.</span> <span data-start="270.83" data-end="277.48">For a good hash function it should be hard to find 2 different inputs mapping to the</span> <span data-start="277.48" data-end="280.33">same input.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="280.33" data-end="284.591">Hard to find a collision for the function.</span> <span data-start="284.591" data-end="288.47">The webcrypto Api provides a different.</span> <span data-start="288.47" data-end="293.56">It takes an array buffer.</span> <span data-start="293.56" data-end="298.22">And also to an array buffer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="298.22" data-end="304.06">Al cryptographic definitions are here.</span> <span data-start="304.06" data-end="306.62">It can be quite expensive.</span> <span data-start="306.62" data-end="310.49">All do the work asynchronously.</span> <span data-start="310.49" data-end="315.14">It can do the heavy work.</span> <span data-start="315.14" data-end="326.22">Subtle is supposed to reflect that many algorithms need to be satisfied in order..</span> <span data-start="326.22" data-end="334.78">Or slightly differently, they want you to know what you are doing.</span> <span data-start="334.78" data-end="339.49">We will see more Api examples later.</span> <span data-start="339.49" data-end="345.77">Let's use digest functions for integrity.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="345.77" data-end="347.78">This is our basic storage api.</span> <span data-start="347.78" data-end="352.42">We start by modifying the save function.</span> <span data-start="352.42" data-end="359.97">Instead of only saving nodes we want to use hash.</span> <span data-start="359.97" data-end="363.1">To store the values nicer.</span> <span data-start="363.1" data-end="375.81">Until all are resolved and lets the caller know.</span> <span data-start="375.81" data-end="378.43">Sha-256 as the hash function.</span> <span data-start="378.43" data-end="382.46">And pass the notes.</span> <span data-start="382.46" data-end="393.22">We should change the save function signature to make it clear it takes array buffers now.</span> <span data-start="393.22" data-end="397.34">So now that we stored everything we need to know for integrity checking.</span> <span data-start="397.34" data-end="398.78">Let's implement the check.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="398.78" data-end="403.03">And look at the load function.</span> <span data-start="403.03" data-end="407.8">We will use promise.All to use.</span> <span data-start="407.8" data-end="411.64">People want to compute a digest off the notes.</span> <span data-start="411.64" data-end="420.08">We just read from disk.</span> <span data-start="420.08" data-end="426.37">Compare is a simple function that takes 2 types arrays and compares them.</span> <span data-start="426.37" data-end="429.68">We resolve that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="429.68" data-end="435.13">Or resolve to .</span> <span data-start="435.13" data-end="438.53">Using a cryptographic hashfunction we solved the problem.</span> <span data-start="438.53" data-end="442.34">And can detect accidental corruption.</span> <span data-start="442.34" data-end="447.37">We are not protected against deliberate functions.</span> <span data-start="447.37" data-end="455.68">It is not really a challenge.</span> <span data-start="455.68" data-end="459.46">It would be great to combine a secret with the hash function.</span> <span data-start="459.46" data-end="463.72">that we can prevent deliberate changes.</span> <span data-start="463.72" data-end="467.15">What we are missing is authenticity.</span> <span data-start="467.15" data-end="474.99">When reading data from disk, we want to make sure it was from someone.</span> <span data-start="474.99" data-end="478.68">Can convince it that the data on disk is genuine.</span> <span data-start="478.68" data-end="490.17">Hmac or hash based message authentication code are excellent for integrity and authenticity.</span> <span data-start="490.17" data-end="493.64">In combination with a secret key.</span> <span data-start="493.64" data-end="497.03">For any data you need to know the secret key.</span> <span data-start="497.03" data-end="505.53">The hash function will be Sha-256 as we have seen in the previous example.</span> <span data-start="505.53" data-end="507.55">Hash functions take a single input.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="507.55" data-end="510.04">And return a digest.</span> <span data-start="510.04" data-end="514.61">We need a secret key.</span> <span data-start="514.61" data-end="519.55">Combining the data and key input, these functions return a message authentication code.</span> <span data-start="519.55" data-end="524.01">And use it later.</span> <span data-start="524.01" data-end="532.31">Given the same data and same key, the hmac function will return the same code.</span> <span data-start="532.31" data-end="534.83">This looks similar to how we use digest before.</span> <span data-start="534.83" data-end="537.21">This time the function.</span> <span data-start="537.21" data-end="539.93">And a key argument.</span> <span data-start="539.93" data-end="546.65">The promise returned for the given data under the given key.</span> <span data-start="546.65" data-end="552.68">And instead of comparing the digest manually, we can use the function provided by the Api.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="552.68" data-end="556.47">We provide the key and data.</span> <span data-start="556.47" data-end="568.8">And a boolean if it is valid of the data under a key.</span> <span data-start="568.8" data-end="573.16">We first replace the digest function with the function.</span> <span data-start="573.16" data-end="577.39">Algorithm and secret key.</span> <span data-start="577.39" data-end="580.34">Both the notes and the mac are stored.</span> <span data-start="580.34" data-end="584.97">The save function takes a key argument.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="632.31" data-end="638.59">The problem is that passwords don't look random at all.</span> <span data-start="638.59" data-end="640.61">Think of how they are composed.</span> <span data-start="640.61" data-end="642.15">Printable characters.</span> <span data-start="642.15" data-end="645.56">And the same.</span> <span data-start="645.56" data-end="649.33">You can't use passwords directly.</span> <span data-start="649.33" data-end="651.64">But there is a way.</span> <span data-start="651.64" data-end="656.361">That is what we call key derivation.</span> <span data-start="656.361" data-end="664.13">It is the process of deriving a second key from a given key.</span> <span data-start="664.13" data-end="669.16">The webcrypto Api derives to the key method.</span> <span data-start="669.16" data-end="675.61">To use the base key to derive from whether the algorithm the key will be used for.</span> <span data-start="675.61" data-end="677.29">Whether it is extractable.</span> <span data-start="677.29" data-end="680.38">Exporting it to a different format.</span> </p>
