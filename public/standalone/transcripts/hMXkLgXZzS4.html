<p><span data-start="93.909" data-end="95.619">Netscape and Microsoft were the two</span> <span data-start="95.619" data-end="98.049">dominant browser you know the two</span> <span data-start="98.049"

data-end="108.039">explorer had undercut their business</span> <span data-start="108.039" data-end="109.749">model and they suddenly found themselves</span> <span data-start="109.749"

data-end="115.81">fooling themselves into thinking that</span> <span data-start="115.81" data-end="119.649">they had some some way to survive so</span> <span data-start="119.649" data-end="121.869">they could see that Microsoft was really</span> <span data-start="121.869" data-end="123.609">poised to basically take over the web</span> <span data-start="123.609" data-end="127.689">and in this kind of desperate situation</span> <span data-start="127.689" data-end="129.64">they actually pulled a pretty amazing</span> <span data-start="129.64" data-end="132.459">move particularly for that time when</span> <span data-start="132.459" data-end="134.09">open source was not as</span> <span data-start="134.09" data-end="138.65">as popular common a thing on the</span> <span data-start="138.65" data-end="142.31">thirty-first of march in 1998 they</span> <span data-start="142.31" data-end="144.23">decided to open the source to netscape</span> <span data-start="144.23" data-end="147.41">and create mozilla org which was going</span> <span data-start="147.41" data-end="150.4">to be this worldwide organization of</span> <span

data-end="157.099">two parts to this to what makes us a</span> <span data-start="157.099" data-end="160.34">revolution one was this was maybe</span> <span data-start="160.34" data-end="162.56">possibly going to rescue netscape from</span> <span data-start="162.56" data-end="165.709">almost certain death and we know how</span> <span data-start="165.709" data-end="168.59">that story ends but more importantly I</span> <span data-start="168.59" data-end="171.38">think this move saved the web I think if</span> <span data-start="171.38" data-end="173.39">they hadn't done this there would have</span> <span data-start="173.39" data-end="176.9">been very little that anybody could do</span> <span data-start="176.9" data-end="179.42">to stop Microsoft from from taking over</span> <span data-start="179.42" data-end="183.2">the web as it turns out this revolution</span> <span data-start="183.2" data-end="187.269">was actually televised so I have a</span> <span data-start="187.269" data-end="189.65">little clip here I want to show you from</span> <span data-start="189.65" data-end="192.68">a documentary called code rush which was</span> <span data-start="192.68" data-end="195.049">actually they followed Netscape people</span> <span data-start="195.049" data-end="197.69">around during this period and they</span> <span data-start="197.69" data-end="200.48">actually filmed the moment when Jamie's</span> <span data-start="200.48" data-end="203.09">a winski who was a well-known developer</span> <span data-start="203.09" data-end="204.92">at Netscape pushed the code out to the</span> <span data-start="204.92" data-end="207.53">web and for me this is a pretty heady</span> <span data-start="207.53" data-end="209.09">moment in the history of the web this</span> <span data-start="209.09" data-end="211.819">was this was a moment of revolution and</span> <span data-start="211.819" data-end="213.65">what led up to this was a whole bunch of</span> <span data-start="213.65" data-end="216.829">pressure they were behind schedule they</span> <span data-start="216.829" data-end="218.12">were finding out at the last minute that</span> <span data-start="218.12" data-end="219.799">they had potentially patent encumbered</span> <span data-start="219.799" data-end="221.03">code that they were going to have to</span> <span data-start="221.03" data-end="222.919">replace and there were people pulling</span> <span data-start="222.919" data-end="224.66">all nighters to replace patent and come</span> <span data-start="224.66" data-end="226.16">pre code with open source code so it was</span> <span data-start="226.16" data-end="227.84">really down to the wire and the</span> <span data-start="227.84" data-end="230.84">documentary kind of plays that up so</span> <span data-start="230.84" data-end="232.25">here they are on March 31st that's</span> </p>

<span data-start="260.959" data-end="262.7">that the first developer release of its</span> <span data-start="262.7" data-end="265.13">communicator 50 source code is available</span> <span

data-end="279.59">the end of March as we announced we are</span> <span data-start="279.59" data-end="281.84">pushing the code out to the web as they</span> <span data-start="281.84" data-end="283.49">say and we're delighted to be part of it</span> <span data-start="283.49" data-end="284.84">and we're very excited to see what</span> <span data-start="284.84" data-end="287.39">happens the good news is the marathoner</span> <span data-start="287.39" data-end="288.919">is now coming into town with that bomb</span> <span data-start="288.919" data-end="290.36">on his back and it looks like he's going</span> <span data-start="290.36" data-end="297.07">to make it this is the moment of truth</span> <span data-start="297.07" data-end="299.93">they don't have a theoretical framework</span> <span data-start="299.93" data-end="301.91">to write software they're just writing</span> <span data-start="301.91" data-end="308.84">it hi just like hitting the baseball if</span> <span data-start="308.84" data-end="311.87">their code gets a home run nobody's</span> <span data-start="311.87" data-end="314">asking questions well this doesn't make</span> <span data-start="314" data-end="315.62">sense or why do you do that why does it</span> <span data-start="315.62" data-end="329.21">work nobody cares why it works wait</span> <span data-start="329.21" data-end="334.49">what's good um well it's not connected</span> <span data-start="334.49" data-end="337.729">to the machine that controls the ftp</span> <span data-start="337.729" data-end="340.07">push it's like not answering is it Lotus</span> <span data-start="340.07" data-end="344.18">its blast that flash oh yeah maybe Reba</span> <span

out on the</span> <span data-start="371.78" data-end="377.56">note that's correct i decided not to a</span> <span data-start="377.56" data-end="383.18">stupid idea that's a story interesting</span> <span data-start="383.18" data-end="395.85">to go</span> <span data-start="395.86" data-end="399.199">for a moment everyone at Netscape takes</span> <span data-start="399.199" data-end="403.04">a breather</span> <span data-start="403.05" data-end="405.219">he said I think it's going to work out</span> <span data-start="405.219" data-end="407.529">there at the end I think my favorite</span> <span data-start="407.529" data-end="408.969">part of that is the little Duran Duran</span> <span data-start="408.969" data-end="412.719">playing in the background alright this</span> <span data-start="412.719" data-end="416.949">was a this was a seriously revolutionary</span> <span data-start="416.949" data-end="418.3">move and they knew what they were doing</span> <span data-start="418.3" data-end="420.61">this wasn't just about saving Netscape</span> <span data-start="420.61" data-end="423.55">they understood that they were also</span> <span data-start="423.55" data-end="426.129">creating a parachute to rescue a</span> <span data-start="426.129" data-end="428.08">competition on the web to be able to</span> <span data-start="428.08" data-end="432.819">have another another option after the</span> <span data-start="432.819" data-end="435.249">end of Netscape so Jamie Zielinski was</span> <span data-start="435.249" data-end="437.169">replying a year later after AOL had</span> <span data-start="437.169" data-end="438.819">acquired Netscape and people were kind</span> <span data-start="438.819" data-end="442.599">of facepalming and giving up and he was</span> <span data-start="442.599" data-end="444.659">saying don't don't forget what we did</span> <span data-start="444.659" data-end="448.81">because we opened the the source code</span> <span data-start="448.81" data-end="451.509">because legally nobody can close that</span> <span data-start="451.509" data-end="453.249">source code back up he's saying nobody</span> <span data-start="453.249" data-end="454.839">can undo what has been done the Mozilla</span> <span data-start="454.839" data-end="456.61">code is out there and nobody can ever</span> <span data-start="456.61" data-end="459.639">take that away from you ever so that you</span> <span data-start="459.639" data-end="460.87">know it took a couple of years for that</span> <span data-start="460.87" data-end="462.189">source code to really land on its feet</span> <span data-start="462.189" data-end="463.99">and for Firefox to become a big thing</span> <span data-start="463.99" data-end="466.839">but this was a big a big bold move in</span> <span data-start="466.839" data-end="472.36">the history of of the web so revolution</span> <span data-start="472.36" data-end="474.729">is really exciting and it lets you raise</span> <span data-start="474.729" data-end="476.68">guns over your head and and red flags</span> <span data-start="476.68" data-end="478.12">and it's it's pretty hard to get excited</span> <span data-start="478.12" data-end="479.8">about things like evolution because</span> <span data-start="479.8" data-end="482.439">evolution tends to not be quite as</span> <span data-start="482.439" data-end="484.949">pretty not maybe not quite as exciting</span> <span data-start="484.949" data-end="490.029">it produces some interesting effects but</span> <span data-start="490.029" data-end="491.289">i'm going to try anyway to convince you</span> <span data-start="491.289" data-end="493.93">that there's there's there's times for</span> <span data-start="493.93" data-end="495.759">revolution but there's also times when</span> <span data-start="495.759" data-end="497.08">maybe revolution isn't what's called for</span> <span data-start="497.08" data-end="498.339">and maybe evolution would actually work</span> <span data-start="498.339" data-end="501.669">better so you know when they saw where</span> <span data-start="501.669" data-end="503.56">we're at death's door here the web is</span> <span data-start="503.56" data-end="505.719">almost over okay that's time for</span> <span data-start="505.719" data-end="508.27">revolution but often you hear people say</span> <span data-start="508.27" data-end="509.86">you know you read on like hacker news oh</span> <span data-start="509.86" data-end="511.389">this you know JavaScript such an ugly</span> <span data-start="511.389" data-end="513.699">language oh it has with we should just</span> <span data-start="513.699" data-end="516.069">start over again but look every</span> <span data-start="516.069" data-end="517.959">technology has words and maybe having</span> <span data-start="517.959" data-end="519.76">warts isn't actually enough cause for</span> <span data-start="519.76" data-end="525.04">revolution so one of the one of the</span> <span data-start="525.04" data-end="527.079">topics where you see people asking for</span> <span data-start="527.079" data-end="530.29">revolution all the time is this you know</span> <span data-start="530.29" data-end="531.459">why don't you have a byte code language</span> <span data-start="531.459" data-end="532.26">on the</span> <span data-start="532.26" data-end="534.72">and for a long time was ill argued</span> <span data-start="534.72" data-end="538.44">against trying to standardize a bytecode</span> <span data-start="538.44" data-end="542.31">vm but it was hard to really it's hard</span> <span data-start="542.31" data-end="544.11">to just say no you really want to offer</span> <span data-start="544.11" data-end="547.89">an alternative and so when we look at</span> <span data-start="547.89" data-end="549.81">the the calls for a byte code language</span> <span data-start="549.81" data-end="551.73">it's actually better to take a step back</span> <span data-start="551.73" data-end="553.05">and say what are the problems that</span> <span data-start="553.05" data-end="554.79">people are actually trying to solve the</span> <span data-start="554.79" data-end="556.56">problems that that they're identifying</span> <span data-start="556.56" data-end="558.12">these are real actual problems are</span> <span data-start="558.12" data-end="561.45">things like JavaScript lacks the</span> <span data-start="561.45" data-end="563.88">features that you need for other</span> <span data-start="563.88" data-end="565.71">languages to compile to the web so
