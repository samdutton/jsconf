<p><span data-start="48.84" data-end="55.36">This event is often described as a homecoming for the JavaScript community, because that</span> <span data-start="55.36" data-end="82.959">might be hard for you to believe right now, but back then, the JavaScript community kind</span> <span data-start="82.959" data-end="90.52">of didn't exist.</span> <span data-start="90.52" data-end="162.799">A lot of people were PHP programmers doing Ruby and Python and doing a bit of JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="162.799" data-end="197.079">Nobody felt that JavaScript is my home.</span> <span data-start="197.079" data-end="242.599">JSConf EU 2009 brought that space together and changed the landscaping space forever.</span> <span data-start="242.599" data-end="249.319"Audience member: Holger, Jan and Malte met at that first JSConf US and decided they needed to bring</span> <span data-start="249.319" data-end="250.489">that community to Europe.</span> <span data-start="250.489" data-end="254.62">In 2009, they chose a venue, and, with no other prior experience planning a conference,</span> <span data-start="254.62" data-end="255.62">they got started.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="255.62" data-end="263.28">Lucky for them, Marina worked there, and she helped bring that conference to live, and</span> <span data-start="263.28" data-end="272.919">a few months later when they were planning the next conference, they found that Marina</span> <span data-start="272.919" data-end="280.62">didn't work there any more, and they were panicked and approached there, and since then,</span> <span data-start="280.62" data-end="284.35">she's been working with the conference every single year.</span> <span data-start="284.35" data-end="287.889">A little-known secret: Marina is a huge part of this conference.</span> <span data-start="287.889" data-end="289.3">Please applaud Marina!</span> <span data-start="289.3" data-end="290.3">[Applause].</span> <span data-start="290.3" data-end="292.72">She is the one who suggested the bubble track.</span> <span data-start="292.72" data-end="294.319">If you remember that?</span> <span data-start="294.319" data-end="295.919">Anyway, not this year.</span> <span data-start="295.919" data-end="300.38">So the original JSConf was Jan, Holger, and Malte.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="300.38" data-end="311.21">These were not the only people who have been a part of this amazing organising team.</span> <span data-start="311.21" data-end="315.68">In 2012, Tiffany joins, and then in 2015, Simone.</span> <span data-start="315.68" data-end="327.25">For a year, I was a part of the team before moving to Australia and starting — actually,</span> <span data-start="327.25" data-end="349.55">just cultivating a local chapter of JSConf and CSSConf Australia, and Feli joined as</span> <span data-start="349.55" data-end="350.55">the newest team member.</span> <span data-start="350.55" data-end="357.65">As someone who is organiser, I think it's fair to shall I that JSConf EU had a little</span> <span data-start="357.65" data-end="369.759">impact on the tech community starting in the first year when Ryan Dahl showed JS for the</span> <span data-start="369.759" data-end="373.33">first time, and it was one of the only tech conferences with a standing ovation.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="373.33" data-end="374.43">I missed it.</span> <span data-start="374.43" data-end="376.409">I was in the other track.</span> <span data-start="376.409" data-end="381.539">And then, last year, he demoed Deno, his new JavaScript run time, and of course, Deno is</span> <span data-start="381.539" data-end="385.87">based on typescript which was also I understood Democratic Unionist at JSConf EU.</span> <span data-start="385.87" data-end="390.259">Finally, the not-so-super-well-received React was at JSConf US but then represented at Pete</span> <span data-start="390.259" data-end="391.259">Hunt.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="391.259" data-end="393.77">JSConf was never supposed to be a big conference.</span> <span data-start="393.77" data-end="397.02">Yet here we are with 1,600 people right now.</span> <span data-start="397.02" data-end="403.599">The strategy for JSConf from the early days was to have a lot of small conferences around</span> <span data-start="403.599" data-end="407.55">the globe to provide local communities to be distributed, and also to lower the environmental</span> <span data-start="407.55" data-end="410.22">impact of flying people around.</span> <span data-start="410.22" data-end="421">While organising conferences now we have 14 JSConfs, some active and retired — EU, Australia,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="421" data-end="431.78">China, Colombia would be Brazil, Belgium, China, and I hope I didn't forget anyone.</span> <span data-start="431.78" data-end="432.78">[Cheering].</span> <span data-start="432.78" data-end="436.05"Audience member: There are a lot of them.</span> <span data-start="436.05" data-end="442.949">And that's not mentioning any satellite events and JSConf family events.</span> <span data-start="442.949" data-end="458.97">It's</span> <span data-start="458.97" data-end="494.01">a huge family now.</span> <span data-start="494.01" data-end="589.36">JSConf EU didn't just spawn more JSConfs around the world.</span> <span data-start="589.36" data-end="632.69">In 2011, Reject US which was originally conceived as a platform for the great talks that got</span> <span data-start="632.69" data-end="658.65">rejected, and it was a lower prised event aimed at locals which got its own cult following.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="658.65" data-end="669.78">CSSConf came to  the US as well in 2013.</span> <span data-start="669.78" data-end="679.31">They may have heard that just like JSConf, CSSConf is also taking a break, but that means</span> <span data-start="679.31" data-end="681.02">it's completely over.</span> <span data-start="681.02" data-end="683.88">Their last conference was yesterday.</span> <span data-start="683.88" data-end="688.45">Round of applause if you went yesterday!</span> <span data-start="688.45" data-end="689.45">[Applause].</span> <span data-start="689.45" data-end="704.43">One of the things that makes JSConf and CSSConf very special and welcoming place is inclusion.</span> <span data-start="704.43" data-end="716.17">And JSConf is one of the first events in tech which implemented and enforced a code of conduct,</span> <span data-start="716.17" data-end="727.67">provided childcare, built an anonymous Call for Speakers process that minimises bias,</span> <span data-start="727.67" data-end="732.17">and they really put an effort into maximising the participation from under-represented groups</span> <span data-start="732.17" data-end="735.22">in every single aspect of the event.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="735.22" data-end="742.92">So diversity and inclusion is one of the core values at JSConf, because anyone, no matter</span> <span data-start="742.92" data-end="751.08">their race, gender, age, socio-economic status, ability, should be able to safely participate</span> <span data-start="751.08" data-end="755.82">in the tech community, be treated equally, and be welcome.</span> <span data-start="755.82" data-end="757.22"Audience member: Applause to that!</span> <span data-start="757.22" data-end="758.22">[Applause].</span> <span data-start="758.22" data-end="759.22"Audience member: Wow!</span> <span data-start="759.22" data-end="760.22">I didn't do that.</span> <span data-start="760.22" data-end="761.22">I promise!</span> <span data-start="761.22" data-end="763.28">I just pressed a button.</span> <span data-start="763.28" data-end="765.14">We can keep going.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="765.14" data-end="767.01">We can just go.</span> <span data-start="767.01" data-end="768.41"Audience member: Let's keep going!</span> <span data-start="768.41" data-end="771.85">Imagine tweets, imagine excited tweets from people — picture tweets!</span> <span data-start="771.85" data-end="772.85">Okay, key can go.</span> <span data-start="772.85" data-end="773.85">We can go through this again.</span> <span data-start="773.85" data-end="775.85">Yes, we've talked about this.</span> <span data-start="775.85" data-end="777.75"Audience member: Recap of the recap!</span> <span data-start="777.75" data-end="779.65"Audience member: Been there, done that!</span> <span data-start="779.65" data-end="780.65">Yep, yep!</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="780.65" data-end="782.01">Previously on JSConf EU!</span> <span data-start="782.01" data-end="784.8"Audience member: It's the gifs that are breaking it, I swear.</span> <span data-start="784.8" data-end="785.8"Audience member: Success.</span> <span data-start="785.8" data-end="786.8">Getting back on track.</span> <span data-start="786.8" data-end="795.81">So one of the most exciting and great manifestations of that inclusion strategy is the scholarship</span> <span data-start="795.81" data-end="805.69">programme that's been run by JSConf EU JSConf and CSSConf as well.</span> <span data-start="805.69" data-end="810.5">This programme allows people who couldn't attend these events otherwise to attend for</span> <span data-start="810.5" data-end="811.5">free.</span> <span data-start="811.5" data-end="814.05">This programme has started friendships, careers, and built amazing connections.</span> <span data-start="814.05" data-end="820.94">One of the examples of that is Sun Li is the participant and now the organiser of the first</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="820.94" data-end="822.38">JSConf Korea!</span> <span data-start="822.38" data-end="823.38">[Applause].</span> <span data-start="823.38" data-end="1031.559">So it's just incredible to see the effect of this programme that it</span> <span data-start="1031.559" data-end="1092.12">can have</span> <span data-start="1092.12" data-end="1105.9">on somebody's life.</span> <span data-start="1105.9" data-end="1115.039"Audience member: So  we want to thank right now everyone who supported</span> <span data-start="1115.039" data-end="1119.23">this programme, both this year and in previous years.</span> <span data-start="1119.23" data-end="1123.299">People, like yourselves, contributing to this programme.</span> <span data-start="1123.299" data-end="1126.779">All the sponsors this year, every single one of them contributed to the programme.</span> <span data-start="1126.779" data-end="1131.71">We want especially to thank Google and Glitch who directly contributed to the programme,</span> <span data-start="1131.71" data-end="1137.49">and this programme has grown so significantly that, this year, there are 150 scholarships</span> <span data-start="1137.49" data-end="1141.61">given out for CSSconf and JSConf.</span> <span data-start="1141.61" data-end="1149.509">Congratulations on that!</span> <span data-start="1149.509" data-end="1156.609">[Applause].</span> <span data-start="1156.609" data-end="1164.11"Audience member: It's really important to address those of you who are here because of this programme.</span> </p>
