<p><span data-start="23.06" data-end="24.15">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="24.15" data-end="26.34">Thank you very much.</span> <span data-start="26.34" data-end="28.971">As I said, I didn't get much sleep because of course I</span> <span data-start="28.971" data-end="33.59">had to change the demo in the last moment to get stuff to</span> <span data-start="33.59" data-end="35.68">work.</span> <span data-start="35.68" data-end="37.53">So that's always fun.</span> <span data-start="37.53" data-end="46.3">And so I'm going to talk about AirPlay in node, and of course I would like</span> <span data-start="46.3" data-end="49.37">this to also work in the browser, so maybe it should just</span> <span data-start="49.37" data-end="54.21">say JavaScript, but this is a work in progress,</span> <span data-start="54.21" data-end="57.25">and I haven't figured out how to do multi-cast</span> <span data-start="57.25" data-end="62.16">in the browser yet, but we'll see what happens.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="62.16" data-end="65.22">My name is Thomas Watson.</span> <span data-start="65.22" data-end="68.26">You can talk to me on Twitter and github.</span> <span data-start="68.26" data-end="74.61">First, a history lesson.</span> <span data-start="74.61" data-end="76.39">So AirPlay.</span> <span data-start="76.39" data-end="81.509">There was a first generation of AirPlay, it was</span> <span data-start="81.509" data-end="85.03">in 2004, and it wasn't actually called AirPlay back then;</span> <span data-start="85.03" data-end="88.38">it was called Air Tunes.</span> <span data-start="88.38" data-end="94.09">And actually, Air Tunes is just a fancy marketing name for a protocol called</span> <span data-start="94.09" data-end="101.39">RAOP, which is remote audio output protocol .. I'm feeling</span> <span data-start="101.39" data-end="103.53">so sorry for the translators, because I'm kind</span> <span data-start="103.53" data-end="108.079">of using a lot of acronyms and protocol names and stuff,</span> <span data-start="108.079" data-end="111.13">but hopefully it is going to work out okay.</span> <span data-start="111.13" data-end="117.719">So RAOP or Air Tunes is a simple protocol for you have your</span> <span data-start="117.719" data-end="120.829">computers before the iPhone, so where like you had your</span> <span data-start="120.829" data-end="124.729">computer with iTunes running on it, you have your local</span> <span data-start="124.729" data-end="127.18">area network, and you have a RAOP server, which</span> <span data-start="127.18" data-end="131.76">is usually like a an airport express and you connect</span> <span data-start="131.76" data-end="135.55">a physical speaker to that with an audio cable, and then</span> <span data-start="135.55" data-end="137.67">you can stream music from your computer from iTunes</span> <span data-start="137.67" data-end="140.56">over to your speaker.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="140.56" data-end="150.51">RAOP then came a second generation in 2010, and it was called AirPlay, because a lot of</span> <span data-start="150.51" data-end="154.989">stuff happened between 2004 and 2010: you'd got</span> <span data-start="154.989" data-end="162.12">the iPhone, we got an Apple TV, so iTunes  —  so AirPlay is</span> <span data-start="162.12" data-end="168.5">basically an umbrella name for both iTunes, the Air Tunes</span> <span data-start="168.5" data-end="172.92">two, and the protocol called AirPlay, which is under</span> <span data-start="172.92" data-end="173.98">the umbrella name AirPlay.</span> <span data-start="173.98" data-end="176.65">So it is kind of confusing.</span> <span data-start="176.65" data-end="179.7">But Air Tunes two, which is a new version of Air Tunes</span> <span data-start="179.7" data-end="182.629">protocol or the RAOP protocol, is basically still RAOP,</span> <span data-start="182.629" data-end="188.5">just a little bit extended, and it works similarly.</span> <span data-start="188.5" data-end="192.909">Now it can also connect your iPhone to your local</span> <span data-start="192.909" data-end="194.87">area network and you have an AirPlay server and you can</span> <span data-start="194.87" data-end="199.26">stream all sorts of stuff to a TV, as well as a speaker.</span> <span data-start="199.26" data-end="203.58">So just to recap, RAOP, that's for audio, AirPlay</span> <span data-start="203.58" data-end="208.709">is for photos, video and screen mirroring.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="208.709" data-end="211.9">So how does this work?</span> <span data-start="211.9" data-end="215.04">How does these things figure out how to talk each other?</span> <span data-start="215.04" data-end="221.53">There is a service discover protocol, which is using Apples.</span> <span data-start="221.53" data-end="226.86">Bonjour protocol, basically just Apple's branding of something</span> <span data-start="226.86" data-end="230.879">called Zero Conf, and it is basically running on top of</span> <span data-start="230.879" data-end="233.621">multi-cast DNS, so if we run multi-cast DNS, which we</span> <span data-start="233.621" data-end="241.56">can, and no JNS, so we can get started.</span> <span data-start="241.56" data-end="245.53">Just a quick  —  so I'm going to show you how this will work when</span> <span data-start="245.53" data-end="248.989">you're using a RAOP, when you want to play music.</span> <span data-start="248.989" data-end="256.989">That was the stuff I was trying to get to work last night.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="256.989" data-end="261.03">So the phone will query, say: is there any AirPlay servers?</span> <span data-start="261.03" data-end="264.83">And an AirPlay server will say, "Hey, I'm here, and</span> <span data-start="264.83" data-end="267.5">I can support these things, and you can do screen</span> <span data-start="267.5" data-end="275.21">mirroring or whatever", and then the phone will be like:</span> <span data-start="275.21" data-end="279.75">"Cool, what  — " so if it is just concerned about</span> <span data-start="279.75" data-end="285.68">doing audio, it will send an RTSP options request, which</span> <span data-start="285.68" data-end="289.68">is basically a way for it to ask the server what kind of</span> <span data-start="289.68" data-end="296.49">RTSP it supports, and that's basically the protocol</span> <span data-start="296.49" data-end="297.639">that RAOP uses to communicate.</span> <span data-start="297.639" data-end="298.639">It resembles HTTP a lot.</span> <span data-start="298.639" data-end="304.539">It is exactly like it, except they change the first</span> <span data-start="304.539" data-end="309.05">line and then called it RTSP, it is a proper, so you</span> <span data-start="309.05" data-end="313.449">can read about it in a 100-page document if you feel</span> <span data-start="313.449" data-end="314.47">like it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="314.47" data-end="319.67">The problem is Apple added the thing to the write, yes?</span> <span data-start="319.67" data-end="324.96">They added encryption because "Oh no, we can't use this</span> <span data-start="324.96" data-end="332.52">protocol and not know who we're talking to", so this is</span> <span data-start="332.52" data-end="336.05">for a way for the phone to know: okay, am I actually</span> <span data-start="336.05" data-end="349.34">talking to an Apple device here?</span> <span data-start="349.34" data-end="354.539">This happened in 2011, somebody got the private key</span> <span data-start="354.539" data-end="361.88">of off an Apple TV, so that's nice.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="361.88" data-end="364.22">So now we can figure out what's going on.</span> <span data-start="364.22" data-end="367.849">This is setting a challenge encrypted using the port key, and we have</span> <span data-start="367.849" data-end="373.16">to decrypt it and then have to add to, and past that on</span> <span data-start="373.16" data-end="377.07">32 bit, and then we have to add the IP of the server and</span> <span data-start="377.07" data-end="380.35">the Mac address of the server, and encrypt that with</span> <span data-start="380.35" data-end="383.99">the private key, send it back to the phone, and the phone</span> <span data-start="383.99" data-end="387.06">is going to be like: "Cool, you're a proper Apple device.</span> <span data-start="387.06" data-end="390.36">I trust you."</span> <span data-start="390.36" data-end="394.879">And then it will send a request, basically saying:</span> <span data-start="394.879" data-end="398.15">I'm about to play something to you, and this is the</span> <span data-start="398.15" data-end="404.919">codec, and I'm using these bit rates", and stuff like</span> <span data-start="404.919" data-end="405.919">that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="405.919" data-end="408">And the server will be like: cool.</span> <span data-start="408" data-end="412.509">And it will be like: okay, I'm almost  —  I forgot what</span> <span data-start="412.509" data-end="417.699">it was sending here, but it was some extra information,</span> <span data-start="417.699" data-end="420.139">whatever.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="420.139" data-end="423.19">And then it's going to be like: "Okay, record."</span> <span data-start="423.19" data-end="427.389">Because it is kind of like this was something that was built, the RTSP protocol is from</span> <span data-start="427.389" data-end="431.599">the nineties, so it is thinking in terms of record and pause</span> <span data-start="431.599" data-end="436.8">and rewind, so it is going to send a record request,</span> <span data-start="436.8" data-end="438.52">and the server is going to be: cool.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="438.52" data-end="441.63">This is all over TCP.</span> <span data-start="441.63" data-end="445.199">And then everything is set up, oh yeah, the set-up</span> <span data-start="445.199" data-end="448.58">thing was to set up the ports, because now we're going</span> <span data-start="448.58" data-end="452.09">to switch to UDP, because it's going to be like you've</span> <span data-start="452.09" data-end="454.75">got to output a lot of high quality data, it is going</span> <span data-start="454.75" data-end="456.539">to be really fast.</span> <span data-start="456.539" data-end="459.729">So it is going to set up three different ports that it's going to listen to, that's</span> <span data-start="459.729" data-end="461.61">what the set-up request is for.</span> <span data-start="461.61" data-end="465.69">On the first port it will send raw audio packets using UDP.</span> <span data-start="465.69" data-end="470.72">On the second port it will send control packets to say: hey, we need</span> <span data-start="470.72" data-end="474.639">to do this or this, and the server can also send control</span> <span data-start="474.639" data-end="478.389">packets back to say, "Oh, I didn't get that piece of audio,</span> <span data-start="478.389" data-end="480.57">please resend it."</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="480.57" data-end="485.03">And it will also send a heartbeat every three seconds saying: hey, this is my time, so you</span> <span data-start="485.03" data-end="488.199">can sync multiple speakers in the room, and have them</span> <span data-start="488.199" data-end="492.77">play in sync.</span> <span data-start="492.77" data-end="495.68">Then you should have audio, right?</span> <span data-start="495.68" data-end="498.09">Not really.</span> <span data-start="498.09" data-end="500.82">Because of this, again, so of course they encrypted all</span> <span data-start="500.82" data-end="507.419">the video and they encrypted, it is really, really  —  I</span> <span data-start="507.419" data-end="511.379">can't say that word here  —  stupid.</span> <span data-start="511.379" data-end="519.2">And trust me, I spent a lot of time figuring out exactly what</span> <span data-start="519.2" data-end="522.361">should be  —  how to decrypt this audio, because it</span> <span data-start="522.361" data-end="524.52">is not encrypted normally, but still using the same</span> <span data-start="524.52" data-end="527.55">key, but you have to decrypt it in 16 byte segments,</span> <span data-start="527.55" data-end="534.16">and not the last, and then you have audio.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="534.16" data-end="538.1">Not quite, because well, you have audio, but it is in ALAC, because</span> <span data-start="538.1" data-end="542.64">if you have a modern phone or new version of iTunes it</span> <span data-start="542.64" data-end="547.07">will send it in ALAC, which is Apple looseless(?) and they</span> <span data-start="547.07" data-end="551.709">sourced that in 2011, so that is cool, but it is usually</span> <span data-start="551.709" data-end="553.61">the player is used to having it in a container</span> <span data-start="553.61" data-end="554.61">format.</span> <span data-start="554.61" data-end="556.45">So M-peg or something, and this is without the</span> <span data-start="556.45" data-end="559.95">container format, so this is why we sent the request</span> <span data-start="559.95" data-end="560.95">previously.</span> <span data-start="560.95" data-end="566.47">It will tell us: hey, this is like the bit rate and all</span> <span data-start="566.47" data-end="569.14">the stuff, and there's a magic cookie you need to set.</span> <span data-start="569.14" data-end="571.779">It is really weird.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="571.779" data-end="577.18">You can't just play this normally; you have to figure out a way to interpret</span> <span data-start="577.18" data-end="579.46">this ALAC data.</span> <span data-start="579.46" data-end="586.5">That was a lot of theory.</span> <span data-start="586.5" data-end="592.87">But basically RAOP uses the RAOP client, and server uses four</span> <span data-start="592.87" data-end="599.99">different ports some for UDP, some for HTTP RSP, and</span> <span data-start="599.99" data-end="602.56">they kind of follow the standards, all of these are backed</span> <span data-start="602.56" data-end="606.17">by RFCs but of course Apple changed the last two a</span> <span data-start="606.17" data-end="610.529">bit, so they are not really the follow the RFC, and AirPlay</span> <span data-start="610.529" data-end="615.75">is way easier is AirPlay over port 7,000 using HTTP.</span> <span data-start="615.75" data-end="617.42">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="617.42" data-end="621.87">And then NTP for screen sharing and syncing the</span> <span data-start="621.87" data-end="626.56">sound and video.</span> <span data-start="626.56" data-end="628.25">And a lot of stuff about protocols.</span> <span data-start="628.25" data-end="632.67">I thought I'm going to do this, and it's going to be easy.</span> <span data-start="632.67" data-end="633.94">And I'm like: woah.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="633.94" data-end="638.76">All of these have an RFC behind them, and I've been really good at reading RFCs.</span> <span data-start="638.76" data-end="641.71">Really good.</span> <span data-start="641.71" data-end="643.399">And these are just like the tip of the iceberg, all the</span> <span data-start="643.399" data-end="646.05">audio codec stuff is not here, and video codec stuff is</span> <span data-start="646.05" data-end="651.23">not here, so luckily I was not the first one to do this.</span> <span data-start="651.23" data-end="653.76">Somebody else already reverse engineered the protocol</span> <span data-start="653.76" data-end="657.76">back in 2011, thank you.</span> <span data-start="657.76" data-end="661.79">But play have changed it a lot since, so I need to buy this router, I can</span> <span data-start="661.79" data-end="666.31">do a man in the middle attack, and on the Apple TV and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="666.31" data-end="670.12">I use wire shock to listen to the packages and stuff.</span> <span data-start="670.12" data-end="672.79">It is fun.</span> <span data-start="672.79" data-end="673.94">So getting to the code.</span> <span data-start="673.94" data-end="674.94">Npm.</span> <span data-start="674.94" data-end="676.18">I like npm, it is amazing.</span> <span data-start="676.18" data-end="679.579">I love npm.</span> <span data-start="679.579" data-end="685.73">All of this effort I've put into doing this have resulted in a lot of small</span> <span data-start="685.73" data-end="688.61">modules that can be mixed and matched, because I don't</span> <span data-start="688.61" data-end="692.21">just want to play or create like an AirPlay server that</span> <span data-start="692.21" data-end="696.2">you npm install AirPlay, and then just like have this</span> <span data-start="696.2" data-end="698.959">magic box and everything works inside it.</span> </p>
