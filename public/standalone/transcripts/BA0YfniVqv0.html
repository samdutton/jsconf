<p><span data-start="332.51" data-end="336.89">There was also this coloring book thing where you had paint brushes and you could paint</span> <span data-start="336.89" data-end="339.97">the colors and it all filled it in with light.</span> <span data-start="339.97" data-end="342.91">There were giant touch pen tables.</span> <span data-start="342.91" data-end="348.08">You know, like those things you put your face into and all the little metal pins.</span> <span data-start="348.08" data-end="353.69">It sounds gross when you think about all the people touching it but it was really cool.</span> <span data-start="353.69" data-end="362.57">It was really fun and encouraged you to, like, do things with technology but creatively.</span> <span data-start="362.57" data-end="366.659">Inside the imagination pavilion was a dark ride which is what the rides in Disney that</span> <span data-start="366.659" data-end="368.25">are in the dark are called.</span> <span data-start="368.25" data-end="369.63">Who would have thought?</span> <span data-start="369.63" data-end="374.65">It was called journey into imagination and the inspiration for this talk is where I got</span> <span data-start="374.65" data-end="375.82">the name from.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="375.82" data-end="383.36">This one lasted from 1983-1999 and in the ride the dream finder introduces himself and</span> <span data-start="383.36" data-end="389.57">says he uses the dream mobile to collect dreams and ideas to create all sorts of new things.</span> <span data-start="389.57" data-end="394.52">So then he creates a figment of his imagination and I wanted to show you some footage from</span> <span data-start="394.52" data-end="399.909">that ride I found from 1996 so you can experience the same thing I got to as a child because</span> <span data-start="399.909" data-end="405.64">this ride has had two other iterations after it and they are bad.</span> <span data-start="405.64" data-end="407.32">They are really bad.</span> <span data-start="407.32" data-end="409.68">So enjoy this video.</span> <span data-start="409.68" data-end="453.75">It is two minutes and 30 seconds.</span> <span data-start="453.75" data-end="518.68">Here we go.</span> <span data-start="518.68" data-end="563.9">[Playing video] >> So one thing this video also shows is that</span> <span data-start="563.9" data-end="569.4">people have been taking bad videos since before cellphones could except was really big and</span> <span data-start="569.4" data-end="570.58">on our shoulder.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="570.58" data-end="576.46">THAFRT part  —  after that part of the ride, you go through and explore a bunch of creative</span> <span data-start="576.46" data-end="582.52">applications and they talk about science and how scientists and astronauts and using your</span> <span data-start="582.52" data-end="588.84">creativity you can be whatever you want and how creativeness can apply to anything.</span> <span data-start="588.84" data-end="590.84">It doesn't just have to be the arts.</span> <span data-start="590.84" data-end="593.89">I was like that is awesome.</span> <span data-start="593.89" data-end="596.95">The experiences I had as a kid with the imagination pavilion.</span> <span data-start="596.95" data-end="599.46">There is me with their dream finder and figment.</span> <span data-start="599.46" data-end="601.52">I am sure it isn't the same one.</span> <span data-start="601.52" data-end="605.89">They look a little different.</span> <span data-start="605.89" data-end="613.28">That led me to do a lot of research on the things I loved about the park.</span> <span data-start="613.28" data-end="616.77">So the blend of the education and the creative learning.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="616.77" data-end="620.47">I wanted to know more about how they did it.</span> <span data-start="620.47" data-end="628.7">I started reading more about the imagineers and I found this quote from Disney.</span> <span data-start="628.7" data-end="646.17">We are always exploring and experimenting and call it Imagineering.</span> <span data-start="646.17" data-end="655.01">Imagineers are responsible for building Disney theme parks, resorts and cruise ships.</span> <span data-start="655.01" data-end="662.46">They do the rides but they also do the interior of the restaurants to the menu design.</span> <span data-start="662.46" data-end="663.51">It is everything.</span> <span data-start="663.51" data-end="664.8">Everyone is an imagineer.</span> <span data-start="664.8" data-end="675.62">There is over 140 job titles including architectures, engineers, show writers, graphic designers.</span> <span data-start="675.62" data-end="682.32">All these multi-disciplinary people are using the same principles for when they create.</span> </p>
