so basically the work we do</span> <span data-start="21.43" data-end="26.38">at Twitter visualizing data so i work at</span> <span data-start="26.38" data-end="28.179">twitter on the visual insights team it's</span> <span data-start="28.179" data-end="29.289">a small team that does data</span> <span data-start="29.289" data-end="31.75">visualizations and I lead the</span> <span data-start="31.75" data-end="34.09">interactive the twitter com project it's</span> <span data-start="34.09" data-end="35.86">a web page that has public facing data</span> <span data-start="35.86"

data-start="57.97" data-end="59.86">leverage the cool things about the</span> <span data-start="59.86" data-end="62.08">platform right so the platform has I'd</span> <span data-start="62.08" data-end="64.059">say like three kind of main features</span> <span data-start="64.059" data-end="66.1">were global we've been called the pulse</span> <span data-start="66.1" data-end="67.99">of the planet many times you probably</span> <span data-start="67.99" data-end="69.46">have seen data visualizations of like</span> <span data-start="69.46" data-end="71.619">when people you know wake up and go to</span> <span data-start="71.619" data-end="73.329">sleep and how that correlates with the</span> <span data-start="73.329" data-end="74.74">number of tweets they make and stuff</span> <span data-start="74.74" data-end="76.689">like that so we are really the post of</span> <span data-start="76.689" data-end="78.07">your planet also the fact that we're</span> <span data-start="78.07" data-end="80.71">real time and that's like a pretty big</span> <span data-start="80.71" data-end="82.539">challenge for data visualization having</span> <span data-start="82.539" data-end="85.06">like a real-time platform and finally</span> <span data-start="85.06" data-end="87.07">conversational right so you have you</span> <span data-start="87.07" data-end="88.57">know within the text of a tweet

data-end="99.939">recognition topic analysis sentiment</span> <span data-start="99.939" data-end="102.49">analysis on off stuff so there's a lot</span> <span data-start="102.49" data-end="104.35">of

verticals and the</span> <span data-start="111.609" data-end="113.649">verticals we have depend on kind of like</span> <span data-start="113.649" data-end="115.899">the audience we have so we can really</span> <span data-start="115.899" data-end="117.609">find those verticals as well but when we</span> <span data-start="117.609" data-end="119.259">plan on doing data visualizations we</span> <span data-start="119.259" data-end="123.49">have government news sports TV and music</span> <span data-start="123.49" data-end="125.979">and kind of those verticals determine</span> <span data-start="125.979" data-end="128.14">how you're going to be thinking about</span> <span data-start="128.14" data-end="130.09">doing the visualization and the main</span> <span data-start="130.09" data-end="132.7">idea is like what is the tone of the</span> <span data-start="132.7" data-end="134.28">visualization are going to be working on</span> <span data-start="134.28" data-end="137.56">do I

data-start="256.63" data-end="258.91">go click there and so this takes me</span> <span data-start="258.91" data-end="262.45">exactly to the time to what the</span> <span data-start="262.45" data-end="263.979">president was saying when these tweets</span> <span data-start="263.979" data-end="267.01">occurred so on the right one we have is</span> <span data-start="267.01" data-end="268.78">kind of like something that leverages a</span> <span data-start="268.78" data-end="270.669">bit more the real-time aspect of the</span> <span data-start="270.669"

data-end="296.99">government type of data visualisations</span> <span data-start="296.99" data-end="302.78">is always try to try to enhance whatever</span> <span data-start="302.78" data-end="306.05">document we have and so how we did this</span> <span data-start="306.05" data-end="309.289">is a very iterative process with a lot</span> <span data-start="309.289" data-end="311.659">of feedback and you know looking as much</span> <span data-start="311.659" data-end="313.849">as you can the first the first iteration</span> <span data-start="313.849" data-end="315.979">was this we didn't know we were going to</span> <span data-start="315.979" data-end="318.139">have the transcript before the speech</span> <span data-start="318.139" data-end="320.09">because we annotated every paragraph</span> <span data-start="320.09" data-end="323">with the timestamp of like you know when</span> <span data-start="323" data-end="325.219">did he start saying this till the end of</span> <span data-start="325.219" data-end="326.69">that paragraph and then grabbed tweets</span> <span data-start="326.69" data-end="328.58">and did that topic analysis for that</span> <span data-start="328.58" data-end="330.53">specific paragraph so in order to do</span> <span data-start="330.53" data-end="331.909">that you need to have the transcript</span> <span data-start="331.909" data-end="334.55">before the president actually says</span> <span data-start="334.55" data-end="336.53">anything before the actual speech and</span> <span data-start="336.53" data-end="338.9">that's props to the media team for</span> <span data-start="338.9" data-end="342.56">having that so what we did is the first</span> <span data-start="342.56" data-end="344.21">approach just have like you know every</span> <span data-start="344.21" data-end="346.19">row is a minute every column is a</span> <span data-start="346.19" data-end="347.87">different state in the United States and</span> <span data-start="347.87" data-end="349.4">then we'll just have like volume of</span> <span data-start="349.4" data-end="353">tweets and this was horrible like I show</span> <span data-start="353" data-end="355.009">this to a team I was like I I mean</span> <span data-start="355.009" data-end="357.86">there's nothing interesting

<span data-start="361.759" data-end="363.469">planning on just putting some quotes on</span> <span data-start="363.469" data-end="364.819">the right that the president mentioned</span> <span data-start="364.819" data-end="367.31">during that minute and then at the</span> <span data-start="367.31" data-end="368.93">bottom instead of having like a topic</span> <span data-start="368.93" data-end="371.18">analysis we were just using a word</span> <span data-start="371.18" data-end="373.43">frequency count so for example we're</span> <span data-start="373.43" data-end="374.779">just like kind of the frequency of the</span> <span data-start="374.779" data-end="376.34">words in the tweets for that minute so</span> <span data-start="376.34" data-end="378.44">in this case is you know it's the third</span> <span data-start="378.44" data-end="380.84">minute within the speech and the words</span> <span data-start="380.84" data-end="382.669">you can see are like Obama president</span>

<p><span data-start="673.54" data-end="682.899">Europe and so on so for this it is we</span> <span data-start="682.899" data-end="685.51">start with like any query rectangular</span> <span data-start="685.51" data-end="687.97">projection of a map and then we do a</span> <span data-start="687.97" data-end="689.47">small thing which is just Center it on</span> <span data-start="689.47" data-end="691.269">the Philippines which is a small thing</span> <span data-start="691.269" data-end="693.19">but I think that it's like an important</span> <span data-start="693.19" data-end="695.16">thing because it puts that in the middle</span> <span data-start="695.16" data-end="697.66">then we just roll a straight line from</span> <span data-start="697.66" data-end="699.279">each one of those locations to the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="699.279" data-end="701.079">Center of the Philippines and then we</span> <span data-start="701.079" data-end="703.329">run this algorithm which is called</span> <span data-start="703.329" data-end="705.519">multi-level agglomerative edge bundling</span> <span data-start="705.519" data-end="711.399">for large graphs mingle and then we</span> <span data-start="711.399" data-end="713.17">color-coded each one of those clusters</span> <span data-start="713.17" data-end="715.66">with a categorical color palette so we</span> <span data-start="715.66" data-end="718.149">we can easily identify all the clusters</span> <span data-start="718.149" data-end="719.98">so up to hear that algorithm is really</span> <span data-start="719.98" data-end="724.209">awesome it works really fast and it's</span> <span data-start="724.209" data-end="726.97">it's it has a very clever algorithm the</span> <span data-start="726.97" data-end="728.56">only thing is that when you bundle all</span> <span data-start="728.56" data-end="730.57">these edges together into one group the</span> <span data-start="730.57" data-end="732.73">resulting edge is also one pixel width</span> <span data-start="732.73" data-end="735.699">width which is not you know this the</span> <span data-start="735.699" data-end="737.829">thing you'd like because it means that</span> <span data-start="737.829" data-end="739.57">it doesn't really take into account the</span> <span data-start="739.57" data-end="742.87">the weight of each bundle so we extended</span> <span data-start="742.87" data-end="747.699">this algorithm so that I would would it</span> <span data-start="747.699" data-end="749.29">would take into account bundle weight</span> <span data-start="749.29" data-end="751.089">and it would take into account like</span> <span data-start="751.089" data-end="754.18">direct directed edges and we open</span> <span data-start="754.18" data-end="758.14">sourced this we have a great open source</span> <span data-start="758.14" data-end="759.85">team that always want us to open source</span> <span data-start="759.85" data-end="762.01">as much as possible so that was actually</span> <span data-start="762.01" data-end="765.339">pretty easy to do so we have kind of</span> <span data-start="765.339" data-end="767.709">like a kitchen sink for that here this</span> <span data-start="767.709" data-end="769.06">is the example you can choose the number</span> <span data-start="769.06" data-end="771.55">of neighbors to cluster so this means</span> <span data-start="771.55" data-end="775.39">that you know this will if you put more</span> <span data-start="775.39" data-end="777.25">neighbors there will be less clusters</span> <span data-start="777.25" data-end="780.339">were with more edges basically and what</span> <span data-start="780.339" data-end="781.99">you can interpolate here is between the</span> <span data-start="781.99" data-end="784.12">initial state of straight lines to the</span> <span data-start="784.12" data-end="786.49">bundle edges you can play a bit with the</span> <span data-start="786.49" data-end="788.949">margin which is the stuff we added to to</span> <span data-start="788.949" data-end="790.209">have this kind of like bundle weight</span> <span data-start="790.209" data-end="793.54">being taken care of you can color by</span> <span data-start="793.54" data-end="795.61">cluster as i showed before or you can</span> <span data-start="795.61" data-end="799.149">call x direction so in this case edges</span> <span data-start="799.149" data-end="800.38">that start from a bloop</span> <span data-start="800.38" data-end="802.39">point to a red point are like the</span> <span data-start="802.39" data-end="804.64">direction the direction is encoded in</span> <span data-start="804.64" data-end="808">that so here it's not very easy to see</span> <span data-start="808" data-end="811.24">how many edges are going from one place</span> <span data-start="811.24" data-end="814.42">to the other and vice versa so what we</span> <span data-start="814.42" data-end="816.87">did also is we extended the algorithm to</span> <span data-start="816.87" data-end="819.22">sort a bit the edges when you're</span> <span data-start="819.22" data-end="821.14">creating the bundles to group the edges</span> <span data-start="821.14" data-end="822.43">going from one direction to the other</span> <span data-start="822.43" data-end="825.43">and so now it's a bit easier to see that</span> <span data-start="825.43" data-end="826.93">about half of the edges are going from</span> <span data-start="826.93" data-end="835.72">one place to the other and so on yeah so</span> <span data-start="835.72" data-end="840.22">on sports the audience for sport is like</span> <span data-start="840.22" data-end="842.35">pretty geeky right it's like they always</span> <span data-start="842.35" data-end="844.87">like to know the exact stats and goals</span> <span data-start="844.87" data-end="847.33">and like yellow cards and so on so we</span> <span data-start="847.33" data-end="848.56">had a lot of fun during the World Cup</span> <span data-start="848.56" data-end="851.89">with this this this interactive</span> <span data-start="851.89" data-end="856.87">visualization that was built what by one</span> <span data-start="856.87" data-end="861.55">of the people in our team cryst it's</span> <span data-start="861.55" data-end="863.14">pretty amazing because it's an</span> <span
