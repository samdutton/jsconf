<span data-start="1668.29" data-end="1672.06">is that you can stretch and scale</span> <span data-start="1672.06" data-end="1674.29">without having to touch all the</span> <span data-start="1674.29"

data-end="1749.81">complicated but basically there's no</span> <span data-start="1749.81" data-end="1752.63">units on it and what that means is that</span> <span data-start="1752.63"

data-end="2521.85">building applications it's really hard</span> <span data-start="2521.85" data-end="2525.48">to do that so you have to consider your</span> <span data-start="2525.48" data-end="2527.97">audience and decide whether SVG is a</span> <span data-start="2527.97" data-end="2530.94">appropriate solution today even if it</span> <span data-start="2530.94" data-end="2532.32">isn't I think it makes sense to look at</span> <span data-start="2532.32" data-end="2534.6">it because in a couple of years everyone</span> <span data-start="2534.6"

I think right now</span> <span data-start="2625.8" data-end="2628.44">it's a very flexible very fluid kind of</span> <span data-start="2628.44" data-end="2630.54">scenario so everyone's just testing it</span> <span data-start="2630.54" data-end="2634.47">out happy to talk more about it as I get</span> <span data-start="2634.47" data-end="2639.21">more experience with it myself hi just</span> <span data-start="2639.21" data-end="2641.6">ask another question about html5 canvas</span> <span data-start="2641.6" data-end="2644.58">so these are most motor thing to talk</span> <span
