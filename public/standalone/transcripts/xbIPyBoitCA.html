data-end="236.62">what happens that once they developed a</span> <span data-start="236.62" data-end="238.84">system they started to tweak the</span> <span data-start="238.84"

data-end="250.51">and so on and who ended up getting</span> <span data-start="250.51" data-end="253.18">invited then they tweaked the program to</span> <span data-start="253.18" data-end="255.579">basically exactly replicate the results</span> <span data-start="255.579" data-end="258.93">they got in the previous yes so then</span> <span data-start="258.93" data-end="263.32">between 1982 and 1996 they use the</span> <span data-start="263.32" data-end="265.87">program to help them in that with the</span> <span data-start="265.87"

because it was</span> <span data-start="305.86" data-end="308.199">made by people who had themselves and</span> <span data-start="308.199" data-end="310.449">examined prejudices they ended up</span> <span data-start="310.449" data-end="311.979">creating it so that the software</span> <span data-start="311.979" data-end="314.38">replicated in a seemingly objective</span> <span data-start="314.38" data-end="318.37">manner now it would be very unfair of me</span> <span data-start="318.37" data-end="320.41">to suggest that this was done</span> <span data-start="320.41" data-end="322.99">deliberately because at the time some</span> <span data-start="322.99" data-end="326.139">george's medical school was the most</span> <span data-start="326.139" data-end="328.6">diverse college in entire England and</span> <span data-start="328.6" data-end="331.389">and therefore I think what happened</span> <span data-start="331.389" data-end="334.3">there is that people who didn't</span> <span data-start="334.3" data-end="337.03">necessarily think about their own biases</span> <span data-start="337.03" data-end="342.85">ended up replicating them um I think</span> <span data-start="342.85" data-end="344.919">it's also really interesting that in</span> <span data-start="344.919" data-end="347.77">this case this was only uncovered after</span> <span data-start="347.77" data-end="351.1">a self human was removed from the</span> <span data-start="351.1" data-end="353.11">process so once software took over it</span> <span data-start="353.11" data-end="355.479">was okay for people to complain about</span> <span data-start="355.479" data-end="358.18">its biases and bring them to light but</span> <span data-start="358.18" data-end="360.039">when it was your colleagues doing it</span> <span data-start="360.039" data-end="361.69">perhaps it was a little bit more</span> <span data-start="361.69" data-end="365.41">difficult so I think some projects end</span> <span data-start="365.41" data-end="369.55">up some expressing values of people even</span> <span data-start="369.55"
