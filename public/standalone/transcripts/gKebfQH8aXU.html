testing straight</span> <span data-start="1199.75" data-end="1202.96">ahead and what is interesting about</span> <span data-start="1202.96" data-end="1206.8">cracking is that we moved the logic away</span> <span data-start="1206.8" data-end="1209.92">from our initial in the x-ray ass or fjs</span> <span data-start="1209.92" data-end="1213.01">file into the different controllers so</span> <span data-start="1213.01" data-end="1215.11">controllers handle routing and a lot of</span> <span data-start="1215.11" data-end="1217.18">other stuff and this is something that</span> <span data-start="1217.18" data-end="1219.19">you can actually see it's now also</span> <span data-start="1219.19" data-end="1222.19">present in Xpress 4 so Express free</span> <span data-start="1222.19" data-end="1224.38">initially didn't have that and they</span> <span data-start="1224.38" data-end="1226.57">actually moved it over into Express 4 as</span> <span data-start="1226.57" data-end="1228.37">well because they realized it helps to</span> <span data-start="1228.37" data-end="1231.43">have much cleaner fights and way more</span> <span data-start="1231.43" data-end="1236.37">structure and I think the best for</span> <span data-start="1236.37" data-end="1238.39">modules and there is a whole lot of</span> <span data-start="1238.39" data-end="1240.03">different modules that come with it a</span> <span data-start="1240.03" data-end="1244.62">mcaren lisca Adaro and CAPA Makara is</span> <span data-start="1244.62" data-end="1246.87">used to do internationalization</span> <span data-start="1246.87" data-end="1249.04">localization or specialization in your</span> <span data-start="1249.04" data-end="1249.34">apps</span> <span data-start="1249.34" data-end="1252.73">lioska is coming with a lot of sensible</span> <span data-start="1252.73" data-end="1256.27">security defaults Adaro is used to bring</span> <span data-start="1256.27" data-end="1258.64">the Strayer support and CAPA is our NPM</span> <span data-start="1258.64" data-end="1262.09">proxy now if you want to do localization</span> <span data-start="1262.09" data-end="1264.04">it's actually quite easy we use key</span> <span data-start="1264.04" data-end="1266.26">value files for that it's not Jason it's</span> <span data-start="1266.26" data-end="1269.44">our own kind of format with property</span> <span data-start="1269.44" data-end="1272.26">files and you just load up lots of</span> <span data-start="1272.26" data-end="1274.51">different content bundles and you can do</span> <span data-start="1274.51" data-end="1276.78">that on the fly or you can obviously use</span> <span data-start="1276.78" data-end="1279.61">gratin to do that for you but you don't</span> <span data-start="1279.61" data-end="1281.5">have to use Kraken to use all of these</span> <span data-start="1281.5" data-end="1283.93">modules so what we do is we have a</span> <span data-start="1283.93" data-end="1286.27">provider that just loads for various</span> <span data-start="1286.27" data-end="1288.87">locates and it basically provides those</span> <span data-start="1288.87" data-end="1291.25">different values for you which is kind</span> <span data-start="1291.25" data-end="1294.28">of good and the property files are not</span> <span data-start="1294.28" data-end="1296.14">really complex as I said it's not JSON</span> <span data-start="1296.14" data-end="1298.66">syntax but it allows for some structures</span> <span data-start="1298.66" data-end="1300.91">where you can bring arrays in there you</span> <span data-start="1300.91" data-end="1304.21">can define multiple values it's actually</span> <span data-start="1304.21" data-end="1306.97">kind of useful for us you don't have to</span> <span data-start="1306.97" data-end="1308.38">use this format</span> <span data-start="1308.38" data-end="1310.15">but I think it's actually pretty good</span> <span data-start="1310.15" data-end="1311.53">since it also supports some more</span> <span data-start="1311.53" data-end="1315.58">structure like subkeys now if you want</span> <span data-start="1315.58" data-end="1317.71">to use this it actually heavily taps</span> <span data-start="1317.71" data-end="1321.1">into dust so one of the good things</span> <span data-start="1321.1" data-end="1324.64">about it is if you switch be located it</span> <span data-start="1324.64" data-end="1327.88">automatically changes changes we locate</span> <span data-start="1327.88" data-end="1330.01">for you and be templates as well by</span> <span data-start="1330.01" data-end="1332.68">leveraging the folder structure so</span> <span data-start="1332.68" data-end="1334.93">different keys in different languages</span> <span data-start="1334.93" data-end="1337.6">get visible for you which is very handy</span> <span data-start="1337.6" data-end="1340.06">and you can see that down below with the</span> <span data-start="1340.06" data-end="1342.64">head attack so it basically just loads</span> <span data-start="1342.64" data-end="1345.58">up the index start quitting and index is</span> <span data-start="1345.58" data-end="1349.24">my controller so my localization is</span> <span data-start="1349.24" data-end="1351.34">bound to my controller and it just</span> <span data-start="1351.34" data-end="1353.26">basically loads in a file for me which</span> <span data-start="1353.26" data-end="1357.64">is really handy for us and if I want to</span> <span data-start="1357.64" data-end="1358.42">use Adaro</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1358.42" data-end="1360.61">I basically just defined dust as my view</span> <span data-start="1360.61" data-end="1363.58">engine for express obviously I can still</span> <span data-start="1363.58" data-end="1365.86">as I said before use any other view</span> <span data-start="1365.86" data-end="1370.08">engine it's just dust for us because a</span> <span data-start="1370.08" data-end="1372.49">lot of new engines try to have a lot of</span> <span data-start="1372.49" data-end="1375.61">logic in their files and they try to do</span> <span data-start="1375.61" data-end="1377.5">a lot of processing for you and</span> <span data-start="1377.5" data-end="1379.75">calculations and that stuff and we tend</span> <span data-start="1379.75" data-end="1382.33">to move that rather into our controller</span> <span data-start="1382.33" data-end="1386.32">logic so you basically have a layout and</span> <span data-start="1386.32" data-end="1388.45">you provide your palettes into it and</span> <span data-start="1388.45" data-end="1390.37">what happens is it fades up the content</span> <span data-start="1390.37" data-end="1393.06">so nothing new nothing magic in there</span> <span data-start="1393.06" data-end="1395.71">dust comes with some cool stuff like</span> <span data-start="1395.71" data-end="1397.75">sections and you can provide your view</span> <span data-start="1397.75" data-end="1400.72">context into that so different models</span> <span data-start="1400.72" data-end="1404.44">can be just rendered directly and it</span> <span data-start="1404.44" data-end="1407.5">also comes with conditionals so not too</span> <span data-start="1407.5" data-end="1410.29">much logic because it's just saying if a</span> <span data-start="1410.29" data-end="1412.15">certain content is there show it or</span> <span data-start="1412.15" data-end="1414.85">don't show it so it doesn't really try</span> <span data-start="1414.85" data-end="1419.17">to be dead smart now security is</span> <span data-start="1419.17" data-end="1420.4">something that I think is kind of</span> <span data-start="1420.4" data-end="1420.94">interesting</span> <span data-start="1420.94" data-end="1424.06">lots of frameworks come with security</span> <span data-start="1424.06" data-end="1426.28">measurements and lots of kind of ways to</span> <span data-start="1426.28" data-end="1429.43">make your app secure and harden it but</span> <span data-start="1429.43" data-end="1431.26">lots of those frameworks also don't come</span> <span data-start="1431.26" data-end="1433.03">with sensible defaults so they just</span> <span data-start="1433.03" data-end="1434.89">assume you do the configuration and</span> <span data-start="1434.89" data-end="1437.02">quite often developers tend to not do</span> <span data-start="1437.02" data-end="1440.92">that so one of the biggest features we</span> <span data-start="1440.92" data-end="1442.09">support is</span> <span data-start="1442.09" data-end="1444.25">prevention of cross cross-site request</span> <span data-start="1444.25" data-end="1448.149">forgery see Cerf and it basically says</span> <span data-start="1448.149" data-end="1450.039">if you want to manipulate my data with</span> <span data-start="1450.039" data-end="1453.61">post requests put or delete you have to</span> <span data-start="1453.61" data-end="1455.649">provide a token to make sure that it's</span> <span data-start="1455.649" data-end="1457.259">really the app and not somebody else</span> <span data-start="1457.259" data-end="1459.94">click tracking which basically means I'm</span> <span data-start="1459.94" data-end="1462.37">framing your website in another website</span> <span data-start="1462.37" data-end="1465.429">can be prevented by setting up the</span> <span data-start="1465.429" data-end="1469.12">same-origin header it comes with output</span> <span data-start="1469.12" data-end="1472.12">escaping against cross-site scripting</span> <span data-start="1472.12" data-end="1474.629">and content security policy supports and</span> <span data-start="1474.629" data-end="1477.61">if you've attended last year's J's comp</span> <span data-start="1477.61" data-end="1479.11">you might have seen my quest talking</span> <span data-start="1479.11" data-end="1481.24">about content security policy it's</span> <span data-start="1481.24" data-end="1484.389">really awesome stuff configuration</span> <span data-start="1484.389" data-end="1487.539">happens via JSON so you basically just</span> <span data-start="1487.539" data-end="1489.759">say I want that feature I don't want to</span> <span data-start="1489.759" data-end="1492.21">have that feature this is my setting or</span> <span data-start="1492.21" data-end="1494.679">you can just go through the method calls</span> <span data-start="1494.679" data-end="1496.96">one by one so you don't have to use all</span> <span data-start="1496.96" data-end="1499.409">those kind of things</span> <span data-start="1499.409" data-end="1503.11">now I already mentioned you have to</span> <span data-start="1503.11" data-end="1505.21">provide a token and it's basically just</span> <span data-start="1505.21" data-end="1507.279">a hidden input fields that you provide</span> <span data-start="1507.279" data-end="1509.74">over to the app and then it plays a key</span> <span data-start="1509.74" data-end="1513.389">validation or at manipulating me data</span> <span data-start="1513.389" data-end="1517.299">the NPM proxy Kappa is very easy to</span> <span data-start="1517.299" data-end="1519.37">install you can go for that globally or</span> <span data-start="1519.37" data-end="1522.309">locally and that's basically what we use</span> <span data-start="1522.309" data-end="1523.899">to distribute our different services</span> <span data-start="1523.899" data-end="1526.029">like the key store database access</span> <span data-start="1526.029" data-end="1529.21">logging monitoring and it's based on</span> <span data-start="1529.21" data-end="1531.779">another module currently to NPM delegate</span> <span data-start="1531.779" data-end="1534.039">and if you look at the configuration</span> <span data-start="1534.039" data-end="1536.44">it's really just a folder so I got</span> <span data-start="1536.44" data-end="1538.57">called config and in that folder you</span> <span data-start="1538.57" data-end="1540.879">have a bunch of different files and you</span> <span data-start="1540.879" data-end="1543.58">can set up various environments so you</span> <span data-start="1543.58" data-end="1545.59">can say this is my staging config this</span> <span data-start="1545.59" data-end="1547.6">is my development this is my test</span> <span data-start="1547.6" data-end="1550.48">environment and it's pretty much easy to</span> <span data-start="1550.48" data-end="1554.2">set up in this case you see the view</span> <span data-start="1554.2" data-end="1556.21">engines and you can obviously do that</span> <span data-start="1556.21" data-end="1557.71">for all the kind of different settings</span> <span data-start="1557.71" data-end="1560.86">for cotton now if you want to set up</span> <span data-start="1560.86" data-end="1564.009">cracking with let's say passports you</span> <span data-start="1564.009" data-end="1566.919">could go and really just configure it by</span> <span data-start="1566.919" data-end="1570.309">providing some options to it and this is</span> <span data-start="1570.309" data-end="1572.289">just the index.js file that you would</span> <span data-start="1572.289" data-end="1575.68">use for that and now we</span> <span data-start="1575.68" data-end="1577.63">nice thing is about that you don't need</span> <span data-start="1577.63" data-end="1580.24">to miss mess around if you lifecycle you</span> <span data-start="1580.24" data-end="1582.43">don't need to figure out when is my</span> <span data-start="1582.43" data-end="1585.34">module being loaded and why you just tap</span> <span data-start="1585.34" data-end="1587.5">into different events like in this case</span> <span data-start="1587.5" data-end="1590.2">middleware so after my session is low</span> <span data-start="1590.2" data-end="1591.94">that I make sure that my I can use my</span> <span data-start="1591.94" data-end="1594.85">passport local strategy I just make sure</span> <span data-start="1594.85" data-end="1596.47">that the user is nicely serialized</span> <span data-start="1596.47" data-end="1600.07">deserialized and that's it so it</span> <span data-start="1600.07" data-end="1602.17">provides a very very clean way to make</span> <span data-start="1602.17" data-end="1604.63">sure that my projects are nicely and</span> <span data-start="1604.63" data-end="1608.58">visible so I think it helps a lot and</span> <span data-start="1608.58" data-end="1610.99">since we wanted to make sure that people</span> <span data-start="1610.99" data-end="1613.12">don't have to set up this stuff manually</span> <span data-start="1613.12" data-end="1616.96">and it comes with a yeoman generator so</span> <span data-start="1616.96" data-end="1620.77">you do NPM install generator Kraken call</span> <span data-start="1620.77" data-end="1622.99">yo cracker in your shell and that's it</span> <span data-start="1622.99" data-end="1626.2">it's really easy to set up and I think</span> <span data-start="1626.2" data-end="1628.15">it's pretty cool because it does a lot</span> <span data-start="1628.15" data-end="1630.37">of scaffolding for you so it comes with</span> <span data-start="1630.37" data-end="1631.57">the templates it comes to few</span> <span data-start="1631.57" data-end="1633.46">localization v3 tests automatically</span> <span data-start="1633.46" data-end="1636.55">which is really useful for all of us I</span> <span data-start="1636.55"

data-end="1646.24">the Express for push and I think one of</span> <span data-start="1646.24" data-end="1648.91">the features that we will focus on</span> <span data-start="1648.91"
