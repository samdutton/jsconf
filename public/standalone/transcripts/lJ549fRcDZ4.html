<p><span data-start="8.179" data-end="11.7">hello everybody I'm Nicholas Carr 7</span> <span data-start="11.7" data-end="14.79">Monta I'm the guy behind the JavaScript</span> <span data-start="14.79" data-end="18.24">in for his tool kit and today I'm going</span> <span data-start="18.24" data-end="19.65">to be talking about creating interactive</span> <span data-start="19.65" data-end="24.09">data visualizations for the web so there</span> <span data-start="24.09" data-end="25.619">are too many topics related to the</span> <span data-start="25.619" data-end="28.529">project one is data visualization itself</span> <span data-start="28.529" data-end="31.92">the other one is JavaScript since I'm</span> <span data-start="31.92" data-end="33.42">going to be describing more what the</span> <span data-start="33.42" data-end="36.36">toolkit does I'm going to focus more on</span> <span data-start="36.36" data-end="38.75">data visualization but you can ask me</span> <span data-start="38.75" data-end="44.789">any JavaScript weird question so the</span> <span data-start="44.789" data-end="46.079">JavaScript them for this toolkit its</span> <span data-start="46.079" data-end="48.48">purpose is to create web based</span> <span data-start="48.48" data-end="51.03">interactive data visualizations it</span> <span data-start="51.03" data-end="54.42">supports charts and multiple graph and</span> <span data-start="54.42" data-end="58.379">three layouts it's a modular extensible</span> <span data-start="58.379" data-end="61.98">and composable and its web standards</span> <span data-start="61.98" data-end="67.409">based so by modularity what I mean is</span> <span data-start="67.409" data-end="69.869">that you can go to the to the page and</span> <span data-start="69.869" data-end="71.549">you can actually make your own build of</span> <span data-start="71.549" data-end="74.13">the toolkit so you can keep the code of</span> <span data-start="74.13" data-end="76.56">the visualizations you will use and keep</span> <span data-start="76.56" data-end="78.479">all the code of the visualizations you</span> <span data-start="78.479" data-end="81.09">won't be using internally actually the</span> <span data-start="81.09" data-end="84">toolkit has many independent small</span> <span data-start="84" data-end="86.159">modules of functionality that you can</span> <span data-start="86.159" data-end="88.95">add or remove those are kind of generic</span> <span data-start="88.95" data-end="90.57">modules for example you can add total</span> <span data-start="90.57" data-end="93.9">support or event system with you know</span> <span data-start="93.9" data-end="96.659">event delegation or most movement</span> <span data-start="96.659" data-end="98.9">tracking or you can add remove</span> <span data-start="98.9" data-end="101.64">navigation panning and zooming or graph</span> <span data-start="101.64" data-end="104.13">operations and dissolve work the same</span> <span data-start="104.13" data-end="106.259">for visualization so you can add or</span> <span data-start="106.259" data-end="109.11">remove those this is interesting because</span> <span data-start="109.11" data-end="112.38">you know for the loading time of the</span> <span data-start="112.38" data-end="116.62">page then</span> <span data-start="116.62" data-end="118.78">it is extensible in a way of know the</span> <span data-start="118.78" data-end="120.55">mathematical definition of a graph is</span> <span data-start="120.55" data-end="122.89">that you have a set of notes and set of</span> <span data-start="122.89" data-end="125.89">relations between notes and there is not</span> <span data-start="125.89" data-end="128.89">much a more concrete description of what</span> <span data-start="128.89" data-end="132.37">a node is awarding edges and so I try to</span> <span data-start="132.37" data-end="134.71">keep that kind of abstraction to let you</span> <span data-start="134.71" data-end="136.6">you know customize the nodes and edges</span> <span data-start="136.6" data-end="139.99">just as you want so basically in this</span> <span data-start="139.99" data-end="141.64">example we can see different node types</span> <span data-start="141.64" data-end="144.43">these are built-in types and you can</span> <span data-start="144.43" data-end="147.43">change different properties like size</span> <span data-start="147.43" data-end="151.36">color or any canvas style same goes for</span> <span data-start="151.36" data-end="154.12">the edges you know like line with color</span> <span data-start="154.12" data-end="156.79">etc or you can hack your own note</span> <span data-start="156.79" data-end="158.77">rendering functions or edge rendering</span> <span data-start="158.77" data-end="161.44">functions by augmenting the node types</span> <span data-start="161.44" data-end="164.71">object and so you could you know use</span> <span data-start="164.71" data-end="167.56">draw image from canvas or pester video</span> <span data-start="167.56" data-end="171.87">inside of the canvas or you know etc and</span> <span data-start="171.87" data-end="174.67">following this idea of extensibility I</span> <span data-start="174.67" data-end="177.15">thought that it would be quite elegant</span> <span data-start="177.15" data-end="179.59">for the toolkit to be able to compose</span> <span data-start="179.59" data-end="181.68">visualizations from other visualizations</span> <span data-start="181.68" data-end="185.44">so you could add visualizations as node</span> <span data-start="185.44" data-end="187.27">and edge rendering functions to other</span> <span data-start="187.27" data-end="192.82">visa actually but you can do it and most</span> <span data-start="192.82" data-end="195.01">important of all web standards based so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="195.01" data-end="198.85">I'm basically using html5 canvas but I'm</span> <span data-start="198.85" data-end="203.32">also using SVG CSS and JavaScript ie six</span> <span data-start="203.32" data-end="206.2">to eight is supported via Explorer</span> <span data-start="206.2" data-end="208.48">canvas or flash canvas which is you know</span> <span data-start="208.48" data-end="213.4">flash a JavaScript API for canvas in</span> <span data-start="213.4" data-end="217.209">flash all our browsers are supported</span> <span data-start="217.209" data-end="220.51">natively there's also a mobile support</span> <span data-start="220.51" data-end="223.45">for Android and iPhone I'm supporting</span> <span data-start="223.45" data-end="226.269">touch events and also for example some</span> <span data-start="226.269" data-end="228.73">versions of iphone do not have</span> <span data-start="228.73" data-end="230.56">very good Phil text function for the</span> <span data-start="230.56" data-end="233.349">canvas so you can fall back and just add</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="233.349" data-end="239.53">HTML and svgs labels for the note the</span> <span data-start="239.53" data-end="245">future visualizations are stacked charts</span> <span data-start="245.01" data-end="248.62">like ariel bar and pie charts you have</span> <span data-start="248.62" data-end="250.51">space filling visualizations which i'll</span> <span data-start="250.51" data-end="254.11">be describing later and also know to</span> <span data-start="254.11" data-end="259.84">link visualizations you have stacked</span> <span data-start="259.84" data-end="262.419">aria charts everything is you know very</span> <span data-start="262.419" data-end="265.69">dynamic you can filter and restore your</span> <span data-start="265.69" data-end="268.18">filters and you can upload the data</span> <span data-start="268.18" data-end="271.09">alive also by sending another json</span> <span data-start="271.09" data-end="276.58">object jason data same principle for the</span> <span data-start="276.58" data-end="278.74">bar charts you can change the</span> <span data-start="278.74" data-end="280.84">orientation of the bars can also update</span> <span data-start="280.84" data-end="285.13">the data live sm goes with pie charts</span> <span data-start="285.13" data-end="286.87">this is kind of a more complex</span> <span data-start="286.87" data-end="288.669">representation of a pie chart in which</span> <span data-start="288.669" data-end="291.31">you know each pie slice has different</span> <span data-start="291.31" data-end="293.88">heights and you are dealing with many</span> <span data-start="293.88" data-end="296.62">different layers of information which</span> <span data-start="296.62" data-end="298.66">are aggregated on each file but you</span> <span data-start="298.66" data-end="301.479">could also just make up I a simple pie</span> <span data-start="301.479" data-end="310.89">charts</span> <span data-start="310.9" data-end="316.34">so not much to say about charts then you</span> <span data-start="316.34" data-end="321.11">have space filling visualizations so</span> <span data-start="321.11" data-end="322.61">watching what our space filling</span> <span data-start="322.61" data-end="325.97">visualizations so if you take a standard</span> <span data-start="325.97" data-end="329">3 layout and you want to render it on a</span> <span data-start="329" data-end="331.64">constraint space you will find out that</span> <span data-start="331.64" data-end="333.89">there are two main problems actually the</span> <span data-start="333.89" data-end="336.83">first problem is that there's a lot of a</span> <span data-start="336.83" data-end="339.41">new space actually the entire white</span> <span data-start="339.41" data-end="342.05">square behind the tree is a lot of a new</span> <span data-start="342.05" data-end="345.11">space and the other problem is that if</span> <span data-start="345.11" data-end="347.39">you add a level to the standard tree it</span> <span data-start="347.39" data-end="350.36">won't feed anymore so researchers</span> <span data-start="350.36" data-end="352.79">thought about changing you know the</span> <span data-start="352.79" data-end="355.51">visual metaphor of parent-child</span> <span data-start="355.51" data-end="357.74">relationships in just something that</span> <span data-start="357.74" data-end="359.3">would make a visualization that could</span> <span data-start="359.3" data-end="362.54">fit in a constraint space and so b is a</span> <span data-start="362.54" data-end="365.36">child of a they thought it could be a</span> <span data-start="365.36" data-end="369.83">child of a B is contained in a and so by</span> <span data-start="369.83" data-end="372.32">changing this metaphor they made a</span> <span data-start="372.32" data-end="374.6">visualization which solved the true</span> <span data-start="374.6" data-end="376.85">problems actually it fits in the entire</span> <span data-start="376.85" data-end="381.05">rectangle and if you add add levels in</span> <span data-start="381.05" data-end="385.82">indefinitely it will still fit and so</span> <span data-start="385.82" data-end="388.1">this is the tree map visualization there</span> <span data-start="388.1" data-end="391.61">are many different types of trim up</span> <span data-start="391.61" data-end="396.26">tiling algorithms each one has different</span> <span data-start="396.26" data-end="399.5">characteristics so for example if you</span> <span data-start="399.5" data-end="401.51">were to find an element alphabetically</span> <span data-start="401.51" data-end="404.09">you could use a slice and dice layout</span> <span data-start="404.09" data-end="408.32">because it lays nodes ordered but for</span> <span data-start="408.32" data-end="411.02">example for what you use a trim app on a</span> <span data-start="411.02" data-end="413.63">mobile device with it with a touch</span> <span data-start="413.63" data-end="416.36">device would be better to use those</span> <span data-start="416.36" data-end="419.3">qualified layout because notes are more</span> <span data-start="419.3" data-end="423.02">like square fish and so is it's it's</span> <span data-start="423.02" data-end="427.22">easier to tap on a node from a score if</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="427.22" data-end="428.99">I trim up than nearest to tap on another</span> <span data-start="428.99" data-end="432.26">no slice and dice trim up which as you</span> <span data-start="432.26" data-end="434.48">can see notes are quite thinner and so</span> <span data-start="434.48" data-end="435.44">you can</span> <span data-start="435.44" data-end="438.71">you know make mistakes easier and so</span> <span data-start="438.71" data-end="441.95">these are freely out there are many</span> <span data-start="441.95" data-end="444.62">along layouts actually but I implemented</span> <span data-start="444.62" data-end="447.53">free of them this is actually a tree map</span> <span data-start="447.53" data-end="451.58">of the music I listen to so there's a</span> <span data-start="451.58" data-end="453.56">band Incubus if you drill down the tree</span> <span data-start="453.56" data-end="457.13">map you can see the album's very smooth</span> <span data-start="457.13" data-end="461.39">animations for everything same here this</span> <span data-start="461.39" data-end="467">is clarified layout and you can change</span> <span data-start="467" data-end="469.19">the layout also on the Flyers animations</span> <span data-start="469.19" data-end="471.92">for that too so this is a strip layout</span> <span data-start="471.92" data-end="474.32">of the tree map this is a slice and dice</span> <span data-start="474.32" data-end="477.47">as you can see notes have a higher</span> <span data-start="477.47" data-end="481.58">aspect ratio they are not very squared</span> <span data-start="481.58" data-end="484.97">as you can see but they can be sorted</span> <span data-start="484.97" data-end="490.93">which is kind of nice in some cases and</span> <span data-start="490.93" data-end="493.61">so following the idea of space fading</span> <span data-start="493.61" data-end="496.61">visualizations you have like radial</span> <span data-start="496.61" data-end="498.53">layouts of space filling visualizations</span> <span data-start="498.53" data-end="501.53">for example the sunburst visualization</span> <span data-start="501.53" data-end="504.95">which is generally used well is used on</span> <span data-start="504.95" data-end="507.71">many different things but generally it's</span> <span data-start="507.71" data-end="510.44">used on file system visualizations so</span> <span data-start="510.44" data-end="513.61">for example this is the code this is the</span> <span data-start="513.61" data-end="516.5">source of the of the project itself</span> <span data-start="516.5" data-end="519.62">mapped on the visualization the</span> <span data-start="519.62" data-end="521.539">uncompressed source of course so when</span> <span data-start="521.539" data-end="523.58">you click on a node you have you know</span> <span data-start="523.58" data-end="525.83">the last commit on github it's file size</span> <span data-start="525.83" data-end="528.89">and what it was last modified and you</span> <span data-start="528.89" data-end="535.21">can focus on an old</span> <span data-start="535.22" data-end="538.29">now you can extend this visualization</span> <span data-start="538.29" data-end="541.8">for four graphs so not just trees in</span> <span data-start="541.8" data-end="543.93">this case I'm using something called</span> <span data-start="543.93" data-end="547.65">hyper lines to connect nodes it behaves</span> <span data-start="547.65" data-end="554.49">just the same then you have the Icicle</span> <span data-start="554.49" data-end="557.31">space-filling visualization in which you</span> <span data-start="557.31" data-end="561">know a parents children are actually on</span> <span data-start="561" data-end="565.13">the right or at the bottom of its parent</span> <span data-start="565.13" data-end="567.75">this also used for filesystem</span> <span data-start="567.75" data-end="570.03">visualizations generally but you can use</span> <span data-start="570.03" data-end="574.52">it for whatever you like for your keys</span> <span data-start="574.52" data-end="579.33">as you can see can handle a good amount</span> <span data-start="579.33" data-end="585.15">of nodes this visualization was house</span> <span data-start="585.15" data-end="587.03">was actually contributed by</span> <span data-start="587.03" data-end="590.58">visualizations like the one that you're</span> <span data-start="590.58" data-end="594.15">seeing are like more intuitive it's</span> <span data-start="594.15" data-end="595.95">easier to understand another link vs</span> <span data-start="595.95" data-end="598.29">ation it's easier to see what's the</span> <span data-start="598.29" data-end="600.18">topology of a tree with a node link</span> <span data-start="600.18" data-end="602.49">visualization and also what you can do</span> <span data-start="602.49" data-end="605.55">is you know add extra information on the</span> <span data-start="605.55" data-end="607.68">edges like coloring the edges or adding</span> <span data-start="607.68" data-end="609.99">a line width etc something that you</span> <span data-start="609.99" data-end="611.19">can't do with space filling</span> <span data-start="611.19" data-end="613.14">visualizations at least when I showed</span> <span data-start="613.14" data-end="615.54">you see there there are no edges or the</span> <span data-start="615.54" data-end="621.06">visualizations in this ones you have so</span> <span data-start="621.06" data-end="622.89">the first one is a radio layout of a</span> <span data-start="622.89" data-end="625.11">graph which is kind of simple to make</span> <span data-start="625.11" data-end="630.03">but researchers made a lot of research</span> <span data-start="630.03" data-end="633.27">about how to make intuitive or non</span> <span data-start="633.27" data-end="636.24">confusing animations for this and I'm</span> <span data-start="636.24" data-end="638.97">going to and so they arrived to the</span> <span data-start="638.97" data-end="640.92">conclusion that by changing free things</span> <span data-start="640.92" data-end="644.25">you could make you know more</span> <span data-start="644.25" data-end="646.98">understandable animations with a radial</span> <span data-start="646.98" data-end="649.14">layout and so I'll be describing these</span> <span data-start="649.14" data-end="652.939">three things</span> <span data-start="652.949" data-end="656.86">so this is a rare layout of a more</span> <span data-start="656.86" data-end="667.36">general graph so if I were to click on</span> <span data-start="667.36" data-end="670.66">node 9c the top left nodes which are on</span> <span data-start="670.66" data-end="674.319">the on the Outer Ring they will remain</span> <span data-start="674.319" data-end="676.6">on the same outer rain on the new</span> <span data-start="676.6"

data-end="682.54">this will make the animation quite</span> <span data-start="682.54" data-end="685.209">confusing see they get all in the middle</span> <span data-start="685.209" data-end="688.149">that's because they use some linear you</span> <span data-start="688.149" data-end="690.639">know the shortest path to do the</span> <span data-start="690.639" data-end="692.739">animation from the starting to the</span> <span data-start="692.739" data-end="696.759">ending position by changing a</span> <span data-start="696.759" data-end="699.1">rectangular

data-start="708.899" data-end="711.85">same goes for another case say for</span> <span data-start="711.85" data-end="714.459">example you have a central node and lots</span> <span data-start="714.459" data-end="717.489">of notes on the on the first ring if you</span> <span data-start="717.489" data-end="722.579">click on white if you click on this node</span> <span data-start="722.579" data-end="725.319">you will see that the notes jump on the</span> <span data-start="725.319" data-end="728.23">outer ring but they also rotate a lot so</span> <span data-start="728.23" data-end="730.389">it's kind of complicated to understand</span> <span data-start="730.389" data-end="733.54">word notes are now and to actually</span> <span data-start="733.54" data-end="736.48">follow each node properly but if you add</span> <span data-start="736.48" data-end="738.579">this constraint you'll see that the</span> <span data-start="738.579" data-end="741.85">notes just jump out and they remain on</span> <span data-start="741.85" data-end="743.86">the same relative angle so this makes</span> <span data-start="743.86" data-end="746.589">the the visualization more you know</span> <span data-start="746.589" data-end="749.559">understandable and these are the kind of</span> <span data-start="749.559" data-end="753.309">things that in focus researchers work on</span> <span data-start="753.309" data-end="756.639">and I kind of implement these things on</span> <span data-start="756.639" data-end="761.41">a toolkit so then you have a hyperbolic</span> <span data-start="761.41" data-end="763.899">to visualization and this is what it's</span> <span data-start="763.899" data-end="767.139">called a focus best context technique it</span> <span data-start="767.139" data-end="769.119">has sort of like a magnifying glass</span> <span data-start="769.119" data-end="772.119">effect in which the sensor node has a</span> <span data-start="772.119" data-end="774.529">lot of detail and then there is</span> <span data-start="774.529" data-end="777.259">the tree is kind of distorted to fit</span> <span data-start="777.259" data-end="780.019">into a disk and in order to make this</span> <span data-start="780.019" data-end="782.749">effect what you use is another type of</span> <span data-start="782.749" data-end="784.67">geometry which is called a hyperbolic</span> <span data-start="784.67" data-end="787.16">geometry which is actually the same</span>

data-end="812.959">space what you can also do is add graph</span> <span data-start="812.959" data-end="815.18">operations on the tree so say for</span> <span data-start="815.18" data-end="817.639">example you'd like to remove the bottom</span> <span data-start="817.639" data-end="820.399">right subtree you can do it with</span> <span data-start="820.399" data-end="823.309">animation say you want to remove some</span> <span data-start="823.309" data-end="827.689">edges you can also do it the top left</span> <span data-start="827.689" data-end="830.269">edges with an animation and will</span> <span data-start="830.269" data-end="832.91">recalculate the position automatically</span> <span data-start="832.91" data-end="837.74">you can add a graph or transform a graph</span> <span data-start="837.74" data-end="839.48">into another graph by adding and</span> <span data-start="839.48" data-end="844.43">removing notes so this is just a generic</span> <span data-start="844.43" data-end="847.009">model that works on abstract graphs and</span> <span data-start="847.009" data-end="848.75">you can implement it on any</span> <span data-start="848.75" data-end="852.92">visualization you want then there's this</span> <span data-start="852.92" data-end="855.139">pastry this is like a more intuitive</span> <span data-start="855.139" data-end="857.72">layout of a tree with the addition of</span> <span data-start="857.72" data-end="861.11">the fact that you collapsed sub trees</span> <span data-start="861.11" data-end="863.809">which aren't in the path between the</span> <span data-start="863.809" data-end="866.779">clicked node and the root node and when</span> <span data-start="866.779" data-end="869.3">you collapse these sub trees you do an</span> <span data-start="869.3" data-end="871.399">animation and you also add some type of</span> <span data-start="871.399" data-end="874.339">visual encoding to you know inform the</span> <span data-start="874.339" data-end="876.23">user that what is the topology of the</span> <span data-start="876.23" data-end="878.899">tree like is that a big surgery there or</span> <span data-start="878.899" data-end="881.329">how number of know how many number of</span> <span data-start="881.329" data-end="886.66">notes that it does it have etcetera so</span> <span data-start="886.66" data-end="889.61">this is a very simple example this all</span> <span data-start="889.61" data-end="891.889">on the demos page of the of the homepage</span> <span data-start="891.889" data-end="893.809">of the toolkit see if you click on a</span> <span data-start="893.809" data-end="895.819">node it makes all those animations of</span> <span data-start="895.819" data-end="898.61">contracting and expanding subtrees you</span> <span data-start="898.61" data-end="902.23">can change the tree orientation also and</span> <span data-start="902.23" data-end="904.819">besides selecting a node what you can</span> <span data-start="904.819" data-end="906.24">also do is you know</span> <span data-start="906.24" data-end="908.82">set a notice route that will change the</span> <span data-start="908.82" data-end="912.18">topology of the tree itself now you have</span> <span data-start="912.18" data-end="919.92">another tree with another route then you</span> <span data-start="919.92" data-end="922.589">have the force directed graph so first</span> <span data-start="922.589" data-end="924.45">affected is a physical system simulation</span> <span data-start="924.45" data-end="928.29">in which all nodes have a repulsive</span> <span data-start="928.29" data-end="931.11">force and notes which are connected to</span> <span data-start="931.11" data-end="932.97">each other have also an attractive force</span> <span data-start="932.97" data-end="934.95">and you run this for a couple of times</span> <span data-start="934.95" data-end="936.959">and then you make a layout and what's</span> <span data-start="936.959" data-end="940.01">interesting about this layout is that</span> <span data-start="940.01" data-end="943.68">symmetries are preserved so you can see</span> <span data-start="943.68" data-end="946.44">the symmetries of our graph by doing</span> <span data-start="946.44" data-end="948.08">this layout and also it makes</span> <span data-start="948.08" data-end="952.44">aesthetically pleasing layouts it's very</span> <span data-start="952.44" data-end="955.589">useful for general graphs generally you</span> <span data-start="955.589" data-end="958.29">know this is just not a tree anymore</span> <span data-start="958.29" data-end="960.45">this example is also interesting because</span> <span data-start="960.45" data-end="963.42">it is like a small graph editing tool in</span> <span data-start="963.42" data-end="964.77">which you can add panning and zooming</span> <span data-start="964.77" data-end="967.47">and you can drag and drop nodes and you</span> <span data-start="967.47" data-end="969.829">can click on a node and select it and</span> <span data-start="969.829" data-end="972.48">you can delete notes and cetera at those</span> <span data-start="972.48" data-end="974.82">so this is a very simple example you</span> <span data-start="974.82" data-end="976.92">have the code here and you can access</span> <span data-start="976.92" data-end="981.66">and so this might be quite useful to</span> <span data-start="981.66" data-end="992.94">some some people okay some examples so</span> <span data-start="992.94" data-end="995.79">this is a trimmer visualization I made</span> <span data-start="995.79" data-end="1001.67">of Doctor Who's valence so each villain</span> <span data-start="1001.67" data-end="1004.79">is a is a rectangle

number</span> <span data-start="1008.12" data-end="1010.88">of episodes the villain appears on so</span> <span data-start="1010.88" data-end="1014.27">you can kind of drill down and have more</span> <span data-start="1014.27" data-end="1016.459">information on demand like the stories</span> <span data-start="1016.459" data-end="1019.459">of your own appears on and then what you</span> <span data-start="1019.459" data-end="1021.56">can do is kind of have a dynamic</span> <span data-start="1021.56" data-end="1023.93">filtering on the tree map so here on the</span> <span data-start="1023.93" data-end="1025.459">right I have the name of all the actors</span> <span data-start="1025.459" data-end="1029.78">who played doctor who from 1963 to 2010</span> <span

data-end="1040.19">and just your dynamic filtering which is</span> <span data-start="1040.19" data-end="1048.76">kind of interesting</span> <span data-start="1048.77" data-end="1053.07">then you have an old example of artists</span> <span data-start="1053.07" data-end="1055.409">and relationships but I don't know if</span> <span data-start="1055.409" data-end="1058.529">you know it it's kind of like a six</span> <span data-start="1058.529" data-end="1062.549">degrees of separation to Kevin Bacon so</span> <span data-start="1062.549" data-end="1064.62">you have a band which is centered
