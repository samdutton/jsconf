data-end="149.84">take too long to to check and implement</span> <span data-start="149.84" data-end="151.7">and look for cross-cutting but</span> <span data-start="151.7" data-end="153.95">but we can go faster and we think we can</span> <span data-start="153.95" data-end="158">start to paralyse es7 and get maybe an</span> <span data-start="158" data-end="160.61">annual edition of the standardout

data-start="163.55" data-end="168.08">seen this so don't let me carry with</span> <span data-start="168.08" data-end="170.63">class syntax but it works for existing</span> <span data-start="170.63" data-end="172.76">functions including built-in ones like</span> <span data-start="172.76" data-end="175.01">note list or array you can mix and match</span> <span data-start="175.01" data-end="176.6">with function constructors there's only</span> <span data-start="176.6" data-end="178.459">a little bit of extra kernel semantics</span> <span data-start="178.459" data-end="180.05">it's mostly sugar for functions and</span> <span data-start="180.05" data-end="183.08">prototypes we have Const and you also</span> <span data-start="183.08" data-end="185.39">see arrow functions those that bind this</span> <span data-start="185.39" data-end="187.31">to the outer this there's something that</span> <span data-start="187.31" data-end="189.17">squares its argument

destructuring I tried to put too</span> <span data-start="210.95" data-end="212.15">many things together here because I</span> <span data-start="212.15" data-end="213.35">don't really want to spend more than the</span> <span data-start="213.35" data-end="215.18">slide on this stuff you boys need it the</span> <span data-start="215.18" data-end="217.31">structure he's really cool and if I were</span> <span data-start="217.31" data-end="218.359">really using the Dom it would probably</span> <span data-start="218.359" data-end="220.01">be something awful like get client</span> <span data-start="220.01" data-end="221.81">bounding wreck but it never room for it</span> <span data-start="221.81" data-end="224.51">so there it is and with that object</span> <span data-start="224.51" data-end="226.22">shorthand you can pluck out the top and</span> <span data-start="226.22" data-end="228.23">left properties of the returned object a</span> <span data-start="228.23" data-end="230.329">smart jet could even boil away the</span> <span data-start="230.329" data-end="232.15">object and just get the top and left</span> <span data-start="232.15" data-end="233.89">coordinates</span> <span data-start="233.89" data-end="237.049">here's a default parameter default</span> <span data-start="237.049" data-end="239.39">argument and this is very handy you can</span> <span data-start="239.39" data-end="242.57">even refer to prior arguments to assign</span> <span data-start="242.57" data-end="245.09">later ones you can pass  as a</span> <span data-start="245.09" data-end="247.1">sentinel value to trigger defaulting</span> <span data-start="247.1" data-end="248.42">which is important when you're</span> <span data-start="248.42" data-end="250.7">delegating or composing functions you</span> <span data-start="250.7" data-end="251.9">don't want to have to know all the</span> <span data-start="251.9" data-end="254.269">combinations of defaults so you can</span> <span data-start="254.269" data-end="255.38">trigger them by passing</span> <span data-start="255.38" data-end="259.12">modules are going in in a very</span> <span data-start="259.12" data-end="261.89">simplified way even from what's been</span> <span data-start="261.89" data-end="263.21">discussed in the past and it's going to</span> <span data-start="263.21" data-end="265.64">be very much like I would say like</span> <span data-start="265.64" data-end="266.27">nodejs</span> <span data-start="266.27" data-end="269.57">but with the first class syntax so we</span> <span data-start="269.57" data-end="272.84">can preload things and here's an example</span> <span data-start="272.84" data-end="274.46">where we're getting the keys and entries</span> <span data-start="274.46" data-end="275.72">functions from the built in iteration</span> <span data-start="275.72" data-end="278">module you can then use those for things</span> <span data-start="278" data-end="279.65">like the four of luth we couldn't make</span> <span data-start="279.65" data-end="280.97">four in do this it wasn't backwards</span> <span data-start="280.97" data-end="283.43">compatible so we have four of kind of</span> <span data-start="283.43" data-end="284.52">like CoffeeScript</span> <span data-start="284.52" data-end="286.68">different and there's a key in value</span> <span data-start="286.68" data-end="288.87">iterator called entries we also have</span> <span data-start="288.87" data-end="291.569">generators people on the committee</span> <span data-start="291.569" data-end="293.159">wanted the star in front after the</span> <span data-start="293.159" data-end="294.539">function to tell you this is a generator</span> <span data-start="294.539" data-end="296.819">it also allows us to contextually</span> <span data-start="296.819" data-end="299.099">reserve yield which is not a reserved</span> <span data-start="299.099" data-end="303.509">word in standards up until es5 strict so</span> <span data-start="303.509" data-end="306.9">code uses yield a freely for function</span> <span data-start="306.9" data-end="308.19">names and parameter names so it's very</span> <span data-start="308.19" data-end="310.59">hard to reserve unconditionally but the</span> <span data-start="310.59" data-end="312.99">star lets us do it inside the body and</span> <span data-start="312.99" data-end="314.55">that's the easiest way to implement</span> <span data-start="314.55" data-end="316.05">iterator by the way there's a lot of</span> <span data-start="316.05" data-end="319.349">stuff to show here if you guys have seen</span> <span data-start="319.349" data-end="320.759">this you can go to tank access</span> <span data-start="320.759" data-end="322.919">compatibility table to see he has a lot</span> <span data-start="322.919" data-end="325.789">of
