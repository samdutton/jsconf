data-start="566.02" data-end="567.22">right it does in this case it moves</span> <span data-start="567.22" data-end="568.99">first camera exactly like I said it</span> <span data-start="568.99" data-end="572.17">would but if we reversed order commands</span> <span data-start="572.17" data-end="573.67">so that we rotate it first and then</span> <span data-start="573.67" data-end="578.17">translate it basically are picking your</span> <span data-start="578.17" data-end="581.56">angle Z according to the object is still</span> <span data-start="581.56" data-end="582.79">straight out in front of it even though</span> <span data-start="582.79" data-end="584.47">it's off to the side for us so now when</span> <span data-start="584.47" data-end="595.96">we move Z it moves along its own axis</span> <span data-start="595.97" data-end="599.16">so can you actually use this thing it's</span> <span data-start="599.16" data-end="602.13">great it's in all modern browsers it's</span> <span data-start="602.13" data-end="604.56">on mobile I haven't included opera here</span> <span data-start="604.56" data-end="605.82">but I assume it'll basically look</span> <span data-start="605.82" data-end="607.38">exactly like Chrome as soon as they're</span> <span data-start="607.38" data-end="609.81">done with that currently opera doesn't</span> <span data-start="609.81" data-end="612.3">support it but it's a niche thing</span> <span data-start="612.3" data-end="615.839">don't kill me if you work for opera it</span> <span data-start="615.839" data-end="617.64">also works on Mobile Safari and Chrome</span> <span data-start="617.64" data-end="618.63">for Android and iOS</span> <span data-start="618.63" data-end="622.91">for Android that means 3.0 and newer</span> <span data-start="622.91" data-end="626.25">there is the asterisk though ie10 has</span> <span data-start="626.25" data-end="627.45">not supported a property called</span> <span data-start="627.45" data-end="629.94">preserved 3d and I'm going to show why</span> <span data-start="629.94" data-end="631.62">this is so important that it basically</span> <span data-start="631.62" data-end="633.63">means that ie10 can't really even use</span> <span data-start="633.63" data-end="637.92">any of this stuff so preserve

data-end="654.75">get below it gets the same transform so</span> <span data-start="654.75" data-end="656.43">the cascading transform over rights</span> <span data-start="656.43" data-end="659.1">everything below it what you might</span> <span data-start="659.1" data-end="660.42">expect would actually be the default is</span> <span data-start="660.42" data-end="663">preserved 3d reserve 2d says if I rotate</span> <span data-start="663" data-end="664.17">something and then I rotate it's</span> <span data-start="664.17" data-end="665.88">apparent the original transform is</span> <span data-start="665.88" data-end="667.92">maintained and it just removes inside of</span> <span data-start="667.92" data-end="671.52">it so this isn't in 3d or in ie10</span> <span data-start="671.52" data-end="673.8">which means it's you can only do the</span> <span data-start="673.8" data-end="677.01">motors the surface kind of animations in</span> <span data-start="677.01" data-end="684.36">ie10 so here's four elements and they</span> <span data-start="684.36" data-end="688.35">live in a parent element and I rotate</span> <span data-start="688.35" data-end="691.17">them

couple</span> <span data-start="720.92" data-end="723.24">transitions common transitions on mobile</span> <span data-start="723.24" data-end="724.589">applications and show how to implement</span> <span data-start="724.589" data-end="726.929">them this is Michael receding layers</span> <span data-start="726.929" data-end="730.319">basically says in mobile like you eyes</span> <span data-start="730.319" data-end="732.179">we often have layers on top of each</span> <span data-start="732.179" data-end="733.589">other and they're revealed beneath them</span> <span data-start="733.589" data-end="736.05">we could just slide this top off off of</span> <span data-start="736.05" data-end="738.959">it but it's from behind so it actually</span> <span data-start="738.959" data-end="740.16">feels kind of nice to actually have it</span> <span data-start="740.16" data-end="742.35">moving forward towards you as if coming</span> <span data-start="742.35" data-end="748.679">from behind I've been watching our</span> <span data-start="748.679" data-end="751.199">development all week and on the plane</span> <span data-start="751.199" data-end="753.6">instead of cramming all right so here's</span> <span data-start="753.6" data-end="758.79">our animation tap on an object and it</span> <span data-start="758.79" data-end="759.929">moves off to the side and something</span> <span data-start="759.929" data-end="761.91">comes from behind it so how do we</span> <span data-start="761.91" data-end="765.54">implement that so here's a two up view</span> <span data-start="765.54" data-end="766.92">of what's actually going on we have two</span> <span data-start="766.92" data-end="769.11">layers and then top right there's an</span> <span data-start="769.11" data-end="773.189">overhead view of the scene so it'll help</span> <span data-start="773.189" data-end="774.119">you know when something's behind</span> <span data-start="774.119" data-end="775.679">something else so you can see that</span> <span data-start="775.679" data-end="776.929">they're beside each other right now</span> <span data-start="776.929" data-end="779.819">there's the magical perspective value</span> <span data-start="779.819" data-end="780.54">off in the corner</span> <span data-start="780.54" data-end="782.939">the first one is translated 100% of its</span> <span data-start="782.939" data-end="784.709">own self off to the right so it</span> <span data-start="784.709" data-end="786.929">basically takes it off screen and the</span> <span data-start="786.929" data-end="790.74">other one is not moving at all so if we</span> <span data-start="790.74" data-end="791.939">go ahead and run that animation again</span> <span data-start="791.939" data-end="794.1">all we're doing is translating the Z</span> <span data-start="794.1" data-end="796.319">negative 250 pixels back into the scene</span> <span data-start="796.319" data-end="799.199">and you can see it moves back also in</span> <span data-start="799.199" data-end="804.54">the overhead view so our default state</span> <span data-start="804.54" data-end="806.129">for this animation is when you come to</span> <span data-start="806.129" data-end="808.799">this it's placed behind it and shrunken</span> <span data-start="808.799" data-end="814.47">down already and then as it comes</span> <span data-start="814.47" data-end="816.509">forward we basically run a CSS</span> <span data-start="816.509" data-end="818.249">transition from the negative to 250</span> <span data-start="818.249" data-end="820.259">degree

data-start="834.79" data-end="837.32">second super common animation especially</span> <span data-start="837.32" data-end="841.1">on iOS is the card flip so this demo has</span> <span data-start="841.1" data-end="843.019">been out for css3 forever and ever and</span> <span data-start="843.019" data-end="844.85">ever it's it's pretty representative of</span> <span data-start="844.85" data-end="846.26">a bunch of more complicated things</span> <span data-start="846.26" data-end="848.209">you'll do so I'll show you how to put</span> <span data-start="848.209" data-end="853.23">one of these together</span> <span data-start="853.24" data-end="859.31">so here's Tobias look in pert and we can</span> <span data-start="859.31" data-end="860.72">flip them around by interacting with</span> <span data-start="860.72" data-end="865.07">this and double-clicking so again we</span> <span data-start="865.07" data-end="866.81">have two objects we have a friend in the</span> <span data-start="866.81" data-end="869.12">back and we bring off side to side from</span> <span data-start="869.12" data-end="870.41">each other so you have to get an idea of</span> <span data-start="870.41" data-end="874.37">what's going on we rotate this it</span> <span data-start="874.37" data-end="877.519">rotates in place and rather than seeing</span> <span data-start="877.519" data-end="879.8">some unknown backside of this object we</span> <span data-start="879.8" data-end="887.449">actually see the mirror image so when we</span> <span data-start="887.449" data-end="888.86">move it put it back and we flip it on</span> <span data-start="888.86" data-end="890.54">backwards and put it behind itself it</span> <span data-start="890.54" data-end="892.37">ends up clipping over at the top of the</span> <span data-start="892.37" data-end="894.86">original images because they're both at</span> <span data-start="894.86" data-end="897.92">the same translation of Z equals zero so</span> <span data-start="897.92" data-end="899.12">the system doesn't know which one's</span> <span data-start="899.12" data-end="902.75">actually in front of the other what we</span> <span data-start="902.75" data-end="904.31">can do is use a property called back</span> <span data-start="904.31" data-end="906.05">phase visibility which basically tells</span> <span data-start="906.05" data-end="908.149">the object if we can see the back side</span> <span data-start="908.149" data-end="909.74">of it we actually want to see through it</span> <span data-start="909.74" data-end="912.86">so that way when this back face as you</span> <span data-start="912.86" data-end="914.529">can see is facing the other direction</span> <span data-start="914.529" data-end="916.97">it's invisible facing it from the front</span> <span data-start="916.97" data-end="920.269">direction now we can take the parent</span> <span data-start="920.269" data-end="922.37">object of both of these objects and we</span> <span data-start="922.37" data-end="924.89">can animate that and it'll move the</span> <span data-start="924.89" data-end="925.67">things inside of it</span> <span data-start="925.67" data-end="929.66">because we have reserved 3d so they both</span> <span data-start="929.66" data-end="931.519">move together this isn't two separate</span> <span data-start="931.519" data-end="932.949">animations you're just moving the parent</span> <span data-start="932.949" data-end="936.74">and running the CSS transition one thing</span> <span data-start="936.74" data-end="938.06">you might notice is we're actually</span> <span data-start="938.06" data-end="939.76">clipping at the top of this animation</span> <span data-start="939.76" data-end="946.189">which is pretty cool pretty tacky</span> <span data-start="946.199" data-end="948.639">alternatively if we wanted to avoid</span> <span data-start="948.639" data-end="951.069">clipping as we animate we can just move</span> <span data-start="951.069" data-end="953.11">our camera back or the object back</span> <span data-start="953.11" data-end="954.459">however you want to think about it</span> <span data-start="954.459" data-end="956.74">while the animation is running so in</span> <span data-start="956.74" data-end="958.66">this case we have a little CSS animation</span> <span data-start="958.66" data-end="961.149">that says very quickly we're going to</span> <span data-start="961.149" data-end="963.67">move this whole thing back to no pixels</span> <span data-start="963.67" data-end="966.279">and continue on rotating and because the</span> <span data-start="966.279" data-end="968.44">order we've given it it doesn't affect</span> <span data-start="968.44" data-end="972.1">how the rotation actually looks so goes</span> <span data-start="972.1" data-end="985.67">back rotates comes forward</span> <span data-start="985.68" data-end="989.2">third example our carousels so these are</span> <span data-start="989.2" data-end="990.94">used rather sparingly but you can see</span> <span data-start="990.94" data-end="992.89">that the animation at the top is</span> <span data-start="992.89" data-end="996.43">rotating on a cube so as it folds in it</span> <span data-start="996.43" data-end="998.14">looks like it has four sides and gives</span> <span data-start="998.14" data-end="1006.73">it a nice little bit of depth</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1006.74" data-end="1010.85">I'd say here's Jobe so we have two sides</span> <span data-start="1010.85" data-end="1014.06">job's on each and they rotate as if on a</span> <span data-start="1014.06" data-end="1017.27">cube so we want to inspect this scene</span> <span data-start="1017.27" data-end="1018.25">you can see what's actually going on</span> <span

data-end="1029.329">one off to the side in a square to be</span> <span data-start="1029.329" data-end="1035.12">acute I've also kept some of the code</span> <span data-start="1035.12" data-end="1036.47">from the last slide where they move back</span> <span data-start="1036.47" data-end="1038.929">in space before continuing so it doesn't</span> <span data-start="1038.929" data-end="1046.6">clip so terribly but cubes are boring so</span> <span data-start="1046.6" data-end="1050.51">here's a Pentagon it's exact same except</span> <span data-start="1050.51" data-end="1053.809">for the math to make anagon is a little</span> <span data-start="1053.809" data-end="1056.09">different than to make a square so</span> <span data-start="1056.09" data-end="1057.92">there's some math in here that you can</span> <span data-start="1057.92" data-end="1059.84">review later it's pretty basic</span> <span data-start="1059.84" data-end="1062.6">it basically says I've given in number</span> <span data-start="1062.6" data-end="1064.55">of sides what is the position of the</span> <span data-start="1064.55" data-end="1066.2">rotation of each object

data-end="1088.91">this is all written and all the demos</span> <span data-start="1088.91" data-end="1090.92">are in SAS so I just ran through some</span> <span data-start="1090.92"
