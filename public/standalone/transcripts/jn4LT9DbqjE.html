data-end="369.02">in the lower right you see this is our</span> <span data-start="369.02" data-end="371.03">kind of first version of a very simple</span> <span data-start="371.03" data-end="373.969">ide you see the documentation of what</span> <span data-start="373.969" data-end="375.74">you're doing right now I'm showing up in</span> <span data-start="375.74" data-end="380.75">real time then clipping and masking I'm</span> <span data-start="380.75" data-end="385.28">not using it in this example you should</span> <span data-start="385.28" data-end="388.3">see a little star coming up in a second</span> <span data-start="388.3" data-end="390.5">events multi-touch multi-touch is one</span> <span data-start="390.5" data-end="391.68">thing which is really really</span> <span data-start="391.68" data-end="393.06">useful you can get started writing a</span> <span data-start="393.06" data-end="395.699">game for the ipad right away and you've</span> <span data-start="395.699" data-end="401.28">event handlers filters sepia blur you</span> <span data-start="401.28" data-end="403.38">know you name it all types of different</span> <span

data-end="413.88">have different shapes group them animate</span> <span data-start="413.88" data-end="416.43">these shapes and these groups nest</span> <span data-start="416.43" data-end="419.16">groups if you're familiar with the flesh</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="419.16" data-end="421.05">API then you probably will recognize</span> <span data-start="421.05" data-end="423.36">whole bunch of stuff shape morphing so</span> <span data-start="423.36" data-end="424.979">you can take one shape morph it into</span> <span data-start="424.979" data-end="430.77">another shape I'm drawing a little text</span> <span data-start="430.77" data-end="434.25">bubble with movies and sub movies so you</span> <span data-start="434.25" data-end="436.5">can have I'm going to show later the</span> <span data-start="436.5" data-end="438.18">windmills away where the wings of the</span> <span data-start="438.18" data-end="440.37">wind will is one movie and then you know</span> <span data-start="440.37" data-end="442.199">you add that to another movie and rotate</span> <span data-start="442.199" data-end="451.38">the wings text phone support then we</span> <span data-start="451.38" data-end="455.13">have a timeline its frame based or so</span> <span data-start="455.13" data-end="456.57">you can you can access certain frames</span> <span data-start="456.57" data-end="458.43">and do certain things at certain frames</span> <span data-start="458.43" data-end="460.47">video support audio support as far as</span> <span data-start="460.47" data-end="465.409">it's possible on iOS for example and</span> <span data-start="465.409" data-end="467.28">this is kind of interesting and I'm</span> <span data-start="467.28" data-end="468.96">going to show you the more about this</span> <span data-start="468.96" data-end="470.4">later the architecture of bike shed is</span> <span data-start="470.4" data-end="471.81">you could name it a client-server</span> <span data-start="471.81" data-end="473.31">architecture so we have separated the</span> <span data-start="473.31" data-end="475.11">rendering from the movie execution and</span> <span data-start="475.11" data-end="477.75">that basically means that right now this</span> <span data-start="477.75" data-end="480.69">is using an SPG renderer the next thing</span> <span data-start="480.69" data-end="481.919">we're going to be working on is a canvas</span> <span data-start="481.919" data-end="483.449">vendor and hopefully in the future also</span> <span data-start="483.449" data-end="485.82">the WebGL vendor which is going to be</span> <span data-start="485.82" data-end="487.289">interesting so that's the rendering part</span> <span data-start="487.289" data-end="490.05">and then the movie execution runs either</span> <span data-start="490.05" data-end="492.09">you know in your brows in your window</span> <span data-start="492.09" data-end="495.32">threat or in an iframe or in a worker</span> <span data-start="495.32" data-end="498.479">them or you could also run it on node so</span> <span data-start="498.479" data-end="500.4">you can run the movie the bike shed</span> <span data-start="500.4" data-end="502.47">movie on node is going to stream or the</span> <span data-start="502.47" data-end="511.47">rendering data to the client</span> <span data-start="511.48" data-end="522.22">so Chris is swearing to JavaScript</span> <span data-start="522.23" data-end="526.25">as we have a really simple animation so</span> <span data-start="526.25" data-end="529.97">i want to show you four things today in</span> <span data-start="529.97" data-end="531.68">this talk and the first one is going to</span> <span data-start="531.68" data-end="534.83">be building a very simple nice turn</span> <span data-start="534.83" data-end="538.15">based game in bike shed and this is a</span> <span data-start="538.15" data-end="541.7">little story next to this the guy who</span> <span data-start="541.7" data-end="543.8">made the designs for this game he's</span> <span data-start="543.8" data-end="545.69">working noise from from Turkey and I</span> <span data-start="545.69" data-end="547.4">found him through dribble Elementary's</span> <span data-start="547.4" data-end="549.26">know if you know this side for designers</span> <span data-start="549.26" data-end="551.33">and we've built it's got this game</span> <span data-start="551.33" data-end="553.49">entirely using google translate he</span> <span data-start="553.49" data-end="555.44">doesn't speak English so he was pacing</span> <span data-start="555.44" data-end="557.03">his Turkish into google translate and</span> <span data-start="557.03" data-end="559.46">sending it through skype to me and there</span> <span data-start="559.46" data-end="561.92">was a lot of lot of great great laughs</span> <span data-start="561.92" data-end="565.88">for me at least in the end worked out so</span> <span data-start="565.88" data-end="568.49">i'm going to show you this game called</span> <span data-start="568.49" data-end="571.1">nine men's morris basically yeah it's a</span> <span data-start="571.1" data-end="573.2">turn based game you set stones and</span> <span data-start="573.2" data-end="575.18">whenever you have three stones in a row</span> <span data-start="575.18" data-end="577.61">horizontally or vertically you take the</span> <span data-start="577.61" data-end="579.29">stone from your opponent and whenever</span> <span data-start="579.29" data-end="581.45">one of the players has two stones left</span> <span data-start="581.45" data-end="588.86">that player lost so i have it running</span> <span data-start="588.86" data-end="595.37">here now on the ipad so you can drag</span> <span data-start="595.37" data-end="601.17">stones</span> <span data-start="601.18" data-end="604.63">that's pretty pretty simple now i have</span> <span data-start="604.63" data-end="612.61">three stones row i can steal one and so</span> <span data-start="612.61" data-end="615.42">on and so further so if we look at the</span> <span data-start="615.42" data-end="623.89">at the source hold on how how do i do it</span>

data-end="706.21">and so here I you know provided the the</span> <span data-start="706.21" data-end="709.93">address of the node server and now if I</span> <span data-start="709.93"
