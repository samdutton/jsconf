is kind of a self-contained</span> <span data-start="843.55" data-end="845.98">description of a custom element it has</span> <span data-start="845.98" data-end="849.54">you know the name the tag name

<p><span data-start="904.18" data-end="907.75">I want a URL that will set the page</span> <span data-start="907.75" data-end="909.79">property of the applications view model</span> <span
