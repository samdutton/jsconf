<p><span data-start="71.009" data-end="79.88">So there's a real classic and wonderful joke about web expressions.</span> <span data-start="79.88" data-end="85.299">Some people when confronted with a problem think: I know, I will use regular expressions.</span> <span data-start="85.299" data-end="88.61">Now they have two problems.</span> <span data-start="88.61" data-end="92.899">You may have heard this joke from the person sitting next to you at your first job, that's</span> <span data-start="92.899" data-end="100.109">certainly when I first heard it, but the actual source of the quote is a guy named Jamie Zawinski</span> <span data-start="100.109" data-end="109.56">on a group in 1997 and Jamie was an Emacs devotee, approaching the status of a religion</span> <span data-start="109.56" data-end="115.6">for him apparently, and he hated Perl with a passion.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="115.6" data-end="121.65">One of his other really meaty quotes is: Perl combines the power of C with the readability</span> <span data-start="121.65" data-end="123.539">of PostScript.</span> <span data-start="123.539" data-end="127.56">So clearly a man of strong opinions and pithy statements.</span> <span data-start="127.56" data-end="130.239">Why would he say this?</span> <span data-start="130.239" data-end="134.05">Regular expressions are a great tool, aren't they?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="134.05" data-end="142.12">You can use them in a HTML input box to validate the form of input.</span> <span data-start="142.12" data-end="146.26">Obviously you use them all the time when you are trying to match an pattern in text.</span> <span data-start="146.26" data-end="158.07">I've seen websites .. but why would regular expressions be a problem?</span> <span data-start="158.07" data-end="161.81">I rather think it's because of things like this.</span> <span data-start="161.81" data-end="164.319">Can you all actually read this here?</span> <span data-start="164.319" data-end="167.349">Use your hand if you can read it.</span> <span data-start="167.349" data-end="174.25">Okay, okay, so does anyone recognise this nasty scrum of characters and numbers?</span> <span data-start="174.25" data-end="179.4">US phone number, thank you!</span> <span data-start="179.4" data-end="181.44">And wow, it's just gross, isn't it?</span> <span data-start="181.44" data-end="187.409">It's just nasty, looks like something you would pick off the bottom of your shoe programming-wise,</span> <span data-start="187.409" data-end="194.72">and so the reason I think that people — regular expressions are a problem even as they solve</span> <span data-start="194.72" data-end="198.72">problems for us is this lack of comprehensibility.</span> <span data-start="198.72" data-end="209.28">When I need a regular expression at work, I Google it, so I would just Google regular</span> <span data-start="209.28" data-end="213.939">expression for a phone number and take that top Stack Overflow answer and probably most</span> <span data-start="213.939" data-end="222.39">people would do the same, but regular expressions are something more than just something that</span> <span data-start="222.39" data-end="226.31">we, you know, can take somebody else's advice for.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="226.31" data-end="232.061">They are more than something where you find the experienced senior dev in the room, or</span> <span data-start="232.061" data-end="239.189">maybe the one person who you know is a regex whizz and you go ask them for it.</span> <span data-start="239.189" data-end="242.189">They can also be something like this.</span> <span data-start="242.189" data-end="250.989">So I totally stole this beautiful graph from JavaScript [inaudible], a classic, and this</span> <span data-start="250.989" data-end="257.91">is a description of the various ways that white space can be evaluated that code can</span> <span data-start="257.91" data-end="265.06">sort of not be evaluated within JavaScript, and let's run through them [sound problem]</span> <span data-start="265.06" data-end="266.06">.. here.</span> <span data-start="266.06" data-end="268.44">Obviously a space will just be a space.</span> <span data-start="268.44" data-end="274.86">A tab will just be evaluated as a tab, and a line end similarly, nothing will happen.</span> <span data-start="274.86" data-end="283.54">But then we get down into here, so if the parser is running and hits a forward slash,</span> <span data-start="283.54" data-end="288.56">well then, if it sees another forward slash and then it sees any character except for</span> <span data-start="288.56" data-end="295.95">a line end, and it can seen any numbers, so what is that?</span> <span data-start="295.95" data-end="299.14">Of course, it's a comment, yes.</span> <span data-start="299.14" data-end="306.04">Then it gets a little bit more complicated, of course, for our beautiful multiline comment.</span> <span data-start="306.04" data-end="312.14">We have the forward slash, we have an asterisk, ooh, and then I can optionally — you see it's</span> <span data-start="312.14" data-end="316.85">not on the path here — I can optionally have another forward slash but then I have to have</span> <span data-start="316.85" data-end="321.81">any character except the slash and the asterisk, and I can have as many of those as I want.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="321.81" data-end="330.06">But I have to finish off with another asterisk before my final forward slash, and the real</span> <span data-start="330.06" data-end="336.73">meaning of this diagram here is that you cannot — you can have slashes and asterisks within</span> <span data-start="336.73" data-end="342.04">your comment but if you have a slash and then an asterisk, you've closed the comment.</span> <span data-start="342.04" data-end="343.9">And you are done.</span> <span data-start="343.9" data-end="347.3">So, gosh, well what does this have to do with regular expressions?</span> <span data-start="347.3" data-end="351.53">This is a regular expression I wrote for you guys very specially.</span> <span data-start="351.53" data-end="357.21">It really broke my brain, it felt like a test in school because I did actually used to do</span> <span data-start="357.21" data-end="363.54">this at school, I would have a regular diagram like that and have to turn it into a regular</span> <span data-start="363.54" data-end="367.71">expression, not with Perl syntax though, this is Perl syntax which of course is also used</span> <span data-start="367.71" data-end="370.05">in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="370.05" data-end="376.76">Without going into it too much, we have the simple cases, we have a space here, a tab,</span> <span data-start="376.76" data-end="379.58">ooh and then it starts to get clicked.</span> <span data-start="379.58" data-end="387.18">We have these escaped slashes and then line ends, and then this incredibly nasty thing</span> <span data-start="387.18" data-end="393.17">is the — you can have asterisks and slashes but they can't be next to each other unless</span> <span data-start="393.17" data-end="395.35">you are closing out.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="395.35" data-end="400.31">So, what exactly is a regular expression, my gosh?</span> <span data-start="400.31" data-end="404.67">They were defined in the 1950s before there was such a thing as an automatic computer</span> <span data-start="404.67" data-end="406.76">really.</span> <span data-start="406.76" data-end="412.41">So they pre-date the actual machines that we could our work on and they were defined</span> <span data-start="412.41" data-end="417.49">by a wonderful guy named Stephen Culchrane who you love even if you don't know who he</span> <span data-start="417.49" data-end="425.22">is because he is responsible for this little star, the clean star, which you probably use</span> <span data-start="425.22" data-end="430.25">all the time.</span> <span data-start="430.25" data-end="436.34">The clean star is not part of regular expressions per se; it's rather, I would say, a notation</span> <span data-start="436.34" data-end="441.96">that we very frequently use in regular expressions and probably the most commonly used of all</span> <span data-start="441.96" data-end="446.45">pattern matchers is: tick everything, star.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="446.45" data-end="448.44">Yes, I love this very much.</span> <span data-start="448.44" data-end="451.94">I think it's very pretty and also useful.</span> <span data-start="451.94" data-end="454.69">So what exactly makes a regular expression?</span> <span data-start="454.69" data-end="460.84">It's a set of characters that describe other characters with origins in the attempt to</span> <span data-start="460.84" data-end="465.49">describe natural language in a computable way.</span> <span data-start="465.49" data-end="471">So we have that pipe.</span> <span data-start="471" data-end="477.77">We have the concept of grouping, the notion that if I have ABCD, or AXYD then that is</span> <span data-start="477.77" data-end="485.19">equivalent to ABC or XYD; and then lastly, quantification.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="485.19" data-end="494.97">This syntax may be familiar to you, the question mark is I believe 01, the star is of course</span> <span data-start="494.97" data-end="500.95">0 pipe, and the plus is 11 or more.</span> <span data-start="500.95" data-end="502.33">So we've got all that.</span> <span data-start="502.33" data-end="507.48">We kind of know what we are talking about here, but let's try to place regular expressions</span> <span data-start="507.48" data-end="515.25">in sort of a wider world of concepts, a wider world of attempts to describe language, and</span> <span data-start="515.25" data-end="521.43">actually we think of ourselves as web developers, we do code, but code is language and it is</span> <span data-start="521.43" data-end="526.69">specifically an attempt to translate human language into language that computers can</span> <span data-start="526.69" data-end="532.32">understand, and regular expressions are just one in a whole set of toolboxes for doing</span> <span data-start="532.32" data-end="537.949">this, and they were described by this gentleman, who may be familiar to you, this is Noam Chomsky,</span> <span data-start="537.949" data-end="545.37">who in addition to his wonderful political opinions also is responsible for the Chomsky</span> <span data-start="545.37" data-end="550.71">Hierarchy of Grammars so as you can see regular expressions are down here, the most limited</span> <span data-start="550.71" data-end="555.92">subset of the Noam Chomsky hierarchy and then we work air way up through the context free</span> <span data-start="555.92" data-end="562.04">and others, so what are these?</span> <span data-start="562.04" data-end="566.769">Actually the type zero unrestricted grammar is something that you are also all familiar</span> <span data-start="566.769" data-end="572.88">with and I say I am familiar with these machines in the same way as regular expressions — I'm</span> <span data-start="572.88" data-end="578.61">certainly not an expert, I just know they help me do the things I need to do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="578.61" data-end="580.17">What exactly is a Turing machine?</span> <span data-start="580.17" data-end="584.709">This is a Turing machine that somebody built with Lego.</span> <span data-start="584.709" data-end="588.66">It has wheels and goes back and forth.</span> <span data-start="588.66" data-end="597.86">We have a beautiful quote which I am going to read out: a Turing machine is an unlimited</span> <span data-start="597.86" data-end="602.839">memory capacity obtained in the form of an infinite tape marked out onto squares on each</span> <span data-start="602.839" data-end="604.589">of which a symbol could be printed.</span> <span data-start="604.589" data-end="609.25">At any moment there is one symbol in the machine, it is called the scan symbol.</span> <span data-start="609.25" data-end="613.54">The machine can alter the scan symbol and its behaviour is in part determined by that</span> <span data-start="613.54" data-end="618.279">symbol but the symbols on the tape elsewhere do not affect the behaviour of the machine.</span> <span data-start="618.279" data-end="624.319">However, the tape can be moved back and forth, this being one of the elementary operations</span> <span data-start="624.319" data-end="625.569">of the machine.</span> <span data-start="625.569" data-end="628.54">Any symbol on the tape may therefore eventually have an innings.</span> <span data-start="628.54" data-end="633.149">That is a quote from Alan Turing, I think in addition to being a brilliant computer</span> <span data-start="633.149" data-end="638.879">scientist and truly the father of the industry that we work in now, he was a lovely writer</span> <span data-start="638.879" data-end="639.879">as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="639.879" data-end="645.399">So Alan Turing, of course, committed suicide after he began to be persecuted by the British</span> <span data-start="645.399" data-end="649.97">Government for being gay, and I think there's a lot of irony in the fact that a man who</span> <span data-start="649.97" data-end="657.22">contributed so much to our understanding of patterns and communication literally died</span> <span data-start="657.22" data-end="662.62">for not fitting a pattern that was prescribed by the society that he lived in.</span> <span data-start="662.62" data-end="667.649">Well, moving right along, type 1 grammars, they are boring.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="667.649" data-end="670.31">I don't really understand what the use case is for them.</span> <span data-start="670.31" data-end="672.66">It seems to be mostly theoretical.</span> <span data-start="672.66" data-end="679.339">But they are called context-sensitive because they come with a little bit of context.</span> <span data-start="679.339" data-end="683.249">So I don't know them, I don't know her.</span> <span data-start="683.249" data-end="688.37">The type 2 grammars on the other hand, I'm not going to read out all this math, it comes</span> <span data-start="688.37" data-end="693.98">from Wikipedia, I do encourage you to look this up, but most programming languages are</span> <span data-start="693.98" data-end="699.87">interpreted by computers as type 2 languages so as we are moving up this hierarchy here.</span> <span data-start="699.87" data-end="704.589">And type 2 has something extremely important, type 2 languages have a stack.</span> <span data-start="704.589" data-end="708.56">So you will note that in a regular — of course, in a regular expression there's no concept</span> <span data-start="708.56" data-end="710.49">of memory.</span> <span data-start="710.49" data-end="716.16">You are only — you don't know, as you are matching that pattern, the things that you've</span> <span data-start="716.16" data-end="721.16">seen before but once you have the introduction of a stack you can keep track of the past</span> <span data-start="721.16" data-end="726.85">and use it to help you evaluate the current input.</span> <span data-start="726.85" data-end="733.069">Then type 3 grammars are irregular expressions and they are equivalent to finite-state automata</span> <span data-start="733.069" data-end="738.899">which is something else you may have used, perhaps a finite-state machine library for</span> <span data-start="738.899" data-end="745.35">some context at work so regular expressions are mathematically equivalent, they can always</span> <span data-start="745.35" data-end="752.16">be translated in between each other, and this is a picture from my native city.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="752.16" data-end="759.61">These are some turnstiles at a subway stop in Harlem and subway turnstiles are actually</span> <span data-start="759.61" data-end="765.56">one of the classic examples of a finite-state machine, and I will show you how.</span> <span data-start="765.56" data-end="769.85">So the way that a turnstile used to work, now pretend that the coin is a Metro card</span> <span data-start="769.85" data-end="777.77">swipe, these coins are obsolete unfortunately, if the machine is locked then no matter how</span> <span data-start="777.77" data-end="779.87">much you push, nothing will happen.</span> <span data-start="779.87" data-end="781.579">You return to the locked state.</span> <span data-start="781.579" data-end="786.439">But if you put in a coin, then you are in the unlocked state and no matter how many</span> <span data-start="786.439" data-end="789.98">coins you put in, it will still be unlocked, you have done nothing to it.</span> <span data-start="789.98" data-end="794.459">I have actually done this, swiped my Metro card accidentally multiple times, spending</span> <span data-start="794.459" data-end="802.07">$275 each time, very frustrating, but then if you push through the turnstile, you return</span> <span data-start="802.07" data-end="807.509">to that locked state and you can only get out of it again by putting in a coin.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="807.509" data-end="817.769">So you could actually write a regular expression for this where you represent where the coin</span> <span data-start="817.769" data-end="827.149">and push would be your letters, your characters in it, and the locked and unlocked states</span> <span data-start="827.149" data-end="831.829">would be the potential states that you could get to.</span> <span data-start="831.829" data-end="837.439">So one thing that you may have heard, it's another thing that I heard sort of second</span> <span data-start="837.439" data-end="843.249">hand at my first job, is that you can't parse HTML with a regular expression and the reason</span> <span data-start="843.249" data-end="850.779">for that is the same thing that I said about the context free grammars, they have a stack,</span> <span data-start="850.779" data-end="851.779">right?</span> <span data-start="851.779" data-end="854.85">So to parse HTML we need that stack.</span> <span data-start="854.85" data-end="860.399">We need to put down the HTML tag and then we need to put down the body tag and then</span> <span data-start="860.399" data-end="866.209">we need to put down our headers and build up that stack and as we unparse or get to</span> <span data-start="866.209" data-end="872.639">the end of the execution, we start popping those elements, author stack as we see their</span> <span data-start="872.639" data-end="879.149">closing tags, and that's how we get proper HTML parsing, so that again because regular</span> <span data-start="879.149" data-end="885.459">expressions do not have a stack, do not have a sense of memory, cannot be done with a true</span> <span data-start="885.459" data-end="887.449">regular expression.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="887.449" data-end="892.709">But the regular expressions that you use in programming languages like JavaScript which</span> <span data-start="892.709" data-end="900.569">takes its implementation from Perl, and Perl I think has been the most significant influence</span> <span data-start="900.569" data-end="906.769">on the development of regular expressions in sort of day-to-day programming — you know,</span> <span data-start="906.769" data-end="910.139">I personally, one of the very first things I ever had to do that somebody paid me to</span> <span data-start="910.139" data-end="915.54">write code for was to write Perl scripts to parse some documents and put them into a different</span> <span data-start="915.54" data-end="916.6">directory structure.</span> <span data-start="916.6" data-end="918.8">It's a good task for an intern actually.</span> <span data-start="918.8" data-end="920.98">You learn a lot.</span> <span data-start="920.98" data-end="932.809">So Perl expressions have features, those negative look-aheads that make them no longer pure</span> <span data-start="932.809" data-end="940.269">regular expressions but capable of a wider variety of tasks than true regular expressions</span> <span data-start="940.269" data-end="942.339">are.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="942.339" data-end="948.779">So from that I have a quote from Larry Wall who did create Perl so probably the worst</span> <span data-start="948.779" data-end="954.089">enemy of that Jamie guy I quoted earlier.</span> <span data-start="954.089" data-end="960.05">"The term has grown with the capabilities of our pattern-matching engines, so I am not</span> <span data-start="960.05" data-end="962.16">going to fight linguistic necessity here."</span> <span data-start="962.16" data-end="963.25">A wise man.</span> <span data-start="963.25" data-end="975.819">"I will, however, call them regexes .."  so what's the difference really?</span> <span data-start="975.819" data-end="983.179">Those regular expressions meet the criteria, the deterministic criteria in particular it's</span> <span data-start="983.179" data-end="987.91">important to remember, that each of its transitions is uniquely determined by its source state</span> <span data-start="987.91" data-end="994.819">and input symbol and reading an input symbol is important for each transition; with the</span> <span data-start="994.819" data-end="1008.29">power of modern regexes, has actually become quite divorced from the underpinning of the</span> <span data-start="1008.29" data-end="1011.61">regular concept, lovely as those are.</span> <span data-start="1011.61" data-end="1019.929">So again a regex has only its state and a Turing machine has memory, and regexes therefore</span> <span data-start="1019.929" data-end="1025.49">are appropriate for a sort of service level parsing of information.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1025.49" data-end="1028.79">They are very useful and they help us a lot.</span> <span data-start="1028.79" data-end="1037.95">They still are only one tool for us and as with many things, as with many things in programming,</span> <span data-start="1037.95" data-end="1040.59">right, a limit is not necessarily bad.</span> <span data-start="1040.59" data-end="1046.11">If you were using a limited set of tools, you may see better performance because there</span> <span data-start="1046.11" data-end="1056.14">is less that it has to do, whereas so regexes exist then in a very limited world that is</span> <span data-start="1056.14" data-end="1063.64">connected to a much broader world of computation and of the attempt to let computers understand</span> <span data-start="1063.64" data-end="1070.65">humans, so there's a sort of a sad ending to a lot of the attempts to describe human</span> <span data-start="1070.65" data-end="1077.55">language that many like Turing and Chomsky were working on, and this was sort of the</span> <span data-start="1077.55" data-end="1086.11">post-war attempt to turn human language into a set of rules that machines could understand</span> <span data-start="1086.11" data-end="1093.86">easily and the notion that we would be able to find a theoretical description of all human</span> <span data-start="1093.86" data-end="1095.2">language.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1095.2" data-end="1099.11">I think as programmers you all know better than anyone else that we are never going to</span> <span data-start="1099.11" data-end="1100.39">achieve that, right?</span> <span data-start="1100.39" data-end="1108.25">We are probably never going to write a programme that deterministically understands human input.</span> <span data-start="1108.25" data-end="1114.51">This is actually, the rise of machine learning and non-deterministic algorithms to parse</span> <span data-start="1114.51" data-end="1122.51">language is a recognition of the notion that we don't have — we will never find a true</span> <span data-start="1122.51" data-end="1128.24">answer, a correct answer; we can only throw a bunch of guesses at the wall and determine</span> <span data-start="1128.24" data-end="1133.81">which one is closest to our understanding as humans.</span> <span data-start="1133.81" data-end="1140.73">So I will leave you with — there wasn't that much JavaScript in this talk, right?</span> <span data-start="1140.73" data-end="1142.96">So it's right here.</span> <span data-start="1142.96" data-end="1147.71">This is about the implementation of other expressions than JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1147.71" data-end="1152.67">Of course you may declare a regular expression in one of two ways, either with those lovely</span> <span data-start="1152.67" data-end="1163.64">backslashes or with the regex constructure so the previous one is for a value that will</span> <span data-start="1163.64" data-end="1168.74">never change whereas if you want to construct a regex dynamically and have it evaluated,</span> <span data-start="1168.74" data-end="1173.96">please use the constructor and enjoy writing regular expressions in JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1173.96" data-end="1175.99">I certainly do.</span> <span data-start="1175.99" data-end="1182">So here I have been thinking a lot about regular expressions since making this talk.</span> <span data-start="1182" data-end="1194.51">I sort of have a vision of applications as being modelled like that turnstile, of designers</span> <span data-start="1194.51" data-end="1203.37">making automata .. and then somehow turning that into regular expression.</span> <span data-start="1203.37" data-end="1207.34">I don't know how that would look but it's really cool.</span> <span data-start="1207.34" data-end="1212.77">They are also really good with games, so write that with a regular expression.</span> <span data-start="1212.77" data-end="1219.84">I think you could also make some cool web art [sound problem] .. obviously writing</span> <span data-start="1219.84" data-end="1228.56">a chatbot that's too obvious for words, but a lot of us, because we are web developers</span> <span data-start="1228.56" data-end="1235.99">and eager to take any tool that works, we — if we don't know about the theoretical underpinnings</span> <span data-start="1235.99" data-end="1240">of this they can remain very opaque and difficult to understand.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1240" data-end="1243.89">I have a math background and still look at the Wikipedia definition of these things and,</span> <span data-start="1243.89" data-end="1252.74">oh, it breaks my brain, but knowledge and education is a treasure and knowing how things</span> <span data-start="1252.74" data-end="1258.13">work, even if it's not going to help you in your day-to-day is, I think, something that</span> <span data-start="1258.13" data-end="1262.4">is very beautiful and very useful, and it will enrich your understanding of what you</span> <span data-start="1262.4" data-end="1264.45">do on a day-to-day basis.</span> <span data-start="1264.45" data-end="1272.36">So seek out theory, and also don't blame other people for not having knowledge of theory.</span> <span data-start="1272.36" data-end="1276.88">Get as much as you can and give as much to other people, and I think that's the way to</span> <span data-start="1276.88" data-end="1278.68">be a truly effective programmer.</span> <span data-start="1278.68" data-end="1281.59">Thank you very much.</span> </p>
