data-start="379.06" data-end="380.919">sounds offensive but how many here think</span> <span data-start="380.919" data-end="386.53">they know JavaScript okay so that was</span> <span data-start="386.53" data-end="388.12">just scary I think everyone in actually</span> <span data-start="388.12" data-end="390.759">knows java script so I'll go pretty fast</span> <span data-start="390.759" data-end="393.039">here in the beginning and I'll kind of</span> <span data-start="393.039" data-end="396.18">slow down and if it goes weird just way</span> <span data-start="396.18" data-end="400.919">or won't leave the basics of java script</span> <span data-start="400.919" data-end="403.83">is well as basic as it gets we can just</span> <span data-start="403.83" data-end="406.47">define the variable that's it you just</span> <span data-start="406.47" data-end="408.57">have a VAR keyword a name for it then it</span> <span data-start="408.57" data-end="412.65">equals a value and the same goes for</span> <span data-start="412.65" data-end="415.08">functions that's pretty much it we have</span> <span data-start="415.08" data-end="416.789">a function we have a name and just the</span> <span data-start="416.789" data-end="420.09">content of the function I know well</span> <span data-start="420.09" data-end="422.28">worth the money so far probably learning</span> <span data-start="422.28" data-end="425.85">a lot right now but when it starts to</span> <span data-start="425.85" data-end="427.169">get interesting is when we talk about</span> <span data-start="427.169" data-end="429.509">conditionals and we have four types and</span> <span data-start="429.509" data-end="431.639">conditionals in JavaScript you have if</span> <span data-start="431.639" data-end="434.25">statements which statements we also have</span> <span data-start="434.25" data-end="435.84">shortened assignments and ternary</span> <span data-start="435.84" data-end="437.759">operators and then they're pretty close</span> <span data-start="437.759" data-end="440.34">to each other and shortened assignment</span> <span data-start="440.34" data-end="444.18">is basically for us cool developers who</span> <span data-start="444.18" data-end="446.43">want to do one liners or actually</span> <span data-start="446.43" data-end="449.789">readable as well is as you see here if</span> <span data-start="449.789" data-end="451.83">we send in the parameter with Liv Tyler</span> <span data-start="451.83" data-end="455.82">if that is equals true the value will be</span> <span data-start="455.82" data-end="458.52">true for the variable lines here we just</span> <span data-start="458.52" data-end="461.22">have the or in the middle so it goes to</span> <span data-start="461.22" data-end="462.69">fall so you can just assign something</span> <span data-start="462.69" data-end="467.52">online it's pretty close to the ternary</span> <span data-start="467.52" data-end="472.889">operators which is just a small if case</span> <span data-start="472.889" data-end="475.349">basically so you have within the party</span> <span data-start="475.349" data-end="478.68">sis you have a value to sorry and</span> <span data-start="478.68" data-end="481.83">if it equals true that value comes</span> <span data-start="481.83" data-end="483.18">through otherwise the other things</span> <span data-start="483.18" data-end="489">happen and that's with any other</span> <span data-start="489" data-end="491.37">language we have the one equal sign to</span> <span data-start="491.37" data-end="493.77">assign the value regular assignment and</span> <span data-start="493.77" data-end="495.63">two equal science is to check equality</span> <span data-start="495.63" data-end="498.36">but javascript also has this funky</span> <span data-start="498.36" data-end="500.699">syntax with three equal signs which</span> <span data-start="500.699" data-end="502.62">usually mess people up and the reaction</span> <span data-start="502.62" data-end="504.06">is usually I haven't seen this anywhere</span> <span data-start="504.06" data-end="506.82">else you know screw it i'll use the two</span> <span data-start="506.82" data-end="509.039">but it actually makes a difference in</span> <span data-start="509.039" data-end="512.459">practice and you know one is just</span> <span data-start="512.459" data-end="514.05">assignment as you see here but the thing</span> <span data-start="514.05" data-end="516.659">here with equality with two equal signs</span> <span data-start="516.659" data-end="519.57">is that the number 5 equals the string 5</span> <span data-start="519.57" data-end="522.719">and that's because javascript is trying</span> <span data-start="522.719" data-end="525.39">to be nice and kind of figure out what</span> <span data-start="525.39" data-end="526.47">you actually meant</span> <span data-start="526.47" data-end="529.41">comparative values so to cover up for</span> <span data-start="529.41" data-end="531.21">something like that instead you want to</span> <span data-start="531.21" data-end="533.94">use three equal signs because the three</span> <span data-start="533.94" data-end="536.46">equal signs will not only compare the</span> <span data-start="536.46" data-end="539.19">value it will also compare the type of</span> <span data-start="539.19" data-end="541.56">what you're comparing so both of them</span> <span data-start="541.56" data-end="544.32">have to be a number or a string to be</span> <span data-start="544.32" data-end="553.74">true and as with any language javascript</span> <span data-start="553.74" data-end="556.32">is based on short circuit logic which</span> <span data-start="556.32" data-end="558.6">means that you don't analysis it all the</span> <span data-start="558.6" data-end="560.16">time when I work as a consultant than</span> <span data-start="560.16" data-end="563.34">people are nest about 15 if closest and</span> <span data-start="563.34" data-end="565.71">it's 400 lines and code you don't need</span> <span data-start="565.71"

data-end="2442.22">slice method because the result of the</span> <span data-start="2442.22" data-end="2446.499">slice method will return an array I know</span> <span data-start="2446.499" data-end="2450.44">but it goes on we have the disc keyword</span> <span data-start="2450.44" data-end="2452.72">and this keyword is for serve and it's</span> <span data-start="2452.72"

data-end="2473.839">remember the value of args which is just</span> <span data-start="2473.839" data-end="2477.71">the arguments as an array so I can use</span> <span data-start="2477.71"

data-end="2495.529">it just seems well annoying and you know</span> <span data-start="2495.529" data-end="2497.059">should I really know this and where it</span> <span data-start="2497.059"

data-end="2505.19">remembering the result of some action</span> <span data-start="2505.19" data-end="2507.079">and then keep on working from that</span> <span data-start="2507.079"

data-end="2514.91">is that we have just like before when</span> <span data-start="2514.91" data-end="2517.849">we're adding up numbers that the first</span> <span data-start="2517.849" data-end="2519.769">time we call the chiro method with any</span> <span data-start="2519.769" data-end="2521.869">number of arguments we want it will</span> <span data-start="2521.869" data-end="2523.94">remember the result to thatís or</span> <span data-start="2523.94" data-end="2526.099">actually be the value of all those</span> <span data-start="2526.099" data-end="2529.279">parameters then when we call that again</span> <span data-start="2529.279" data-end="2530.809">with nother one actually means we can</span> <span data-start="2530.809"
