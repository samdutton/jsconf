<p><span data-start="16.2" data-end="17.2">Yesterday she did the node bots workshop and now says that she's completely and utterly</span> <span data-start="17.2" data-end="18.2">obsessed with building robots and wants to go home a build and a robot.</span> <span data-start="18.2" data-end="19.2">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="19.2" data-end="20.2">She's got a competing thing, she's a knitter, I was in the other room, I'm bummed I missed</span> <span data-start="20.2" data-end="21.2">it.</span> <span data-start="21.2" data-end="22.2">Has gotten her thinking about knitting.</span> <span data-start="22.2" data-end="23.2">She can't decide what she wants to do, build a robot or just knit.</span> <span data-start="23.2" data-end="24.2">And I think she should just build a robot that knits.</span> <span data-start="24.2" data-end="25.2">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="25.2" data-end="26.2">All right.</span> <span data-start="26.2" data-end="27.2">So, everyone, please give it up for our final speaker of JSConf US 2019, Hayley Denbraver.</span> <span data-start="27.2" data-end="28.2">[ Applause ] HAYLEY: All right.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="35.2" data-end="36.2">So, welcome to this meeting for the board of the Ingen corporation held here at JSConf</span> <span data-start="36.2" data-end="37.2">US.</span> <span data-start="37.2" data-end="38.2">I have spoken to a few of you, but for others who I haven't met yet, my name is Hayley Denbraver</span> <span data-start="38.2" data-end="42.57">and I've been hired to analyze the failures that occurred during the incident at IslaNublar.</span> <span data-start="42.57" data-end="46.579">There is maybe uncertainty about the project moving forward.</span> <span data-start="46.579" data-end="49.25">And that's why I'm here.</span> <span data-start="49.25" data-end="55.77">I was hired to review the recent incident and to catalog the points of failure and to</span> <span data-start="55.77" data-end="59.62">suggest some next steps for the project.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="59.62" data-end="67.77">So, I'm going to talk to you today there's gonna be four parts, all right?</span> <span data-start="67.77" data-end="72.259">And first we're going to review the events of the weekend so we can all be working from</span> <span data-start="72.259" data-end="75.07">the same set of facts.</span> <span data-start="75.07" data-end="80.89">Second, I'm going to dive into the flaws within our design workflow.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="80.89" data-end="87.38">Now, this isn't going to be about failures within the code itself, but it's more about</span> <span data-start="87.38" data-end="91.63">our process and our practice of software engineering.</span> <span data-start="91.63" data-end="96.209">Third, we're going to discuss engineering ethics.</span> <span data-start="96.209" data-end="103.799">And look into how ethical breaches compromised this project.</span> <span data-start="103.799" data-end="107.96">And finally, I'm going to cover the idea of chaos engineering.</span> <span data-start="107.96" data-end="114.929">And I'm going to suggest some steps that we could take to build a more resilient Jurassic</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="170.36" data-end="172.27">Dr. Grant is a paleontologist.</span> <span data-start="172.27" data-end="178.85">And he works with his post doc, Dr. Sattler, a paleo botanist.</span> <span data-start="178.85" data-end="185.89">Dr. Ian Malcolm has a Ph.D. in mathematics and he's an expert in something called chaos</span> <span data-start="185.89" data-end="187.5">theory.</span> <span data-start="187.5" data-end="192.31">He details this as the idea that systems are really complex.</span> <span data-start="192.31" data-end="198.78">And that they're likely to behave in unpredictable ways, even when small changes or flaws are</span> <span data-start="198.78" data-end="200.23">introduced.</span> <span data-start="200.23" data-end="207.72">Recent staff members include John Hammond, who is the creator of the park.</span> <span data-start="207.72" data-end="213.51">Dennis Nedry who was the lead software developer for Jurassic Park.</span> <span data-start="213.51" data-end="218.06">Dr. Woo, the head scientist.</span> <span data-start="218.06" data-end="223.499">Robert Muldoon who was our game warden.</span> <span data-start="223.499" data-end="231.629">John Arnold who was our chief engineer and Donald Gennaro who was our chief counsel.</span> <span data-start="231.629" data-end="233.349">All right.</span> <span data-start="233.349" data-end="237.9">So, now that we know the team, let's discuss the events.</span> <span data-start="237.9" data-end="243.93">After a construction worker was killed in an accident, Grant, Sattler and Malcolm were</span> <span data-start="243.93" data-end="247.72">brought to the park to render their professional opinions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="247.72" data-end="254.65">Malcolm was aware of the nature of the park and was against the project.</span> <span data-start="254.65" data-end="259.43">He was convinced that the park would never work because of chaos theory and we're gonna</span> <span data-start="259.43" data-end="262.68">discuss that more later.</span> <span data-start="262.68" data-end="265.93">Grant and Sattler were unaware of the true nature of the park.</span> <span data-start="265.93" data-end="270.16">They thought it was something more Akin to a museum.</span> <span data-start="270.16" data-end="277.02">But they were initially surprised and delighted by the dinosaurs.</span> <span data-start="277.02" data-end="281.12">While this visit was taking place, Dennis Nedry was on site to take care of software</span> <span data-start="281.12" data-end="282.12">bugs.</span> <span data-start="282.12" data-end="286.9">We have since learned that he was unhappy with the terms of his contract.</span> <span data-start="286.9" data-end="292.75">A while back he was approached by a competitor who wanted to open a similar park and wasn't</span> <span data-start="292.75" data-end="300.36">above bribing Nedry to steal embryos to which he agreed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="300.36" data-end="305.06">There was a significant storm while some of our people were on a tour of the park.</span> <span data-start="305.06" data-end="307.91">A number of systems went down.</span> <span data-start="307.91" data-end="310.169">Some of the result of the storm.</span> <span data-start="310.169" data-end="316.97">And others because Nedry had purposely brought them down in order to execute his plan.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="316.97" data-end="322.05">Most notably, the electric fences went down.</span> <span data-start="322.05" data-end="326.54">Nedry died while trying to get the embryos to his handler.</span> <span data-start="326.54" data-end="334.169">And was not able to look at the purposeful software vulnerabilities that he had included</span> <span data-start="334.169" data-end="343.08">to execute his plan, or the multitude of software bugs that were there anyway.</span> <span data-start="343.08" data-end="346.699">Grant discovered that some of the dinosaurs had been breeding.</span> <span data-start="346.699" data-end="350.5">Even though this was supposed to be impossible.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="350.5" data-end="354.259">Because we had made sure that all of the dinosaurs are female.</span> <span data-start="354.259" data-end="362.599">Geneticist, Dr. Wu, used frog DNA to fill in the holes in the genetic code and apparently</span> <span data-start="362.599" data-end="368.83">certain species of frogs can change sex when in a single sex environment in order to continue</span> <span data-start="368.83" data-end="370.49">the species.</span> <span data-start="370.49" data-end="375.61">Or as Malcolm puts it, life finds a way.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="375.61" data-end="381.34">While Grant and others were evading raptors, Dr. Sattler with the help of Muldoon and Arnold</span> <span data-start="381.34" data-end="386.25">was able to manually reboot the power and Hammond's granddaughter was able to get the</span> <span data-start="386.25" data-end="390.68">computer up and running again because she knows UNIX.</span> <span data-start="390.68" data-end="396.19">[ Laughter ] This success this success came at a high</span> <span data-start="396.19" data-end="402.889">cost because both Muldoon and Arnold were lost in the effort.</span> <span data-start="402.889" data-end="405.3">And they weren't the only ones.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="405.3" data-end="413.5">During this incident, we lost Nedry, Muldoon, Arnold and Gennaro and we also lost the construction</span> <span data-start="413.5" data-end="416.33">worker previously.</span> <span data-start="416.33" data-end="419.91">There were also many, many close calls.</span> <span data-start="419.91" data-end="423.389">God, we have a lot of hiring to do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="423.389" data-end="426.069">Check the website, okay?</span> <span data-start="426.069" data-end="429.909">[ Laughter ] The remaining team members with various injuries</span> <span data-start="429.909" data-end="435.669">and traumas were able to escape once the storm had cleared and the T Rex and the velociraptors</span> <span data-start="435.669" data-end="442.52">were keeping each other busy and this brings the relevant facts to a close.</span> <span data-start="442.52" data-end="443.52">Okay.</span> <span data-start="443.52" data-end="449.81">Now that we're on the same page, let's talk about software engineering at Jurassic Park.</span> <span data-start="449.81" data-end="456.139">John Hammond claims that he spared no expense in the creation of this park.</span> <span data-start="456.139" data-end="458.87">But this really isn't the case.</span> <span data-start="458.87" data-end="465.78">The resort is luxurious, and yes, genetic engineering is pricey, but I determined through</span> <span data-start="465.78" data-end="470.62">my research that we dropped the ball when it comes to software.</span> <span data-start="470.62" data-end="472.949">We're going to look at the pitfalls.</span> <span data-start="472.949" data-end="481.4">In this area, I am going to be nice to Nedry, but I have harsh words for him later.</span> <span data-start="481.4" data-end="486.59">From the evidence I've gathered, it's hard to believe this.</span> <span data-start="486.59" data-end="493.49">But it was clear that Nedry did not know that he was writing software for a dinosaur park.</span> <span data-start="493.49" data-end="499.319">Instead, I discovered that the requirements he had been given included vague instructions</span> <span data-start="499.319" data-end="506.3">like write software that will dispense food at prerecorded times.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="506.3" data-end="511.77">Write software to monitor a series of electric fences.</span> <span data-start="511.77" data-end="516.77">Write software to visually scan the area and report back.</span> <span data-start="516.77" data-end="521.1">Nedry eventually figured out what the software was for.</span> <span data-start="521.1" data-end="525.7">And he had his suspicions confirmed by our competitors.</span> <span data-start="525.7" data-end="528.26">But he should have been in from the first.</span> <span data-start="528.26" data-end="533.77">And if we didn't trust him to be in from the first, then we should have hired someone else</span> <span data-start="533.77" data-end="536.95">even if that would have cost more.</span> <span data-start="536.95" data-end="541.02">Hammond was trying to be competitive by keeping his plans under wraps.</span> <span data-start="541.02" data-end="545.67">But he was setting himself up for failure by not giving his software development team</span> <span data-start="545.67" data-end="549.69">critical information.</span> <span data-start="549.69" data-end="554.58">In addition to not telling Nedry what the software's for, an unrealistic timeline was</span> <span data-start="554.58" data-end="555.58">enforced.</span> <span data-start="555.58" data-end="558.88">There was scope creep, insufficient budgeting.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="558.88" data-end="563.96">For instance, Nedry tried to get more money to fix problems, but was threatened with retaliation.</span> <span data-start="563.96" data-end="570.1">And when the scope creep in the budget is blown, how much testing do you think really</span> <span data-start="570.1" data-end="576.47">happens and what critical features do you think are deemed "Good enough"?</span> <span data-start="576.47" data-end="582.56">Now, don't get me wrong, all code has bugs and problems.</span> <span data-start="582.56" data-end="586.28">Everyone no one's perfect and everyone has their fair share of flaws.</span> <span data-start="586.28" data-end="590.41">And a project can always be improved.</span> <span data-start="590.41" data-end="598.03">But not perfect code is a far cry from poorly designed, poorly documented, untested code</span> <span data-start="598.03" data-end="602.53">running in a production environment that includes velociraptors.</span> <span data-start="602.53" data-end="605.73">All right.</span> <span data-start="605.73" data-end="612.17">So, it's clear that we didn't approach how the design of Jurassic Park in a way to best</span> <span data-start="612.17" data-end="616.33">ensure the success and safety of the project.</span> <span data-start="616.33" data-end="621.85">But I also want to discuss the breaches in ethical practice that occurred because they're</span> <span data-start="621.85" data-end="625.79">undoubtedly a cause of the problem as well.</span> <span data-start="625.79" data-end="630.12">So, who here has heard of the Hippocratic oath?</span> <span data-start="630.12" data-end="632.24">Lots of people.</span> <span data-start="632.24" data-end="633.24">Okay.</span> </p>
