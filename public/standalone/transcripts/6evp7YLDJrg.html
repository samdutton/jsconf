<p><span data-start="20.48" data-end="37.94">Hello. So, yes, who am I? As Alex said, I am Nick Hehr. I am first and foremost and</span> <span data-start="37.94" data-end="46.03">empathetic community member and next I am a Front‑End developer at a company called</span> <span data-start="46.03" data-end="50.44">namely, I'm also a Disney fan, that's topical, if you want to talk to me later about</span> <span data-start="50.44" data-end="57.579">something, huge fan of the parks and movies, I'm also a bouldering enthusiast, pretty big</span> <span data-start="57.579" data-end="64.83">here in Berlin and Germany in general, and New York as well, where I'm from. And if you</span> <span data-start="64.83" data-end="77.009">haven't noticed yet, I have petty wicked mustache. Oh, no, is the animation not working</span> <span data-start="77.009" data-end="80.03">(Wicked). But important thing about this, it's not to</span> <span data-start="80.03" data-end="84.35">be touched, you wouldn't believe how many times I've had to tell people that. (Laughing)</span> <span data-start="84.35" data-end="93.3">Jan knows what I'm talking about. So, why do I care about what I'm speaking about today,</span> <span data-start="93.3" data-end="101.509">why do I care about empathy in general? And I care because my badge ground is actually</span> <span data-start="101.509" data-end="107.84">in psychology, and degree in leadership as well, so a lot around people and how people</span> <span data-start="107.84" data-end="116.209">work together it's very important to Maine as part of my job professionally, I'm in constant</span> <span data-start="116.209" data-end="122.17">collaboration with designers to make sure that their visual ideas get Translated to</span> <span data-start="122.17" data-end="128.22">the pages very efficiently and well. And also working with back‑end developers to make</span> <span data-start="128.22" data-end="134.23">sure the data thaw create on the API side comes to the Front‑End and is communicated</span> <span data-start="134.23" data-end="141.33">back and forth efficiently at the same time. And then, I also love the community. This</span> <span data-start="141.33" data-end="145.98">is one of the reasons I chose to keep working and as soon as I started learning about web</span> <span data-start="145.98" data-end="150.409">development and continued working in that community because it's just so nice. And I</span> <span data-start="150.409" data-end="157.79">love every part of the community, it's just so much fun for me. And then there's this</span> <span data-start="157.79" data-end="162.34">very specific group of people that should care about this, about empathy in general</span> <span data-start="162.34" data-end="176.43">and that's everybody. Siriusly (Laughing). But that is empathy? Empathy is the ability</span> <span data-start="176.43" data-end="183.379">to understand and share the feelings of another. If anyone saw Myles talk had gentlemen correctJS</span> <span data-start="183.379" data-end="191.18">it's feeling with someone else, not for someone else. And it's a very widely talked about</span> <span data-start="191.18" data-end="197.17">tool or resource for designers, and we'll talk about it a lot just being empathetic</span> <span data-start="197.17" data-end="202.959">for your users and feeling how they would feel, and seeing the world through the eyes</span> <span data-start="202.959" data-end="208.87">of someone else in order to create the best user experience for them. But, how can we</span> <span data-start="208.87" data-end="215.749">take this and apply it to how we work with other people? And how can we make our products</span> <span data-start="215.749" data-end="223.45">so much better by doing this? Because we're so focused on tools these days that, and there's</span> <span data-start="223.45" data-end="229.819">just wonderful, how can we also focus on the people behind those tools. That's kind of</span> <span data-start="229.819" data-end="235.04">around where empathy\h‑‑ the other side of empathy comes from and this concept. And</span> <span data-start="235.04" data-end="241.01">first it came from using Twitter. I love Twitter, it's such a great resource and medium for</span> <span data-start="241.01" data-end="247.129">connecting with people and learning more about the community, but, there's a lot of people</span> <span data-start="247.129" data-end="254.569">out there, and it's sometimes leads to some snap judgements because it's so easy to put</span> <span data-start="254.569" data-end="260.81">your thoughts out there and just fire off a quick tweet into the Ether that someone</span> <span data-start="260.81" data-end="268.31">will read. And eventually those someones create some kind of mob mentality that really just</span> <span data-start="268.31" data-end="271.97">starts to bumble me out, I think it bumbles a lot of people out, toking on‑line and</span> <span data-start="271.97" data-end="280.06">going on Twitter, I think we need to be more careful and take more care in order to make</span> <span data-start="280.06" data-end="286.57">this a better experience for everyone. And so, I kind of broke down the other side of</span> <span data-start="286.57" data-end="296.05">empathy into four main tenants. And that comes down to context, constructive feedback, communication,</span> <span data-start="296.05" data-end="303.03">and caring. And so I tell you all of this to give you some context about why I'm up</span> <span data-start="303.03" data-end="307.54">here and what I'm speaking about. And why you all should care about what I'm speaking</span> <span data-start="307.54" data-end="315.81">about. And so context is all these internal and external things that influence how we</span> <span data-start="315.81" data-end="323.88">make decisions and how we take actions, and how we affect others around us. And it relates</span> <span data-start="323.88" data-end="329.67">to the other side of empathy mostly because you gnaw have heard un‑opinionuated frameworks</span> <span data-start="329.67" data-end="335.5">or libraries or things like that. But no one is un‑opinionuated, the fact they chose</span> <span data-start="335.5" data-end="340.91">to use small module or framework is an opinion, or to structure something one way or another</span> <span data-start="340.91" data-end="346.97">is an opinion. Is no un‑opinionuated opinions (Laughs)</span> <span data-start="346.97" data-end="353.11">and we all have biases from either the conscious or unconscious, they come from somewhere,</span> <span data-start="353.11" data-end="359.83">it's important to recognize that, where they come from, when they happen. And listening,</span> <span data-start="359.83" data-end="365.66">that's super key to get context from anyone, if you want to get it, you have to listen,</span> <span data-start="365.66" data-end="372.46">and in order to get, that sometimes you have to ask why. Why do we do all these things?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="372.46" data-end="378.44">Why does this happen? Why did you chose that structure over this structure, this framework</span> <span data-start="378.44" data-end="384.75">over that framework. And by doing this, we can set the example for others. And set the</span> <span data-start="384.75" data-end="390.95">example for gaining context, encouraging it from others. And we\h‑‑ I do this at work,</span> <span data-start="390.95" data-end="397.77">and we we do this together using user stories, when cryuating features or work flows, has</span> <span data-start="397.77" data-end="404.27">anyone herd of Gherkin before? Yes, raise your hands? Awesome. Gherkin is pretty saw</span> <span data-start="404.27" data-end="409.05">some, not just for testing but for gaining context from the people you're working with.</span> <span data-start="409.05" data-end="416.33">It captures the who, what and why of a requirement in such a simple way. And it's not only trying</span> <span data-start="416.33" data-end="421.21">to think of the users, but we also are\h‑‑ our own biases influences the kind of Gherkin</span> <span data-start="421.21" data-end="430.99">statements that we make to recognize what a user or yourself would want. And we're all</span> <span data-start="430.99" data-end="435.46">at this conference today, we all have opinions, biases, it's important to remember context</span> <span data-start="435.46" data-end="440.9">when we go around today at breaks or at the parties or throughout the entire what the</span> <span data-start="440.9" data-end="447.72">FEST and when doing that, when you hear something that may differ from your own opinion, it's</span> <span data-start="447.72" data-end="453.61">important to take a deep breath and then clear your mind of any of those biases, recognize</span> <span data-start="453.61" data-end="460.52">that they're there, but just try to push them aside for a second. Ask why, remember just</span> <span data-start="460.52" data-end="466.9">be sincere, you want to know why they did this. And then listen. And through that, you</span> <span data-start="466.9" data-end="473.26">might start gaining some constructive feedback. And now, constructive feedback is very important,</span> <span data-start="473.26" data-end="482.05">that word "constructive" it's not criticism, it's not negative feedback, and being constructive</span> <span data-start="482.05" data-end="488.46">is getting information that should help you move forward or improve. It's not meant to</span> <span data-start="488.46" data-end="494.75">just say, this is what's wrong, it's supposed to say this could be changed this way I'll</span> <span data-start="494.75" data-end="501.84">go further into that. But first how many of you all remember the golden rule? If you don't</span> <span data-start="501.84" data-end="509.05">have anything nice to say, don't say it at all. Yeah. Well, somewhere between when we</span> <span data-start="509.05" data-end="515.82">learn that and maybe primary school, kindergarten, and somewhere along the way through maybe</span> <span data-start="515.82" data-end="524.589">middle school or secondary school we tend to forget that. We don't really remember that</span> <span data-start="524.589" data-end="529.17">rule or interacting with others as we get older and go into the workforce or interacting</span> <span data-start="529.17" data-end="534.459">with other people in the community. And it's nays to remember not to say if you don't have</span> <span data-start="534.459" data-end="539.329">anything nice to say\h‑‑ but in the context of empathy, I want to change it a little and</span> <span data-start="539.329" data-end="544.199">say if you tonight have anything constructive to say, then don't say anything at all. Not</span> <span data-start="544.199" data-end="549.889">saying something nice isn't good, but in the terms of getting good constructive feedback,</span> <span data-start="549.889" data-end="555.17">we want to get constructive feedback saying that's awesome! Doesn't move it forward, that's</span> <span data-start="555.17" data-end="560.279">the important part about this tenant. It's moving something forward for the better to</span> <span data-start="560.279" data-end="567.47">improve upon. And some say negative feedback can do that too, I mean, I go to Twitter sometimes</span> <span data-start="567.47" data-end="573.16">and I see people who have a snap judgments where it's just like this is awful, and it's</span> <span data-start="573.16" data-end="579.999">like, can you tell me why it's awful? Can you tell me more? And they say, it's\h‑‑</span> <span data-start="579.999" data-end="586.839">the negative tweets will help influence the designers or developers behind such a product,</span> <span data-start="586.839" data-end="592.889">but good feedback, good constructive feedback takes more than 140 characters, even less</span> <span data-start="592.889" data-end="598.959">than that when you mention the company or the developers or the designers. And sometimes</span> <span data-start="598.959" data-end="609.129">they agree, but, they don't necessarily follow through. Or we don't. And constructive feedback</span> <span data-start="609.129" data-end="617.05">is importantly a mutually agreed upon event. It is set up with the expectations that you</span> <span data-start="617.05" data-end="623.36">are getting feedback, that we're getting feedback. It's in an open space, not necessarily physically,</span> <span data-start="623.36" data-end="629.22">but somewhere that someone can feel like they can remove themselves pretty simply and it's</span> <span data-start="629.22" data-end="635.05">also shared with context. We give our context behind our constructive feedback in order</span> <span data-start="635.05" data-end="638.829">to make\h‑‑ to help the others understand why we're giving it this way or what we're</span> <span data-start="638.829" data-end="643.439">talking about. And a perfect situation for this, especially when working with others</span> <span data-start="643.439" data-end="649.42">is code reviews. Either if you do this at work or part of an Open Source project, code</span> <span data-start="649.42" data-end="654.889">reviews are the perfect situation because they follow every part of that constructive</span> <span data-start="654.889" data-end="662.529">feedback rules. It's intended to find mistakes and fix them and hope to improve, to push</span> <span data-start="662.529" data-end="671.569">forward, not just the quality of the software, but the developer skills as well. And it's,</span> <span data-start="671.569" data-end="677.35">you have that dedicated meeting or dedicated time to come together and go over someone</span> <span data-start="677.35" data-end="683.059">else's project feature or code and it's coming from everyone in the project, not just developers,</span> <span data-start="683.059" data-end="688.61">designers and manager's in hopes to give them an understanding of what's going on and hopefully</span> <span data-start="688.61" data-end="694.009">the questions they ask will help you understand your understanding of what you actually did.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="694.009" data-end="699.319">Many times we go through something it works maybe we're not sure why, they help us push</span> <span data-start="699.319" data-end="704.54">forward and improve on that that's all about encouraging constructive feedback, we can</span> <span data-start="704.54" data-end="713.67">do it in the open in the community, and first and foremost with a contributing.md. If anyone</span> <span data-start="713.67" data-end="719.98">knows what that is, it's a pretty awesome little trick with GitHub that if you add this</span> <span data-start="719.98" data-end="728.459">file to any Repo, it's automagically link opening an issue or pull request with that</span> <span data-start="728.459" data-end="734.55">contributing MD file what it takes and what they're looking for when opening issue, opening</span> <span data-start="734.55" data-end="741.55">a pull request, submitting code, and some of my favorites have been Atom, the Atom project</span> <span data-start="741.55" data-end="749.49">from GitHub. It's very thorough. It talks all about what they're lacking for from issues,</span> <span data-start="749.49" data-end="754.91">what they're looking for from code, style guides and things like that. It really helps</span> <span data-start="754.91" data-end="759.319">delay the shallow constructive feedback that comes from pull requests and issues and helps</span> <span data-start="759.319" data-end="765.72">push forward to actual improvements that we want. Of course, I'm also a little biased</span> <span data-start="765.72" data-end="771.6">for Hoodie, it's such a great project and such a great contributing.md to help others</span> <span data-start="771.6" data-end="777.97">understand, even the READMEs are great contributing files, just in case people can't get to this</span> <span data-start="777.97" data-end="787.559">up front. And, this type of linking and medium is all about communication. And how to communicate</span> <span data-start="787.559" data-end="794.55">with people. And it's important to remember that communication is sharing information</span> <span data-start="794.55" data-end="799.569">and ideas and feelings, especially in terms of empathy. If you're talking to someone,</span> <span data-start="799.569" data-end="803.649">you're not necessarily communicating with them. You're just spitting ideas at them,</span> <span data-start="803.649" data-end="807.899">and they're not taking them or sharing them if you have to remember how to receive ideas</span> <span data-start="807.899" data-end="814.3">in order to communicate. And it's how we interact with each other in general. And it's what</span> <span data-start="814.3" data-end="820.41">we say, how we say it, and where we say it, like I said before, with the constructive</span> <span data-start="820.41" data-end="826.889">feedback, it's in a dedicated space or area that people feel comfortable in. How we saw</span> <span data-start="826.889" data-end="833.999">it comes in the way we phrase things sometimes. "I" statements. That're great for giving constructive</span> <span data-start="833.999" data-end="841.579">feedback, part of that context that we're giving. I noticed or I found before that this</span> <span data-start="841.579" data-end="848.339">plug‑in tends to be a little inaccessible. But for getting context, it's not fantastic.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="848.339" data-end="856.86">Oh, I don't do it that way or, I don't see how you could possibly do that .. but it's</span> <span data-start="856.86" data-end="863.66">great for "you" statements like why did you make that decision, why did you chose this</span> <span data-start="863.66" data-end="869.41">thing, for giving constructive feedback it's not. You picked the wrong plug‑in, you should</span> <span data-start="869.41" data-end="876.559">change it. Or you should chose the completely wrong coding style, you need to go fix it.</span> <span data-start="876.559" data-end="884.22">That's not pushing people forward into improving. And the mediums which we communicate are very</span> <span data-start="884.22" data-end="890.809">important to\h‑‑ and at work we have several different platforms for communicating. In</span> <span data-start="890.809" data-end="896.98">general we have slack, and I feigned slack to be one of the best tools out there, for</span> <span data-start="896.98" data-end="902.42">communicating just in general and keeping in touch with people. Stand ups, either on</span> <span data-start="902.42" data-end="909.759">some kind of video chat or in person is very nays for getting that face‑to‑face time,</span> <span data-start="909.759" data-end="914.369">quick interactions and finding out what's going on with someone. Regarded discussions</span> <span data-start="914.369" data-end="919.679">that you can reference later, GitHub issues or trouble card or issue tracker are great</span> <span data-start="919.679" data-end="925.269">and some kind of long tomorrow or acinous communications that doesn't have to be triggers</span> <span data-start="925.269" data-end="932.619">right I way or answered right away (Asynchronous) remembering these made yums helps us get the</span> <span data-start="932.619" data-end="937.72">right communication methods and helps us get the right return of information that we're</span> <span data-start="937.72" data-end="944.11">expecting at the right time. We can create communication too, one of the words that I</span> <span data-start="944.11" data-end="953.139">hear a lot from people that is another bummer for me is "it sucks" I really don't like this</span> <span data-start="953.139" data-end="959.85">because it eliminates any hope of improving upon anything. It's very negative. It doesn't</span> <span data-start="959.85" data-end="965.98">push people forward, and improving, and unless you're talking about something like DJ Roomba,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="965.98" data-end="972.329">I don't want to hear about something sucks, it doesn't help me or others. And when we're</span> <span data-start="972.329" data-end="978.489">using these open channels when communicating with a community, Slack is great, Gitter,</span> <span data-start="978.489" data-end="985.819">which is kind of a Slack alternative on top of GitHub IRC has been around over and even</span> <span data-start="985.819" data-end="991.649">GitHub issues are very important. Slack I really like because you can customize things</span> <span data-start="991.649" data-end="999.29">to encourage better feedback and communication from your community. Recently we added a little</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="999.29" data-end="1006.54">Slackbot that recognizes things like "sucks" and encouraging more description and feedback</span> <span data-start="1006.54" data-end="1012.129">in relation to that. And anyone can do that. It's very easy to do. You can add multiple</span> <span data-start="1012.129" data-end="1018.529">integration that fit with how you want the community to act and communicate with you.</span> <span data-start="1018.529" data-end="1023.269">And taking the time to do that is all about caring, taking the time to do any of this</span> <span data-start="1023.269" data-end="1030.1">is all about caring. And caring is providing the needs of something, and generally showing</span> <span data-start="1030.1" data-end="1034.809">an interest in it. If we care about something, we're interested in it, we want to do something</span> <span data-start="1034.809" data-end="1044.4">about it. And caring over all is sharing. It's listening again, always listening and</span> <span data-start="1044.4" data-end="1051.75">understanding. Like I said before, empathy is feeling and understanding with people,</span> <span data-start="1051.75" data-end="1061.2">not for people. And as such a minute detail that one word, but a super important. And</span> <span data-start="1061.2" data-end="1068.96">showing how much you care. Do you care enough to write a Blog post? To file an issue? How</span> <span data-start="1068.96" data-end="1074.75">much time do you have? Can you send an e‑mail. Is there an e‑mail available? Can you record</span> <span data-start="1074.75" data-end="1079.83">screen cast, that's great. There's such great tools out there to quickly record even a Gif</span> <span data-start="1079.83" data-end="1086.279">or full screen cast that you can post to an issue or a pull request for what you're doing</span> <span data-start="1086.279" data-end="1089.85">or when submitting a pull request. If you have time to fix 2 code if you know how to</span> <span data-start="1089.85" data-end="1095.419">do it. If you think their code is unstructured or using the wrong module, to you care enough</span> <span data-start="1095.419" data-end="1099.34">to take the time, change that, submit a pull request and communicate with them to make</span> <span data-start="1099.34" data-end="1105.64">sure that if you're using it then you want it to be better and show it, show them how</span> <span data-start="1105.64" data-end="1112.37">you can make it better. And then very important to remember also, don't give in to the hate.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1112.37" data-end="1119.69">It leads 20 Dark Side. Yoda, he knew what he was talking about. It's such an important</span> <span data-start="1119.69" data-end="1125.97">thing to remember, stay positive, encourage positivity in the community, and part of that,</span> <span data-start="1125.97" data-end="1130.71">and part of caring, putting time into something comes into documentation. At least for me</span> <span data-start="1130.71" data-end="1137.99">at work, I find it so important to remember this. Wikis, code comments, style guides,</span> <span data-start="1137.99" data-end="1145.169">pattern libraries, READMEs. Any of these things can help either new developers or veteran</span> <span data-start="1145.169" data-end="1151.529">developers, reference old code, new code, and go through code reviews and get context</span> <span data-start="1151.529" data-end="1157.99">from that right away and speed up the process maybe. Any little thing that we can add to</span> <span data-start="1157.99" data-end="1164.61">our project will helm tremendously and then remember to make issues for documentation</span> <span data-start="1164.61" data-end="1174.149">and keeping it up. And such a way of doing this helps exsimplify caring. And another</span> <span data-start="1174.149" data-end="1180.22">way to do that even not just at work and but in the community is mentoring. Mentoring is</span> <span data-start="1180.22" data-end="1185.11">really interesting, you can have a mentor and men tee at the same time, we're all at</span> <span data-start="1185.11" data-end="1192.299">different stages in our skill set, and our skills (Mentee) in general, but do we remember</span> <span data-start="1192.299" data-end="1197.98">starting out and how much we wanted a mentor to learn from, we can be that for a junior</span> <span data-start="1197.98" data-end="1204.61">developer and a senior developer ahead of us be our mentor D you have a mentor when</span> <span data-start="1204.61" data-end="1211.86">you started out? And how much did you want one? And did you want to learn? You can learn</span> <span data-start="1211.86" data-end="1219.39">from having a mentor, you can learn from having a Mentee. We saw earlier that teaching someone</span> <span data-start="1219.39" data-end="1227.72">helps improve our understanding of a concept. It really helps push forward our understanding.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1227.72" data-end="1234.799">And in order to start contributing these ideas, these tenants to our companies, we can start</span> <span data-start="1234.799" data-end="1240.57">just by listening for a difficult start small. Start listening, maybe not always having to</span> <span data-start="1240.57" data-end="1245.97">voice an opinion, to voice a bias. And start applying these small examples that I talked</span> <span data-start="1245.97" data-end="1253.96">about before. Code reviews. Using the right channels, using the right statements. Starting</span> <span data-start="1253.96" data-end="1260.139">off small and then remaining open to sharing, remaining open to listening and asking why.</span> <span data-start="1260.139" data-end="1264.98">And for some people, it sounds like too much work, to keep remembering this, to keep remembering</span> <span data-start="1264.98" data-end="1270.519">that oh, I have to remember to think about people, to care. Yes, that's Oooh, that's</span> <span data-start="1270.519" data-end="1280.95">so much work. And to them I say, well, deal with it. Because by starting to apply empathy</span> <span data-start="1280.95" data-end="1286.389">to connect with others professionally at first, it leads us down this path to connecting with</span> <span data-start="1286.389" data-end="1292.57">others personally. This is a small space and a small area to start out with. We all have</span> <span data-start="1292.57" data-end="1296.58">something in common when we start out with working on the web, working with products,</span> <span data-start="1296.58" data-end="1300.529">working with JavaScripts. That's that small connection that can lead to bigger connections</span> <span data-start="1300.529" data-end="1307.289">and understanding others. And for following up, and following a resources, one of my favorites</span> <span data-start="1307.289" data-end="1313.73">and probably the first place I go to is suggest for others is a book called practical empathy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1313.73" data-end="1321.029">This leads to more general examples and more general like research around working with</span> <span data-start="1321.029" data-end="1326.919">others, and using empathy that way. While my example is more specific to our industry</span> <span data-start="1326.919" data-end="1333.12">and development and design. And I also like to collect resources as well and recently,</span> <span data-start="1333.12" data-end="1338.69">used to be on my own web site,now I've decided to dedicate something else to that. So this</span> <span data-start="1338.69" data-end="1344.299">went live yesterday, it's called the other side of empathy.com, just try to gather empathy</span> <span data-start="1344.299" data-end="1350.6">on the web and share it with others and give people a place to find new resources, keep</span> <span data-start="1350.6" data-end="1357.46">up to date, with any medium, pod casts, Blog posts, research papers, videos. But it's also</span> <span data-start="1357.46" data-end="1365.46">available while I was lacking up this domain at more‑empathy.online. So I really like</span> <span data-start="1365.46" data-end="1372">that, and I think you can access it anywhere and it describes what I'm trying to do, and</span> <span data-start="1372" data-end="1377.679">who I hope otherrings can try to do. I love hearing more about it. It's open, it's on</span> <span data-start="1377.679" data-end="1382.889">my GitHub, you can also suggest resources that way, improvements to make this more accessible</span> </p>
