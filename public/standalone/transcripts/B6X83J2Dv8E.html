command-line interface with respect</span> <span data-start="149.72" data-end="153.26">to testing it in the node community it's</span> <span data-start="153.26" data-end="154.67">really interesting that we're very</span> <span data-start="154.67" data-end="157.34">diligent for testing our modules will do</span> <span data-start="157.34" data-end="159.26">unit tests or will do behavior

<span data-start="164.349" data-end="167.03">but we rarely do that when it comes to</span> <span data-start="167.03" data-end="169.209">the command line interface we dumped</span> <span data-start="169.209" data-end="173">dozens or hundreds of lines of code into</span> <span data-start="173" data-end="177.29">a file and we release it and that is</span> <span data-start="177.29"

<span data-start="192.92" data-end="194.36">necessarily the command-line interface</span> <span data-start="194.36" data-end="197.09">and this is something that we've really</span> <span data-start="197.09" data-end="200.51">struggled with Phil and I for both the</span> <span data-start="200.51" data-end="205.28">past year or so we have no idea really</span> <span data-start="205.28" data-end="206.69">released for the past year we had no</span> <span data-start="206.69" data-end="209.329">idea how to write good test for a</span> <span data-start="209.329" data-end="210.62">command-line interface we really</span> <span data-start="210.62" data-end="213.799">struggled with this originally we were</span> <span data-start="213.799" data-end="215.569">going about by testing through shell</span> <span data-start="215.569" data-end="217.849">execution so we would write unit tests</span> <span data-start="217.849" data-end="220.16">or behavior driven tests we would</span> <span data-start="220.16" data-end="222.709">execute a given script and then we kind</span> <span data-start="222.709" data-end="225.29">of like poke and prod inspect what the</span> <span data-start="225.29" data-end="227.69">results were but the end result is that</span> <span data-start="227.69" data-end="229.31">things weren't really slow you're doing</span> <span data-start="229.31" data-end="231.29">a ton of file i/o and you're actually</span> <span data-start="231.29" data-end="233.72">executing a lot of code and your tests</span> <span data-start="233.72" data-end="236.299">end up being extremely vague so if you</span> <span data-start="236.299" data-end="239.51">dive into just this one example here</span> <span data-start="239.51" data-end="241.579">this is just a simple behavior driven</span> <span data-start="241.579" data-end="243.56">test where we're running the command</span> <span data-start="243.56" data-end="247.06">jazz conf create with a given path and</span> <span data-start="247.06" data-end="249.709">the test itself should create a project</span> <span data-start="249.709" data-end="252.769">so on line 7 you can see we shall exec</span> <span data-start="252.769" data-end="254.959">to a given command that command is jazz</span> <span data-start="254.959" data-end="257.989">conf create with a path and then</span> <span data-start="257.989" data-end="259.789">afterwards we're kind of going to poke</span> <span data-start="259.789" data-end="262.19">and prod and see if maybe the result was</span> <span data-start="262.19" data-end="264.56">what we wanted so first off we expect</span> <span data-start="264.56" data-end="267.44">that the result status code is 0 0 means</span> <span data-start="267.44" data-end="270.169">things probably went okay assuming that</span> <span data-start="270.169" data-end="272.729">we actually use status codes</span> <span data-start="272.729" data-end="274.669">command-line tool and that's not broken</span> <span data-start="274.669" data-end="277.349">we inspect the output the console output</span> <span data-start="277.349" data-end="280.02">so we can match a couple words and see</span> <span data-start="280.02" data-end="281.849">if maybe the word created and not err</span> <span data-start="281.849" data-end="284.189">appeared but that's again or extremely</span> <span data-start="284.189" data-end="286.02">weak what if we have just a conditional</span> <span data-start="286.02" data-end="287.189">bug and we're always saying the</span> <span data-start="287.189" data-end="288.719">project's been created when it actually</span> <span data-start="288.719" data-end="291.509">hasn't and so then we can also go even</span> <span data-start="291.509" data-end="293.61">deeper and we can start checking whether</span> <span data-start="293.61" data-end="296.009">or not certain files certain folders</span> <span data-start="296.009" data-end="298.409">were created and so this is where the FS</span> <span data-start="298.409" data-end="301.71">exists Inc is and equals true downside</span> <span data-start="301.71" data-end="304.169">there is that what if the file existed</span> <span data-start="304.169" data-end="306.839">before the test ran or you would</span> <span data-start="306.839" data-end="308.189">actually have to have before and after</span> <span data-start="308.189" data-end="309.689">tests to do clean up each time which</span> <span data-start="309.689" data-end="311.46">means you're doing a ton of file i/o and</span> <span data-start="311.46" data-end="312.99">people who don't have a solid state</span> <span data-start="312.99" data-end="315.599">drive results in tests the run extremely</span> <span data-start="315.599" data-end="317.699">extremely slow and in the end it's still</span> <span data-start="317.699" data-end="321.899">not a very deep test ideally what we</span> <span data-start="321.899" data-end="324.599">want is to programmatically test deep</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="324.599" data-end="326.819">CLI the same way we programmatically</span> <span data-start="326.819" data-end="329.009">test the rest of our library we can do</span> <span data-start="329.009" data-end="331.289">very deep and very intimate test that</span> <span data-start="331.289" data-end="333.509">way so we want something such as this</span> <span data-start="333.509" data-end="336.569">which is on line 7 we would simply say</span> <span data-start="336.569" data-end="339.06">we expect some function to have been</span> <span data-start="339.06" data-end="341.069">called with some argument at least now</span> <span data-start="341.069" data-end="344.009">we have a much deeper test running at</span> <span data-start="344.009" data-end="346.169">that specific time well it turns out</span> <span data-start="346.169" data-end="347.699">that we can actually do this and we can</span> <span data-start="347.699" data-end="349.469">do it very easily by simply treating the</span> <span data-start="349.469" data-end="352.529">CLI as a module instead of as an</span> <span data-start="352.529" data-end="356.699">executable script and to actually go</span> <span data-start="356.699" data-end="358.259">about doing that the first step you have</span> <span data-start="358.259" data-end="360.81">to do is just simply slim down your bin</span> <span data-start="360.81" data-end="362.87">script instead think of it as a proxy</span> <span data-start="362.87" data-end="365.55">into your CLI module or an interface</span> <span data-start="365.55" data-end="367.83">into your CLI module so what we're going</span> <span data-start="367.83" data-end="369.569">to do is actually go into the bin</span> <span data-start="369.569" data-end="372.87">directory we have the J's conf Chason</span> <span data-start="372.87" data-end="374.759">typically here i mentioned people would</span> <span data-start="374.759" data-end="376.74">be dumping dozens or hundreds of lines</span> <span data-start="376.74" data-end="379.289">of code where they parse argument</span> <span data-start="379.289" data-end="380.58">parameters and decide what they're going</span> <span data-start="380.58" data-end="384.149">to do but instead let's just get rid of</span> <span data-start="384.149" data-end="387.719">all of that and instead require a CLI</span> <span data-start="387.719" data-end="389.999">module that we've declared on line 8 i'm</span> <span data-start="389.999" data-end="393.059">actually parsing the process argument</span> <span data-start="393.059" data-end="395.55">values i'm using optimist but you guys</span> <span data-start="395.55" data-end="397.77">don't have to if you like the raw</span> <span data-start="397.77" data-end="401.099">process args then go nuts line 14 is the</span> <span data-start="401.099" data-end="403.56">key right there with our CLI module we</span> <span data-start="403.56" data-end="405.509">call an entry point and we pass those</span> <span data-start="405.509" data-end="406.62">process args so</span> <span data-start="406.62" data-end="410.16">my entry point is RV and pass arc V and</span> <span data-start="410.16" data-end="413.07">so that is all that this would do you</span> <span data-start="413.07" data-end="415.02">could write three simple script tests if</span> <span data-start="415.02" data-end="417">you really want to know that this entry</span> <span data-start="417" data-end="419.28">point works but after that at least</span> <span data-start="419.28" data-end="422.85">we're moving into real code now the</span> <span data-start="422.85" data-end="424.949">second step is actually the CLI module</span> <span data-start="424.949" data-end="426.419">which is going to consume our main</span> <span data-start="426.419" data-end="428.79">library and so if we go into lib an easy</span> <span data-start="428.79" data-end="430.44">way to organize this as silly as it</span> <span data-start="430.44" data-end="432.6">sounds is just create a CLI directory</span> <span data-start="432.6" data-end="435.75">with an index like Jas and size nice and</span> <span data-start="435.75" data-end="439.47">clean that lot that modules of course</span> <span data-start="439.47" data-end="441">going to consume your main module in</span> <span data-start="441" data-end="443.16">this case we're calling it Jas conf and</span> <span data-start="443.16" data-end="445.08">from there you can actually treat it</span> <span data-start="445.08" data-end="446.61">like a real module so you don't need to</span> <span data-start="446.61" data-end="449.58">have this gigantic bin script instead</span> <span data-start="449.58" data-end="451.05">you can actually start to abstract and</span> <span data-start="451.05" data-end="453.15">move things into different files and it</span> <span data-start="453.15" data-end="458.07">looks a lot cleaner to work with and the</span> <span data-start="458.07" data-end="459.72">benefit of all of this is that now we</span> <span data-start="459.72" data-end="462.51">can actually test that CLI as a module</span> <span data-start="462.51" data-end="464.43">and we're binding really close to the</span> <span data-start="464.43" data-end="466.41">metal of the actual command line</span> <span data-start="466.41" data-end="468.72">terminal because we can just fake the</span> <span data-start="468.72" data-end="471.389">process arg v value but everything else</span> <span data-start="471.389" data-end="473.099">is going to run the same so we have high</span> <span data-start="473.099" data-end="475.83">confidence that our programmatic tests</span> <span data-start="475.83" data-end="477.599">are actually testing the same interface</span> <span data-start="477.599" data-end="479.78">that our users are actually going to use</span> <span data-start="479.78" data-end="482.34">so if you jump into the spec and you</span> <span data-start="482.34" data-end="484.02">jumped into the CLI if we want to</span> <span data-start="484.02" data-end="485.639">actually write a test for the create</span> <span data-start="485.639" data-end="487.77">spec we can actually now accomplished</span> <span data-start="487.77" data-end="489.36">something much more detailed we can</span> <span data-start="489.36" data-end="492.87">again include our CLI module and we can</span> <span data-start="492.87" data-end="495.57">again still test the the J's conf create</span> <span data-start="495.57" data-end="498.51">paths we can still say it should be able</span> <span data-start="498.51" data-end="500.3">to create a project but on line fourteen</span> <span data-start="500.3" data-end="503.43">we actually call CLI dark B and we pass</span> <span data-start="503.43" data-end="505.139">in the exact same command that the user</span> <span data-start="505.139" data-end="507.599">would have ran on their system so create</span> <span data-start="507.599" data-end="511.05">space path to the project the benefit</span> <span data-start="511.05" data-end="512.43">those and now we can actually test</span> <span data-start="512.43" data-end="514.8">details so we can actually say what's</span> <span data-start="514.8" data-end="516.57">the entry point to remain library JS</span> <span data-start="516.57" data-end="518.76">conf with the create function was it</span> <span data-start="518.76" data-end="520.709">actually called yes awesome was it</span> <span data-start="520.709" data-end="523.2">called with the correct path yes awesome</span> <span data-start="523.2" data-end="525.33">so at least we know that the CLI is now</span> <span data-start="525.33" data-end="527.94">parsing things correctly and of course</span> <span data-start="527.94" data-end="529.68">we can take it even a step further and</span> <span data-start="529.68" data-end="531.42">this is always important is to keep the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="531.42" data-end="534.48">CLI as silly as it sounds doing the CLI</span> <span data-start="534.48" data-end="537.03">logic only but the benefit there isn't</span> <span data-start="537.03" data-end="538.53">now we can actually use mocking so we</span> <span data-start="538.53" data-end="539.97">can mark out that mean lie</span> <span data-start="539.97"

data-end="1268.99">do that too so just thinking about these</span> <span data-start="1268.99" data-end="1272.32">sorts of ideas allows us to create tools</span> <span data-start="1272.32"

data-end="1301.48">let's check them out on windows and</span> <span data-start="1301.48" data-end="1305.02">everything's broken so simple rule to</span> <span data-start="1305.02" data-end="1308.049">follow is don't hardcode paths let's</span> <span data-start="1308.049" data-end="1312.52">take a look in this create function that</span> <span data-start="1312.52" data-end="1315.4">we have in our J's comic program you</span> <span data-start="1315.4" data-end="1317.47">might need to shell out just just an</span> <span data-start="1317.47" data-end="1319.27">example but at least in our project</span> <span data-start="1319.27" data-end="1322.62">happens a lot so the top example there</span> <span data-start="1322.62" data-end="1326.35">has a dot and a forward slash both of</span> <span data-start="1326.35" data-end="1328.21">which will blow up a Windows machine so</span> <span data-start="1328.21" data-end="1330.91">you don't want to do those instead you</span> <span data-start="1330.91" data-end="1333.73">should use your trusty friend path the</span> <span data-start="1333.73" data-end="1336.34">standard lib or the node standard module</span> <span data-start="1336.34" data-end="1338.74">to join it all together and then execute</span> <span data-start="1338.74" data-end="1340.35">that instead</span> <span data-start="1340.35" data-end="1343.33">simple tip but it saves us a lot of</span> <span data-start="1343.33" data-end="1347.17">hassle environment variables are a good</span> <span data-start="1347.17" data-end="1349.48">way to kind of figure out a few details</span> <span data-start="1349.48" data-end="1351.34">that are sometimes necessary to work</span> <span data-start="1351.34" data-end="1353.02">with when you're building command-line</span> <span data-start="1353.02" data-end="1356.8">tools so I'm going to show an example of</span> <span data-start="1356.8" data-end="1361.96">a technique to get to the user's home</span> <span data-start="1361.96" data-end="1365.02">directory which is sometimes useful if</span> <span data-start="1365.02" data-end="1367">you need to download stuff on the fly or</span> <span data-start="1367" data-end="1370.42">save stuff you need to get to that</span> <span data-start="1370.42" data-end="1371.5">director because you know you can write</span> <span data-start="1371.5" data-end="1377.11">to it so here we use the environment</span> <span data-start="1377.11" data-end="1379.66">variable one of two environment</span> <span data-start="1379.66" data-end="1381.7">variables depending on the platform that</span> <span data-start="1381.7" data-end="1384.97">the program is executing in and it will</span> <span data-start="1384.97" data-end="1388.69">return a proper path on that environment</span> <span data-start="1388.69" data-end="1392.35">and so this line actually works well and</span> <span data-start="1392.35" data-end="1394.78">takes into account the latest switch and</span> <span data-start="1394.78" data-end="1398.05">windows is that right so from windows 95</span> <span data-start="1398.05" data-end="1400.72">to windows 7 your home directory was</span> <span data-start="1400.72" data-end="1403.96">located in a user profile direct your</span> <span data-start="1403.96" data-end="1405.61">environment variable but in the latest</span> <span data-start="1405.61" data-end="1407.14">version of Windows it switches back to</span> <span data-start="1407.14" data-end="1409.54">home as every other st. operating system</span> <span data-start="1409.54" data-end="1412.57">does so this conditional least handles</span> <span data-start="1412.57" data-end="1414.82">that case but it's like very simple kind</span> <span data-start="1414.82" data-end="1416.83">of patterns that help you build</span> <span data-start="1416.83" data-end="1420.83">compatible tools everywhere and</span> <span data-start="1420.84" data-end="1424.21">thankfully node uses NP m and n p.m. is</span> <span data-start="1424.21" data-end="1427.78">awesome and windows friendly and one</span> <span data-start="1427.78" data-end="1430.33">interesting thing that took a little bit</span> <span data-start="1430.33" data-end="1433.03">of documentation hunting to find out was</span> <span data-start="1433.03" data-end="1435.7">that any dependencies that you have in</span> <span data-start="1435.7" data-end="1438.87">your package.json if they have binary</span> <span data-start="1438.87" data-end="1441.49">interfaces or command faces for their</span> <span data-start="1441.49" data-end="1446.44">modules NPM will add all of those</span> <span data-start="1446.44" data-end="1449.17">binaries to the executive search paths</span> <span data-start="1449.17" data-end="1451.86">before you fire any of the npm scripts</span> <span data-start="1451.86" data-end="1456.18">so let's take a look an example this</span> <span data-start="1456.18" data-end="1459.04">will die on windows because you're using</span> <span data-start="1459.04" data-end="1461.49">a dot and using forward slashes</span> <span data-start="1461.49" data-end="1463.66">essentially the situation here is say</span> <span data-start="1463.66" data-end="1466.24">you have some awesome test framework</span> <span data-start="1466.24" data-end="1468.43">like jasmine node and you want to use it</span> <span data-start="1468.43" data-end="1471.73">to execute respects usually you want to</span> <span data-start="1471.73" data-end="1473.32">type npm test in a node</span> <span data-start="1473.32" data-end="1475.86">jewel in a way goes your test execution</span> <span data-start="1475.86" data-end="1479.409">but you don't have to do that you can</span> <span data-start="1479.409" data-end="1481.33">just refer to Jasmine node the binary</span> <span data-start="1481.33" data-end="1483.639">name on its own and NPM figures out the</span> <span data-start="1483.639" data-end="1485.23">rest because jasmine has this binary</span> <span data-start="1485.23" data-end="1488.47">executive bowlin so it's it's a neat</span> <span data-start="1488.47" data-end="1491.759">little tip to kind of ease development</span> <span data-start="1491.759" data-end="1494.62">and that's it those are four major</span> <span data-start="1494.62" data-end="1496.12">points that we want to share with you</span> <span data-start="1496.12" data-end="1499.269">guys and hopefully it will improve your</span> <span data-start="1499.269" data-end="1502.72">command line tool authoring and thank</span> <span data-start="1502.72" data-end="1513.19">you very much we have a five minutes if</span> <span data-start="1513.19" data-end="1558.75">you guys have any questions yeah awesome</span> <span data-start="1558.76" data-end="1565.22">hey that's good yeah for the video he</span> <span data-start="1565.22" data-end="1566.93">was just pointing out that if you want</span> <span data-start="1566.93" data-end="1570.29">live input extending that initial proxy</span> <span
