<p><span data-start="8.17" data-end="9.769">My name's Aditya.</span> <span data-start="9.769" data-end="14.799">This talk is entitled koro, translating human code back into languages and back again.</span> <span data-start="14.799" data-end="22.71">I've been writing JavaScript off and on again for about 20 years, but these days my primary</span> <span data-start="22.71" data-end="25.76">language isn't JavaScript, it's Go.</span> <span data-start="25.76" data-end="31.349">I've been writing Go for the last seven years and I will be taking a look at work that has</span> <span data-start="31.349" data-end="32.349">been done?</span> <span data-start="32.349" data-end="37.07">Go and seeing how we might apply that same work to the JavaScript world as well.</span> <span data-start="37.07" data-end="45.489">Even though my examples will be in Go, everything can and should be done in JavaScript too.</span> <span data-start="45.489" data-end="50.64">How many of you speak English as a second language?</span> <span data-start="50.64" data-end="53.23">That's the overall majority here.</span> <span data-start="53.23" data-end="58.41">So worldwide, only five per cent of the world speaks English as their first language, and</span> <span data-start="58.41" data-end="63.03">only about 11 per cent speaks English at all.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="63.03" data-end="66.78">That means that the majority of people who speak English speak it as their second language.</span> <span data-start="66.78" data-end="73.02">If this conference were perfectly represented of the entire world, that only means 165 people</span> <span data-start="73.02" data-end="78.021">out of this entire conference would be able to understand this talk, and of those, all</span> <span data-start="78.021" data-end="83.13">but 75 would be listening to me speak in what is for them a foreign language.</span> <span data-start="83.13" data-end="89.53">I feel like to say software is eating the world, but also JavaScript is eating software.</span> <span data-start="89.53" data-end="93.77">I don't just mean that things are moving to the web, which has always been JavaScript's</span> <span data-start="93.77" data-end="99.1">platform of dominance, but JavaScript also is being used in ways that we never really</span> <span data-start="99.1" data-end="102.549">thought of maybe like 20 years ago.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="102.549" data-end="107.51">Node.js was launched on this very stage ten years ago at this conference, and that completely</span> <span data-start="107.51" data-end="112.35">changed the way in which we think of JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="112.35" data-end="116.74">JavaScript is now being used â€” you can use JavaScript to write Excel macros.</span> <span data-start="116.74" data-end="122.299">Try explaining someone to that in the mid-90s, that you would be using live script to write</span> <span data-start="122.299" data-end="125.119">your Microsoft Office macros.</span> <span data-start="125.119" data-end="129.94">If you want to do positioning logic within Linux, you're going to be writing JavaScript</span> <span data-start="129.94" data-end="135.95">rules.</span> <span data-start="135.95" data-end="139.66">Technology which includes software is a powerful enabling force.</span> <span data-start="139.66" data-end="145.08">We have the ability to do amazingly things on a global scale using software.</span> <span data-start="145.08" data-end="149.97">Thanks to software, we are able to take pictures of a black hole that is 55 million light years</span> <span data-start="149.97" data-end="151.25">away.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="151.25" data-end="155.01">We can treat and cure diseases that would have been thought chronic or even fatal just</span> <span data-start="155.01" data-end="156.419">a few decades ago.</span> <span data-start="156.419" data-end="160.859">We might not think of this as achievements of software specifically but software is the</span> <span data-start="160.859" data-end="164.63">underlying force that is powering and enabling all of these.</span> <span data-start="164.63" data-end="173.36">But software can be used for terrible things as well, using it to inflict violence or commit</span> <span data-start="173.36" data-end="174.859">genocide.</span> <span data-start="174.859" data-end="182.17">If we think software is a powerful and enable enabling force, who does it enable and what</span> <span data-start="182.17" data-end="183.41">does it allow them to do?</span> <span data-start="183.41" data-end="186.949">I have really lives who don't speak English.</span> <span data-start="186.949" data-end="193.54">If one came to me and said they want to learn to write software and asked me for advice,</span> <span data-start="193.54" data-end="198.72">the first thing I would say is you have to learn English because if you don't speak English,</span> <span data-start="198.72" data-end="203.419">you're not really going to be able to do much in the software world, certainly not in open-source</span> <span data-start="203.419" data-end="205.06">software development.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="205.06" data-end="210.91">Especially if you don't even read the Latin script because your native language uses a</span> <span data-start="210.91" data-end="212.37">different script altogether.</span> <span data-start="212.37" data-end="214.359">That itself is a barrier.</span> <span data-start="214.359" data-end="218.5">If writing software is only an option for the ten per cent of the world who can speak</span> <span data-start="218.5" data-end="222.95">English, that has huge implications about what it means when we say that software is</span> <span data-start="222.95" data-end="225.919">an empowering and enabling force.</span> <span data-start="225.919" data-end="229.35">So if JavaScript wants to be the future of software development and we think that software</span> <span data-start="229.35" data-end="235.29">development is going to be an enable willing force for the world, then we need to writing</span> <span data-start="235.29" data-end="240.48">JavaScript is accessible to people of all languages, not just English.</span> <span data-start="240.48" data-end="244.45">The idea of eliminating natural language barriers to programming isn't new at all.</span> <span data-start="244.45" data-end="246.6">In fact, it's very old.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="246.6" data-end="250.79">Grace Hopper is one of the first computer scientists and she wrote THE very first compiler</span> <span data-start="250.79" data-end="253.49">for a high-level language.</span> <span data-start="253.49" data-end="258.85">You should check out her portrait there.</span> <span data-start="258.85" data-end="264.07">The language that she invented was called Cobal, and the goal was to have English-like</span> <span data-start="264.07" data-end="268.18">national language syntax so that business executives could write code.</span> <span data-start="268.18" data-end="273.32">She got a lot of pushback about this because engineers thought if non-engineers can write</span> <span data-start="273.32" data-end="278.07">code, this can put us out of a job but Hopper took this vision further.</span> <span data-start="278.07" data-end="281.57">Why restrict it to English-like syntax?</span> <span data-start="281.57" data-end="285.16">What if engineers who speak other languages want to be able to write code as well, and</span> <span data-start="285.16" data-end="290.39">she wanted Cobal to be a language you can talk to people around the world.</span> <span data-start="290.39" data-end="295.31">The response she got to that was more vitriolic.</span> <span data-start="295.31" data-end="301.04">How can we teach American computers to run German programmes?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="301.04" data-end="302.88">That wasn't an accident.</span> <span data-start="302.88" data-end="307.56">This wasn't a question of how it can be done technically, it was a political question.</span> <span data-start="307.56" data-end="313.6">This was the 1950s, and in the US military, the fear of a threat from Germany or Russia</span> <span data-start="313.6" data-end="318.94">was still a huge fear in people's minds.</span> <span data-start="318.94" data-end="327.28">But even if Hopper's idea was put on the back burner in the 1950s due to xenophobia and</span> <span data-start="327.28" data-end="333.97">Cold War politics, we can look at what that means today, and apply that approach to modern</span> <span data-start="333.97" data-end="334.97">languages.</span> <span data-start="334.97" data-end="339.49">So this is Hopper speaking about Cobal many years later, ""I would have thought it would</span> <span data-start="339.49" data-end="343.89">be useful to NATO because they had the common verbs for the things they're going to do,</span> <span data-start="343.89" data-end="347.48">and the nouns, they have to have a dictionary for the things they were referring to for</span> <span data-start="347.48" data-end="348.48">inventory control.</span> <span data-start="348.48" data-end="353.09">They would have common announce throughout NATO and a diction of common verbs and translate</span> <span data-start="353.09" data-end="354.3">the programme.</span> <span data-start="354.3" data-end="358.51">You can write one in English and you could translate it and it goes to the other language.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="358.51" data-end="359.51">No problem.</span> <span data-start="359.51" data-end="360.87">You have communication.</span> <span data-start="360.87" data-end="362.48">It would be a limited vocabulary.""</span> <span data-start="362.48" data-end="368.12">One thing is that she chose the imperative mood specifically because she thought it would</span> <span data-start="368.12" data-end="373.43">be universal to languages, because not all languages distinguish between tenses in the</span> <span data-start="373.43" data-end="378.37">same way but they generally have a commanding way to do something.</span> <span data-start="378.37" data-end="384.28">Cobol popularised the programming style, and that stuck with us today.</span> <span data-start="384.28" data-end="388.87">Even JavaScript, way has the capabilities of a function al language, we still usually</span> <span data-start="388.87" data-end="398.69">use imperatives for the four function names and that is â€” let's see what we get when we</span> <span data-start="398.69" data-end="403.52">take the principles of hopper's vision and apply that to a modern programming language</span> <span data-start="403.52" data-end="411.889">like JavaScript or Go, Koro is an extension of the Go compiler.</span> <span data-start="411.889" data-end="416.5">It's an idiomatic translation of the English name Go.</span> <span data-start="416.5" data-end="420.73">You will see why I chose it for this example.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="420.73" data-end="428.29">But as for Bengali, I chose that because Bengali it's the language my family speaks, and we're</span> <span data-start="428.29" data-end="432.97">Bengali, and, if you talk to Bengali about our language and culture, you'll see very</span> <span data-start="432.97" data-end="435.6">quickly that we're pretty proud of it.</span> <span data-start="435.6" data-end="440.2">The Bengalis like to say is the language that is so beautiful, people literally fought a</span> <span data-start="440.2" data-end="444.43">revolution, an entire war, to defend the right to speak it.</span> <span data-start="444.43" data-end="448.32">The United Nations more recently actually issued a declaration stating that Bengali</span> <span data-start="448.32" data-end="453.44">was the sweetest-sounding language in the entire world.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="453.44" data-end="457.04">But on a more practical note, Bengali is a pretty common language.</span> <span data-start="457.04" data-end="461.59">After Hindi, it's the most common language spoken in India, and also the national language</span> <span data-start="461.59" data-end="462.74">of Bangladesh.</span> <span data-start="462.74" data-end="467.46">Combined, that means it's the seventh most widely spoken language in the entire world.</span> <span data-start="467.46" data-end="472.22">There are more native speakers of Bengali than there are of German and French combined.</span> <span data-start="472.22" data-end="479.25">It also uses a non-Latin script, so it gives us an opportunity to test the boundaries of</span> <span data-start="479.25" data-end="485.93">what we can do with Unicode and how characters get treated and rendered in languages outside</span> <span data-start="485.93" data-end="487.669">the ASCII code range.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="487.669" data-end="492.29">Again, nothing that I'm doing here is unique to Bengali or to Go.</span> <span data-start="492.29" data-end="496.25">If you speak another language, which it seems the majority of this room does, I encourage</span> <span data-start="496.25" data-end="500.96">you to go home and try to do this with your own language as well.</span> <span data-start="500.96" data-end="506.41">This right here is a simple ""hello, world"" in standard Go.</span> <span data-start="506.41" data-end="513.11">If you've never written a line of code, you can guess what it is doing here.</span> <span data-start="513.11" data-end="517.21">This is that equivalent programme written in koro.</span> <span data-start="517.21" data-end="527.09">We've left the identifier names intact, and I did not forget ""true"", true is not a key</span> <span data-start="527.09" data-end="530.76">word in Go.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="530.76" data-end="534.57">Based on the previous slide, you can take a guess at what this programme is doing.</span> <span data-start="534.57" data-end="537.89">If you don't speak Bengali, you might not be able to figure it out from scratch, if</span> <span data-start="537.89" data-end="541.5">you do, this is a whole lot more readable than what we just saw on the previous slide.</span> <span data-start="541.5" data-end="545.33">The first challenge we need to do here is we need to get this programme to run because</span> <span data-start="545.33" data-end="552.85">the Go compiler isn't going to know what to do with the key words.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="552.85" data-end="554.43">Here we can take advantage of a nice trick.</span> <span data-start="554.43" data-end="557">This is why we chose Go for this example.</span> <span data-start="557" data-end="558.9">Go's source code is all UTF8.</span> <span data-start="558.9" data-end="567.47">The Go compiler has trouble dealing with non-ASCII characters in Go programmes and the Go compiler</span> <span data-start="567.47" data-end="573.17">is bootstrapped, written in Go which means that the Go compiler is a Go programme so</span> <span data-start="573.17" data-end="581.26">it has trouble dealing with non-ASCII key word definitions or strings.</span> <span data-start="581.26" data-end="586.5">There are a few checks that ensure that non-alphabetic or non-alphabetic characters can be used in</span> <span data-start="586.5" data-end="591.55">key words but it turns out that you additional them and nothing goes wrong.</span> <span data-start="591.55" data-end="597.56">If we disable them, all you need to do is extend the mapping that has the strings, that</span> <span data-start="597.56" data-end="603.15">map strings to the internal tokens, and extend those to include the Bengali translations</span> <span data-start="603.15" data-end="605.76">of the key words as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="605.76" data-end="609.51">JavaScript already has the analogous concept of transformations, and that is something</span> <span data-start="609.51" data-end="616.56">that is used heavily in JavaScript, if languages like TypeScript and also with polyfills, and</span> <span data-start="616.56" data-end="621.52">it is a little trickier to do this for reasons of they have to do with compiler architecture</span> <span data-start="621.52" data-end="625.57">which I'm not going to get into, but it's still â€” it's fairly similar.</span> <span data-start="625.57" data-end="630.01">It's the still very much possible to use this same approach in JavaScript to translate from</span> <span data-start="630.01" data-end="636.61">one human language to another, or one dialect of a programming language to another.</span> <span data-start="636.61" data-end="641.48">Having made those changes, this is what that ""Hello, World"" looks like in practice.</span> <span data-start="641.48" data-end="647.6">You can see the programme, and we are going to run it.</span> <span data-start="647.6" data-end="650.81">There we go.</span> <span data-start="650.81" data-end="652.71">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="652.71" data-end="654.32">[Applause].</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="654.32" data-end="659.76">Remember, our goal is to defragment open-source development, not to fragment it further.</span> <span data-start="659.76" data-end="664.41">We need to make sure that our code that we are writing in koro is still interoperable</span> <span data-start="664.41" data-end="668.04">with English-speaking Go developers are use as well.</span> <span data-start="668.04" data-end="672.46">We don't want to have to translate every programme manually because that would be unfeasible,</span> <span data-start="672.46" data-end="676.04">but the computers are doing the heavy-lifting for us.</span> <span data-start="676.04" data-end="686.721">Conveniently, for translation, Go has a handy utility for format ing â€” and mostly we you</span> <span data-start="686.721" data-end="692.56">have the use Go format to argue over bike shedding, semicolons, things like that.</span> <span data-start="692.56" data-end="698.899">Instead of arguing which is the proper way to indent your code, you set up the editor</span> <span data-start="698.899" data-end="704.42">whichever way you want and render tabs how you want them to be, and, when you save your</span> <span data-start="704.42" data-end="707.96">code, it's committed in the standard form.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="707.96" data-end="712.85">If I want to use four spaces for indentation and you want to use two, Go format means we</span> <span data-start="712.85" data-end="714.5">can work together.</span> <span data-start="714.5" data-end="719.76">I set up my editor to render it to the width I want and we don't need to know that we have</span> <span data-start="719.76" data-end="724.98">different indentation preferences because the code committed is on the standard form.</span> <span data-start="724.98" data-end="732.04">Go format is syntax aware, so it can do things like remove unnecessarily parentheses and</span> <span data-start="732.04" data-end="735.57">ensure it will never change your code semantics.</span> <span data-start="735.57" data-end="740.3">That's a simpler way of saying it is a great way of performing fully isomorphic translations</span> <span data-start="740.3" data-end="744.529">of source code which is exactly what we could wouldn't here.</span> <span data-start="744.529" data-end="751.82">All we have to do is extend Go format and repurpose it for translating English Go code</span> <span data-start="751.82" data-end="756.56">into Bengali or vice versa, and that is what koro format does.</span> <span data-start="756.56" data-end="761.39">So let's translate that same programme written in koro back into English-speaking Go and</span> <span data-start="761.39" data-end="765.05">run it.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="943.54" data-end="951.2">In Go the source code is acquired by the UTF8 means internally strings and byte arrays are</span> <span data-start="951.2" data-end="957.459">treated as UTF8 as well.</span> <span data-start="957.459" data-end="963.42">JavaScript is â€” source code can be what you want in JavaScript, whatever the interpreter</span> <span data-start="963.42" data-end="965.79">happens to support.</span> <span data-start="965.79" data-end="969.83">As for the internal representation of strings, that is an even trickier question.</span> <span data-start="969.83" data-end="976.97">If you talk to most people, they will say UTF-16, wide Unicode, that's mostly true except</span> <span data-start="976.97" data-end="978.74">where it's not.</span> <span data-start="978.74" data-end="984.029">Some people will say it's UCS2, that some were true except where it's not.</span> <span data-start="984.029" data-end="988.8">The reality is probably best described like this like this: JavaScript is some weird amalgamation</span> <span data-start="988.8" data-end="997.73">of UTF16 and UTFC2 internally which works fine, but it makes, trickier when you're dealing</span> <span data-start="997.73" data-end="1003.66">with non-ASCII things outside the code point, especially when you're dealing with the actual</span> <span data-start="1003.66" data-end="1009.079">digging into the actual internals of the language implementation itself because you can't rely</span> <span data-start="1009.079" data-end="1014.269">on the source encoding, because it can be whatever the interpreter happens to support,</span> <span data-start="1014.269" data-end="1020.3">and you can't rely on, and dealing with code points that are far outside the ASCII code</span> <span data-start="1020.3" data-end="1024.699">range so you need to be able to handle more than one byte at a time in your key words.</span> <span data-start="1024.699" data-end="1028.679">A lot of implementations, particularly things implemented in C, they're going to struggle</span> <span data-start="1028.679" data-end="1031.11">with that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1031.11" data-end="1032.23">Could we do this in JavaScript?</span> <span data-start="1032.23" data-end="1035.529">I mean, honestly, I think so.</span> <span data-start="1035.529" data-end="1040.739">Definitely, not as easy as it is in Go, like I've outlined some of the challenges there,</span> <span data-start="1040.739" data-end="1042.679">but definitely possible.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1042.679" data-end="1048.84">That said, one of my friend, who is a very die-hard JavaScript programmer, she told me</span> <span data-start="1048.84" data-end="1054.309">that the best way to get JavaScript developers to write something is to convince them that</span> <span data-start="1054.309" data-end="1058.85">it can't be done in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1058.85" data-end="1062.74">If you tell them they can't tell them in JavaScript, then within an hour of your talk finishing,</span> <span data-start="1062.74" data-end="1066.33">there will be three packages which do that thing.</span> <span data-start="1066.33" data-end="1071.82">I'm going to tell you this can't be done in JavaScript, and I'm going to bet that you</span> <span data-start="1071.82" data-end="1075.279">cannot prove me wrong!</span> <span data-start="1075.279" data-end="1078.239">[Applause].</span> <span data-start="1078.239" data-end="1092.019">Ask how we've done the â€” we've done the source code itself, and we have to talk about the</span> <span data-start="1092.019" data-end="1095.419">users, and the users include developers who are using developer tooling as well.</span> <span data-start="1095.419" data-end="1097.73">Error messages are a big part of that.</span> <span data-start="1097.73" data-end="1102.32">Node.js does a pretty good job with this by abstracting the way that messages are presented</span> <span data-start="1102.32" data-end="1109.12">from the internals of it, so JavaScript actually already does, I would say, well, some platforms</span> <span data-start="1109.12" data-end="1112.48">of JavaScript, does maybe 70 per cent of the work that you would need for this.</span> <span data-start="1112.48" data-end="1117.139">Go is an approach to error-handling that is different from most languages, but if you've</span> <span data-start="1117.139" data-end="1120.59">actually written JavaScript, you're probably still familiar with it, because in JavaScript,</span> <span data-start="1120.59" data-end="1127.899">you can't use access â€” exception handling to, or error handling within a callback because</span> <span data-start="1127.899" data-end="1129.09">it's asynchronous code.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1382.679" data-end="1386.299">That's a virtual certainty because of how widely used JavaScript is across the web and</span> <span data-start="1386.299" data-end="1391.509">how powerful the web has been in transforming people's lives, not just in English-speaking</span> <span data-start="1391.509" data-end="1394.34">countries, but really all around the world.</span> <span data-start="1394.34" data-end="1399.789">So, it means that there is really no language that is as well suited and JavaScript is to</span> <span data-start="1399.789" data-end="1404.129">being used by the entire world, not just people who speak English.</span> <span data-start="1404.129" data-end="1409.1">We have an opportunity to bridge this language divide, to make Hopper's vision a reality</span> <span data-start="1409.1" data-end="1413.049">in a way that no other programming language has been able to do before.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1413.049" data-end="1415.159">So, let's do that.</span> <span data-start="1415.159" data-end="1419.259">Let's make JavaScript a programming language that is truly accessible to everyone, no matter</span> <span data-start="1419.259" data-end="1422.549">what language you happen to speak.</span> <span data-start="1422.549" data-end="1426.83">Thank you.</span> </p>
