<p><span data-start="67.75" data-end="72.43">So I work at Microsoft, a site reliability engineer which means I don't do a lot of JavaScript</span> <span data-start="72.43" data-end="74.08">in the daytime.</span> <span data-start="74.08" data-end="80.72">I have been a JavaScript developer for quite had a while though, also a .NET developer.</span> <span data-start="80.72" data-end="86.95">I mainly focus on the domain of date and time so if you ever have questions about time zone,</span> <span data-start="86.95" data-end="93.89">daylight saving time, how to schedule things, any of those sorts of topics, you can probably</span> <span data-start="93.89" data-end="96.62">find me on Stack Overflow, that's usually where I hang out.</span> <span data-start="96.62" data-end="102.11">I also have a lot of open source daytime related libraries and if you've got daytime bugs on</span> <span data-start="102.11" data-end="107.17">your projects I may have jumped in and fixed it.</span> <span data-start="107.17" data-end="108.63">That's what I do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="108.63" data-end="112.86">And I like cheese, because everybody likes cheese.</span> <span data-start="112.86" data-end="115.64">So what is a date, let's talk about dates.</span> <span data-start="115.64" data-end="119.08">I think a date looks like this January 1st.</span> <span data-start="119.08" data-end="121.84">Everybody agree with me that's a date?</span> <span data-start="121.84" data-end="125.7">Yes, I think that's a date.</span> <span data-start="125.7" data-end="129.789">But that gets us into problems with JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="129.789" data-end="132.98">If we take a look at this little demo that I made here, this is literally all I have,</span> <span data-start="132.98" data-end="140.77">a HTML5 date input type, okay, and all I am going to do with that is just give you the</span> <span data-start="140.77" data-end="141.77">output.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="141.77" data-end="147.599">I am going to feed that into the value of an object and I am going to say to date string.</span> <span data-start="147.599" data-end="154.54">Let's say I was born today, okay, what happened here?</span> <span data-start="154.54" data-end="158.31">I picked May 7th but I got May 6th.</span> <span data-start="158.31" data-end="161.879">Does anybody ever run into this problem with the date object?</span> <span data-start="161.879" data-end="165.84">This is one of the things that people yell and scream about the date object.</span> <span data-start="165.84" data-end="166.84">What's going on here?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="166.84" data-end="170.7">What's going on here is that I'm from the United States and I haven't adjusted this</span> <span data-start="170.7" data-end="178.84">computer's time zone to be east of the UTC line, it's still west of it, so if you happen</span> <span data-start="178.84" data-end="185.219">to be that negative offset from UTC you will find that JavaScript will throw your dates</span> <span data-start="185.219" data-end="194.97">off by one, and this happens because the specification originally wasn't clear about what to do when</span> <span data-start="194.97" data-end="197.459">you only have a date.</span> <span data-start="197.459" data-end="203.09">It just said: if I've got some value what I don't know the offset then the offset must</span> <span data-start="203.09" data-end="204.139">be UTC.</span> <span data-start="204.139" data-end="207.67">Well, what's an UTC day?</span> <span data-start="207.67" data-end="212.64">From UTC midnight to UTC the end of midnight — the only people that I know of that are</span> <span data-start="212.64" data-end="215.151">always on an UTC day are mostly in Iceland.</span> <span data-start="215.151" data-end="219.81">Iceland is on GMT year round.</span> <span data-start="219.81" data-end="226.489">Even in Greenwich where they draw the Greenwich mean line, that's not on UTC all the time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="226.489" data-end="231.76">They are UTC plus one right now for British Summer Time so there's a discrepancy in the</span> <span data-start="231.76" data-end="237.51">last two forms here between this specification which is where we get all of our date and</span> <span data-start="237.51" data-end="243.09">time standards from and the other specification.</span> <span data-start="243.09" data-end="249.23">As you can see the third item on there is a date and a time and originally it was said</span> <span data-start="249.23" data-end="255.48">that should be UTC but they later corrected it to be local so fortunately for date and</span> <span data-start="255.48" data-end="262.84">times we now know all modern browsers will be on local time but for date forms they got</span> <span data-start="262.84" data-end="267.379">stuck with UTC and really this comes down to web reality.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="267.379" data-end="271.15">We wanted to change it, the implementers all wanted to change it but when Chrome tried</span> <span data-start="271.15" data-end="278.23">there were so many lash backs within a small window that they had to revert so the script</span> <span data-start="278.23" data-end="285.05">now only says four date only forms they are UTC and that's because that's the reality</span> <span data-start="285.05" data-end="289.77">of the web since the early days of the Internet.</span> <span data-start="289.77" data-end="293.37">But a date — what is a date?</span> <span data-start="293.37" data-end="302.1">It's not [audio problem] in JavaScript it's not, it's a time stamp.</span> <span data-start="302.1" data-end="312.889">It's the number of seconds since — the number of milliseconds since — you can't have.</span> <span data-start="312.889" data-end="317.56">We lost display here.</span> <span data-start="317.56" data-end="319.3">Hold on.</span> <span data-start="319.3" data-end="327.539">There we go, so we can't have just the date represented in terms of milliseconds.</span> <span data-start="327.539" data-end="336.02">You all should probably know this but not every day is a whole number of 24 hours exactly</span> <span data-start="336.02" data-end="340.409">and the days that aren't are random all around the world because of time zones.</span> <span data-start="340.409" data-end="343.919">When we are in standard time and then we switch to summertime or we call it daylight time</span> <span data-start="343.919" data-end="351.99">in some parts of the world, we might have a 23 or 25-hour local day depending on which</span> <span data-start="351.99" data-end="356.44">way we are transitioning.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="356.44" data-end="364.33">If you live on this small island called Lord Howe Island they only switch by half an hour</span> <span data-start="364.33" data-end="370.99">so you will have a 23.5-hour day, or a 24.5-hour day, so you can't just measure a date in terms</span> <span data-start="370.99" data-end="372.05">of milliseconds.</span> <span data-start="372.05" data-end="374.639">It's the wrong type.</span> <span data-start="374.639" data-end="376.99">I like to call it a datish.</span> <span data-start="376.99" data-end="383.58">We have the falsey, truthy, it's a datish.</span> <span data-start="383.58" data-end="388">There's this wonderful quote: off by one and naming thins, cash validation doesn't apply</span> <span data-start="388" data-end="389">here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="389" data-end="393.65">I usually throw time zones into the mix of things that are hard in computer science so</span> <span data-start="393.65" data-end="398.169">one wonders what were they thinking, why did they do this?</span> <span data-start="398.169" data-end="403.56">I have to go back to this, Brendan and I, one of the inventors of JavaScript called</span> <span data-start="403.56" data-end="409.9">Live Script back then, they had very little time to do this and they were told just make</span> <span data-start="409.9" data-end="416.06">it look like Java, and he has told us many times, and there's a couple of blog posts.</span> <span data-start="416.06" data-end="424.129">Actually it was Ken Smith, not Brendan, Ken of net scape, took the utility code from Java</span> <span data-start="424.129" data-end="432.439">in the implementation and translated into the implementation for the early days to JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="432.439" data-end="434.159">This is what that looked like.</span> <span data-start="434.159" data-end="438.101">Everybody thinks that it all happened all at once but if you look at the dates you can</span> <span data-start="438.101" data-end="441.74">see that when they developed it Java was in beta.</span> <span data-start="441.74" data-end="442.74">Nobody had used this thing.</span> <span data-start="442.74" data-end="449.479">They just said this is how Java does dates so this is how JavaScript will do dates and</span> <span data-start="449.479" data-end="457.99">by the time Java 1.0 came out the JavaScript prototype was set in stone and then when Java</span> <span data-start="457.99" data-end="464.38">1.1 came out we deprecated almost all the functionality, moving it off to something</span> <span data-start="464.38" data-end="471.379">called Java calendar so we are stuck with a model that was fundamentally broken and</span> <span data-start="471.379" data-end="476.599">found pretty early on, and we never did anything about.</span> <span data-start="476.599" data-end="483.83">We published ECMAScript 1.0 afterwards and adjusted that and that's just what we have</span> <span data-start="483.83" data-end="489.56">today, so there's a lot of things that are wrong besides just the date parsing.</span> <span data-start="489.56" data-end="493.58">I showed you how when you parse the date you can be off by one but look at this code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="493.58" data-end="497.639">Can anybody guess what this result?</span> <span data-start="497.639" data-end="498.639">This looks reasonable.</span> <span data-start="498.639" data-end="502.33">A lot of people would write something like this.</span> <span data-start="502.33" data-end="505.34">Just think in your mind what you might think it is.</span> <span data-start="505.34" data-end="508.699">I look at that and say: well, it's December 31st and I'm adding a month so it must be</span> <span data-start="508.699" data-end="516.82">January 31st, is the result.</span> <span data-start="516.82" data-end="521.979"Audience member: [off mic] MATT: We end up at March 2nd.</span> <span data-start="521.979" data-end="527.62">Only when I run this code from this time zone in Berlin.</span> <span data-start="527.62" data-end="540.079">Notice in terms of time we did something implicit which</span> <span data-start="540.079" data-end="545.22">converted it from local to UTC time and gave me an UTC-based time stamp so not only do</span> <span data-start="545.22" data-end="553.1">I end up on March 2nd, because I actually started on November 31st, which doesn't exist,</span> <span data-start="553.1" data-end="556.51">so I started — sorry, on January 31st.</span> <span data-start="556.51" data-end="562.44">So I went to February 31st, which doesn't exist, so I went into March, and then I went</span> <span data-start="562.44" data-end="564.66">back an hour for UTC.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="564.66" data-end="565.92">So there's a lot of things wrong with this.</span> <span data-start="565.92" data-end="569.68">The other thing that it highlights is that data is mutable.</span> <span data-start="569.68" data-end="570.68">Notice how I've added a month?</span> <span data-start="570.68" data-end="575.3">I had on get the month and then increment it and then rely on this bubbling functionality</span> <span data-start="575.3" data-end="579.67">in order to move from one month to the next.</span> <span data-start="579.67" data-end="585.36">These are really difficult concepts, especially for a beginner developer.</span> <span data-start="585.36" data-end="589.649">Date in almost any other language is a value type, it's immutable.</span> <span data-start="589.649" data-end="592.97">It doesn't change once you create it.</span> <span data-start="592.97" data-end="597.05">If you add a month, you have a specific method; add a month and you get back the one with</span> <span data-start="597.05" data-end="598.41">the month added.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="598.41" data-end="602.88">The other thing we have wrong with date is notice nowhere here did I say what time I</span> <span data-start="602.88" data-end="607.4">was starting, I just started it in local time so the only thing it supports is the local</span> <span data-start="607.4" data-end="610.63">time that the environment is running on and UTC.</span> <span data-start="610.63" data-end="617.39">Well, that's really bad if you are a Node developer because nobody cares about the times</span> <span data-start="617.39" data-end="618.6">going on your server.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="618.6" data-end="622.49">You really shouldn't care about times going on your server anyway.</span> <span data-start="622.49" data-end="630.94">Okay, this one I love, strings should be interchangeable in most JavaScript things, we have string</span> <span data-start="630.94" data-end="633.54">0, regular 0, 00, or 000.</span> <span data-start="633.54" data-end="638.149">Does anybody think this should give the same results, whatever they might be?</span> <span data-start="638.149" data-end="641.6">They kind of should be the same defaults.</span> <span data-start="641.6" data-end="646.82">I will give you a hint, they are in descending order here.</span> <span data-start="646.82" data-end="652.45">Every one of those things is going to give you something different, and so the first</span> <span data-start="652.45" data-end="656.61">one is because when you only parse a number as a string it's treated as a year, so year</span> <span data-start="656.61" data-end="662.493">2000, and anything that is parsed as a number is treated as a time stamp so we are right</span> <span data-start="662.493" data-end="664.27">at the epoch there.</span> <span data-start="664.27" data-end="674.699">Notice it's not midnight there, it's 11.00am so not even the same time.</span> <span data-start="674.699" data-end="676.959">1.00am.</span> <span data-start="676.959" data-end="687.1">1900 is because if you pass a year from 0 to 99 JavaScript data treats that as 1900</span> <span data-start="687.1" data-end="692.829">to avoid Y2K problems but as soon as you go to 100 that is year 100 so they are not even</span> <span data-start="692.829" data-end="696.98">sequential in terms of parameters.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="696.98" data-end="702.86">And 09 just because of the overflow situation I showed you before, we have no such thing</span> <span data-start="702.86" data-end="706.77">as the easier day of the month so it just goes back one day.</span> <span data-start="706.77" data-end="710.32">What do we do with this?</span> <span data-start="710.32" data-end="714.54">We saw Java came out with Joda-Time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="714.54" data-end="717.69">If you are a Java developer you should be familiar with it.</span> <span data-start="717.69" data-end="726.459">It is the base for 3010 which made its way onto Java 8 so you should be using Java 8</span> <span data-start="726.459" data-end="733.52">with the time package with a few tweaks to make it better.</span> <span data-start="733.52" data-end="738.579">There is alternate one that is also very good called Time4J and they take a little different</span> <span data-start="738.579" data-end="742.389">philosophy between the two.</span> <span data-start="742.389" data-end="746.009">We also had to address this with libraries.</span> <span data-start="746.009" data-end="753.399">Really early on there was a date JS library and I don't recommend you use that today but</span> <span data-start="753.399" data-end="758.69">Sugar and Moment came on the scene in 2011 and Sugar is still pretty good if you want</span> <span data-start="758.69" data-end="765.16">to do something called natural language parsing, like if you have a string that says: what</span> <span data-start="765.16" data-end="769.82">time is it three days and two months from now and it's actually spelt out as a string,</span> <span data-start="769.82" data-end="774.41">Sugar will parse that and try to make a good guess at it.</span> <span data-start="774.41" data-end="777.2">But most people are using Moment.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="777.2" data-end="782.899">Moment does about 90% of the things you would want to do with date and time.</span> <span data-start="782.899" data-end="785.14">Maybe even 99%.</span> <span data-start="785.14" data-end="788.35">But Moment isn't the only thing out there.</span> <span data-start="788.35" data-end="792.56">There are people working on a port of the Joda-Time standard into JavaScript, that's</span> <span data-start="792.56" data-end="796.66">the js-joda library and I think JS is pretty awesome.</span> <span data-start="796.66" data-end="804.589">There is also this thing called date functions which has got a lot of notoriety lately, which</span> <span data-start="804.589" data-end="809.13">says instead of a very large JavaScript object if all you need to do is add a month, let's</span> <span data-start="809.13" data-end="810.38">just add a month.</span> <span data-start="810.38" data-end="815.35">So you pull in individual functions for different things, so I am going to show you those libraries.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="815.35" data-end="822.05">Moment I saw everybody is familiar with.</span> <span data-start="822.05" data-end="824.85">We are very specific when we do our parsing.</span> <span data-start="824.85" data-end="830.589">We don't make that assumption that said: I can tell you what you want.</span> <span data-start="830.589" data-end="835.13">No, I can't always tell what you want, sometimes you have to tell me so if you give me a string</span> <span data-start="835.13" data-end="839.68">with no context and you don't tell me what it is then I will assume it's local time because</span> <span data-start="839.68" data-end="841.73">that's what the date object does.</span> <span data-start="841.73" data-end="845.79">If you give me a string with no context and tell me you want it as UTC then I will assume</span> <span data-start="845.79" data-end="850.5">it is UTC and we have time zone support through the Moment time grown library that imports</span> <span data-start="850.5" data-end="857.089">the database that pretty much all modern computing uses.</span> <span data-start="857.089" data-end="863.66">Moment's API is fluid and intentional so we can do something liked and 200 days and then</span> <span data-start="863.66" data-end="864.66">format that.</span> <span data-start="864.66" data-end="869.009">I can tell exactly what my input style should be so there's no confusion on whether that's</span> <span data-start="869.009" data-end="878.06">July 5th or May 7th, because I'm telling you explicitly that it's day, month, year format.</span> <span data-start="878.06" data-end="883.49">The only problem that we have lately with Moment is it is still a mutable API and that's</span> <span data-start="883.49" data-end="889.2">because when it was originally developed it was built using the JavaScript date object</span> <span data-start="889.2" data-end="894.649">as its basis so notice I clone the Moment here before I start adding to it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="894.649" data-end="899.85">If I didn't do that, it wouldn't just output the same string here but would also change</span> <span data-start="899.85" data-end="904.94">the value of this M variable, so it's important when you are working with Moment that you</span> <span data-start="904.94" data-end="907.55">realise it does mutate the object as you work through its API.</span> <span data-start="907.55" data-end="910.18">That's something we are considering from OF3O.</span> <span data-start="910.18" data-end="920.46">There's some progress on that so hopeful we will have a Moment 30 with immutable API.</span> <span data-start="920.46" data-end="922.149">You can validate simple dates.</span> <span data-start="922.149" data-end="925.99">It does what it says it does and it does it pretty good.</span> <span data-start="925.99" data-end="930.06">Let's look at this date functions library I mentioned.</span> <span data-start="930.06" data-end="934.56">It's very lightweight and modular, and the intent is every single function is its own</span> <span data-start="934.56" data-end="936.88">module so you only pull on the ones you need.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="936.88" data-end="941.329">If all I need is something that will format a string and add some days then I just import</span> <span data-start="941.329" data-end="943.9">those to functions.</span> <span data-start="943.9" data-end="949.85">It uses date objects as I was saying so I create a date object, I format it, I get the</span> <span data-start="949.85" data-end="950.85">output.</span> <span data-start="950.85" data-end="956.079">Again, remember that JavaScript date object has zero base months so it looks like I'm</span> <span data-start="956.079" data-end="967.1">parsing January 1st but it is not, it is February 1st so the string says February 1st.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="967.1" data-end="974.27">This adds days as it says, so it doesn't add a value.</span> <span data-start="974.27" data-end="979.36">So if you want immutable functions check out date functions.</span> <span data-start="979.36" data-end="987.69">Js-joda is also really good, it also has an immutable API, it models separation of concerns</span> <span data-start="987.69" data-end="992.819">very well so we have a different object which is a local date and local in this context</span> <span data-start="992.819" data-end="998.31">doesn't mean local to the computer; it means not — it means could be local anywhere.</span> <span data-start="998.31" data-end="1001.209">It means somebody is local.</span> <span data-start="1001.209" data-end="1006.269">And that's just terminology that has been borrowed over from the ISO8601 standard into</span> <span data-start="1006.269" data-end="1011.99">Java and now up into js-joda so you may see that a few places.</span> <span data-start="1011.99" data-end="1020.27">When we work with this API, we don't have to have the API guess what we want; we tell</span> <span data-start="1020.27" data-end="1021.49">it specifically what we want.</span> <span data-start="1021.49" data-end="1027.54">We say: here is a date, get the start of the day, I wants that for Berlin and then I want</span> <span data-start="1027.54" data-end="1032.13">to know the equivalent time in the computer's local time or in UTC.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1032.13" data-end="1034.2">I can do these things very easily.</span> <span data-start="1034.2" data-end="1037.15">The start of day function is a really interesting concept also.</span> <span data-start="1037.15" data-end="1043.949">Keep in mind that not every day starts right at midnight so a start of day isn't just snap</span> <span data-start="1043.949" data-end="1046.19">to midnight and truncate off data.</span> <span data-start="1046.19" data-end="1049.14">If you are in Brazil or a few other places around the world when they start daylight</span> <span data-start="1049.14" data-end="1058.82">saving time they go from 11.5959 of the night before up to 0100, so you have to have those</span> <span data-start="1058.82" data-end="1065.32">rules in your data to know that the start of day is not necessarily midnight.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1065.32" data-end="1070.73">And Joda-Time is also immutable, so we have D1 and D2 here being different objects, the</span> <span data-start="1070.73" data-end="1072.909">same as I showed you before.</span> <span data-start="1072.909" data-end="1074.55">So what are we going to do?</span> <span data-start="1074.55" data-end="1078.03">How are we going to get out of this mess where we don't have to use libraries or deal with</span> <span data-start="1078.03" data-end="1080.02">an API that is broken.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1080.02" data-end="1084.74">I think we should fix it, do you think we should fix it?</span> <span data-start="1084.74" data-end="1100.59">So Moment.js is a JavaScript Foundation member, Maddie and Brian Terlson are helping with</span> <span data-start="1100.59" data-end="1105.6">this and we've reached stage 1 which means we have general approval of the committee</span> <span data-start="1105.6" data-end="1109.58">to think about how to do a new date API.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1109.58" data-end="1115.169">We have a general idea about what we want but it is not locked in so definitely come</span> <span data-start="1115.169" data-end="1121.96">take a look and give your opinions, we will take issues on GitHub, we will take poll requests,</span> <span data-start="1121.96" data-end="1127.73">any way you want to talk to us or come find Maggie after the talk here.</span> <span data-start="1127.73" data-end="1129.76">Generally we want to make date better.</span> <span data-start="1129.76" data-end="1135.38">We want to learn from the APIs that have come before us, not just in JavaScript but in other</span> <span data-start="1135.38" data-end="1141.409">languages, we want to be comfortable for everybody who uses JavaScript so it needs to be idiomatic,</span> <span data-start="1141.409" data-end="1145.84">not to bring in a whole load of Java cruft and other things that don't apply, at least</span> <span data-start="1145.84" data-end="1150.52">not today, and we are going to do the 1 base months, not the 0 base months.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1150.52" data-end="1154.07">I will put my foot down on that one.</span> <span data-start="1154.07" data-end="1163.33">Possible ideas: it might look like Moment, or Joda-Time or Time4J, it might be that we</span> <span data-start="1163.33" data-end="1172.46">provide functionality so that platforms can do what they need to do in a smaller and more</span> <span data-start="1172.46" data-end="1176.53">direct way but we don't know yet, so help us figure it out.</span> <span data-start="1176.53" data-end="1180.71">Here are some examples, and you can see we have this zone date time object that's a very</span> <span data-start="1180.71" data-end="1186.46">joda-like object but I'm not doing a lot of object construction to get the time zone.</span> <span data-start="1186.46" data-end="1190.2">I'm just parsing them along as strings.</span> <span data-start="1190.2" data-end="1200.419">If I want to add time, I might do something like add to, and that's very Moment-like.</span> <span data-start="1200.419" data-end="1202.24">What else might we be able to do?</span> <span data-start="1202.24" data-end="1207.38">This is actually a very complex problem if you are in a scheduling environment.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1207.38" data-end="1212.12">If I need to run an event at the same time every day but it's in the user's local day,</span> <span data-start="1212.12" data-end="1217.799">so this is a starting point and then I say I want the next four occurrences but I'm crossing</span> <span data-start="1217.799" data-end="1223.95">a daylight saving time transition so 8.00am every day even when the offset in the Pacific</span> <span data-start="1223.95" data-end="1229.69">time zone changes from minus 8 to minus 7 you can see here the UTC output has changed</span> <span data-start="1229.69" data-end="1234.99">also so I cannot schedule in UTC time, I need to schedule in local time and doing that without</span> <span data-start="1234.99" data-end="1237.909">a library is really, really hard with the JavaScript object.</span> <span data-start="1237.909" data-end="1244.279">Most people will just say: plus 24, times 60, times 60, times whatever to get the next</span> <span data-start="1244.279" data-end="1247.76">instant but then you will find you're running at 7.00 or 9.00am and they will be off by</span> <span data-start="1247.76" data-end="1251.56">one.</span> <span data-start="1251.56" data-end="1254.57">It would look something like this.</span> <span data-start="1254.57" data-end="1258.31">If you think this looks awful and you have a better idea, come talk to us.</span> <span data-start="1258.31" data-end="1263.3">If you think this is great, let us know, and that's really all I've got so please give</span> <span data-start="1263.3" data-end="1264.3">your feedback.</span> <span data-start="1264.3" data-end="1269.02">If you have other questions, come find me afterwards, or you can always post on Stack</span> </p>
