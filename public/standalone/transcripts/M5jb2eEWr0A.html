<p><span data-start="38.82" data-end="40.95">I'm bisexual and I'm an atheist and I</span> <span data-start="40.95" data-end="42.6">was also born and raised in multiple</span> <span data-start="42.6" data-end="45.539">places in Texas which is one of the most</span> <span data-start="45.539" data-end="47.489">conservative places in the entire United</span> <span data-start="47.489" data-end="49.62">States one of the cities I lived in was</span> <span data-start="49.62" data-end="50.899">actually ranked as the second most</span> <span data-start="50.899" data-end="53.039">conservative city in the entire country</span> <span data-start="53.039" data-end="55.53">so I let you piece together what that</span> <span data-start="55.53" data-end="57.21">was like growing up it was not pleasant</span> <span data-start="57.21" data-end="59.67">let's just say a little more recently</span> <span data-start="59.67" data-end="61.05">though I was involved in the node.js</span> <span data-start="61.05" data-end="63.03">project for about two years where I</span> <span data-start="63.03" data-end="65.04">focus specifically on diversity and</span> <span data-start="65.04" data-end="67.5">inclusivity and the project I helped to</span> <span data-start="67.5" data-end="69.27">found the inclusivity working group</span> <span data-start="69.27" data-end="71.189">which was the first group that kind of</span> <span data-start="71.189" data-end="73.65">was working on culture and then later on</span> <span data-start="73.65" data-end="75.96">as we kind of restructured some things I</span> <span data-start="75.96" data-end="77.64">helped to found the community committee</span> <span data-start="77.64" data-end="79.17">which is the current group that is</span> <span data-start="79.17" data-end="81.479">responsible for culture in the project</span> <span data-start="81.479" data-end="84.06">as well as a number of other things so I</span> <span data-start="84.06" data-end="85.59">like to think that I've learned a few</span> <span data-start="85.59" data-end="87.72">things along the way throughout all this</span> <span data-start="87.72" data-end="92.13">process right so privilege this is a</span> <span data-start="92.13" data-end="93.99">topic that gets in a word that gets</span> <span data-start="93.99" data-end="97.11">thrown around quite a bit and sometimes</span> <span data-start="97.11" data-end="99.39">the ingenuously sometimes in less</span> <span data-start="99.39" data-end="101.67">tenuous ways shall we say and I think</span> <span data-start="101.67" data-end="102.81">there's a lot of misconceptions about</span> <span data-start="102.81" data-end="105.45">what it is and what it represents so</span> <span data-start="105.45" data-end="107.189">want to spend some time boiling that</span> <span data-start="107.189" data-end="108.72">down it just really talking about what</span> <span data-start="108.72" data-end="110.009">it actually means in the way it</span> <span data-start="110.009" data-end="113.31">manifests itself and I'm gonna do so by</span> <span data-start="113.31" data-end="115.95">making analogies with bug reports</span> <span data-start="115.95" data-end="117.63">actually because I think they're as it</span> <span data-start="117.63" data-end="118.71">turns out are actually quite a few</span> <span data-start="118.71" data-end="122.1">similarities so this is a problem that</span> <span data-start="122.1" data-end="123.329">we tend to have a lot let's say we've</span> <span data-start="123.329" data-end="125.399">got a user they're using you know our</span> <span data-start="125.399" data-end="127.59">product or say or managing an open</span> <span data-start="127.59" data-end="129.66">source project and so these users are</span> <span data-start="129.66" data-end="131.52">using our library so they try and use</span> <span data-start="131.52" data-end="134.16">this thing and they run into problems</span> <span data-start="134.16" data-end="135.48">they get a cryptic error message when</span> <span data-start="135.48" data-end="137.49">they try to log in to a site maybe the</span> <span data-start="137.49" data-end="139.5">library is crashing on startup you know</span> <span data-start="139.5" data-end="141.9">whatever it is something got in the way</span> <span data-start="141.9" data-end="143.28">a bud got in the way of the user being</span> <span data-start="143.28" data-end="146.61">able to use our product and so you know</span> <span data-start="146.61" data-end="147.81">this is bad enough that they go and they</span> <span data-start="147.81" data-end="150.03">file a support issue or they open an</span> <span data-start="150.03" data-end="151.89">issue on github and they say hey I'm</span> <span data-start="151.89" data-end="153.51">trying to use your thing and it's not</span> <span data-start="153.51" data-end="156.18">working so you is the engineer you know</span> <span data-start="156.18" data-end="157.95">you pick up this bug and you go and you</span> <span data-start="157.95" data-end="159.81">try to reproduce it so you know you</span> <span data-start="159.81" data-end="161.46">follow the same steps they did to get to</span> <span data-start="161.46" data-end="164.01">it and well it just works for you</span> <span data-start="164.01" data-end="166.41">right you can't reproduce this bug at</span> <span data-start="166.41" data-end="168.6">all it works on your machine so mark the</span> <span data-start="168.6" data-end="171.27">bug as closed can't reproduce and move</span> <span data-start="171.27" data-end="174.09">on we've all been there I have certainly</span> <span data-start="174.09" data-end="175.59">done that a number of times in my</span> <span data-start="175.59" data-end="177.72">engineering career so far but there's</span> <span data-start="177.72" data-end="179.48">like two sort of simultaneous truths</span> <span data-start="179.48" data-end="181.5">that I think are important to keep in</span> <span data-start="181.5" data-end="183.75">mind the first one is that it's true it</span> <span data-start="183.75" data-end="184.41">worked</span> <span data-start="184.41" data-end="186.42">for you like you know it worked on our</span> <span data-start="186.42" data-end="188.76">machines and so you know we are not</span> <span data-start="188.76" data-end="190.53">encountering that bug ourselves like</span> <span data-start="190.53" data-end="192.87">that is absolutely true the other thing</span> <span data-start="192.87" data-end="194.67">that is also true at the same time is</span> <span data-start="194.67" data-end="197.1">that this user that was using the</span> <span data-start="197.1" data-end="199.74">library or product or whatever did</span> <span data-start="199.74" data-end="202.11">encounter that bug like that bug exists</span> <span data-start="202.11" data-end="204.66">right even if we can't reproduce it that</span> <span data-start="204.66" data-end="207.18">bug still exists and the reason this</span> <span data-start="207.18" data-end="210.24">typically happens is because the context</span> <span data-start="210.24" data-end="211.89">of the user like the technical context</span> <span data-start="211.89" data-end="213.209">of the user is different than the</span> <span data-start="213.209" data-end="215.19">technical context of you you know we</span> <span data-start="215.19" data-end="217.709">typically tend to develop on really you</span> <span data-start="217.709" data-end="220.47">know new fast MacBook Pros or something</span> <span data-start="220.47" data-end="222.12">similar to that like we have powerful</span> <span data-start="222.12" data-end="224.73">machines that are new we also typically</span> <span data-start="224.73" data-end="228.15">have very fast internet access and a lot</span> <span data-start="228.15" data-end="229.38">of times users don't necessarily have</span> <span data-start="229.38" data-end="230.19">that you know they might have a</span> <span data-start="230.19" data-end="232.92">ten-year-old Dell running yo Windows 7</span> <span data-start="232.92" data-end="236.16">that is like heavily locked down and</span> <span data-start="236.16" data-end="238.26">perhaps they have really poor internet</span> <span data-start="238.26" data-end="240">speeds or very intermittent internet you</span> <span data-start="240" data-end="241.44">know there's these differences in</span> <span data-start="241.44" data-end="244.56">context this technical context that</span> <span data-start="244.56" data-end="246.51">caused the user to encounter the bug and</span> <span data-start="246.51" data-end="247.98">we didn't you know it could have been</span> <span data-start="247.98" data-end="251.22">say a race condition in our code but</span> <span data-start="251.22" data-end="253.05">this race condition was only exposed</span> <span data-start="253.05" data-end="254.64">whenever the performance was slow enough</span> <span data-start="254.64" data-end="257.7">for the network was slow enough and so</span> <span data-start="257.7" data-end="259.68">it was like the bug absolutely exists in</span> <span data-start="259.68" data-end="261.419">the code regardless of whether or not we</span> <span data-start="261.419" data-end="263.1">encountered it and the difference is</span> <span data-start="263.1" data-end="266.4">that context and that's basically what</span> <span data-start="266.4" data-end="267.75">privileges in a</span> <span data-start="267.75" data-end="269.67">in a nutshell it's the case where we</span> <span data-start="269.67" data-end="271.86">exist in a context in the broader world</span> <span data-start="271.86" data-end="274.47">you know we live in the country we lived</span> <span data-start="274.47" data-end="276.42">and we had the parents that we had with</span> <span data-start="276.42" data-end="278.34">their financial situation you know we</span> <span data-start="278.34" data-end="280.52">are the gender we are they are the</span> <span data-start="280.52" data-end="282.96">ethnicity we are we are the sexual</span> <span data-start="282.96" data-end="284.34">orientation we are and so on and so</span> <span data-start="284.34" data-end="286.59">forth so like we all exist within these</span> <span data-start="286.59" data-end="289.17">contexts and there's a lot of bugs in</span> <span data-start="289.17" data-end="291.75">society you know bugs that trace back</span> <span data-start="291.75" data-end="294.24">thousands and thousands of years and so</span> <span data-start="294.24" data-end="296.82">depending on the context that we live in</span> <span data-start="296.82" data-end="300.03">we may or may not encounter these bugs</span> <span data-start="300.03" data-end="302.04">in society and that's what privilege is</span> <span data-start="302.04" data-end="303.63">is when we exist in a context that</span> <span data-start="303.63" data-end="305.34">allows us to sidestep this bug</span> <span data-start="305.34" data-end="307.71">oftentimes without us even realizing</span> <span data-start="307.71" data-end="309.93">that we have done that and one thing I</span> <span data-start="309.93" data-end="312">would note is there is nothing you know</span> <span data-start="312" data-end="313.86">there's not a value judgment that I'm</span> <span data-start="313.86" data-end="316.02">placing on the person here just like you</span> <span data-start="316.02" data-end="317.04">know we don't judge the value of a</span> <span data-start="317.04" data-end="318.96">person based on whether their employer</span> <span data-start="318.96" data-end="321.66">issued them a new MacBook Pro or an old</span> <span data-start="321.66" data-end="323.25">dell laptop like that doesn't say</span> <span data-start="323.25" data-end="325.59">anything about the person but that is</span> <span data-start="325.59" data-end="327.15">the context and that is how they view</span> <span data-start="327.15" data-end="331.77">the world at the same time so speaking</span> <span data-start="331.77" data-end="333.33">of contacts a lot of times like as</span> <span data-start="333.33" data-end="335.13">engineers we don't know what the users</span> <span data-start="335.13" data-end="336.93">context is at least not fully you know</span> <span data-start="336.93" data-end="339.21">the user files this bug you know we</span> <span data-start="339.21" data-end="340.65">hopefully will figure out you know what</span> <span data-start="340.65" data-end="342.33">browser they're running on you know for</span> <span data-start="342.33" data-end="343.5">really lucky we'll figure out which</span> <span data-start="343.5" data-end="345.09">browser version in which operating</span> <span data-start="345.09" data-end="347.01">system and we oftentimes don't know the</span> <span data-start="347.01" data-end="349.08">rest we don't know what their ISP is we</span> <span data-start="349.08" data-end="350.31">especially don't know what their</span> <span data-start="350.31" data-end="351.99">networking conditions were at the time</span> <span data-start="351.99" data-end="353.85">of that bug and sometimes there's even</span> <span data-start="353.85" data-end="356.34">things that could contribute to the bug</span> <span data-start="356.34" data-end="357.99">that we don't even know are things that</span> <span data-start="357.99" data-end="360.36">could contribute to a bug a really good</span> <span data-start="360.36" data-end="361.86">example actually ran into one last week</span> <span data-start="361.86" data-end="363.36">when I was doing some technical work I</span> <span data-start="363.36" data-end="365.28">was working with Asher file storage</span> <span data-start="365.28" data-end="366.93">which is a way of storing files in the</span> <span data-start="366.93" data-end="369.03">cloud pretty straightforward I was</span> <span data-start="369.03" data-end="370.229">following the documentation and I'm</span> <span data-start="370.229" data-end="371.76">trying to connect to the service to</span> <span data-start="371.76" data-end="374.34">upload some files and I just couldn't</span> <span data-start="374.34" data-end="376.169">connect I was trying everything reading</span> <span data-start="376.169" data-end="378.27">the documentation following the steps in</span> <span data-start="378.27" data-end="380.04">the azure documentation and what</span> <span data-start="380.04" data-end="381.84">should've work just was not working for</span> <span data-start="381.84" data-end="382.19">me</span> <span data-start="382.19" data-end="384.36">turns out it was actually a problem with</span> <span data-start="384.36" data-end="386.85">my ISP they were blocking port 445</span> <span data-start="386.85" data-end="389.34">outbound and I didn't even realize that</span> <span data-start="389.34" data-end="391.26">like I didn't even think to think about</span> <span data-start="391.26" data-end="392.729">that problem and I spent about a day on</span> <span data-start="392.729" data-end="394.05">it until I realized what was going on</span> <span data-start="394.05" data-end="396.51">and so a lot of times you know it's not</span> <span data-start="396.51" data-end="398.37">that we just that we don't know the</span> <span data-start="398.37" data-end="400.65">users context but we don't know the</span> <span data-start="400.65" data-end="401.46">things</span> <span data-start="401.46" data-end="403.169">that we don't know that are contributing</span> <span data-start="403.169" data-end="406.319">to the bug so that's basically what this</span> <span data-start="406.319" data-end="409.319">concept of unconscious biases so in</span> <span data-start="409.319" data-end="411.21">society there's a lot of times a lot of</span> <span data-start="411.21" data-end="413.25">things that affect certain groups of</span> <span data-start="413.25" data-end="416.52">people that we don't even think or we</span> <span data-start="416.52" data-end="418.199">aren't even aware of that is an actual</span> <span data-start="418.199" data-end="419.789">problem</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="419.789" data-end="422.19">I think perhaps a good example of this</span> <span data-start="422.19" data-end="423.93">is if we there have been some studies</span> <span data-start="423.93" data-end="425.97">that have shown in meetings you know men</span> <span data-start="425.97" data-end="427.889">tend to talk a lot more than women do</span> <span data-start="427.889" data-end="430.77">and sort of the intuitive reaction that</span> <span data-start="430.77" data-end="432.09">a lot of us men will have is that Oh</span> <span data-start="432.09" data-end="434.31">women should just speak up more but</span> <span data-start="434.31" data-end="435.509">there's a whole bunch of other things</span> <span data-start="435.509" data-end="436.83">that actually play into it a lot of</span> <span data-start="436.83" data-end="438.539">societal dynamics that make that a lot</span> <span data-start="438.539" data-end="440.4">more complicated and the things that you</span> <span data-start="440.4" data-end="442.289">know we as men are just not aware of you</span> <span data-start="442.289" data-end="443.91">know we're unconscious to this and</span> <span data-start="443.91" data-end="445.889">because we're not aware of them we end</span> <span data-start="445.889" data-end="447.599">up having these biases that come into</span> <span data-start="447.599" data-end="450.36">play now like I said this is unconscious</span> <span data-start="450.36" data-end="452.31">if we're not doing this on purpose at</span> <span data-start="452.31" data-end="457.139">all but it is still there so another</span> <span data-start="457.139" data-end="458.789">thing that we tend to see a lot is that</span> <span data-start="458.789" data-end="461.28">a lot of small bugs can add up to really</span> <span data-start="461.28" data-end="463.139">big frustrations you know I think we've</span> <span data-start="463.139" data-end="464.49">all used these services you know we</span> <span data-start="464.49" data-end="466.08">start we log in for the first time we</span> <span data-start="466.08" data-end="467.97">might encounter a small bug along the</span> <span data-start="467.97" data-end="469.949">way say we log in it goes through a</span> <span data-start="469.949" data-end="472.5">redirect flow from off and that redirect</span> <span data-start="472.5" data-end="473.88">just like stalls in the middle for some</span> <span data-start="473.88" data-end="475.74">reason you know we may not know why but</span> <span data-start="475.74" data-end="478.11">it just it sticks and so you know we</span> <span data-start="478.11" data-end="479.729">have to go up manually hit that refresh</span> <span data-start="479.729" data-end="481.71">button and then it loads and goes along</span> <span data-start="481.71" data-end="484.259">its merry way that's a bug it's not a</span> <span data-start="484.259" data-end="486.03">very big one it's a small detail you</span> <span data-start="486.03" data-end="487.11">know it didn't get in the way of us</span> <span data-start="487.11" data-end="489.449">using our product well that's just kind</span> <span data-start="489.449" data-end="491.28">of annoying but then we logged it then</span> <span data-start="491.28" data-end="492.509">once we're in we start encountering a</span> <span data-start="492.509" data-end="494.639">lot more of these little things you know</span> <span data-start="494.639" data-end="496.62">maybe there's a label that's just kind</span> <span data-start="496.62" data-end="498.419">of cutting off screen a little bit or</span> <span data-start="498.419" data-end="499.889">maybe there's a button that you had to</span> <span data-start="499.889" data-end="501.539">click on twice before it'll actually</span> <span data-start="501.539" data-end="503.43">activate you know once again every</span> <span data-start="503.43" data-end="504.93">single one of these bugs is a low</span> <span data-start="504.93" data-end="507.5">priority bug but when added up together</span> <span data-start="507.5" data-end="510.659">they add up to a really big frustrating</span> <span data-start="510.659" data-end="512.31">application you know we tend to say that</span> <span data-start="512.31" data-end="513.539">these kind of applications like oh that</span> <span data-start="513.539" data-end="515.669">is so buggy I hate this app you know</span> <span data-start="515.669" data-end="518.099">it's not we don't approach this as like</span> <span data-start="518.099" data-end="519.779">oh yeah there's a bunch of little things</span> <span data-start="519.779" data-end="521.25">but overall the app is great no that's</span> <span data-start="521.25" data-end="524.88">not how our brains actually work you</span> <span data-start="524.88" data-end="526.589">know that each of those bugs sort of</span> <span data-start="526.589" data-end="528.329">they they're not even just like a linear</span> <span data-start="528.329" data-end="530.04">additive thing they kind of multiply</span> <span data-start="530.04" data-end="530.94">against each other</span> <span data-start="530.94" data-end="533.339">and it becomes a really serious issue</span> <span data-start="533.339" data-end="534.71">and you know we end up lose</span> <span data-start="534.71" data-end="537.44">users and things like that so that's</span> <span data-start="537.44" data-end="538.76">basically what the concept of</span> <span data-start="538.76" data-end="541.01">microaggressions is so what</span> <span data-start="541.01" data-end="543.2">microaggression is something where</span> <span data-start="543.2" data-end="545.15">someone will do something to an</span> <span data-start="545.15" data-end="547.4">underprivileged person that just kind of</span> <span data-start="547.4" data-end="549.11">adds up to a little bit I think a</span> <span data-start="549.11" data-end="551.12">classic example of this is whenever we</span> <span data-start="551.12" data-end="553.07">use the word guys to refer to all</span> <span data-start="553.07" data-end="556.64">developers like viewed in a vacuum this</span> <span data-start="556.64" data-end="559.64">is not that big of a deal yeah you know</span> <span data-start="559.64" data-end="560.81">there's definitely much worse things</span> <span data-start="560.81" data-end="563">that a lot of people have to face you</span> <span data-start="563" data-end="564.86">know such as like wage disparity and</span> <span data-start="564.86" data-end="566.99">discrimination things like that so in</span> <span data-start="566.99" data-end="568.34">the grand scheme of things saying guys</span> <span data-start="568.34" data-end="570.05">isn't that big of a deal when viewed in</span> <span data-start="570.05" data-end="570.53">a vacuum</span> <span data-start="570.53" data-end="573.17">but the thing is it doesn't exist in a</span> <span data-start="573.17" data-end="573.62">vacuum</span> <span data-start="573.62" data-end="576.47">it exists in this broader context you</span> <span data-start="576.47" data-end="578.06">know it is one of those you know little</span> <span data-start="578.06" data-end="580.52">bugs that adds up to a really bad</span> <span data-start="580.52" data-end="582.08">application you know it's death by a</span> <span data-start="582.08" data-end="584.33">thousand paper cuts and so you know I</span> <span data-start="584.33" data-end="585.32">think it's really important that we</span> <span data-start="585.32" data-end="587.75">remember that you know these little</span> <span data-start="587.75" data-end="589.64">things do matter even if they don't seem</span> <span data-start="589.64" data-end="591.5">like a big deal because in aggregate</span> <span data-start="591.5" data-end="594.62">it's just a further reminder that you</span> <span data-start="594.62" data-end="596.33">know underprivileged people are in fact</span> <span data-start="596.33" data-end="601.01">underprivileged so another thing that we</span> <span data-start="601.01" data-end="603.83">tend to see a lot especially you know if</span> <span data-start="603.83" data-end="605.18">you've done a lot of open source work</span> <span data-start="605.18" data-end="607.07">you'll see this is that users rarely</span> <span data-start="607.07" data-end="608.96">report bugs it was something I'm</span> <span data-start="608.96" data-end="610.82">actually guilty of myself I was even</span> <span data-start="610.82" data-end="612.46">chatting with Anna last night about this</span> <span data-start="612.46" data-end="615.05">you know we encounter a bug we get kind</span> <span data-start="615.05" data-end="616.52">of frustrated by it but we just move</span> <span data-start="616.52" data-end="619.4">along you know we could take the time</span> <span data-start="619.4" data-end="621.32">out of our day to open an issue on</span> <span data-start="621.32" data-end="623.6">github or file an issue with the support</span> <span data-start="623.6" data-end="626.06">team but we usually don't and because</span> <span data-start="626.06" data-end="627.77">our time is valuable and so we're always</span> <span data-start="627.77" data-end="629.48">doing these little judgment calls in our</span> <span data-start="629.48" data-end="632.99">head of should I invest my time to see</span> <span data-start="632.99" data-end="635.09">that someone else fixes the problem by</span> <span data-start="635.09" data-end="637.25">reporting this issue or bug and the</span> <span data-start="637.25" data-end="639.47">answer is almost always now sometimes</span> <span data-start="639.47" data-end="641.45">it's yes but it's almost always no so</span> <span data-start="641.45" data-end="643.67">when we look at what is being reported</span> <span data-start="643.67" data-end="645.5">you know we have to remember that this</span> <span data-start="645.5" data-end="647.3">is sort of a represent a small</span> <span data-start="647.3" data-end="649.7">representation of much bigger problems</span> <span data-start="649.7" data-end="652.16">that you know this is a fraction of the</span> <span data-start="652.16" data-end="656.09">actual bugs users encounter and we see</span> <span data-start="656.09" data-end="657.71">the same thing when we're talking about</span> <span data-start="657.71" data-end="661.16">culture issues as well and so is the way</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="661.16" data-end="663.59">I tend to say it is like when we see an</span> <span data-start="663.59" data-end="665.3">underprivileged person who is calling</span> <span data-start="665.3" data-end="668.24">out bad behavior this is never</span> <span data-start="668.24" data-end="670.55">the first offense it's the first Hill</span> <span data-start="670.55" data-end="673.88">worth dying on so well when I say that</span> <span data-start="673.88" data-end="677.149">I'm basically saying that someone goes</span> <span data-start="677.149" data-end="678.68">public writes a blog post let's say</span> <span data-start="678.68" data-end="680.63">condemning a company for certain bad</span> <span data-start="680.63" data-end="682.7">behavior there's oftentimes this</span> <span data-start="682.7" data-end="685.04">instinctual reaction that you know</span> <span data-start="685.04" data-end="686.39">people working on the company tend to</span> <span data-start="686.39" data-end="689.36">have and that's to dismiss it we say</span> <span data-start="689.36" data-end="690.89">like okay well that person had a problem</span> <span data-start="690.89" data-end="692.75">but well it's because of yada yada</span> <span data-start="692.75" data-end="694.7">whatever reasons that come up and most</span> <span data-start="694.7" data-end="696.26">important let's say and no one else</span> <span data-start="696.26" data-end="698.6">complained you know we say like well</span> <span data-start="698.6" data-end="700.64">okay so you know this career person was</span> <span data-start="700.64" data-end="703.97">complaining about homophobia and company</span> <span data-start="703.97" data-end="705.5">but yo there's all these other creepy</span> <span data-start="705.5" data-end="706.82">people and they didn't say anything</span> <span data-start="706.82" data-end="708.77">therefore it should be fine but that's</span> <span data-start="708.77" data-end="711.56">not how it actually works what was going</span> <span data-start="711.56" data-end="712.91">on with those individuals with those</span> <span data-start="712.91" data-end="715.43">other queer folks is that you know we</span> <span data-start="715.43" data-end="717.26">were doing that analysis in our head and</span> <span data-start="717.26" data-end="719.51">being like is it worth it to call this</span> <span data-start="719.51" data-end="722.06">out is it worth the lost time in</span> <span data-start="722.06" data-end="724.52">productivity perhaps even you know loss</span> <span data-start="724.52" data-end="726.5">of respect loss of job even in some</span> <span data-start="726.5" data-end="728.51">cases that go along with it and a lot of</span> <span data-start="728.51" data-end="730.64">times the answer is actually no like you</span> <span data-start="730.64" data-end="732.44">know I certainly see stuff on a pretty</span> <span data-start="732.44" data-end="736.49">regular basis that you know it makes me</span> <span data-start="736.49" data-end="737.839">uncomfortable it makes me feel isolated</span> <span data-start="737.839" data-end="740.3">and singled out as a queer person in a</span> <span data-start="740.3" data-end="742.91">mostly straight world but I ignore it I</span> <span data-start="742.91" data-end="745.16">don't call it out I just kind of go on</span> <span data-start="745.16" data-end="747.38">my way because you know I'll analyze the</span> <span data-start="747.38" data-end="749.98">situation and realize it's not worth it</span> <span data-start="749.98" data-end="751.97">and so it's important to realize that</span> <span data-start="751.97" data-end="753.38">when we see someone who is calling</span> <span data-start="753.38" data-end="755.63">something out it's not just that this is</span> <span data-start="755.63" data-end="757.49">a thing that happened it's that a thing</span> <span data-start="757.49" data-end="759.529">that happened that was bad enough that</span> <span data-start="759.529" data-end="761.18">it crossed this threshold where it</span> <span data-start="761.18" data-end="763.79">became worth it to call it out so</span> <span data-start="763.79" data-end="764.99">there's a numbers game there's an</span> <span data-start="764.99" data-end="768.86">aggregate game going on here so that's</span> <span data-start="768.86" data-end="770.48">kind of a couple of the core concepts</span> <span data-start="770.48" data-end="772.579">that go into you like why we have a lot</span> <span data-start="772.579" data-end="774.649">of the disparities that we have in tech</span> <span data-start="774.649" data-end="778.1">and in societies and as a whole but what</span> <span data-start="778.1" data-end="780.86">do we do about it there's a lot of</span> <span data-start="780.86" data-end="782.48">different things we can do and so I'm</span> <span data-start="782.48" data-end="783.89">gonna focus on a very specific aspect</span> <span data-start="783.89" data-end="785.329">and this is what we can do as</span> <span data-start="785.329" data-end="787.97">individuals there's entire conversations</span> <span data-start="787.97" data-end="790.16">we had about what large organizations</span> <span data-start="790.16" data-end="791.81">and companies can do but that's a</span> <span data-start="791.81" data-end="794.149">different talk and the big thing we can</span> <span data-start="794.149" data-end="798.05">do is to develop empathy and so empathy</span> <span data-start="798.05" data-end="800.66">is a word that gets thrown around a lot</span> <span data-start="800.66" data-end="802.07">and it can mean a lot of</span> <span data-start="802.07" data-end="803.51">different things depending on context</span> <span data-start="803.51" data-end="806.9">but in short empathy is whenever we can</span> <span data-start="806.9" data-end="809.42">emotionally relate to another person you</span> <span data-start="809.42" data-end="811.49">know we are technically it is we are</span> <span data-start="811.49" data-end="813.34">feeling what another person is feeling</span> <span data-start="813.34" data-end="816.04">and it's having that shared experience</span> <span data-start="816.04" data-end="818.42">now in practice you know no one will</span> <span data-start="818.42" data-end="820.58">ever feel exactly what another person is</span> <span data-start="820.58" data-end="821.66">feeling but you know we'd get a rough</span> <span data-start="821.66" data-end="824.42">idea it's about you know kind of bonding</span> <span data-start="824.42" data-end="826.04">together and creating a shared</span> <span data-start="826.04" data-end="828.05">experience even though we are different</span> <span data-start="828.05" data-end="829.97">we exist in different contexts within</span> <span data-start="829.97" data-end="833.87">the world and so a way that I like to</span> <span data-start="833.87" data-end="836.03">think about it is that we have you know</span> <span data-start="836.03" data-end="838.37">the privileges that we have and every</span> <span data-start="838.37" data-end="841.07">single person has some privilege in some</span> <span data-start="841.07" data-end="843.17">form or fashion every single person in</span> <span data-start="843.17" data-end="845.69">this room does have privilege and once</span> <span data-start="845.69" data-end="847.13">again like I said earlier this is not a</span> <span data-start="847.13" data-end="849.32">value judgment on you as an individual</span> <span data-start="849.32" data-end="851.48">like having privilege in and of itself</span> <span data-start="851.48" data-end="853.52">is not a bad thing it's just a state of</span> <span data-start="853.52" data-end="856.07">being what matters is what we do with</span> <span data-start="856.07" data-end="858.68">that and how we act on that that's what</span> <span data-start="858.68" data-end="860.9">really matters</span> <span data-start="860.9" data-end="863.03">but so everyone has privilege and it</span> <span data-start="863.03" data-end="865.37">forms this way that we view the world it</span> <span data-start="865.37" data-end="867.83">colors every interaction we have in</span> <span data-start="867.83" data-end="869.84">everything we see and so I like to think</span> <span data-start="869.84" data-end="871.46">of it it's like a lens it's like looking</span> <span data-start="871.46" data-end="873.53">through a pair of binoculars you know we</span> <span data-start="873.53" data-end="876.11">can see one little thing really really</span> <span data-start="876.11" data-end="878.6">well but we can't see everything that</span> <span data-start="878.6" data-end="880.7">exists beside it you know we're missing</span> <span data-start="880.7" data-end="883.58">most of the world but we have a lot of</span> <span data-start="883.58" data-end="885.89">insight into this one small part that we</span> <span data-start="885.89" data-end="889.34">can see and everyone's lens is different</span> <span data-start="889.34" data-end="890.69">just like everyone's privilege is</span> <span data-start="890.69" data-end="892.46">different so the way everyone sees the</span> <span data-start="892.46" data-end="893.51">world is different we are seeing</span> <span data-start="893.51" data-end="896.72">different things and there actually can</span> <span data-start="896.72" data-end="899.05">be I think a lot of power in that</span> <span data-start="899.05" data-end="901.31">because if we can really develop our</span> <span data-start="901.31" data-end="903.56">empathy then we this is how we create</span> <span data-start="903.56" data-end="905.51">this lens to someone else like the lens</span> <span data-start="905.51" data-end="907.49">we have is to the lens we have there's</span> <span data-start="907.49" data-end="909.32">nothing we can really do to change that</span> <span data-start="909.32" data-end="912.02">innately but we can talk to someone else</span> <span data-start="912.02" data-end="913.67">who has a different lens we can form a</span> <span data-start="913.67" data-end="915.05">relationship with them we can create a</span> <span data-start="915.05" data-end="917.33">bond with them so that we can together</span> <span data-start="917.33" data-end="920.15">hopefully create a fuller picture of</span> <span data-start="920.15"

data-end="928.22">about empathy some people do think all</span> <span data-start="928.22" data-end="930.05">right it's often expressed at least that</span> <span data-start="930.05" data-end="932.15">empathy is just a natural trait we have</span> <span data-start="932.15" data-end="934.91">either you have it or you don't there</span> <span data-start="934.91" data-end="935.93">can be some true</span> <span data-start="935.93" data-end="937.7">to that but empathy is also a skill that</span> <span data-start="937.7" data-end="940.43">can be nurtured it's a skill that can be</span> <span data-start="940.43" data-end="942.38">developed and grown and I think I'm</span> <span data-start="942.38" data-end="943.99">actually a pretty good example of this</span> <span data-start="943.99" data-end="946.19">in the past when I was a lot younger I</span> <span data-start="946.19" data-end="948.11">really was did not have very much</span> <span

<p><span data-start="987.41" data-end="988.82">I said we all have a different lens we</span> <span data-start="988.82" data-end="990.709">and we exist in these different context</span> <span data-start="990.709" data-end="993.11">so whenever someone else is saying that</span> <span data-start="993.11" data-end="995.12">you know there's a problem you know at</span> <span data-start="995.12" data-end="996.17">our company we have a culture problem</span> <span data-start="996.17" data-end="997.91">this company on our team and it's</span> <span data-start="997.91" data-end="1000.91">project our first reaction shouldn't be</span> <span data-start="1000.91" data-end="1003.43">to say like oh that's not a problem I'm</span> <span data-start="1003.43" data-end="1004.63">not experiencing that I mean</span> <span data-start="1004.63" data-end="1006.22">unfortunately this is what we often do</span> <span data-start="1006.22" data-end="1008.32">though this is how our brains work this</span> <span data-start="1008.32" data-end="1009.76">is how human beings are just kind of</span> <span data-start="1009.76" data-end="1011.98">wired we always Center ourselves and</span> <span data-start="1011.98" data-end="1014.32">everything we do because we are the only</span> <span data-start="1014.32" data-end="1016.15">person where we have a complete</span> <span data-start="1016.15" data-end="1017.91">understanding of our own experiences so</span> <span data-start="1017.91" data-end="1021.22">our first reaction typically is to say</span> <span data-start="1021.22" data-end="1023.26">well I don't have that problem therefore</span> <span data-start="1023.26" data-end="1026.11">it's not a problem but that's not how it</span> <span data-start="1026.11" data-end="1027.339">works because we exist in these</span> <span data-start="1027.339" data-end="1029.079">different contexts and sometimes we</span> <span data-start="1029.079" data-end="1030.4">encounter these societal bugs and</span> <span data-start="1030.4" data-end="1031.3">sometimes we don't</span> <span data-start="1031.3" data-end="1034.209">based on that context so what we should</span> <span data-start="1034.209" data-end="1036.699">do instead is to start by recognizing</span> <span data-start="1036.699" data-end="1039.069">that this person exists in a different</span> <span data-start="1039.069" data-end="1041.47">context I may not be experiencing that</span> <span data-start="1041.47" data-end="1044.679">issue myself but they are and so that</span> <span data-start="1044.679" data-end="1046.51">issue does exist you know just like</span> <span data-start="1046.51" data-end="1048.4">whenever a user reports a bug our first</span> <span data-start="1048.4" data-end="1050.679">reaction should be to believe the user</span> <span data-start="1050.679" data-end="1052.99">that the bug exists you know and then we</span> <span data-start="1052.99" data-end="1054.309">could do some investigation and figure</span> <span data-start="1054.309" data-end="1057.19">out how together we can actually try to</span> <span data-start="1057.19" data-end="1058.41">make things better</span> <span data-start="1058.41" data-end="1060.94">so yeah just try to really work on that</span> <span data-start="1060.94" data-end="1063.85">innate reaction to say oh that's not a</span> <span data-start="1063.85" data-end="1065.26">problem because I'm not experiencing it</span> <span data-start="1065.26" data-end="1067.72">and replace that instead with oh that's</span> <span data-start="1067.72" data-end="1069.07">interesting and it's like oh I see</span> <span data-start="1069.07"

that because I don't</span> <span data-start="1073.24" data-end="1074.38">experience that and I don't quite</span> <span data-start="1074.38" data-end="1076.99">understand what's going on so listen and</span> <span data-start="1076.99" data-end="1081.669">believe first the next bit of advice I</span> <span data-start="1081.669" data-end="1083.5">have is to put your ego aside because</span> <span data-start="1083.5" data-end="1085.39">really it's not about you as an</span> <span data-start="1085.39" data-end="1087.85">individual you know these bugs that we</span> <span data-start="1087.85"

on a pull request</span> <span data-start="1153.61" data-end="1156.159">like a really good skill as an engineer</span> <span data-start="1156.159" data-end="1158.2">when we get critical feedback in a

data-end="1175.87">together to improve things and finally</span> <span data-start="1175.87" data-end="1178.36">the last tip I have is to actively work</span> <span data-start="1178.36" data-end="1181.809">to create inclusive teams so the thing</span> <span data-start="1181.809" data-end="1183.159">about creating like inclusive and</span> <span data-start="1183.159" data-end="1185.35">diverse teams is that they don't happen</span> <span data-start="1185.35" data-end="1187.48">on their own they take work like it</span> <span data-start="1187.48" data-end="1189.429">takes work to get different types of</span> <span data-start="1189.429" data-end="1191.23">people together you know we have network</span> <span data-start="1191.23" data-end="1192.94">effects you know we tend to typically</span> <span data-start="1192.94" data-end="1196.299">know people who are mostly like us so if</span> <span data-start="1196.299" data-end="1197.85">we want to bring in people to our team</span> <span data-start="1197.85" data-end="1200.35">that are not like us you know we have to</span> <span data-start="1200.35" data-end="1203.47">work a little harder at it and it's</span> <span data-start="1203.47" data-end="1204.64">just about getting people there it's</span> <span data-start="1204.64" data-end="1207.309">also making sure that people stay as</span> <span data-start="1207.309" data-end="1209.799">well and so you know not only do we have</span> <span data-start="1209.799" data-end="1211.299">to reach out to more people to build</span> <span data-start="1211.299" data-end="1213.28">these better teams we have to work on</span> <span data-start="1213.28" data-end="1214.69">our culture you know just like creating</span> <span data-start="1214.69" data-end="1216.88">a really good culture around a pool</span> <span data-start="1216.88" data-end="1218.62">request takes working and we have to get</span> <span data-start="1218.62" data-end="1220.96">over that defensiveness and instead you</span> <span data-start="1220.96" data-end="1222.01">know work towards you know more of a</span> <span data-start="1222.01" data-end="1223.36">common good we have to do that when</span> <span data-start="1223.36" data-end="1225.33">we're creating inclusive teams as well</span> <span data-start="1225.33" data-end="1228.01">and that's also another topic where that</span> <span data-start="1228.01" data-end="1229.75">would take me a couple of talks to</span> <span data-start="1229.75" data-end="1232.03">really go through but just you know I'll</span> <span data-start="1232.03" data-end="1233.35">say it takes work there's a lot of</span> <span data-start="1233.35" data-end="1234.61">resources out there as well where you</span> <span data-start="1234.61" data-end="1237.429">can figure out how to do that and we</span> <span data-start="1237.429" data-end="1239.08">really want to do this because we are so</span> <span data-start="1239.08" data-end="1241.5">much stronger together than we are apart</span> <span data-start="1241.5" data-end="1243.88">there's been a lot of studies that have</span> <span data-start="1243.88" data-end="1245.65">come out that have shown that when you</span> <span data-start="1245.65" data-end="1247.99">control for other variables more diverse</span> <span data-start="1247.99" data-end="1250.39">teams will always outperform less</span> <span data-start="1250.39" data-end="1252.34">diverse teams like there's a very very</span> <span data-start="1252.34"

data-end="1257.74">and diverse teams you know we're not</span> <span data-start="1257.74" data-end="1259.659">just doing this for the sake of a metric</span> <span data-start="1259.659" data-end="1261.7">or the sake of some statistics we want</span> <span data-start="1261.7" data-end="1263.049">to do this because it makes things</span> <span data-start="1263.049"
