<p><span data-start="135.8" data-end="137.63">JavaScript in JavaScript nowadays we</span> <span data-start="137.63" data-end="140.959">have three ways to do conditionals if</span> <span data-start="140.959" data-end="143.39">you're if knows the statement switch</span> <span data-start="143.39" data-end="145.87">statement in ternary eternal expression</span> <span data-start="145.87" data-end="148.18">to help you to get the picture an</span> <span data-start="148.18" data-end="150.17">expression is something that they value</span> <span data-start="150.17" data-end="153.14">a it's dot Val value and a statement is</span> <span data-start="153.14" data-end="155.959">just something that does something I</span> <span data-start="155.959" data-end="158.51">will show quickly how each one of these</span> <span data-start="158.51" data-end="162.59">words so an if-else statement requires a</span> <span data-start="162.59" data-end="164.569">condition which is thrown by this</span> <span data-start="164.569" data-end="170.12">parenthesis and which can evaluate to</span> <span data-start="170.12" data-end="172.58">true fee or false value if the condition</span> <span data-start="172.58" data-end="176.17">is true it is equids the first block</span> <span data-start="176.17" data-end="179.63">which is the curly brackets there and if</span> <span data-start="179.63" data-end="184.31">not if it's false goes to the to the</span> <span data-start="184.31" data-end="189.5">else block if there is one okay just to</span> <span data-start="189.5" data-end="193.51">help you to get Peter I I create this</span> <span data-start="193.51" data-end="196.22">snippet which is just a function that</span> <span data-start="196.22" data-end="201.68">outputs a moyes that mostly reflects the</span> <span data-start="201.68" data-end="207.68">the the the the temperature this is so I</span> <span data-start="207.68" data-end="210.85">forgot to firstly it is to Freud sorry</span> <span data-start="210.85" data-end="215">okay so as you can see here like you</span> <span data-start="215" data-end="217.43">have a an ephah statement and then if</span> <span data-start="217.43" data-end="219.26">this is true it returns like all the</span> <span data-start="219.26" data-end="222.23">fire otherwise it falls to the LC</span> <span data-start="222.23" data-end="224.93">statement which is another heavy</span> <span data-start="224.93" data-end="228.41">statement so with this you can Cheney if</span> <span data-start="228.41" data-end="230.93">an Elsa statement and this can go wild</span> <span data-start="230.93" data-end="232.97">like I'm not even talk about that nasty</span> <span data-start="232.97" data-end="239.93">if so if if I have like oh and this kind</span> <span data-start="239.93" data-end="242.48">of sequential checks with just a small</span> <span data-start="242.48" data-end="245.42">code to react to this I think switch</span> <span data-start="245.42" data-end="246.44">statement could fit</span> <span data-start="246.44" data-end="248.57">better so let's check how a switch</span> <span data-start="248.57" data-end="253.13">statement works so as I told you that if</span> <span data-start="253.13" data-end="254.6">statements very handy when you want to</span> <span data-start="254.6" data-end="258.62">just react to a cup of choice and you</span> <span data-start="258.62" data-end="261.68">know or we have a big chunk of code to</span> <span data-start="261.68" data-end="264.38">run but when I will have like a</span> <span data-start="264.38" data-end="266.93">multiple-choice with just a small code</span> <span data-start="266.93" data-end="270.74">to react to this I think maybe a switch</span> <span data-start="270.74" data-end="272.15">statement could be a good choice</span> <span data-start="272.15" data-end="275.36">so how switch statement works so have</span> <span data-start="275.36" data-end="278.9">like under between disbalances an</span> <span data-start="278.9" data-end="282.11">expression and it evaluates this</span> <span data-start="282.11" data-end="284.87">expression try to match with one of</span> <span data-start="284.87" data-end="288.25">these cases statements and owns the</span> <span data-start="288.25" data-end="290.63">expression matched to the expression</span> <span data-start="290.63" data-end="292.52">inside the case statement this is the</span> <span data-start="292.52" data-end="294.05">entry point of the the switch statement</span> <span data-start="294.05" data-end="299.45">so the the the this is a key to enter in</span> <span data-start="299.45" data-end="303.86">this point it get it gets going until</span> <span data-start="303.86" data-end="305.99">the end so that's why we have this break</span> <span data-start="305.99" data-end="308.66">statement to jump out of the the switch</span> <span data-start="308.66" data-end="312.47">statement so going back to our initial</span> <span data-start="312.47" data-end="316.33">example this is the way I just make the</span> <span data-start="316.33" data-end="319.64">we will wrote the the previous example</span> <span data-start="319.64" data-end="321.62">using switch statement as you can see</span> <span data-start="321.62" data-end="324.169">here you oftentimes we just use the</span> <span data-start="324.169" data-end="325.79">constant in the case statement but here</span> <span data-start="325.79" data-end="328.46">see someone to trust us the truth value</span> <span data-start="328.46" data-end="330.82">so I put that constant in the the switch</span> <span data-start="330.82" data-end="333.41">expression and the comparison inside the</span> <span data-start="333.41" data-end="338.96">case expression the third one like is</span> <span data-start="338.96" data-end="342.5">the ternary expression so the ternary</span> <span data-start="342.5" data-end="345.59">operator became popular recently most by</span> <span data-start="345.59" data-end="348.59">the fictional programmers and who tries</span> <span data-start="348.59" data-end="350.39">to write the code which am as much</span> <span data-start="350.39" data-end="353.66">expression as possible it's it basically</span> <span data-start="353.66" data-end="355.64">works as the following give it a</span> <span data-start="355.64" data-end="357.8">condition if it's true it executes that</span> <span data-start="357.8" data-end="360.38">block after the question mark it's false</span> <span data-start="360.38" data-end="362.39">or if it's false</span> <span data-start="362.39" data-end="366.53">after there the column so sister Mary is</span> <span data-start="366.53" data-end="368.96">an expression you can use error function</span> <span data-start="368.96" data-end="371.75">and to make the that previous example</span> <span data-start="371.75" data-end="375.38">more concise and but it is readable I</span> <span data-start="375.38" data-end="378.54">don't know I'm not heated dirt</span> <span data-start="378.54" data-end="380.16">there are people that really like this</span> <span data-start="380.16" data-end="384.48">approach as you can see there are a lot</span> <span data-start="384.48" data-end="387.48">of ways to do conditional in JavaScript</span> <span data-start="387.48" data-end="387.9">today</span> <span data-start="387.9" data-end="390.74">what's the matter of the fourth one</span> <span data-start="390.74" data-end="394.41">could you imagine what could happen if</span> <span data-start="394.41" data-end="396.84">you mix if statement with switch</span> <span data-start="396.84" data-end="399.36">statement plus the power for the power</span> <span data-start="399.36" data-end="406.13">of distracting parameter very matching</span> <span data-start="406.13" data-end="411.84">so transcend it better how I create this</span> <span data-start="411.84" data-end="414.48">for example which I have we have like a</span> <span data-start="414.48" data-end="418.77">list of shapes with size color type and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="418.77" data-end="421.77">I want I want to log all these circles</span> <span data-start="421.77" data-end="426.21">red squares and big ball triangles just</span> <span data-start="426.21" data-end="429.09">to context wise this will be our sample</span> <span data-start="429.09" data-end="434.1">entry and this is how this is one of</span> <span data-start="434.1" data-end="437.28">partition solution for the problem but</span> <span data-start="437.28" data-end="439.62">it's tricky that it becomes tricky</span> <span data-start="439.62" data-end="441.81">because it can easily become hard to</span> <span data-start="441.81" data-end="444.54">reason about because the more checks we</span> <span data-start="444.54" data-end="446.67">have then the bigger is the if statement</span> <span data-start="446.67" data-end="449.91">and this is the way we can achieve this</span> <span data-start="449.91" data-end="454.77">with with pattern matching so because of</span> <span data-start="454.77" data-end="457.44">the time I want to explain the concepts</span> <span data-start="457.44" data-end="459.54">of the pattern matching if you are</span> <span data-start="459.54" data-end="461.52">interested in interest in this we can</span> <span data-start="461.52" data-end="465.63">talk more about this later so this is</span> <span data-start="465.63" data-end="468.45">the first first part part of it which is</span> <span data-start="468.45" data-end="472.11">the case statement it defines the start</span> <span data-start="472.11" data-end="475.8">of the pattern matching statement so it</span> <span data-start="475.8" data-end="479.34">receives just one value as input which</span> <span data-start="479.34" data-end="481.11">is inside this parenthesis which is the</span> <span data-start="481.11" data-end="484.26">case expression so then we have</span> <span data-start="484.26" data-end="488.13">afterwards the wain clause so the</span> <span data-start="488.13" data-end="491.07">windows is divided in two parts the</span> <span data-start="491.07" data-end="493.92">match pattern which is this first pair</span> <span data-start="493.92" data-end="497.7">of curly brackets and the Wayne Clause</span> <span data-start="497.7" data-end="498.15">body</span> <span data-start="498.15" data-end="502.32">so whenever the shape of the parent the</span> <span data-start="502.32" data-end="504.75">the pattern and makes the shape of the</span> <span data-start="504.75" data-end="509.67">expression it gets into this it executes</span> <span data-start="509.67" data-end="512.9">the this body</span> <span data-start="512.9" data-end="516.09">so as you can see to achieve the second</span> <span data-start="516.09" data-end="518.729">condition I just need to create another</span> <span data-start="518.729" data-end="523.28">query let's say not another pattern and</span> <span data-start="523.28" data-end="526.02">so in here you have something different</span> <span data-start="526.02" data-end="528.63">you can check that we have like we are</span> <span data-start="528.63" data-end="531.45">matching the size and then afterwards we</span> <span data-start="531.45" data-end="535.59">have this if statement which not a an if</span> <span data-start="535.59" data-end="538.2">statement it's just it's called magic</span> <span data-start="538.2" data-end="542.15">word so whenever the first part match</span> <span data-start="542.15" data-end="545.28">even though the like if the the match</span> <span data-start="545.28" data-end="547.77">guard returns false we don't execute</span> <span data-start="547.77" data-end="551.25">that that body we just skip the last</span> <span data-start="551.25" data-end="554.4">part is when I will put a variable and</span> <span data-start="554.4" data-end="560.31">stay alone on this match better it's</span> <span data-start="560.31" data-end="563.67">just it just matched everything so it's</span> <span data-start="563.67" data-end="565.68">kind of the default statement for force</span> <span data-start="565.68" data-end="572.28">which case okay now even though man</span> <span data-start="572.28" data-end="574.14">parent may is powerful we should not</span> <span data-start="574.14" data-end="575.7">forget to use the right tool to do the</span> <span data-start="575.7" data-end="579.93">right job remember or whether example</span> <span data-start="579.93" data-end="582.9">using part and a pattern matching we</span> <span data-start="582.9" data-end="585.78">could do like this so keep in mind that</span> <span data-start="585.78" data-end="590.87">not everything they need to use a hammer</span> <span data-start="590.87" data-end="595.17">okay dangerous part this brings me some</span> <span data-start="595.17" data-end="598.62">some wishes like since we have three</span> <span data-start="598.62" data-end="600.42">ways to do conditionals in JavaScript</span> <span data-start="600.42" data-end="605.01">and to our arrays a statement so I would</span> <span data-start="605.01" data-end="606.45">like to see parent matching linking</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="606.45" data-end="609.54">JavaScript as as expression so we could</span> <span data-start="609.54" data-end="613.38">have because now as its proposed its</span> <span data-start="613.38" data-end="616.89">proposed as a statement and I think and</span> <span data-start="616.89" data-end="618.9">having this I know there are there are a</span> <span data-start="618.9" data-end="620.82">lot of chronic case that needs to be</span> <span data-start="620.82" data-end="623.82">covered to make this as as an expression</span> <span data-start="623.82" data-end="625.86">but I would like to wait more to have</span> <span data-start="625.86" data-end="629.82">this and have this as expression but if</span> <span data-start="629.82" data-end="634.23">this lens as a as a statement and if we</span> <span data-start="634.23" data-end="635.91">have a do expression aligned in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="635.91" data-end="637.77">JavaScript we can write prior image we</span> <span data-start="637.77" data-end="640.62">do expression so let's go to the next</span> <span data-start="640.62" data-end="642.03">one</span> <span data-start="642.03" data-end="644.55">before introduce the next proposal let's</span> <span data-start="644.55" data-end="645.92">check</span> <span data-start="645.92" data-end="648.29">what is functional composition in how we</span> <span data-start="648.29" data-end="650.48">can do this even in JavaScript so</span> <span data-start="650.48" data-end="652.51">function composition is a mathematical</span> <span data-start="652.51" data-end="655.94">mathematical concept that allows you to</span> <span data-start="655.94" data-end="658.16">combine two or more functions to create</span> <span data-start="658.16" data-end="661.94">a new function okay so to help you to</span> <span data-start="661.94" data-end="662.81">get the picture</span> <span data-start="662.81" data-end="665.66">let's could cook a bento I came up with</span> <span data-start="665.66" data-end="667.64">this example just because it's I think</span> <span data-start="667.64" data-end="669.89">it's easier to reason about food and</span> <span data-start="669.89" data-end="675.17">because I like to use a mooch so when I</span> <span data-start="675.17" data-end="678.73">was like whenever have a function that</span> <span data-start="678.73" data-end="681.44">you the output of the previous function</span> <span
