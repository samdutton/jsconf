data-end="2039.15">like the microphone the camera and</span> <span data-start="2039.15" data-end="2041.1">streaming media in JavaScript until</span> <span data-start="2041.1" data-end="2043.98">recently and we just we have a chance to</span> <span data-start="2043.98" data-end="2046.98">change the way things work with that so</span> <span data-start="2046.98"

data-end="2071.49">to think about how communications could</span> <span data-start="2071.49" data-end="2073.11">be built into your app instead of asking</span> <span data-start="2073.11" data-end="2074.94">your users to go and open up skype or go</span> <span data-start="2074.94" data-end="2076.44">jump over to Google hangout so we can</span> <span data-start="2076.44"

data-end="2085.32">it is we wanted communications to happen</span> <span data-start="2085.32" data-end="2086.82">in a seamless fashion and we wanted</span> <span data-start="2086.82" data-end="2088.11">multiple ways to do it in very specific</span> <span data-start="2088.11" data-end="2090.3">use cases so we built that tool out</span> <span data-start="2090.3" data-end="2092.04">another thing I played around with as a</span> <span data-start="2092.04" data-end="2093.42">demo is a technical interview</span> <span data-start="2093.42" data-end="2094.86">application I'll give you a white</span> <span data-start="2094.86" data-end="2096.48">boarding and code challenges and screen</span> <span data-start="2096.48"

data-end="2109.53">can start building communications into</span> <span data-start="2109.53" data-end="2111.06">your applications as features rather</span> <span data-start="2111.06" data-end="2113">than creating separate products for</span> <span data-start="2113" data-end="2115.38">that's it for me again my name is Kyle</span> <span data-start="2115.38" data-end="2117.75">tyack
