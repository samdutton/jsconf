data-end="1795.94">working so you should start in that end</span> <span data-start="1795.94" data-end="1798.61">that's my opinion at least so start by</span> <span data-start="1798.61" data-end="1800.52">making sure your site works by using</span> <span data-start="1800.52" data-end="1803.92">selenium and cucumber capybara any of</span> <span data-start="1803.92"

data-end="1811.809">things that the user can do in our</span> <span data-start="1811.809" data-end="1814.3">application so we don't have to do that</span> <span data-start="1814.3"

data-start="1837.63" data-end="1843.55">maybe they often look like so this</span> <span data-start="1843.55" data-end="1847.09">is is creating the test you have written</span> <span

data-start="1851.559" data-end="1854.77">it to look this is working so just</span> <span data-start="1854.77" data-end="1857.92">imagine that we've created some simple</span> <span

data-end="1871.12">to look because you can't let the</span> <span data-start="1871.12" data-end="1874.33">computer decide if the looks is correct</span> <span data-start="1874.33"

have to start</span> <span data-start="1899.04" data-end="1900.87">checking other browsers and see if the</span> <span data-start="1900.87" data-end="1904.38">rest of our app works well that's not</span> <span data-start="1904.38" data-end="1906.3">that hard because we already have tools</span> <span data-start="1906.3" data-end="1909.57">that do that given that would capture</span> <span

data-start="1929.64" data-end="1931.68">kind of list saying that in these four</span> <span data-start="1931.68" data-end="1934.41">you have deviations that look very</span> <span data-start="1934.41" data-end="1936.6">different from what you already what you</span> <span data-start="1936.6" data-end="1939.81">already have and we could show them and</span> <span data-start="1939.81" data-end="1942.72">guide the user to see where where are</span> <span data-start="1942.72" data-end="1948.63">the faults and since since we since we</span> <span data-start="1948.63" data-end="1951.39">based the tests on I'm jumping back now</span> <span data-start="1951.39" data-end="1954.6">but to on these things and these are</span> <span data-start="1954.6" data-end="1956.58">saved all the scenarios in our</span> <span data-start="1956.58" data-end="1958.73">applications are stored in our code base</span> <span data-start="1958.73" data-end="1961.86">when we run this thing we will also know</span> <span data-start="1961.86" data-end="1963.96">if all the other things that we had</span> <span data-start="1963.96" data-end="1966.21">before are still working the way they</span> <span data-start="1966.21" data-end="1969.87">used to before we wrote our new code so</span> <span data-start="1969.87" data-end="1971.31">now we just have to go through this in</span> <span data-start="1971.31" data-end="1973.05">kind of the same way that you would do</span> <span data-start="1973.05" data-end="1975.51">with image diffs to mark the diffs and</span> <span data-start="1975.51" data-end="1977.76">say that this change is intended and</span> <span data-start="1977.76" data-end="1981.12">this change is not intended and maybe</span> <span data-start="1981.12" data-end="1983.61">certain TV ange deviations that are not</span> <span data-start="1983.61" data-end="1986.79">intended changes but our rendering</span> <span data-start="1986.79" data-end="1989.52">differences and so on you can you can</span> <span data-start="1989.52" data-end="1991.86">mark them as okay as well if you think</span> <span data-start="1991.86" data-end="1994.05">that it's okay that it looks this way in</span> <span data-start="1994.05" data-end="1997.41">this browser and when you've resolved</span> <span data-start="1997.41" data-end="1999.75">everything it all passes everything is</span> <span data-start="1999.75" data-end="2002.12">green and the test tool now tells you</span> <span data-start="2002.12" data-end="2005.18">that everything works so now you can go</span> <span data-start="2005.18" data-end="2007.01">to the third step and you can start</span> <span data-start="2007.01" data-end="2010.61">moving CSS around you can start deleting</span> <span data-start="2010.61" data-end="2013.67">attributes that you think are are dead</span> <span data-start="2013.67" data-end="2016.79">and so on and you can see does this test</span> <span data-start="2016.79" data-end="2019.13">still pass does it produce the same</span> <span data-start="2019.13" data-end="2022.21">thing</span> <span data-start="2022.22" data-end="2028.08">so to kind of get the gist of this the</span> <span data-start="2028.08" data-end="2030.39">idea is that the sign is manual</span> <span data-start="2030.39" data-end="2032.55">you can't automate the sign you have to</span> <span data-start="2032.55" data-end="2036.24">you have to create some layout and the</span> <span data-start="2036.24" data-end="2039.02">definition of correct that's also manual</span> <span data-start="2039.02" data-end="2042.12">it's in the same way that you're writing</span> <span data-start="2042.12" data-end="2044.49">your tests in in JavaScript for</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2044.49" data-end="2047.52">JavaScript is manual then defining what</span> <span data-start="2047.52" data-end="2049.89">is the right look that's also manual you</span> <span data-start="2049.89" data-end="2052.02">have to do that yourself that's your job</span> <span data-start="2052.02" data-end="2055.86">but testing changes that's automatic and</span> <span data-start="2055.86" data-end="2057.96">can be done using various different</span> <span data-start="2057.96" data-end="2060.87">technologies that we have further down</span> <span data-start="2060.87" data-end="2065.7">the stack so it's about design first and</span> <span data-start="2065.7" data-end="2069.87">design as tests not tests as some</span> <span data-start="2069.87" data-end="2075.14">separate entity and if we look at the</span> <span data-start="2075.14" data-end="2078.99">the ups and downs for for this thing</span> <span data-start="2078.99" data-end="2080.97">what's what's the pros and what's the</span> <span data-start="2080.97" data-end="2083.19">cons well we're jacking into the</span> <span data-start="2083.19" data-end="2084.93">acceptance tests that are already there</span> <span data-start="2084.93" data-end="2087.95">and that's useful because it means that</span> <span data-start="2087.95" data-end="2090.21">there are a ton of things that we don't</span> <span data-start="2090.21" data-end="2092.88">have to set up we assume that acceptance</span> <span data-start="2092.88" data-end="2094.98">tests are there so we can somehow deploy</span> <span data-start="2094.98" data-end="2097.47">to a staging site we have a staging</span> <span data-start="2097.47" data-end="2099.24">environment that we can up</span> <span data-start="2099.24" data-end="2102">completely if we want to and we have</span> <span data-start="2102" data-end="2103.77">already described all the possible</span> <span data-start="2103.77" data-end="2105.72">scenarios that the user will go through</span> <span data-start="2105.72" data-end="2107.88">and like I said if you don't have that</span> <span data-start="2107.88" data-end="2109.77">already then then you have bigger</span> <span data-start="2109.77" data-end="2113.7">problems obviously so this also gives us</span> <span data-start="2113.7" data-end="2115.29">this thing that we don't need a record</span> <span data-start="2115.29" data-end="2117.54">step we already know what kind of steps</span> <span data-start="2117.54" data-end="2119.25">we want to go through that we want to</span> <span data-start="2119.25" data-end="2121.86">test and there's no convoluted the</span> <span data-start="2121.86" data-end="2124.83">science back saying in encode what the</span> <span data-start="2124.83" data-end="2126.84">design should be like but you have</span> <span data-start="2126.84" data-end="2129.36">looked at the design at a design and</span> <span data-start="2129.36" data-end="2132.54">stated that this was what I wanted this</span> <span data-start="2132.54" data-end="2135.78">is the way it's supposed to look now</span> <span data-start="2135.78" data-end="2137.9">there there's one big con to this and</span> <span data-start="2137.9" data-end="2142.68">it's that it's make-believe so this is</span> <span data-start="2142.68" data-end="2144.96">the actual mythic part of the</span> <span data-start="2144.96" data-end="2147.66">presentation to be honest it's not</span> <span data-start="2147.66" data-end="2150.63">entirely make-believe because I've been</span> <span data-start="2150.63" data-end="2152.13">working on something like this with a</span> <span data-start="2152.13" data-end="2153.829">couple of my colleagues</span> <span data-start="2153.829" data-end="2157.97">but it split into pieces across a number</span> <span data-start="2157.97" data-end="2162.23">of of proprietary code bases so it's</span> <span data-start="2162.23" data-end="2164.78">kind of hard to extract it we started</span> <span data-start="2164.78" data-end="2166.79">working on this because we want to make</span> <span data-start="2166.79" data-end="2170.589">a tool out of this that people can use</span> <span data-start="2170.589" data-end="2175.25">but I ended up getting a new job that</span> <span data-start="2175.25" data-end="2177.079">takes a lot of energy and I haven't had</span> <span data-start="2177.079" data-end="2180.74">time to finish this thing so if we look</span> <span data-start="2180.74" data-end="2183.619">back at at my initial idea like the the</span> <span data-start="2183.619" data-end="2186.41">purpose of the presentation I wanted to</span> <span data-start="2186.41" data-end="2189.68">to raise some awareness and I hope I've</span> <span data-start="2189.68" data-end="2191.589">done that you've seen a couple of tools</span> <span data-start="2191.589" data-end="2195.74">and you can you can also look for like</span> <span data-start="2195.74" data-end="2197.93">their their competition if you want to</span> <span data-start="2197.93" data-end="2200.21">see others but these are the types of</span> <span

data-end="2208.13">inspire you to this new workflow a new</span> <span data-start="2208.13" data-end="2210.98">way of thinking about design and testing</span> <span data-start="2210.98" data-end="2214.46">that a design is correct but there's a</span> <span data-start="2214.46" data-end="2218.18">third thing and it's the fact that I I</span> <span data-start="2218.18" data-end="2221.93">feel like all these tools are hard to</span> <span data-start="2221.93" data-end="2224.51">get started with testing is hard to</span> <span data-start="2224.51" data-end="2226.49">begin with and this type of testing is</span> <span data-start="2226.49" data-end="2229.97">even harder but I still feel like we</span> <span data-start="2229.97" data-end="2233.18">have to get further we have to create</span> <span data-start="2233.18" data-end="2235.16">something more and make this more</span> <span data-start="2235.16" data-end="2238.549">accessible easier to use for everyone to</span> <span data-start="2238.549" data-end="2241.73">get started with it so what I would be</span> <span data-start="2241.73" data-end="2244.579">really happy for would be for you to</span> <span data-start="2244.579" data-end="2248.63">kind of join into the discussion I'm</span> <span data-start="2248.63"

data-end="2370.95">just wondering how you'd work this into</span> <span data-start="2370.95" data-end="2372.72">kind of in the iterative design</span> <span data-start="2372.72" data-end="2375.119">environment I did you wait till the</span> <span data-start="2375.119" data-end="2377.16">design is finished and then build all</span> <span data-start="2377.16" data-end="2378.869">the tests are you kind of doing them in</span> <span data-start="2378.869" data-end="2380.7">parallel with your design as it's</span> <span data-start="2380.7" data-end="2384.12">changing</span> <span data-start="2384.13" data-end="2387.67">when you say designer do you mean a</span> <span data-start="2387.67" data-end="2392.319">person who is just making like Photoshop</span> <span data-start="2392.319" data-end="2394.76">mock-ups or someone who's actually</span> <span data-start="2394.76" data-end="2397.52">writing CSS as well to me the only valid</span> <span data-start="2397.52" data-end="2399.7">web designer is one who can code as well</span> <span data-start="2399.7" data-end="2402.64">someone who is a coding designer yeah</span> <span data-start="2402.64" data-end="2405.23">yeah and that's the best kind obviously</span> <span data-start="2405.23" data-end="2408.31">that's that's the one I would work with</span> <span data-start="2408.31" data-end="2412.4">so so the question was how to work it</span> <span data-start="2412.4" data-end="2415.579">wrestle with that kind of person like</span> <span data-start="2415.579" data-end="2417.44">between developer and designer yeah I</span> <span data-start="2417.44" data-end="2418.88">guess the thing is trying to reduce the</span> <span data-start="2418.88" data-end="2429.47">other hit of yeah and ideally this would</span> <span data-start="2429.47" data-end="2431.45">all be something that a designer could</span> <span data-start="2431.45" data-end="2436.13">use on his or her own like you should</span> <span data-start="2436.13" data-end="2437.93">not have to think about programming when</span> <span data-start="2437.93" data-end="2440">you do this mmm that's why for example</span> <span data-start="2440" data-end="2443.3">you want to get away from the writing of</span> <span data-start="2443.3" data-end="2446">a test specification and so on you want</span> <span data-start="2446" data-end="2447.95">this to just be about looking at</span> <span data-start="2447.95" data-end="2450.41">something and saying yeah this is what I</span> <span data-start="2450.41" data-end="2453.8">want and now it's correct and then a</span> <span data-start="2453.8" data-end="2457.16">designer who's working with CSS they can</span> <span data-start="2457.16" data-end="2459.98">obviously already start fiddling with</span> <span data-start="2459.98" data-end="2462.109">their code and see if things changes and</span> <span data-start="2462.109" data-end="2464.75">run this again you don't as a designer</span> <span data-start="2464.75" data-end="2467.93">you don't have to learn anything new to</span> <span data-start="2467.93" data-end="2471.89">to do this thing you just have to have</span> <span data-start="2471.89" data-end="2473.599">to run this tune whenever you feel like</span> <span data-start="2473.599" data-end="2476.27">you you're finished is it not working</span> <span data-start="2476.27" data-end="2477.47">everywhere and so on</span> <span data-start="2477.47" data-end="2479.78">so I I definitely think it would be</span> <span data-start="2479.78" data-end="2486.17">perfect for working iteratively yeah</span> <span data-start="2486.17" data-end="2492.29">well and I mean after it depends what</span> <span data-start="2492.29" data-end="2495.5">you mean with after I I would say that</span> <span data-start="2495.5" data-end="2497.39">creating the design is a small part of</span> <span data-start="2497.39" data-end="2499.64">the work and then making it work in all</span> <span data-start="2499.64" data-end="2501.41">places and with the rest of your code</span> <span data-start="2501.41" data-end="2503.599">that's the large work and you do it both</span> <span data-start="2503.599" data-end="2506.51">you do it between those steps and after</span> <span data-start="2506.51" data-end="2508.55">the last one as well for refactoring and</span> <span data-start="2508.55" data-end="2511.46">so on so it should be something that you</span> <span data-start="2511.46" data-end="2513.77">do continuously as soon as you you feel</span> <span data-start="2513.77" data-end="2515.03">like you've designed something that's</span> <span data-start="2515.03" data-end="2515.43">complete</span> <span data-start="2515.43" data-end="2517.559">but you're not sure if it works</span> <span data-start="2517.559" data-end="2519.51">everywhere else and with the rest of</span> <span data-start="2519.51" data-end="2520.079">your code</span> </p>
