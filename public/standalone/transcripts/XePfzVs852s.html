<p><span data-start="11.7" data-end="14.849"Audience member: So you might have seen the talk from Kat just before.</span> <span data-start="14.849" data-end="19.21">It's really interesting, and you should keep it in mind while we make this one as there</span> <span data-start="19.21" data-end="21.85">are a few things that might overlap a bit.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="21.85" data-end="24.14">First, who am I?</span> <span data-start="24.14" data-end="25.14">My name is Maël.</span> <span data-start="25.14" data-end="29.64">I used to work at Facebook as part of the JavaScript foundation team.</span> <span data-start="29.64" data-end="37.78">My job there was to en — do the infrastructure, and I came to contribute to Yarn.</span> <span data-start="37.78" data-end="45.05">As time passed, I started to take more and more responsibilities on the project, and</span> <span data-start="45.05" data-end="49.73">here I am today talking about the work we've been doing for the V2 which is in two small</span> <span data-start="49.73" data-end="54.92">part based on my observation after using Yarn at scale for a few years.</span> <span data-start="54.92" data-end="60.06">Something I like to remember when doing this talk is why does Yarn exist in the first place?</span> <span data-start="60.06" data-end="61.579">How did it get created?</span> <span data-start="61.579" data-end="67.29">It all started with three companies — Facebook, Google, and Expo — which felt something was</span> <span data-start="67.29" data-end="69.53">missing in their infrastructure.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="69.53" data-end="75.1">They figured the existing solution didn't meet all their needs in terms of stability,</span> <span data-start="75.1" data-end="79.899">user experience, and so they decided to try something different, to try something new.</span> <span data-start="79.899" data-end="86.329">A different solution with different architectural choices, different trade-offs that would still</span> <span data-start="86.329" data-end="89.67">be compatible with the ecosystem at large.</span> <span data-start="89.67" data-end="93.579">That was a huge bet but we succeeded, and that is how Yarn got created.</span> <span data-start="93.579" data-end="102.249">Since then, we keep this philosophy, think of Yarn as an a laboratory.</span> <span data-start="102.249" data-end="107.909">Speaking of feels, before talking about what Yarn 2 will bring to the table in 2019 and</span> <span data-start="107.909" data-end="112.999">beyond, we must first go quickly over what it contributed and more importantly what are</span> <span data-start="112.999" data-end="114.45">the things they did right.</span> <span data-start="114.45" data-end="118.87">It's the important to know because that's how we can ensure that we won't lose what</span> <span data-start="118.87" data-end="123.92">makes our core values when we make the transition from the v1 to the v2.</span> <span data-start="123.92" data-end="125.549">This is an open question, by the way.</span> <span data-start="125.549" data-end="129.51">I would like to hear what you think Yarn did right.</span> <span data-start="129.51" data-end="135.4">Please come and see me after the talk and share the stories.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="135.4" data-end="140.39">Ever since Yarn got created, something we deem very important was stability.</span> <span data-start="140.39" data-end="142.37">We want JavaScript project to be stable.</span> <span data-start="142.37" data-end="146.569">We want you to trust your project, and we are ready to go the extra mile to achieve</span> <span data-start="146.569" data-end="147.569">this goal.</span> <span data-start="147.569" data-end="152.319">This is about teaching good practices and letting you know when something is wrong before</span> <span data-start="152.319" data-end="154.319">it can cause any article.</span> <span data-start="154.319" data-end="158.7">We work to remove unsafe patterns from the equation as much as possible.</span> <span data-start="158.7" data-end="163.81">Our log files ensure that the install dependencies are always the same, our install strategy,</span> <span data-start="163.81" data-end="171.04">plug 'n' play, prevent your application breaking at deploy time, and our offline mirror ensures</span> <span data-start="171.04" data-end="174.569">that the network will never be a problem in deployment.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="174.569" data-end="180.64">Speaking of the network, this is one thing in particular we worked really well for us.</span> <span data-start="180.64" data-end="183.79">At Facebook, we barely even noticed when the registry was down.</span> <span data-start="183.79" data-end="188.09">In fact, we often learned about it through Twitter, really.</span> <span data-start="188.09" data-end="193.24">Despite the offline mirror being one of our less-known features, it might be one of the</span> <span data-start="193.24" data-end="195.29">most important ones in my mind.</span> <span data-start="195.29" data-end="196.689">You should definitely check it out.</span> <span data-start="196.689" data-end="201.519">If you don't, it's fine, because it will soon become unmissable, starting from the v2 where</span> <span data-start="201.519" data-end="204.68">it will be enabled by default.</span> <span data-start="204.68" data-end="208.83">Going back to the things we did right, work spaces are high on the list.</span> <span data-start="208.83" data-end="214.959">If you don't know them pretty well, they allow you to split your applications into sub projects</span> <span data-start="214.959" data-end="220.37">that can live independently from each other while style being able to cross-reference</span> <span data-start="220.37" data-end="221.37">each other.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="221.37" data-end="225.549">Ing see them as a declarative Yarn link.</span> <span data-start="225.549" data-end="230.39">For example, you can see here we've been able to split our huge blob of dependencies into</span> <span data-start="230.39" data-end="234.92">smaller pieces, one for the back end and one for the front-end.</span> <span data-start="234.92" data-end="241.66">Spaces came to the community, but as we noticed how much they improve our own product, we</span> <span data-start="241.66" data-end="244.08">decided to make it a core feature in Yarn.</span> <span data-start="244.08" data-end="245.97">That was a great idea.</span> <span data-start="245.97" data-end="251.239">Given the success they got, we will be double ing down our efforts to make them first-class</span> <span data-start="251.239" data-end="254.54">citizens, as you will soon see.</span> <span data-start="254.54" data-end="260.42">Finally, the last core value that we definitely should mention is the overall user experience.</span> <span data-start="260.42" data-end="266.19">It doesn't seem of, but it's actually a big reason why our users say they use Yarn.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="266.19" data-end="271.44">The small things, like the run key while not being native, or the merge conflicts automatically</span> <span data-start="271.44" data-end="272.94">being resolved.</span> <span data-start="272.94" data-end="277.01">Those things aren't the big shiny things you typically that are on our side, but they are</span> <span data-start="277.01" data-end="281.44">the comments that you use every day, the ones that shape your work flow, and that is something</span> <span data-start="281.44" data-end="284.11">we keep in mind when working on the v2.</span> <span data-start="284.11" data-end="289.57">Okay, so now we have to talk a bit about the elephant in the room: why are we even talking</span> <span data-start="289.57" data-end="293.45">about a new major Yarn release today?</span> <span data-start="293.45" data-end="299.17">About half of you use Yarn in your life with great success, so how would a new major release</span> <span data-start="299.17" data-end="300.33">affect you?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="300.33" data-end="303.71">Do we really have something significant to bring to the table?</span> <span data-start="303.71" data-end="306.16">If so, what?</span> <span data-start="306.16" data-end="308.83">Something to realise is that Yarn got created in 2016.</span> <span data-start="308.83" data-end="311.9">Since then, a lot of things happened.</span> <span data-start="311.9" data-end="314.7">For one, we released a lot of major features.</span> <span data-start="314.7" data-end="322.19">Work spaces in 2017, plug 'n' play in 2018, zip loading is coming in 2019, and we will</span> <span data-start="322.19" data-end="323.71">go to that later.</span> <span data-start="323.71" data-end="329.03">Our architecture needed a refresh to stay up to date with all those new concepts that</span> <span data-start="329.03" data-end="334.51">didn't even exist when Yarn got created, and to support the new work flow they unlock.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="334.51" data-end="338.46">Additionally, Yarn got initially created as an npm clone.</span> <span data-start="338.46" data-end="345">As such, we .. values behaviours that won't mesh well with the user experience we provide</span> <span data-start="345" data-end="348.81">which is something we really care about.</span> <span data-start="348.81" data-end="352.58">For those technical reasons, we needed to build something new, to build a new modern</span> <span data-start="352.58" data-end="356.34">foundation more suited to what we had in mind.</span> <span data-start="356.34" data-end="357.83">That's not the only reason.</span> <span data-start="357.83" data-end="364.21">The main reason in my mind is that we wanted to give you more power.</span> <span data-start="364.21" data-end="367.55">We wanted to make it easier for you to contribute to Yarn.</span> <span data-start="367.55" data-end="373.08">To write your own features, to fix what blocks you, not to have to rely on us.</span> <span data-start="373.08" data-end="375.3">After all, Yarn is a community project.</span> <span data-start="375.3" data-end="379.11">We don't want to work for you, we want to work with you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="379.11" data-end="383.88">So our architecture needed to reflect that, and for this reason, we decided to make it</span> <span data-start="383.88" data-end="387.81">very modular so that you would be able to write your own plugins.</span> <span data-start="387.81" data-end="393.63">In fact, most of the features in Yarn 2 are actually plugins that got aggregated together</span> <span data-start="393.63" data-end="395.24">in a single binary.</span> <span data-start="395.24" data-end="401.49">In the same vein, we moved our codebase to a more familiar stack-typescript, and we hoped</span> <span data-start="401.49" data-end="406.08">that, by doing this, it will decrease the time needed for you to understand the pieces,</span> <span data-start="406.08" data-end="411.34">how they fit together in such a way that you will be able to help us maintain this critical</span> <span data-start="411.34" data-end="421.27">part of your infrastructure, and it's scope to .. enough about the abstract talk, let's</span> <span data-start="421.27" data-end="428.12">delve a bit into what the next major version of Yarn will concretely bringing to the table.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="428.12" data-end="432.11">The first thing you will notice is that we revamped the output.</span> <span data-start="432.11" data-end="436.54">What Yarn prints is how it communicates with you, and we wanted to make it easier for you</span> <span data-start="436.54" data-end="441.63">to figure out what happens and highlight the most important information.</span> <span data-start="441.63" data-end="448">This translates into important way: first, we know print message codes that can be Googled</span> <span data-start="448" data-end="453.1">for more detail on what a specific message means, and, if if the in the case of errors,</span> <span data-start="453.1" data-end="454.97">how to solve them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="454.97" data-end="460.04">Secondly, we are now using colours with a specific purpose to highlight the dynamic</span> <span data-start="460.04" data-end="462.46">parts of our messages.</span> <span data-start="462.46" data-end="466.27">It's one of those very tiny things that I mention that happened to matter a lot when</span> <span data-start="466.27" data-end="468.22">you work with Yarn every day.</span> <span data-start="468.22" data-end="475">By using the colours at the right place, we aim to decrease the — you won't have to fight</span> <span data-start="475" data-end="477.9">to understand it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="477.9" data-end="480.14">The v2 also comes with new comments.</span> <span data-start="480.14" data-end="484.3">You might have heard about Yarn creating the v1 which allowed you to download and run any</span> <span data-start="484.3" data-end="487.78">package prefixed by the word "create".</span> <span data-start="487.78" data-end="492">We decided to expand it and build Yarn DLX.</span> <span data-start="492" data-end="498.86">That very similar to its sibling and PX can install packages from the registry.</span> <span data-start="498.86" data-end="508.17">It allows you to run 1&1-off strips without having to revert your changes after the fact.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="508.17" data-end="510.93">Let's see a quick demonstration of it.</span> <span data-start="510.93" data-end="516.93">So here, we are a JavaScript file which is webpack configuration, and we will want to</span> <span data-start="516.93" data-end="517.93">minify it.</span> <span data-start="517.93" data-end="526">Usually, we would have to add the minimum fire filter into our package at JSON and then</span> <span data-start="526" data-end="533.55">remove it — but by using DLX, you just have to run Yarn DLX and the tame of the file,</span> <span data-start="533.55" data-end="539.25">and Yarn will download everything's that is needed and run it locally.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="539.25" data-end="544.45">But even better, since we are using plug 'n' play, it means that we don't have to create</span> <span data-start="544.45" data-end="553.89">.. more, and DLX at the second invocation will be just as fast as it can be because</span> <span data-start="553.89" data-end="556.83">we don't have to fetch the package again.</span> <span data-start="556.83" data-end="565.75">If I run it again, it will be super fast.</span> <span data-start="565.75" data-end="567.64">So that is for newcomers.</span> <span data-start="567.64" data-end="569.09">We have other ones.</span> <span data-start="569.09" data-end="572.28">We've also improved the existing ones.</span> <span data-start="572.28" data-end="577.27">Various changes were made to make it easier to work with mono repos or fix long-standing</span> <span data-start="577.27" data-end="579.05">issues peeve.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="579.05" data-end="584.92">Yarn hub can upgrade a package across all your at once.</span> <span data-start="584.92" data-end="591.52">Yarn Link is able to properly resolve peer dependencies even when you link an external</span> <span data-start="591.52" data-end="594.21">package into your current product.</span> <span data-start="594.21" data-end="603.33">Yarn Ad accept an interactive flag that be instructs Yarn to ask you for advice in various</span> <span data-start="603.33" data-end="604.33">situations.</span> <span data-start="604.33" data-end="605.83">And it's not only a toy.</span> <span data-start="605.83" data-end="611.71">The interactive mode, for example, allows you to quickly reuse a version of a package</span> <span data-start="611.71" data-end="615.13">that another one of your work spaces is already using.</span> <span data-start="615.13" data-end="621.08">You don't need to grab into your packager JSON any more to find that out.</span> <span data-start="621.08" data-end="626.21">Speaking about — we are introducing constraints.</span> <span data-start="626.21" data-end="632.93">Wouldn't it be nice if you could just check that your project obeys some rules?</span> <span data-start="632.93" data-end="637.65">Like linting, some kind of ES lint, but for package.json.</span> <span data-start="637.65" data-end="638.87">We thought so too.</span> <span data-start="638.87" data-end="647.92">One of our newest conditions are constraints which are basically lints rules and written</span> <span data-start="647.92" data-end="648.92">in prologue.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="648.92" data-end="652.05">Prologue makes them extremely small and powerful.</span> <span data-start="652.05" data-end="661.94">In the example, you can see our work spaces forbids Babel listed as an a regular dependency.</span> <span data-start="661.94" data-end="670.07">In fact, with only two more lines, we could extend this to automatically move the dependency</span> <span data-start="670.07" data-end="674.36">within the dev dependency field.</span> <span data-start="674.36" data-end="677.18">Constraints are very powerful, and they have many usages.</span> <span data-start="677.18" data-end="681.32">You can see some of the screen, and we would provide some recipes in our documentation</span> <span data-start="681.32" data-end="687.19">to get started, but you will quickly see that it is super easy to write new ones that are</span> <span data-start="687.19" data-end="690.07">directly adapted to your use case.</span> <span data-start="690.07" data-end="692.35">We can see them in practice a bit.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="692.35" data-end="697.82">So here, I have project with two work spaces: my front-end and my back-end.</span> <span data-start="697.82" data-end="708.68">Both my front-end and back-end are depending on low dash except both are TypeScript and</span> <span data-start="708.68" data-end="716.13">should depend on — it would be nice if there was a way to detect all of those problems</span> <span data-start="716.13" data-end="719.25">and fix them as best as we can.</span> <span data-start="719.25" data-end="724.81">Yarn as a newcomer, Yarn constraints check, when Yarn constraints check is called, it</span> <span data-start="724.81" data-end="728.99">will validate the project against the defined rules, so, in this case, you can see that</span> <span data-start="728.99" data-end="736.54">it has been able to detect that back-end and front-end must depend on TS .. and they depend</span> <span data-start="736.54" data-end="738.86">on conflicting versions of lodash.</span> <span data-start="738.86" data-end="747.12">If I run Yarn constraints fix, Yarn will automatically try to fix all the problems that it detects</span> <span data-start="747.12" data-end="749.339">and can fix.</span> <span data-start="749.339" data-end="755.16">In this case, for example, you can see that it is able to add TSLIB to the dependencies.</span> <span data-start="755.16" data-end="761.3">It hasn't been able to correct the mismatch in lodash because it's ambiguous.</span> <span data-start="761.3" data-end="763.36">It doesn't know which one you want to use.</span> <span data-start="763.36" data-end="770.18">In order to fix those kind of issues, you have the good old Yarn Add.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="770.18" data-end="777.32">If you run that with interactive mode, Yarn will ask you which version of Yarn you want</span> <span data-start="777.32" data-end="780.29">to use amongst multiple possible ones.</span> <span data-start="780.29" data-end="785.83">In this situation, it is smart enough to tell you that lodash is already used in two work</span> <span data-start="785.83" data-end="787.07">spaces.</span> <span data-start="787.07" data-end="788.98">Which one do you want to use?</span> <span data-start="788.98" data-end="795.31">By using this feature, you don't have to think about how should I fix the problem?</span> <span data-start="795.31" data-end="804.63">You just have to validate and Yarn will automatically continue and do its stuff.</span> <span data-start="804.63" data-end="813.48">You will see that all the .. have been properly fixed and everything has been applied.</span> <span data-start="813.48" data-end="820.97">Now, something else we can do with constraint, because of how powerful they are, is using</span> <span data-start="820.97" data-end="825.6">them as a query.</span> <span data-start="825.6" data-end="832.29">By using Yarn constraints Query, you get to ask Yarn what do you know about my project?</span> <span data-start="832.29" data-end="837.94">So, for example, in this case, by using one simple query, I'm able to ask Yarn to tell</span> <span data-start="837.94" data-end="843.41">me all the dependencies and all the ranges in all of my work spaces.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="843.41" data-end="846.04">But I want — I can be more precise if I want to.</span> <span data-start="846.04" data-end="853.63">I have to specify one of the parameters and Yarn will be able to filter those.</span> <span data-start="853.63" data-end="858.66">That is the power of the constraints.</span> <span data-start="858.66" data-end="863.51">Another feature that we are working on, and that is maybe the biggest feature that we</span> <span data-start="863.51" data-end="867.1">will ship, is zero install.</span> <span data-start="867.1" data-end="871.779">Zero install is not actually a feeling, it's more of a concept, and it's more aimed for</span> <span data-start="871.779" data-end="876.94">applications than libraries, even though they work for both.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="876.94" data-end="882.21">The idea is never run Yarn Install again.</span> <span data-start="882.21" data-end="885.65">That might remind you of something!</span> <span data-start="885.65" data-end="892.13">The idea behind this is that if a code needs to run, this code will fail, even though we</span> <span data-start="892.13" data-end="896.86">try our best to make a package manager that never fails, from time to time, we're not</span> <span data-start="896.86" data-end="902.16">free of making a bug, or making a mistake, and is it will crash at some point, or if</span> <span data-start="902.16" data-end="911.19">it is not us, maybe it's — maybe your file system will be run — that actually happened</span> <span data-start="911.19" data-end="913.089">to me before.</span> <span data-start="913.089" data-end="919.28">So, in order for something to work every time, it doesn't — it must not run.</span> <span data-start="919.28" data-end="924.23">So, with the zero install, the concept is simple.</span> <span data-start="924.23" data-end="927.88">You just add all your Yarn files into the repository.</span> <span data-start="927.88" data-end="932.31">And then you don't need to run Yarn install because everything will be there.</span> <span data-start="932.31" data-end="937.35">I know what you think that committing the directory bad.</span> <span data-start="937.35" data-end="943.67">With plug 'n' play, we don't have a directory any more and plug 'n' play is the default</span> <span data-start="943.67" data-end="944.67">in v2.</span> <span data-start="944.67" data-end="952.99">The problem can committing non-models was that non-models contain 20,000 text files.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="952.99" data-end="955.9">You may remember that I mentioned zip loading before.</span> <span data-start="955.9" data-end="963.98">With Yarn 2, instead of generating an unpacked cache, we just download each package that</span> <span data-start="963.98" data-end="970.44">you use, and we store them within your project, or elsewhere if you don't want to.</span> <span data-start="970.44" data-end="975.75">Which means that, for each package that you use, you will have exactly one archive.</span> <span data-start="975.75" data-end="980.23">And that is peanuts for it to support.</span> <span data-start="980.23" data-end="985.36">We discussed it with GitHub before breaking their infra, and they told us it would be</span> <span data-start="985.36" data-end="988.54">fine.</span> <span data-start="988.54" data-end="991.06">So what does zero install bring to the table?</span> <span data-start="991.06" data-end="995.75">Kat mentioned it improves the developer experience by a large factor.</span> <span data-start="995.75" data-end="1002.67">We don't have to run Yarn style between git pull and checkout.</span> <span data-start="1002.67" data-end="1009.279">Peer reviewers know which packet has been — they look at the file's change and see what</span> <span data-start="1009.279" data-end="1012">has been added into the project.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1012" data-end="1018.56">It is faster, simpler, and more stable for deployments, because again you don't have</span> <span data-start="1018.56" data-end="1022.95">to run Yarn at all, so there is no risk of Yarn crashing in production.</span> <span data-start="1022.95" data-end="1028.25">Additionally, you will always have exactly the same state on production as you have on</span> <span data-start="1028.25" data-end="1031.079">development, because that is the guarantee we provide.</span> <span data-start="1031.079" data-end="1034.78">If it works locally, it will work in production.</span> <span data-start="1034.78" data-end="1040.289">Additionally, it allows you to skip the CI configuration step.</span> <span data-start="1040.289" data-end="1047.179">So, in this case, we can see a quick demonstration of zero install, so you can see that we have</span> <span data-start="1047.179" data-end="1049.789">a small project that is using webpack 3.</span> <span data-start="1049.789" data-end="1055.909">We would like to update to webpack 4, so we create a new branch, and here, we will just</span> <span data-start="1055.909" data-end="1058.91">run Yarn add webpack four.</span> <span data-start="1058.91" data-end="1063.71">Yarn is now running, downloading be the dependencies as it always did.</span> <span data-start="1063.71" data-end="1071.64">If we do after that git status, we will see something very interesting.</span> <span data-start="1071.64" data-end="1077.23">But first, yes, you can see that webpack got updated correctly, of course.</span> <span data-start="1077.23" data-end="1080.78">And now if we run GIT status, you can see something interesting.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1080.78" data-end="1085.47">Instead of having .. we have as I mentioned one zip for each package.</span> <span data-start="1085.47" data-end="1093.029">If we commit all this, then we have everything we need in order to run our applications.</span> <span data-start="1093.029" data-end="1098.11">Let's say that suddenly a project manager comes into your room and says we need to fix</span> <span data-start="1098.11" data-end="1103.649">this problem on master, and it needs to be done now, so here you need to give a switch</span> <span data-start="1103.649" data-end="1109.309">quickly into the webpack 3 branch, make your child, and commit it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1109.309" data-end="1114.58">But just after switching, you don't have to run Yarn install because everything is like</span> <span data-start="1114.58" data-end="1115.769">it should be.</span> <span data-start="1115.769" data-end="1119.049">Your project is always in a good state.</span> <span data-start="1119.049" data-end="1125.019">Once you're done, you just have to switch back on your webpack 4 and everything will</span> <span data-start="1125.019" data-end="1127.019">work just the same.</span> <span data-start="1127.019" data-end="1132.489">By having this work flow and the simplifying context switches, it makes you more productive</span> <span data-start="1132.489" data-end="1135.889">because you can work on multiple features at any point in time.</span> <span data-start="1135.889" data-end="1143.559">In fact, it's super useful for me and a Yarn maintainer, because I can quickly check out</span> <span data-start="1143.559" data-end="1153.42">the pulls submitted to Yarn and fix them myself, something that was before very painful because</span> <span data-start="1153.42" data-end="1163.11">I had to be careful in which state my project — it's now super easy, in fact, Yarn to itself</span> <span data-start="1163.11" data-end="1172.499">is using zero install, so, for example, here, you can find that I'm — so it's a bit slower</span> <span data-start="1172.499" data-end="1178.399">than it would be if you don't have those tar balls inside your repository but it's faster</span> <span data-start="1178.399" data-end="1183.409">than it would be if you were to clone your repository and then run Yarn install.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1183.409" data-end="1185.57">In the end, there's a kind of balance here.</span> <span data-start="1185.57" data-end="1189.429">And, yes, there is a balance here.</span> <span data-start="1189.429" data-end="1191.289">So the clone is about to finish.</span> <span data-start="1191.289" data-end="1194.82">And starting from now, you can use any comment that you would typically use.</span> <span data-start="1194.82" data-end="1198.47">For example, here, I can run the unit test for Yarn.</span> <span data-start="1198.47" data-end="1202.11">I don't have to run Yarn install.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1202.11" data-end="1203.809">Everything is already there.</span> <span data-start="1203.809" data-end="1207.59">It makes it much easier for our contributors to jump into the project.</span> <span data-start="1207.59" data-end="1210.419">They just have to clone and run the counter.</span> <span data-start="1210.419" data-end="1212.38">They don't think more about it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1212.38" data-end="1215.1">Let's recap a bit.</span> <span data-start="1215.1" data-end="1216.78">We have an improved login.</span> <span data-start="1216.78" data-end="1218.429">We have new comments.</span> <span data-start="1218.429" data-end="1220.259">We have improved comments.</span> <span data-start="1220.259" data-end="1222.759">We have added packages and linting.</span> <span data-start="1222.759" data-end="1225.44">We have removed the need to run Yarn Install.</span> <span data-start="1225.44" data-end="1229.36">That has to be worth a major bump, right?</span> <span data-start="1229.36" data-end="1231.799">That is the tip of the iceberg.</span> <span data-start="1231.799" data-end="1236.419">This is only a 30-minute talk, and there is only so much that we can discuss here.</span> <span data-start="1236.419" data-end="1241.08">Fortunately, we have a more comprehensive change log on our GitHub repository.</span> <span data-start="1241.08" data-end="1244.809">I encourage you to look at it to see what is coming.</span> <span data-start="1244.809" data-end="1250.69">The v2 is flagged as experimental but it's starting to become stable enough for your</span> <span data-start="1250.69" data-end="1252.639">future projects.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1252.639" data-end="1256.039">The official release is still to be determined but we are thinking somewhere in the second</span> <span data-start="1256.039" data-end="1262.609">half of 2019 once we've ensured the transition path is as smooth as possible.</span> <span data-start="1262.609" data-end="1268.059">A big thanks should go to our contributors, of course, because we have had the pleasure</span> <span data-start="1268.059" data-end="1273.07">to welcome various you in people who simple stepped into the project and improved what</span> <span data-start="1273.07" data-end="1274.669">the feature they liked.</span> <span data-start="1274.669" data-end="1278.369">I said Yarn is a community project at the beginning of my talk.</span> <span data-start="1278.369" data-end="1280.07">And I really meant it.</span> <span data-start="1280.07" data-end="1282.519">We are always looking for new contributors.</span> <span data-start="1282.519" data-end="1287.179">More than that, we are ready to go the extra mile and help you get started.</span> <span data-start="1287.179" data-end="1291.919">Yarn is a huge project with a huge reach, a huge impact but we still aim to make it</span> <span data-start="1291.919" data-end="1293.57">approachable by anyone.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1293.57" data-end="1299.669">Plus we have cool T-shirts for the v2 if you contribute to the project, of course!</span> <span data-start="1299.669" data-end="1300.97">So I will now leave you.</span> <span data-start="1300.97" data-end="1303.34">I hope you enjoyed this talk.</span> <span data-start="1303.34" data-end="1305.369">Please come ask your questions when you see me in the hall.</span> <span data-start="1305.369" data-end="1308.19">I will be thrilled to share more about the work we do.</span> <span data-start="1308.19" data-end="1311.59">Thank you, and have a good evening.</span> </p>
