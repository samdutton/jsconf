data-end="259.92">had a found a bunch of takeaways and</span> <span data-start="259.92" data-end="261.48">those are that you want to keep your</span> <span data-start="261.48" data-end="263.73">emails texts light you want to keep them</span> <span data-start="263.73" data-end="265.41">image-heavy just to keep the interest of</span> <span data-start="265.41" data-end="267.6">your users have that huge top anchored</span> <span data-start="267.6" data-end="269.31">logo so people know where your email is</span> <span data-start="269.31" data-end="272.01">coming from and then also you want to</span> <span data-start="272.01" data-end="273.51">set a max width on your email you don't</span> <span data-start="273.51" data-end="274.95">want people reading across the screen</span> <span data-start="274.95" data-end="278.85">just to see what you want to say alright</span> <span data-start="278.85" data-end="279.99">so the next thing I wanted to take a</span> <span data-start="279.99" data-end="281.7">look at was the emails that I'd be</span> <span data-start="281.7" data-end="285.66">working with so I did and here's the</span> <span data-start="285.66" data-end="287.61">welcome email from hot pads I was like</span> <span data-start="287.61" data-end="291">oh my god so a couple of things first</span> <span data-start="291" data-end="292.86">off why is the logo right in the middle</span> <span data-start="292.86" data-end="295.89">of email I don't know another thing</span> <span data-start="295.89" data-end="297.63">you'll notice is the spacing is really</span> <span data-start="297.63" data-end="299.7">inconsistent throughout the email it</span> <span data-start="299.7" data-end="301.59">doesn't really make any sense why things</span> <span data-start="301.59" data-end="305.4">are have the margins that they do the</span> <span data-start="305.4" data-end="306.9">last thing I noticed was wait where do</span> <span data-start="306.9" data-end="309.63">you unsubscribe if your user the type of</span> <span data-start="309.63" data-end="311.22">user who gets really annoyed at all of</span> <span data-start="311.22" data-end="313.56">these emails pummeling your inbox then</span> <span data-start="313.56" data-end="314.82">you definitely want to be able to at</span> <span data-start="314.82" data-end="316.26">least find that unsubscribe no matter</span> <span data-start="316.26" data-end="320.1">how hard it is to find so basically I</span> <span data-start="320.1" data-end="323.88">was like dog I was like wow okay so</span> <span data-start="323.88" data-end="326.91">that's what I'm working with so the next</span> <span data-start="326.91" data-end="328.32">thing I wanted to do in designing our</span> <span data-start="328.32" data-end="331.34">emails was to plan on what I was making</span> <span data-start="331.34" data-end="335.07">and I had a couple of goals in mind so</span> <span data-start="335.07" data-end="336.36">the first was to bring a bunch of</span> <span data-start="336.36" data-end="338.91">consistency to our emails I took a look</span> <span data-start="338.91" data-end="341.79">at all of our emails across hot pads and</span> <span data-start="341.79" data-end="343.5">they were all different like the logos</span> <span data-start="343.5" data-end="345.72">in different places there are different</span> <span data-start="345.72" data-end="348.57">margins different icons so I was like</span> <span data-start="348.57" data-end="350.669">all right let's bring some consistency</span> <span data-start="350.669" data-end="352.65">to them and in general having that</span> <span data-start="352.65" data-end="354.45">consistency will bring brand awareness</span> <span data-start="354.45" data-end="357.15">again seeing that top anchor blue logo</span> <span data-start="357.15" data-end="359.22">over and over again will make sure that</span> <span data-start="359.22" data-end="363.36">your brand is recognizable so another</span> <span data-start="363.36" data-end="364.89">thing I took a look at in my planning</span> <span data-start="364.89" data-end="366.99">was a bunch of pre-made templates I'm</span> <span data-start="366.99" data-end="368.88">sure a bunch of you guys have seen all</span> <span data-start="368.88" data-end="371.07">those and there are just lots of options</span> <span data-start="371.07" data-end="372.599">which I'm going to talk about a little</span> <span data-start="372.599" data-end="375.9">bit later and I actually didn't use any</span> <span data-start="375.9" data-end="377.34">of them</span> <span data-start="377.34" data-end="379.77">the reason why was because I was redoing</span> <span data-start="379.77" data-end="382.11">all of our emails we have a pretty like</span> <span data-start="382.11" data-end="385.38">specific user base that uses outlook a</span> <span data-start="385.38" data-end="387.84">lot still so I wanted to make sure I had</span> <span data-start="387.84" data-end="390.63">something that was customizable also</span> <span data-start="390.63" data-end="392.729">being that this was the first project I</span> <span data-start="392.729" data-end="394.8">did as a web developer it was a learning</span> <span data-start="394.8" data-end="396.54">experience for me and I had a lot of</span> <span data-start="396.54" data-end="398.97">time on my hands so if you're a company</span> <span data-start="398.97" data-end="401.1">that doesn't have the time you could go</span> <span data-start="401.1" data-end="402.6">with a template but if you've got a lot</span> <span data-start="402.6" data-end="404.28">of time and you need a customizable</span> <span data-start="404.28" data-end="406.26">solution then I'd recommend just</span> <span data-start="406.26" data-end="410.46">building your own the next thing I did</span> <span data-start="410.46" data-end="413.04">was a bunch of sketches so if I've</span> <span data-start="413.04" data-end="414.6">learned anything from UX it's that</span> <span data-start="414.6" data-end="416.94">sketching is awesome so you see here</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="416.94" data-end="418.56">I've actually sketched the same email</span> <span data-start="418.56" data-end="421.41">four different times and in general when</span> <span data-start="421.41" data-end="423.3">you do sketch you will find that your</span> <span data-start="423.3" data-end="426.06">later sketches are much better than the</span> <span data-start="426.06" data-end="427.919">previous ones so it's good to just do it</span> <span data-start="427.919" data-end="431.28">over and over again another thing you</span> <span data-start="431.28" data-end="433.2">can do in planning your design is if</span> <span data-start="433.2" data-end="435">you've got the skills for photoshop i'd</span> <span data-start="435" data-end="437.16">recommend it it's great you can have a</span> <span data-start="437.16" data-end="438.93">quick mock-up so you see here one of the</span> <span data-start="438.93" data-end="440.76">earlier mock-ups of our wealth of our</span> <span data-start="440.76" data-end="446.82">welcome email that i did another thing</span> <span data-start="446.82" data-end="448.59">to keep in mind is what i call the rule</span> <span data-start="448.59" data-end="451.05">of thumbs so minimum touchable area i</span> <span data-start="451.05" data-end="452.61">think a lot of people heard the number</span> <span data-start="452.61" data-end="456.479">44 x 44 pixels this is actually based on</span> <span data-start="456.479" data-end="459.539">the original iphones human interface</span> <span data-start="459.539" data-end="462.12">guidelines which actually no longer</span> <span data-start="462.12" data-end="465.45">exists so wipe that number from your</span> <span data-start="465.45" data-end="467.7">mind take a look at these links you'll</span> <span data-start="467.7" data-end="469.08">find a bunch of different minimum</span> <span data-start="469.08" data-end="471.38">touchable areas for different devices</span> <span data-start="471.38" data-end="473.849">they vary quite a bit so you probably</span> <span data-start="473.849" data-end="475.74">want to take a look at the devices that</span> <span data-start="475.74" data-end="478.62">your users have and then base it on the</span> <span data-start="478.62" data-end="484.02">largest size all right so here's my</span> <span data-start="484.02" data-end="486.599">template this is the email i created</span> <span data-start="486.599" data-end="488.88">from the original one again you'll see</span> <span data-start="488.88" data-end="491.729">the top anchor logo you'll see the links</span> <span data-start="491.729" data-end="493.889">are underlined for accessibility as well</span> <span data-start="493.889" data-end="496.919">as color colored differently i changed a</span> <span data-start="496.919" data-end="500.099">bunch of things for mobile and for</span> <span data-start="500.099" data-end="501.99">social media so that you have images</span> <span data-start="501.99" data-end="503.91">instead and again with the text below</span> <span data-start="503.91" data-end="506.46">for accessibility it's a little bit hard</span> <span data-start="506.46" data-end="508.59">to see but below that in the footer I'm</span> <span data-start="508.59" data-end="510.22">mimicking what hot pads</span> <span data-start="510.22" data-end="511.93">website used to look like it's the same</span> <span data-start="511.93" data-end="514.12">footer so people kind of see that</span> <span data-start="514.12" data-end="516.4">consistency from the web on to the</span> <span data-start="516.4" data-end="520.599">emails so I like to say that it's an</span> <span data-start="520.599" data-end="522.159">aesthetic that Prince would approve of</span> <span data-start="522.159" data-end="525.76">and just for reference here's the</span> <span data-start="525.76" data-end="527.56">original email and then the email that I</span> <span data-start="527.56" data-end="530.14">designed so they see the content is a</span> <span data-start="530.14" data-end="532.21">little bit longer in my version but I</span> <span data-start="532.21" data-end="535.24">think it looks a whole lot better and a</span> <span data-start="535.24" data-end="537.37">lot of trap or traffic shot up shot</span> <span data-start="537.37" data-end="538.99">through the roof after the redesign of</span> <span data-start="538.99" data-end="544.72">this email all right on to code a bunch</span> <span data-start="544.72" data-end="548.35">of tips and tricks so you can find my</span> <span data-start="548.35" data-end="550.39">template on github it's just the general</span> <span data-start="550.39" data-end="552.31">template that I created for the hot pads</span> <span data-start="552.31" data-end="557.35">emails so why template a great thing</span> <span data-start="557.35" data-end="559.21">about having a template is that you can</span> <span data-start="559.21" data-end="560.74">keep your code dry so you're not</span> <span data-start="560.74" data-end="562.68">repeating yourself so see in my email</span> <span data-start="562.68" data-end="564.82">what we're calling our little micro</span> <span data-start="564.82" data-end="566.29">listing it's like the same little block</span> <span data-start="566.29" data-end="567.88">of code just repeated over and over</span> <span data-start="567.88" data-end="570.13">again again you'll see the consistency</span> <span data-start="570.13" data-end="572.77">in the hot pads logo so that people know</span> <span data-start="572.77"
