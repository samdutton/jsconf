<p><span data-start="195.04" data-end="197.32">USB and when I beam by that is like</span> <span data-start="197.32" data-end="199.84">somehow being able to put browses and</span> <span data-start="199.84" data-end="202.39">like devices like arduino x' and drones</span> <span data-start="202.39" data-end="204.28">and boats and things like that together</span> <span data-start="204.28" data-end="206.74">in the past so we do actually have to go</span> <span data-start="206.74" data-end="210.73">as far back as 2007 to 2009 that was</span> <span data-start="210.73" data-end="212.67">when I first started getting into</span> <span data-start="212.67" data-end="216.16">hardware and trying to sort of make</span> <span data-start="216.16" data-end="218.29">really cool machines but also like talk</span> <span data-start="218.29" data-end="220.3">to it with my browser and so the way</span> <span data-start="220.3" data-end="222.07">that you did it back then was use flash</span> <span data-start="222.07" data-end="223.96">communication server does anyone use</span> <span data-start="223.96" data-end="227.17">that yeah a couple of us were certain to</span> <span data-start="227.17" data-end="230.35">be in the minority and you use this</span> <span data-start="230.35" data-end="232.12">really cool app called serve proxy and</span> <span data-start="232.12" data-end="233.709">what it would do is it would take the</span> <span data-start="233.709" data-end="236.14">serial port data coming in from like</span> <span data-start="236.14" data-end="238.54">something like an Arduino and it would</span> <span data-start="238.54" data-end="242.01">then like proxy that on to like</span> <span data-start="242.01" data-end="244.66">basically like a socket so that you</span> <span data-start="244.66" data-end="246.01">could actually listen to the data coming</span> <span data-start="246.01" data-end="248.17">in in your browser or in flash which is</span> <span data-start="248.17" data-end="249.13">really really interesting</span> <span data-start="249.13" data-end="251.89">so you would have your Arduino and your</span> <span data-start="251.89" data-end="254.05">browser but that was so far apart</span> <span data-start="254.05" data-end="255.61">because you had to have all these steps</span> <span data-start="255.61" data-end="257.739">in between right so you had so proxy</span> <span data-start="257.739" data-end="261.04">which would go from serial to TCP so</span> <span data-start="261.04" data-end="262.15">that you could then use flash</span> <span data-start="262.15" data-end="264.28">communication server and make a flash</span> <span data-start="264.28" data-end="266.29">app to listen to that so I think the</span> <span data-start="266.29" data-end="268.99">first example I ever did was I had like</span> <span data-start="268.99" data-end="271.63">a a trim pot like a little knob that you</span> <span data-start="271.63" data-end="273.7">could turn plugged into the Arduino and</span> <span data-start="273.7" data-end="275.8">when you turned it there was like a</span> <span data-start="275.8" data-end="278.77">circle colored in with a color in flat</span> <span data-start="278.77" data-end="281.65">and as you as you turn the knob it would</span> <span data-start="281.65" data-end="283.15">either change the cycle through all the</span> <span data-start="283.15" data-end="284.65">colors or it would change the shape of</span> <span data-start="284.65" data-end="286.87">the circle and I thought I was a wizard</span> <span data-start="286.87" data-end="291.009">basically if the code did not look much</span> <span data-start="291.009" data-end="293.289">like what a wizard would write there was</span> <span data-start="293.289" data-end="294.94">a really weird configuration file that</span> <span data-start="294.94" data-end="297.639">you used in so proxy where you had to</span> <span data-start="297.639" data-end="301.27">put lots of nerdy things like the baud</span> <span data-start="301.27" data-end="303.58">rate and all your stop bits and parity</span> <span data-start="303.58" data-end="305.08">and things like that but the flash</span> <span data-start="305.08" data-end="307.509">communication stuff in action script is</span> <span data-start="307.509" data-end="309.55">pretty readable you know you can kind of</span> <span data-start="309.55" data-end="311.199">see what's happening and so it was</span> <span data-start="311.199" data-end="312.52">actually pretty friendly once you</span> <span data-start="312.52" data-end="314.009">actually got that data coming through</span> <span data-start="314.009" data-end="318.19">but we all know what happened with flash</span> <span data-start="318.19" data-end="322.389">it fell out of vogue for like very you</span> <span data-start="322.389" data-end="324.55">know understandable reasons and I agree</span> <span data-start="324.55" data-end="327.31">with a lot of those reasons and so sadly</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="327.31" data-end="329.05">I sort of had to put that method down</span> <span data-start="329.05" data-end="331.69">and it was really uncool for a while for</span> <span data-start="331.69" data-end="333.19">me to say that I used to be a flash</span> <span data-start="333.19" data-end="336.759">developer for my day job so we fast</span> <span data-start="336.759" data-end="340.419">forward to 2013 to 2017 and we got this</span> <span data-start="340.419" data-end="342.61">really cool thing in the Chrome browser</span> <span data-start="342.61" data-end="346">called chrome serial and just wanted to</span> <span data-start="346" data-end="347.889">just quickly like before everyone gets</span> <span data-start="347.889" data-end="350.139">excited just to give a little bit of a</span> <span data-start="350.139" data-end="351.819">rest and peace there so explain what</span> <span data-start="351.819" data-end="355.15">happens later okay so let's start with</span> <span data-start="355.15" data-end="356.469">that scenario again you know we've got a</span> <span data-start="356.469" data-end="358.06">load we know and we desperately want our</span> <span data-start="358.06" data-end="359.83">browser to like start controlling it and</span> <span data-start="359.83" data-end="362.349">showing data and stuff like that so what</span> <span data-start="362.349" data-end="363.52">we would do is we would use Chrome</span> <span data-start="363.52" data-end="366.159">serial which was an API that allowed us</span> <span data-start="366.159" data-end="369.34">to access the the actual like serial</span> <span data-start="369.34" data-end="371.11">communication that was built into our</span> <span data-start="371.11" data-end="373.18">dueño boards or any other hardware that</span> <span data-start="373.18" data-end="374.8">had like a serial port that we could</span> <span data-start="374.8" data-end="378.159">connect to and then the only way that we</span> <span data-start="378.159" data-end="380.44">could actually use that API was it was</span> <span data-start="380.44" data-end="382.96">sort of sandboxed into you I either had</span> <span data-start="382.96" data-end="385.87">to have a chrome app and it had to sort</span> <span data-start="385.87" data-end="388.21">of run in there so for a while there</span> <span data-start="388.21" data-end="389.83">were like really cool things coming out</span> <span data-start="389.83" data-end="391.9">where you had a website but you also had</span> <span data-start="391.9" data-end="393.699">to kind of install the companion app and</span> <span data-start="393.699" data-end="395.979">it was a little bit clunky but I was</span> <span data-start="395.979" data-end="397.33">able to sort of demonstrate some of my</span> <span data-start="397.33" data-end="399.25">hardware libraries working within that</span> <span data-start="399.25" data-end="401.469">and some people went on to kind of use</span> <span data-start="401.469" data-end="403.86">my libraries to make really cool stuff</span> <span data-start="403.86" data-end="406.389">and one example that I really really</span> <span data-start="406.389" data-end="408.729">loved was the chip computer which some</span> <span data-start="408.729" data-end="410.139">of you might have seen on Kickstarter a</span> <span data-start="410.139" data-end="412.539">few years ago it was a $9</span> </p>
