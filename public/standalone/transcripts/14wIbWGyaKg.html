<p><span data-start="13.019" data-end="14.509"Audience member: All right, hi.</span> <span data-start="14.509" data-end="20.41">My name's Garann, and I would like to talk today what happened to our JavaScript phones?</span> <span data-start="20.41" data-end="26.869">I want to start off with a hypothesis which is that nobody in this room actually has a</span> <span data-start="26.869" data-end="28.38">hacker phone.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="28.38" data-end="33.34">About five to six years ago, I feel like I could have asked you all this kind of conference</span> <span data-start="33.34" data-end="39.969">if you had some kind of experimental advice running Firefox OS, Ubuntu on your person</span> <span data-start="39.969" data-end="44.32">right now, and there would be a fair amount of hands in the air given the demographic</span> <span data-start="44.32" data-end="45.34">of this conference.</span> <span data-start="45.34" data-end="50.55">Today, I doubt there are any of those devices here in the room, unless you brought them</span> <span data-start="50.55" data-end="52.32">here specifically to troll me?</span> <span data-start="52.32" data-end="54.31">Am I right?</span> <span data-start="54.31" data-end="55.36">I'm assuming that I am!</span> <span data-start="55.36" data-end="61.35">So I think it's fair to say that hacker phones as a concept kind of disappeared.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="61.35" data-end="66.36">We just gave up, and we went back to our iPhones and our Androids.</span> <span data-start="66.36" data-end="67.63">It wasn't for no reason.</span> <span data-start="67.63" data-end="74.79">We got better cameras, faster modems, and greater stability.</span> <span data-start="74.79" data-end="77">These phones seemed to get more and more expensive.</span> <span data-start="77" data-end="84.859">I can't even fathom how I would have justified paying nearly a grand for my first Nokia,</span> <span data-start="84.859" data-end="90.42">but they also become more impressive and able to replace our real computers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="90.42" data-end="94.579">So you could say that they cost more, because they help us accomplish for.</span> <span data-start="94.579" data-end="99.479">They go far beyond what we could have done with hacker phones.</span> <span data-start="99.479" data-end="102.249">Except they don't work like real computers.</span> <span data-start="102.249" data-end="108.119">We're locked into somebody else's vision of this sort of like Ikea office computer that</span> <span data-start="108.119" data-end="113.06">looks pretty convincing, but it's actually quite limited.</span> <span data-start="113.06" data-end="119.279">If you don't like the vision that you're offered, you have at maximum one alternative option.</span> <span data-start="119.279" data-end="126.299">So maybe that's why I'm up here today wondering what happened to JavaScript phones which would</span> <span data-start="126.299" data-end="132.26">blow up this field and put the future of these computers back into the hands of your average</span> <span data-start="132.26" data-end="139.25">JavaScript developer, the way we grabbed the web back from IE5 and Flash.</span> <span data-start="139.25" data-end="145.31">Interestingly, what happened involves a bit of all the things I just mentioned.</span> <span data-start="145.31" data-end="150.63">The stunning cameras, the connection speeds, the stability of the firmware.</span> <span data-start="150.63" data-end="156.22">And it might seem superficially like this is triumph of the free market where the products</span> <span data-start="156.22" data-end="160.06">that won do so because they were simply better products.</span> <span data-start="160.06" data-end="166.87">It's actually more of a triumph of old boys' network, monopolies, the obtuseness of infrastructure,</span> <span data-start="166.87" data-end="171.75">and fashion having lots and lots of capital to throw at something so that nobody else</span> <span data-start="171.75" data-end="174.74">can compete on your level.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="174.74" data-end="179.69">It's not a story of the natural even Lukes of products to become better, it's the story</span> <span data-start="179.69" data-end="182.75">of capitalism rewarding capitalism.</span> <span data-start="182.75" data-end="188.17">Let's go back five or six years when some of us thought it might play out differently.</span> <span data-start="188.17" data-end="194.22">There are a few things relevant to examine from that time that should have culminated</span> <span data-start="194.22" data-end="203.12">in a great JavaScript phone â€” the interest in Cordova and the tools, the exponential</span> <span data-start="203.12" data-end="209.12">adoption of Node, and Node bots being like artisan coffee brewing, or bread-making or</span> <span data-start="209.12" data-end="214.81">knitting, whatever you're into these days, of the day.</span> <span data-start="214.81" data-end="220.51">People searching for ways of web skills on their phones, putting Node where they could</span> <span data-start="220.51" data-end="224.53">think of and everybody seemed to have a soldiering iron.</span> <span data-start="224.53" data-end="228.73">If that is not a recipe for a JavaScript phone, I don't know what is.</span> <span data-start="228.73" data-end="235.29">Some of your babies, you will remember that time, so let's talk about the details.</span> <span data-start="235.29" data-end="239.76">First, the state of mobile development was really unresolved.</span> <span data-start="239.76" data-end="243.51">People were already developing native apps, and they were making quite decent money off</span> <span data-start="243.51" data-end="246.61">them because there wasn't as much competition.</span> <span data-start="246.61" data-end="251.51">So, naturally, developers who didn't work in the native languages of the platforms wanted</span> <span data-start="251.51" data-end="256.07">a piece of that too or their employers or client did, and from there, we got things</span> <span data-start="256.07" data-end="258.22">like phone gap.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="258.22" data-end="266.03">Phone gap was bought by Adobe and became Cordova, a tool to allow JavaScript developers to write</span> <span data-start="266.03" data-end="271.259">a JavaScript application and compile it to native code.</span> <span data-start="271.259" data-end="276.09">There was a lot of focus on making normal hosted web apps and websites mobile-friendly.</span> <span data-start="276.09" data-end="283.389">There are tool kits such as emulators, and intensive theorising about responsive design</span> <span data-start="283.389" data-end="287.65">that started appearing out of nowhere to meet the needs of smartphones.</span> <span data-start="287.65" data-end="292.509">You could compare it to the current consensus we should be producing accessibility websites,</span> <span data-start="292.509" data-end="296.36">but in this case, we actually went and did something about it.</span> <span data-start="296.36" data-end="303.729">At this point, testing cross-browser had been a significant and limiting piece of work recently.</span> <span data-start="303.729" data-end="308.499">Adding mobile browsers generated mobile apps to the list of things to check felt pretty</span> <span data-start="308.499" data-end="315.909">natural, and everybody wanted to be on the everybody's phone and we all just did it.</span> <span data-start="315.909" data-end="317.05">That's the front-end.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="317.05" data-end="322.12">On the back-end, you have Node, which at this point is still fairly new, or at least is</span> <span data-start="322.12" data-end="324.36">still being treated that way.</span> <span data-start="324.36" data-end="330.35">It's gone through a few years of people insisting it's merely a novelty, and people insisting</span> <span data-start="330.35" data-end="336.449">it will never have the robustness of Engine X, or Ruby, or the corporate assured reliability</span> <span data-start="336.449" data-end="339.54">of .NET.</span> <span data-start="339.54" data-end="344.039">Express has existed a few minutes after Node was released so people have been using Node</span> <span data-start="344.039" data-end="347.559">as a web server all this time.</span> <span data-start="347.559" data-end="353.039">Even the Node community itself has been trying to distance Node from being a web server.</span> <span data-start="353.039" data-end="360.889">I always read it as an unfortunate giving into pressure from hacker news-type people</span> <span data-start="360.889" data-end="362.34">to be more serious.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="362.34" data-end="366.419">There is nothing more serious than hardware.</span> <span data-start="366.419" data-end="373.889">At this time, you can assume that you will see people playing with circuit boards with</span> <span data-start="373.889" data-end="384.93">lights on them, and somebody's nocopter will be sitting on the ground, gathering speculation</span> <span data-start="384.93" data-end="388.56">about what actually needs to be fixed, and how sweet it's going to be when it actually</span> <span data-start="388.56" data-end="391.12">runs.</span> <span data-start="391.12" data-end="402.4">The hardware is just marketing being useful things to do with JavaScript, not necessarily</span> <span data-start="402.4" data-end="404.529">ma'am-up and not individual interfaces.</span> <span data-start="404.529" data-end="405.529">Why not?</span> <span data-start="405.529" data-end="409.689">Scripting languages are lovely to work with if introducing the additional layer of abstraction</span> <span data-start="409.689" data-end="412.389">doesn't slow things down massively.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="412.389" data-end="418.559">JavaScript has been getting faster, more powerful for years at this point, so that easier adoption</span> <span data-start="418.559" data-end="423.069">makes it a very attractive interface to code against.</span> <span data-start="423.069" data-end="426.599">There's one more big things that is happening at this point in time, which is that there</span> <span data-start="426.599" data-end="431.949">is a JavaScript phone, and at a conference like this, a bunch of people would have had</span> <span data-start="431.949" data-end="432.949">one.</span> <span data-start="432.949" data-end="436.65">We talked a little bit about â€” we will talk about Firefox OS in a second.</span> <span data-start="436.65" data-end="440.02">You may or may not have noticed there's an elephant in this room.</span> <span data-start="440.02" data-end="445.07">Maybe it's more clear when it seemed like we could have a JavaScript phone, but what</span> <span data-start="445.07" data-end="447.68">made us think if we should?</span> <span data-start="447.68" data-end="451.379">If you're thinking that was a really good idea, why didn't that happen?</span> <span data-start="451.379" data-end="453.719">Why do you think that?</span> <span data-start="453.719" data-end="457.289">Personally, I wondered if today it's too late?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="457.289" data-end="462.71">I don't know if people still feel this way, or if the ship has sailed?</span> <span data-start="462.71" data-end="466.169">Several years ago, though, it was too early to wonder that.</span> <span data-start="466.169" data-end="471.419">Another advantage for Apple and Google sharing the smartphone monopoly is they have had the</span> <span data-start="471.419" data-end="475.189">privilege of training us all to use their products.</span> <span data-start="475.189" data-end="479.71">If you think back, though, people used to have tons of complaints about the phone interfaces.</span> <span data-start="479.71" data-end="485.96">But if your echo chamber is like mine, that sort of grumbling has died down over the recent</span> <span data-start="485.96" data-end="491.249">years, and if anything, you're left with a sniping back and forth about whether Android</span> <span data-start="491.249" data-end="493.569">or iOS is better.</span> <span data-start="493.569" data-end="495.61">Probably not even that, though.</span> <span data-start="495.61" data-end="501.369">Because we have no or limited opportunity for personalisation, and for deviation from</span> <span data-start="501.369" data-end="505.9">this sort of single-sanction set of use cases, there's nothing on our smartphones really</span> <span data-start="505.9" data-end="508.3">to get invested in now.</span> <span data-start="508.3" data-end="510.169">That didn't used to be true.</span> <span data-start="510.169" data-end="515.76">There are probably even now things on your phone that kind of annoy you, but you found</span> <span data-start="515.76" data-end="517.18">workarounds for them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="517.18" data-end="522.349">Like maybe the mail client isn't full-featured enough, or the maps give bad directions, the</span> <span data-start="522.349" data-end="526.71">system preferences seem intentionally hard to set and confusing.</span> <span data-start="526.71" data-end="531.22">I think the big reason that people wanted a JavaScript phone is because several years</span> <span data-start="531.22" data-end="537.02">ago, the most serious JavaScript developers still have experience writing interfaces.</span> <span data-start="537.02" data-end="541.13">Even if we weren't designers per se, we felt we could do better.</span> <span data-start="541.13" data-end="546.31">Because phones at that point were like this trash heap of badly functioning operating</span> <span data-start="546.31" data-end="551.2">system and carrier-installed apps and the third-party apps that might have improved</span> <span data-start="551.2" data-end="553.75">that situation were treated and super sketchy.</span> <span data-start="553.75" data-end="558.34">I believe people wanted JavaScript phones because they wanted to make the software on</span> <span data-start="558.34" data-end="562.77">their phones live up to the promise of the hardware.</span> <span data-start="562.77" data-end="566.94">So you've been very patient waiting for me to say something about Firefox OS, and now</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="566.94" data-end="569.83">I'm going to say something about Firefox OS.</span> <span data-start="569.83" data-end="576.69">Mozilla had a project called Boot to Gecko that was meant to give us JavaScript phones.</span> <span data-start="576.69" data-end="581.53">Mozilla was probably the only company that could have pulled this off, being a huge company</span> <span data-start="581.53" data-end="586.94">that nonetheless maintained an open back-and-forth with the web community as a whole and isn't</span> <span data-start="586.94" data-end="591.41">the growth diabetic focused business the same as Apple and Google were.</span> <span data-start="591.41" data-end="602.19">The idea was to bring a smartphone to everybody by using the power of web technologies.</span> <span data-start="602.19" data-end="603.77">That's clearly not happened.</span> <span data-start="603.77" data-end="608.43">To understand why, we need to talk a bit about hardware and what goes on inside these little</span> <span data-start="608.43" data-end="611.78">machines.</span> <span data-start="611.78" data-end="615.97">Your phone is a tiny little computer, but it's also kind of not.</span> <span data-start="615.97" data-end="619.57">It contains a lot of the same pieces as the computers that you work with, the processor,</span> <span data-start="619.57" data-end="621.51">modem, sound, and graphics cards.</span> <span data-start="621.51" data-end="623.24">They're in a different format.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="623.24" data-end="635.56">In the old days, personal computers were hobbyist devices, and you could build it yourself to</span> <span data-start="635.56" data-end="637.65">has your own machine.</span> <span data-start="637.65" data-end="642.4">Even big-brand desktop machines as recently as the dawn of wildly available cell phones</span> <span data-start="642.4" data-end="648.62">were the things that you expected to customise, but that's never been the case with phones.</span> <span data-start="648.62" data-end="653.94">Handheld devices have always been largely single units that weren't intended to be customised,</span> <span data-start="653.94" data-end="655.81">let alone built from spare parts.</span> <span data-start="655.81" data-end="661.68">Today, you can still get a GSM shield, and you can make something similar to a phone</span> <span data-start="661.68" data-end="668.96">but a long way from from the definition of mobile phone.</span> <span data-start="668.96" data-end="673.6">Similarly, you can sit at your computer and do pretty much everything your phone does,</span> <span data-start="673.6" data-end="680.76">just using different networks, but we still don't recognise your computer as a phone.</span> <span data-start="680.76" data-end="685.8">The size is a big part of what makes a phone a phone, but the size is only important because</span> <span data-start="685.8" data-end="687.53">it offers portability.</span> <span data-start="687.53" data-end="692.38">And portability is only useful if you can connect at that cell network.</span> <span data-start="692.38" data-end="700.05">This the â€” the protocol is needed to negotiate a negotiation with a cellphone tower are only</span> <span data-start="700.05" data-end="703.04">licensed to carriers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="703.04" data-end="705.92">It's not quite as exclusive as it might sound.</span> <span data-start="705.92" data-end="711.4">Even the carriers who have their own communications infrastructure will regularly rent space on</span> <span data-start="711.4" data-end="715.47">other networks for the client's communications.</span> <span data-start="715.47" data-end="719.36">But it's another hurdle for anyone who wants to start making phones.</span> <span data-start="719.36" data-end="724.14">This hardware needs to be certified by the individual carriers that it's going to connect</span> <span data-start="724.14" data-end="729.01">to, and then it also needs to be approved by the relevant governing bodies in whatever</span> <span data-start="729.01" data-end="734.16">countries it will be used in, for example, the FCC in the United States.</span> <span data-start="734.16" data-end="739.1">And none of the hardware in the phone exists in isolation, so, if you love writing integration</span> <span data-start="739.1" data-end="743.93">tests and stress tests, you will probably spend a lifetime being entertained by getting</span> <span data-start="743.93" data-end="745.57">the hardware certified.</span> </p>
