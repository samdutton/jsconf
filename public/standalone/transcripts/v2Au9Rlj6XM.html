data-end="228.39">and start to dissect them and especially</span> <span data-start="228.39" data-end="231.06">just in the 70s this was like wow what</span> <span data-start="231.06" data-end="233.88">do you mean we can see live video from</span> <span data-start="233.88" data-end="236.43">two different places at once and what</span> <span data-start="236.43" data-end="238.17">what are the possibilities of this and I</span> <span data-start="238.17" data-end="240.299">think sometimes when when technology</span> <span data-start="240.299" data-end="243.87">just comes out is when people are often</span> <span data-start="243.87" data-end="247.19">the most experimental with it and so</span> <span data-start="247.19" data-end="249.78">fast forward to now there's this</span> <span data-start="249.78" data-end="253.88">protocol called web RTC real-time web</span> <span data-start="253.88" data-end="258.44">streaming

data-start="1270.93" data-end="1273.21">so I could actually just do it sort of</span> <span data-start="1273.21" data-end="1276">within the code so for example I could</span> <span data-start="1276" data-end="1282.42">here make a shape and then I could blend</span> <span data-start="1282.42" data-end="1288.06">it with its own output which is oa0 in</span> <span data-start="1288.06" data-end="1290.52">this case but because it's blending the</span> <span data-start="1290.52" data-end="1292.29">same thing with the same thing it just</span> <span data-start="1292.29" data-end="1297.6">ends up also being a triangle but if I</span> <span data-start="1297.6" data-end="1299.58">blend it with itself and then repeat the</span> <span data-start="1299.58" data-end="1302.91">entire thing add a shape on top to the</span> <span data-start="1302.91" data-end="1307.71">repeated output it gets more interesting</span> <span data-start="1307.71"

data-end="1317.4">scale</span> <span data-start="1317.4" data-end="1320.67">and so just using this idea of a video</span> <span data-start="1320.67" data-end="1325.08">feedback and in pretty simple code then</span> <span data-start="1325.08" data-end="1327.84">you get something that's as complex</span> <span data-start="1327.84" data-end="1333.12">account as complex as a factor and so</span> <span data-start="1333.12" data-end="1338.22">another example is here I could go back</span> <span data-start="1338.22" data-end="1344.4">to the camera and they're actually</span> <span data-start="1344.4" data-end="1355.44">another example oh yeah and so I could</span> <span data-start="1355.44" data-end="1362.82">blend my face with itself here we go and</span> <span data-start="1362.82" data-end="1364.83">so then I just start to get these sort</span> <span data-start="1364.83" data-end="1368.76">of trails but then if I use that</span> <span data-start="1368.76" data-end="1371.01">modulate function again and so I</span> <span data-start="1371.01" data-end="1374.19">actually use the colors to affect the</span> <span data-start="1374.19"
