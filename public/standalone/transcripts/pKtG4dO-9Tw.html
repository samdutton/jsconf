<p><span data-start="26.92" data-end="32.59">Good morning everyone, so I am talking today about cognitive computing, the name of my</span> <span data-start="32.59" data-end="38.9">talk is Domo Arigato, Mr Roboto, I do not speak Japanese, I copied that straight from</span> <span data-start="38.9" data-end="52.12">Wikipedia, I'll talk about cognitive computing, my slides are</span> <span data-start="52.12" data-end="57.71">available online, ‘snugug’ is the bit that's important, that's where I'm on the</span> <span data-start="57.71" data-end="61.94">internet, Github, Twitter, you can find me there.</span> <span data-start="61.94" data-end="67.38">So let's talk about the world of cognitive computing, shall we.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="67.38" data-end="70.159">This is Pepper.</span> <span data-start="70.159" data-end="79.95">Pepper is a robot, built by Soft Bank a Japanese company, pepper is designed to be one of the</span> <span data-start="79.95" data-end="86.45">worlds first human computer interactive Android type things.</span> <span data-start="86.45" data-end="90.85">It's using the power of cognitive computing to make this interaction between humans and</span> <span data-start="90.85" data-end="97.7">computers a little bit easier something not like the programming we do everyday.</span> <span data-start="97.7" data-end="104.409">If we talk about cognitive computing we should probably define what cognitive computing is.</span> <span data-start="104.409" data-end="110.25">So cognitive computing is a new field of computing, the types of problem that cognitive computing</span> <span data-start="110.25" data-end="116.719">can solve are unlike any problems we have been able to try and work on before.</span> <span data-start="116.719" data-end="121.759">It's for working with human complex problems, so the type of problems that were normally</span> <span data-start="121.759" data-end="127.88">used to be solving in computer science are not really human complex problems, being problems</span> <span data-start="127.88" data-end="133">that really require a human to solve, usually things that can be solved with just maths</span> <span data-start="133" data-end="139.2">or just data analysis, but cognitive computing aims to be able to solve problems that otherwise</span> <span data-start="139.2" data-end="140.79">we wouldn't be able to do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="140.79" data-end="144.68">It does this by using machine learning and artificial intelligence.</span> <span data-start="144.68" data-end="149.77">So not a single path towards a cynical solution, but rather, single solution, but rather a</span> <span data-start="149.77" data-end="154.54">problem is tick solution to problems.</span> <span data-start="154.54" data-end="160.4">It's a very different way to thinking about computing than we are normally used to it.</span> <span data-start="160.4" data-end="168.41">It works with human natural input and output, so think instead of putting in numbers and</span> <span data-start="168.41" data-end="174.15">getting numbers back or putting in key word searches, think rather putting in long form</span> <span data-start="174.15" data-end="179.54">text, like whole webpages and being able to answer questions on whole webpages without</span> <span data-start="179.54" data-end="184.95">converting it into anything, or speaking into them computing and getting things back, or</span> <span data-start="184.95" data-end="192.19">having the computer understand audio, video or images and being able to output audio,</span> <span data-start="192.19" data-end="196.14">video ipages, other forms of long form text.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="196.14" data-end="199.91">This is the type of problem solving and the type of solutions we can do with cognitive</span> <span data-start="199.91" data-end="205.17">computing it's why it's the new type of computing and problem solving, I think it's really cool</span> <span data-start="205.17" data-end="210.79">and lends itself to new types of applications.</span> <span data-start="210.79" data-end="221.489">Yah, what does that mean, I bet you have all used a cognitive application, if not today,</span> <span data-start="221.489" data-end="222.569">recently.</span> <span data-start="222.569" data-end="233.75">Who here has used Google Now, or Siri, they are all cognitive applications, they are called</span> <span data-start="233.75" data-end="239.51">the personal assistant, it's one of the patterns that we find at Watson that people use all</span> <span data-start="239.51" data-end="241.05">the time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="241.05" data-end="244.67">Let's breakdown what that personal assistant cognitive application is.</span> <span data-start="244.67" data-end="250.15">It's speech in, speech gets transformed into text.</span> <span data-start="250.15" data-end="256.94">That text is then run through usually what we call a natural language classifier to figure</span> <span data-start="256.94" data-end="259.769">out what the subject of the</span> <span data-start="259.769" data-end="265.12">sentence is or the subject of the text is pool out the individual pieces, then runs</span> <span data-start="265.12" data-end="269.6">the business logic underneath it to figure out if you are talking about the weather and</span> <span data-start="269.6" data-end="276.13">you have your location, what is go and find the weather application, then runs a Speech-to-Text</span> <span data-start="276.13" data-end="280.19">to transform that into synthesized speech and tells you what it is, or if you are doing</span> <span data-start="280.19" data-end="286.61">a Google search or web search it will go and find what that is and possibly pull back here</span> <span data-start="286.61" data-end="292.8">are the results for you, or look in alpha and pull out the individual pieces, these</span> <span data-start="292.8" data-end="297.73">are all different types of speech input and then business logic and output.</span> <span data-start="297.73" data-end="302.56">So not everything inside of a cognitive application needs to be cognitive or fit the cognitive</span> <span data-start="302.56" data-end="309.041">paradigm the application as a whole becomes cognitive when we provide it, when we use</span> <span data-start="309.041" data-end="314.02">these types of cognitive input and output to work with it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="314.02" data-end="317.38">That's what I want — yeah.</span> <span data-start="317.38" data-end="321.78">So.. let's talk about, let's see what some of these examples are.</span> <span data-start="321.78" data-end="322.97">Let's play a little bit.</span> <span data-start="322.97" data-end="327.14">I like pepper dancing, pepper is fun.</span> <span data-start="327.14" data-end="333.22">So, the first application that we're going to talk about is this little thing that I</span> <span data-start="333.22" data-end="339.63">built, a little tiny Chrome extension, using Watson's text analysis tool.</span> <span data-start="339.63" data-end="346.7">What it does, it's a Chrome extension for Github, whereas you are typing it analyses</span> <span data-start="346.7" data-end="352.22">the speech that you, the actual long form text you are writing in the comment box if</span> <span data-start="352.22" data-end="356.97">it finds the text is negative, if the content of your text is negative, it switches the</span> <span data-start="356.97" data-end="365.17">comment submit button from green to red, if it becomes angry it disables the comment button,</span> <span data-start="365.17" data-end="366.65">right!</span> <span data-start="366.65" data-end="370.47">That's pretty fun!</span> <span data-start="370.47" data-end="373.72">\{Applause\}.</span> <span data-start="373.72" data-end="378.41">So it's also about this, one of the reasons why I'm talking to you about this, even though</span> <span data-start="378.41" data-end="383.5">you might be able, you might not think well this is probably really super expensive and</span> <span data-start="383.5" data-end="388.87">probably something that I get access to because I'm Watson, this is built with a single publicly</span> <span data-start="388.87" data-end="394.19">available API that you can go and use right now.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="394.19" data-end="399.7">Watson isn't the only group doing this, we happen to have a whole lot of cognitive APIs</span> <span data-start="399.7" data-end="406.03">that you can use right now by searching the Watson developer cloud, this is one called</span> <span data-start="406.03" data-end="413.19">tone analyser, what winds up happening here, as you type on key up, the Chrome extension</span> <span data-start="413.19" data-end="420.96">sends all of your text off to a little tiny server I made, that runs through tone analyser,</span> <span data-start="420.96" data-end="429.36">comes back and tone analyser splits your text into one of three different tones, happy,</span> <span data-start="429.36" data-end="432.22">negative or angry.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="432.22" data-end="438.78">If negative is one or above, I tell you that you probably shouldn't send that and if angry</span> <span data-start="438.78" data-end="441.43">is one or above I disable it.</span> <span data-start="441.43" data-end="445.509">Usually you are angry and negative, but you can be negative without being angry, that's</span> <span data-start="445.509" data-end="447.7">why it's kind of that three layer thing.</span> <span data-start="447.7" data-end="453.47">So this is the first type of cognitive application you can build.</span> <span data-start="453.47" data-end="457.2">The second one gets a little bit more complex.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="457.2" data-end="466.741">So, this is something I wrote called 'Babel Fish', those of you that don't know, it's</span> <span data-start="466.741" data-end="471.99">the weirdest thing in the universe, you put it in your ear and it translates all speech</span> <span data-start="471.99" data-end="480.25">into other speech, it's from hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, Watson as three, Speech-to-Text,</span> <span data-start="480.25" data-end="487.68">language translation API and text to speech API, when it's combined you can create a Babel</span> <span data-start="487.68" data-end="499.54">fish, I will use media to get text input, it will run through the Speech-to-Text algorithm,</span> <span data-start="499.54" data-end="506.21">it is then going to translate that text using text or language translation, then going to</span> <span data-start="506.21" data-end="508.13">spit it out in that native language.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="508.13" data-end="511.23">Unfortunate German isn't supported, but French is.</span> <span data-start="511.23" data-end="518.68">What I'm going to do is say English and go to go to French, I'm going to do it not on</span> <span data-start="518.68" data-end="519.68">my speaker</span> <span data-start="519.68" data-end="534.01">notes.. hello JSConf.</span> <span data-start="534.01" data-end="537.959">Live demos are always fun!</span> <span data-start="537.959" data-end="547.31">\{Laughter\} \{French\} close..!</span> <span data-start="547.31" data-end="550.43">\{Laughter\}.</span> <span data-start="550.43" data-end="553.55">\{Applause\}.</span> <span data-start="553.55" data-end="559.629">I guess JSConf isn't something that Speech-to-Text understands, so let's try something else.</span> <span data-start="559.629" data-end="583.139">'The breakfast this morning was fantastic'.. \{French\} that's a little bit better I think.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="583.139" data-end="589.55">What do the APIs look like under the hood, is the way that — what you get back from Speech-to-Text</span> <span data-start="589.55" data-end="591.6">is you get a confidence meter.</span> <span data-start="591.6" data-end="598.12">This is where cognitive applications sort of differ from normal APIs that you may wind</span> <span data-start="598.12" data-end="599.72">up working with.</span> <span data-start="599.72" data-end="608.459">Speech-to-Text is a little bit iffy it's working of probability, not confidence, you get the</span> <span data-start="608.459" data-end="616.5">translated text but you also get a confidence meter from 0 — 1, 0 to 100% basically.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="616.5" data-end="619.14">That is going to tell you how confident it is in your results.</span> <span data-start="619.14" data-end="624.72">The first one not so confident, this is pretty confident, this is more or less spot on.</span> <span data-start="624.72" data-end="628.23">Then language translation does a one-to-one translation.</span> <span data-start="628.23" data-end="634.3">Translation happened between different domains, you could have — right now there is a news</span> <span data-start="634.3" data-end="639.949">domain and a medical and a travel domain, but one of the great things about this is</span> <span data-start="639.949" data-end="645.72">because cognitive computing is based off of artificial intelligence and machine learning,</span> <span data-start="645.72" data-end="651.689">you can learn, you can train it, you can have it understand your specific domain, if you</span> <span data-start="651.689" data-end="657.529">wanted to create, let's say a food application, you could train these APIs, you can train</span> <span data-start="657.529" data-end="661.019">cognitive systems to understand the domain of food.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="661.019" data-end="669.68">So you don't have to know, necessarily, what a croissant is in English or French, you don't</span> <span data-start="669.68" data-end="675.48">have to know what the words are, but you are able to translate them by training the applications</span> <span data-start="675.48" data-end="680.35">with APIs I'm using a standard news domain.</span> <span data-start="680.35" data-end="687.439">Text to speech synth sizes text in one of a variety of different languages, that just</span> <span data-start="687.439" data-end="693.829">takes what ever text and goes straight off, so it's cognitive input, human natural input,</span> <span data-start="693.829" data-end="698.77">with language translation which is trainable to understand the different domains you are</span> <span data-start="698.77" data-end="709.689">working in, then text to speech, a human understandable output, it makes a new way of working and</span> <span data-start="709.689" data-end="718.79">interacting with your user, there are only really three APIs being used here.</span> <span data-start="718.79" data-end="728.23">The final bit that we have is a little bit more fun, it's cognitive computing.</span> <span data-start="728.23" data-end="734.95">So, the first example that we showed is something that you can build today with a single API,</span> <span data-start="734.95" data-end="743.699">it's a simple example of what cognitive computing can be, one API, one natural language text</span> <span data-start="743.699" data-end="747.54">input, goes off to server, comes back, you do stuff.</span> <span data-start="747.54" data-end="754.48">The second one a little bit more complex, three APIs being used, one turns speech into</span> <span data-start="754.48" data-end="758.23">text, then it does stuff in the back ground and gives you speech out.</span> <span data-start="758.23" data-end="763.309">Be able to hold full conversations with other people that you otherwise couldn't.</span> <span data-start="763.309" data-end="768.189">That's also available as three public APIs, this a little bit future state, it's available</span> <span data-start="768.189" data-end="776.449">now, just not as APIs, Watson is built on what we call Watson Discovery Advisor, it's</span> <span data-start="776.449" data-end="781.97">a system for understanding connections and being able to find connections between things</span> <span data-start="781.97" data-end="787.569">you wouldn't otherwise be able to see, in this case food.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="787.569" data-end="796.009">So what we have done here, we have ingested all of the recipes that bon appetite magazine</span> <span data-start="796.009" data-end="797.939">has written.</span> <span data-start="797.939" data-end="809.41">We have ingested all of thinkers, like artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning,</span> <span data-start="809.41" data-end="817.139">kind of do its thing on them, what you get out of this, you get food pairings or recipes</span> <span data-start="817.139" data-end="821.6">you wouldn't otherwise know or be able to see.</span> <span data-start="821.6" data-end="827.579">So one example of this, when we talk about food and we talk about cooking, normally the</span> <span data-start="827.579" data-end="834.269">food and the recipes that we have, those ingredients go together \{sirens outside\}, I guess the</span> <span data-start="834.269" data-end="836.269">police don't like me talking about food!</span> <span data-start="836.269" data-end="841.199">\{Laughter\} So food and recipes they generally go together and the ingredients in recipes</span> <span data-start="841.199" data-end="843.819">generally go together because they grow together.</span> <span data-start="843.819" data-end="846.79">They come from the same region of the world</span> <span data-start="846.79" data-end="854.67">but things like apples and olives don't grow in the same place but it turns out that when</span> <span data-start="854.67" data-end="860.269">you look at the types of recipes they are used in and their chemical compounds and how</span> <span data-start="860.269" data-end="864.819">other things relate to those 2 ingredients, apples and olives turn out to pair really</span> <span data-start="864.819" data-end="868.309">well together, even though it's something you would never think to pair together because</span> <span data-start="868.309" data-end="870.339">they don't grow together.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="870.339" data-end="875.509">What cognitive computing and what Chef Watson is able to do is able to find these underlying</span> <span data-start="875.509" data-end="876.509">connections.</span> <span data-start="876.509" data-end="882.81">It also have applications in other things, think law enforcement, we have this demo where</span> <span data-start="882.81" data-end="889.24">we ingested all of Wikipedia, and you ask it questions about Wikipedia like what are</span> <span data-start="889.24" data-end="892.839">the planets in the solar system it's able to actual what all the planets are with all</span> <span data-start="892.839" data-end="894.889">the evidence and all the confidence.</span> <span data-start="894.889" data-end="900.23">You can actually trace back all the evidence and all the different pieces that connect</span> <span data-start="900.23" data-end="905.23">together this is how cognitive computing is a bit different than normal key word search</span> <span data-start="905.23" data-end="908.79">you can actually see the full evidence tree of how got somewhere.</span> <span data-start="908.79" data-end="913.66">Let's build a recipe.</span> </p>
