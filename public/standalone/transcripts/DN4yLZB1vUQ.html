<p><span data-start="23.48" data-end="25.18">So yeah.</span> <span data-start="25.18" data-end="26.86">AGdubz on Twitter.</span> <span data-start="26.86" data-end="29.8">You might know me from some of the pool talks.</span> <span data-start="29.8" data-end="33.77">I don't work anywhere right now, so I'm going to introduce</span> <span data-start="33.77" data-end="36.54">myself as somebody who makes mistakes.</span> <span data-start="36.54" data-end="38.14">These things happen all the time.</span> <span data-start="38.14" data-end="42.55">And this talk, depending on how you think about it, could be about making</span> <span data-start="42.55" data-end="46.31">mistakes, but I'm not going to tread on this too much further.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="46.31" data-end="47.87">Some mistakes were made.</span> <span data-start="47.87" data-end="48.87">We understand.</span> <span data-start="48.87" data-end="50.44">But yeah.</span> <span data-start="50.44" data-end="52.039">Let's talk about cows in space, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="52.039" data-end="54.96">Because what is my talk even about?</span> <span data-start="54.96" data-end="56.21">I don't even know.</span> <span data-start="56.21" data-end="57.21">Cows in space.</span> <span data-start="57.21" data-end="60.02">Maybe that's not what we're here for.</span> <span data-start="60.02" data-end="61.55">We're here to talk about art.</span> <span data-start="61.55" data-end="62.55">Right?</span> <span data-start="62.55" data-end="64.699">This is some great art that I found on the internet.</span> <span data-start="64.699" data-end="65.699">Yeah, I know.</span> <span data-start="65.699" data-end="66.699">Bummer.</span> <span data-start="66.699" data-end="68.22">Got to talk about JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="68.22" data-end="69.47">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="69.47" data-end="72.35">We're going to talk actually a little bit about</span> <span data-start="72.35" data-end="77.62">ES6/2015, and I'm not going to say that whole thing every time, because I think</span> <span data-start="77.62" data-end="78.62">it's garbage.</span> <span data-start="78.62" data-end="82.12">I'm just going to say ES6, and if you think I'm wrong, I don't</span> <span data-start="82.12" data-end="84.83">really care.</span> <span data-start="84.83" data-end="86.18">So..</span> <span data-start="86.18" data-end="87.54">Anyways..</span> <span data-start="87.54" data-end="89.19">Let's talk about ES6.</span> <span data-start="89.19" data-end="93.94">But it's Ashley, so I'm going to have to talk about something else.</span> <span data-start="93.94" data-end="95.22">And the first thing that I really want to talk</span> <span data-start="95.22" data-end="97.42">to you about is abstraction.</span> <span data-start="97.42" data-end="98.42">Right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="98.42" data-end="102.45">And this wouldn't be a good computer talk if I wasn't going to talk some Dijkstra for</span> <span data-start="102.45" data-end="103.45">you.</span> <span data-start="103.45" data-end="108.09">So the effective exploitation of his powers of abstraction..</span> <span data-start="108.09" data-end="110.22">Bummer on the pronoun, I know..</span> <span data-start="110.22" data-end="113.35">Must be regarded as one of the most vital activities</span> <span data-start="113.35" data-end="115.12">of a competent programmer.</span> <span data-start="115.12" data-end="118.34">So when we're thinking about programming, when</span> <span data-start="118.34" data-end="124.48">we're really doing programming, the behavior that we're doing is abstracting.</span> <span data-start="124.48" data-end="125.48">And so..</span> <span data-start="125.48" data-end="126.48">Okay.</span> <span data-start="126.48" data-end="128.19">Abstract is a pretty abstract concept.</span> <span data-start="128.19" data-end="130.78">So let's talk about the abstraction principle.</span> <span data-start="130.78" data-end="133.39">And another really big tome, called types and</span> <span data-start="133.39" data-end="140.16">programming languages, Benjamin C Pierce defines it as..</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="140.16" data-end="143.239">Each significant piece of functionality in a program</span> <span data-start="143.239" data-end="147.269">should be implemented in just one place in the source code, where functions</span> <span data-start="147.269" data-end="152.569">are carried out by a distinct piece of code, it is generally beneficial to</span> <span data-start="152.569" data-end="156.56">combine them into one by abstracting out the varying parts.</span> <span data-start="156.56" data-end="159.67">This is something we all do in our daily lives, potentially</span> <span data-start="159.67" data-end="163.749">one of the things we find most satisfying when we program and can refactor</span> <span data-start="163.749" data-end="166.31">something into this one elegant function.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="166.31" data-end="167.73">And that's really, really excellent.</span> <span data-start="167.73" data-end="172.819">But I want us to understand abstraction on a theoretical level.</span> <span data-start="172.819" data-end="175.42">So in order to do the theoretical level part of abstraction,</span> <span data-start="175.42" data-end="178.15">I went to Wikipedia and got this.</span> <span data-start="178.15" data-end="182.06">So it's pretty good.</span> <span data-start="182.06" data-end="184.67">Details from a common pattern  —  the programs can</span> <span data-start="184.67" data-end="188.62">work close to the level of human thought.</span> <span data-start="188.62" data-end="194.379">Leaving out details which matter in practice but are immaterial to the problem</span> <span data-start="194.379" data-end="196.37">being solved.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="196.37" data-end="199.079">And this is something I want to flag for us.</span> <span data-start="199.079" data-end="202.23">The idea of something being immaterial to the problem</span> <span data-start="202.23" data-end="203.23">being solved.</span> <span data-start="203.23" data-end="206.139">We know as programmers that one of the big things we also do is</span> <span data-start="206.139" data-end="208.459">define the problem we're solving.</span> <span data-start="208.459" data-end="211.489">And so this is something that's kind of tying that in, and I want us just to kind</span> <span data-start="211.489" data-end="214.33">of flag that.</span> <span data-start="214.33" data-end="219.39">So I'm going to take us on another little adventure before I get to that whole</span> <span data-start="219.39" data-end="220.39">ES6 thing.</span> <span data-start="220.39" data-end="223.34">So I had the pleasure of working at the New York City Web</span> <span data-start="223.34" data-end="227.359">Development Fellowship in its flagship year, a boot camp program for people</span> <span data-start="227.359" data-end="231.889">who are unemployed or make very little money to take them from six months of</span> <span data-start="231.889" data-end="235.68">no programming experience to being a junior developer.</span> <span data-start="235.68" data-end="238.359">There are problems with some of these programs, but this one was awesome</span> <span data-start="238.359" data-end="241.04">and they were all there and there are students of mine in this audience</span> <span data-start="241.04" data-end="244.15">and I'm super proud I'm here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="244.15" data-end="248.389">One of the reasons I love teaching  —  some people are like  —  if you can, do.</span> <span data-start="248.389" data-end="249.529">If you can't, teach.</span> <span data-start="249.529" data-end="251.959">I think that's real garbage.</span> <span data-start="251.959" data-end="255.54">So when I say I teach beginners, beginners teach me, and a lot of</span> <span data-start="255.54" data-end="258.88">the lessons that are learned that I want to share with you in this talk are</span> <span data-start="258.88" data-end="261.68">from interfacing with beginners on a regular basis.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="261.68" data-end="262.78">All right.</span> <span data-start="262.78" data-end="264.92">So something that I learned when I was teaching is,</span> <span data-start="264.92" data-end="269.39">like, for beginners, iteration is really hard.</span> <span data-start="269.39" data-end="272.84">Right before I started, I was at this meetup, and the dean of the school</span> <span data-start="272.84" data-end="274.71">was giving a talk and he was like..</span> <span data-start="274.71" data-end="278.46">Hey, look at Ruby. Ruby is so awesome.</span> <span data-start="278.46" data-end="281.03">Even your mom could understand that Ruby array.</span> <span data-start="281.03" data-end="282.03">Sidebar..</span> <span data-start="282.03" data-end="283.59">Don't say that stuff.</span> <span data-start="283.59" data-end="285.139">Moms are smart and cool.</span> <span data-start="285.139" data-end="286.67">Don't be rude.</span> <span data-start="286.67" data-end="287.67">(applause)</span> <span data-start="287.67" data-end="288.67">Anyways..</span> <span data-start="288.67" data-end="290.24">So yeah, he was like..</span> <span data-start="290.24" data-end="292.28">Yeah, JavaScript, people don't understand JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="292.28" data-end="293.52">He didn't understand JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="293.52" data-end="294.56">So that was the problem.</span> <span data-start="294.56" data-end="298.62">But he has this point that's actually kind of core and really cool.</span> <span data-start="298.62" data-end="302.71">So you might recognize these excellent hand gesture people  —  Abelson and</span> <span data-start="302.71" data-end="303.71">Sussman.</span> <span data-start="303.71" data-end="305.37">They wrote a book we'll talk about later.</span> <span data-start="305.37" data-end="309.669">But what they say in that book is programs must be written for people</span> <span data-start="309.669" data-end="314.65">to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</span> <span data-start="314.65" data-end="316.72">And this is a really big point.</span> <span data-start="316.72" data-end="318.78">People write programs.</span> <span data-start="318.78" data-end="320.18">People read programs.</span> <span data-start="320.18" data-end="321.78">The computers do stuff over there.</span> <span data-start="321.78" data-end="322.78">All right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="322.78" data-end="324.77">We're really here to program for people.</span> <span data-start="324.77" data-end="326.16">And that's something that we need to remember.</span> <span data-start="326.16" data-end="330.77">But there's a little bit of a trick here, because what does it mean to write programs</span> <span data-start="330.77" data-end="333.419">for people to read?</span> <span data-start="333.419" data-end="337.039">People really struggle with instructions sometimes.</span> <span data-start="337.039" data-end="339.01">This is a picture of my door.</span> <span data-start="339.01" data-end="340.84">In my cool ranch.</span> <span data-start="340.84" data-end="342">Anyways, yeah.</span> <span data-start="342" data-end="343.96">So this is a struggle, sometimes.</span> <span data-start="343.96" data-end="344.96">What does it mean?</span> <span data-start="344.96" data-end="348.46">We don't really know what level of abstraction</span> <span data-start="348.46" data-end="349.87">is good for people to read.</span> <span data-start="349.87" data-end="353.139">All right, so we go back into iteration is hard.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="353.139" data-end="355.12">And this is, like, a really neat lesson.</span> <span data-start="355.12" data-end="356.47">So this array.each..</span> <span data-start="356.47" data-end="359.47">Like, I had this sinking feeling about it.</span> <span data-start="359.47" data-end="361.36">Saying  —  yeah, people can read it.</span> <span data-start="361.36" data-end="362.37">Ruby is great.</span> <span data-start="362.37" data-end="366.58">Interestingly enough, written in English by a Japanese person.</span> <span data-start="366.58" data-end="367.58">Anyways..</span> <span data-start="367.58" data-end="368.599">So yeah, I was like  —  okay.</span> <span data-start="368.599" data-end="369.77">This is not working.</span> <span data-start="369.77" data-end="371.55">Everyone is having a lot of trouble with iteration.</span> <span data-start="371.55" data-end="373.039">This is supposed to be easy.</span> <span data-start="373.039" data-end="374.039">What's going on?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="374.039" data-end="378.069">So I'm sitting at my desk one day and my code teacher, Blake, is teaching</span> <span data-start="378.069" data-end="383.05">iteration in Ruby to the group for the first time and I'm listening in and it's</span> <span data-start="383.05" data-end="384.15">not going well.</span> <span data-start="384.15" data-end="385.289">It's just not working.</span> <span data-start="385.289" data-end="387.039">And it's not because Blake's a bad teacher.</span> <span data-start="387.039" data-end="388.15">Blake is awesome.</span> <span data-start="388.15" data-end="390.55">But I hear this and I'm like..</span> <span data-start="390.55" data-end="391.89">I really should jump in.</span> <span data-start="391.89" data-end="393.289">What am I going to?</span> <span data-start="393.289" data-end="394.34">And I did something kind of bold.</span> <span data-start="394.34" data-end="395.34">Which..</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="395.34" data-end="397.13">If anyone knows me, isn't out of character.</span> <span data-start="397.13" data-end="401.139">I was like  —  I'm going to hijack this class.</span> <span data-start="401.139" data-end="403.79">And so I walk into the class and I'm like  —  hey, guys.</span> <span data-start="403.79" data-end="405.66">I have an idea.</span> <span data-start="405.66" data-end="407.84">And I'm not sure it will work.</span> <span data-start="407.84" data-end="409.509">But I have an inkling that it might.</span> <span data-start="409.509" data-end="413.479">And what I would like to do is I would like you to throw away all the Ruby</span> <span data-start="413.479" data-end="417.69">you just learned, and I just want to teach you iteration in a language that you</span> <span data-start="417.69" data-end="419.07">don't know.</span> <span data-start="419.07" data-end="420.22">And I think it's going to work.</span> <span data-start="420.22" data-end="421.22">You'll understand.</span> <span data-start="421.22" data-end="422.31">And people are like  —  that does not sound like a</span> <span data-start="422.31" data-end="423.31">good idea.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="423.31" data-end="426.27">I'm like  —  no, no Ruby here.</span> <span data-start="426.27" data-end="427.53">However..</span> <span data-start="427.53" data-end="430.49">JavaScript was awesome for teaching iteration.</span> <span data-start="430.49" data-end="433.349">Because it expressed the underlying concepts.</span> <span data-start="433.349" data-end="437.21">If we look at it here, I know all of us maybe don't like writing</span> <span data-start="437.21" data-end="438.229">all this syntax out.</span> <span data-start="438.229" data-end="439.819">I'll get to that later.</span> <span data-start="439.819" data-end="440.819">But..</span> <span data-start="440.819" data-end="443.46">When we understand iteration, it's state..</span> <span data-start="443.46" data-end="444.46">Condition..</span> <span data-start="444.46" data-end="445.789">Increment.</span> <span data-start="445.789" data-end="446.789">I see it right there.</span> <span data-start="446.789" data-end="447.789">But in that Ruby..</span> <span data-start="447.789" data-end="448.789">It's not.</span> </p>
