<p><span data-start="12.929" data-end="15.48">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="15.48" data-end="16.76">GraphQL.</span> <span data-start="16.76" data-end="20.369">You might have heard of it by now, and, if you have, you've heard about how to it's great</span> <span data-start="20.369" data-end="27.66">for performance, backwards compatibility, and great for those hard to get out stains!</span> <span data-start="27.66" data-end="29.2">Probably!</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="29.2" data-end="31.24">There's seemingly nothing it can't do.</span> <span data-start="31.24" data-end="33.73">But have you wondered how?</span> <span data-start="33.73" data-end="36.93">How can GraphQL have these supposed superpowers?</span> <span data-start="36.93" data-end="41.16">I think the key to this lays in its basic building blocks.</span> <span data-start="41.16" data-end="46.079">In this talk, we will start off by taking a look at the schema definition language,</span> <span data-start="46.079" data-end="51.54">RSL, and the resolvers, and understand how they work together to execute a query.</span> <span data-start="51.54" data-end="57.63">Then I will show ways to use these features to graph all the things before finally entering</span> <span data-start="57.63" data-end="60.61">the "don't try this at home" portion of the talk.</span> <span data-start="60.61" data-end="69.32">First, g, the ' day, how is it going?</span> <span data-start="69.32" data-end="74.939">We work on building tooling services and platforms to enable at Red Bubble.</span> <span data-start="74.939" data-end="82.68">I'm the maintainer of Lis Sass and notes Sass.</span> <span data-start="82.68" data-end="84.29">So let's jump right into it.</span> <span data-start="84.29" data-end="86.75">The schema is the skeleton of GraphQL.</span> <span data-start="86.75" data-end="87.8">It's what gives it its shape.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="87.8" data-end="91.45">Everything else builds on top of or happens because of the schema.</span> <span data-start="91.45" data-end="94.979">It is defined using the schema definition language.</span> <span data-start="94.979" data-end="98.28">We are we have an example schema.</span> <span data-start="98.28" data-end="103.34">We're using "type" to define conference.</span> <span data-start="103.34" data-end="106.85">Our conference type is a name field which we set as a string.</span> <span data-start="106.85" data-end="111.63">String is one of the skeletypes, in graph, and others like ints, floats, and booleans</span> <span data-start="111.63" data-end="114.76">and the other suspects.</span> <span data-start="114.76" data-end="120.49">We have a speakers' field which has an array of the speaker type.</span> <span data-start="120.49" data-end="123.74">It's not a built-in type, so we define it ourselves.</span> <span data-start="123.74" data-end="126.89">Our speaker has a name and a favourite emoji.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="126.89" data-end="132.29">This gives me licence to use member throughout the talk!</span> <span data-start="132.29" data-end="134.65">We have some fields with exclamation marks and others don't.</span> <span data-start="134.65" data-end="139.069">It means a field is omitted but still valid.</span> <span data-start="139.069" data-end="145.939">IDs are convenient for querying and mutating data.</span> <span data-start="145.939" data-end="153.359">Speaking of querying and mutating data, we have the query types called root types.</span> <span data-start="153.359" data-end="156.169">There are others too but we're not going to talk about them today.</span> <span data-start="156.169" data-end="160.73">On our query type, we have a conference field that returns any conferences we know about.</span> <span data-start="160.73" data-end="167.78">We also have a speaker's field that has a required emoji argument and returns some speakers.</span> <span data-start="167.78" data-end="168.819">We have a mutation type.</span> <span data-start="168.819" data-end="173.4">It has a speak field, that takes a speaker ID and a Conference ID.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="173.4" data-end="178.519">Something to note, it's common to refer to fields on query mutation types.</span> <span data-start="178.519" data-end="185.42">You see return-type mutation looks like the return type of a query field.</span> <span data-start="185.42" data-end="190.78">A field on a mutation could return things like booleans but as richer types as part</span> <span data-start="190.78" data-end="192.809">of the expressiveness of GraphQL.</span> <span data-start="192.809" data-end="198.5">There is some detail as to how these are defined that we won't go into today.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="198.5" data-end="202.12">The important thing to take away from this is the field in the query type to ask for</span> <span data-start="202.12" data-end="205.909">information whereas fields and mutation type typically change things.</span> <span data-start="205.909" data-end="213.28">Lastly, the resulting data from mutation can be expected to have the changes already applied.</span> <span data-start="213.28" data-end="217.109">The schemas are the skeletons of GraphQL and at their beating heart.</span> <span data-start="217.109" data-end="218.9">They bring life to GraphQL.</span> <span data-start="218.9" data-end="223.739">With the amazing things that GraphQL can do, you would think they would be pretty complicated,</span> <span data-start="223.739" data-end="228.499">but it's the simplicity of resolvers that is the key to their flexibility.</span> <span data-start="228.499" data-end="229.779">It's just a function.</span> <span data-start="229.779" data-end="231.42">It takes a couple of arguments.</span> <span data-start="231.42" data-end="235.069">We're going to talk about these three today, but there are others.</span> <span data-start="235.069" data-end="240.43">You can define a resolver or any or all fields on your schema, including fields in the query</span> <span data-start="240.43" data-end="248.109">type, the speak field, and fields on any type like the emoji field on the speaker type.</span> <span data-start="248.109" data-end="252.209">Inside a resolver, you can do anything it could do in any other JavaScript function.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="252.209" data-end="256.199">The only requirement is that it returns of value in the shape that matches the type of</span> <span data-start="256.199" data-end="260.389">the field that it is responsible for.</span> <span data-start="260.389" data-end="261.64">Here we have a map of resolvers.</span> <span data-start="261.64" data-end="266.09">It has a query object representing the query type.</span> <span data-start="266.09" data-end="270.08">And a query object, there is a speaker's resolver.</span> <span data-start="270.08" data-end="272.59">A speaker's query has an emoji argument.</span> <span data-start="272.59" data-end="277.33">We can access that argument by the name on the arc's argument on its resolver.</span> <span data-start="277.33" data-end="283.73">We know from our schema that the query should returning the or an array of speaker types.</span> <span data-start="283.73" data-end="290.36">Here it's returning an array of objects which have an integer ID field and a name and an</span> <span data-start="290.36" data-end="295.36">emoji string field which means they match the expected shape of the query and all is</span> <span data-start="295.36" data-end="296.36">well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="296.36" data-end="302.49">Remember, the conference field doesn't have an exclamation mark so it's entirely optional</span> <span data-start="302.49" data-end="303.49">here.</span> <span data-start="303.49" data-end="311.25">Our speaker mutation — here we have a speaker mutation loading data from the context by</span> <span data-start="311.25" data-end="313.79">the conference ID argument.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="313.79" data-end="317.08">Conference is a bit special.</span> <span data-start="317.08" data-end="322.159">It makes it useful for storing things like configuration or services like database connections.</span> <span data-start="322.159" data-end="328.219">After it is loaded, the speaker ID argument is appended to the conference object, the</span> <span data-start="328.219" data-end="336.449">- finally does a query for the conferences that the speaker is attending.</span> <span data-start="336.449" data-end="337.449">So that was a lot.</span> <span data-start="337.449" data-end="339.939">But it is just a groundwork for what is coming up next.</span> <span data-start="339.939" data-end="345.379">We're going to take a look at practical use of resolvers to feel how they work together</span> <span data-start="345.379" data-end="349.57">and give you the versatility of GraphQL.</span> <span data-start="349.57" data-end="351.81">The simplest resolver is one that returns an object.</span> <span data-start="351.81" data-end="356.199">Earlier, we saw a resolver and all good because it returned a resolver that matched the shape</span> <span data-start="356.199" data-end="361.5">of the speaker type before how does GraphQL match the speaker shape?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="361.5" data-end="365.639">Is there some kind of internal validation engine or some form of intro expect on their</span> <span data-start="365.639" data-end="367.37">return type or AI?</span> <span data-start="367.37" data-end="370.069">GraphQL can do these magical things.</span> <span data-start="370.069" data-end="372.41">Why not build AI in there?</span> <span data-start="372.41" data-end="376.509">No doubt there is a way to return these types.</span> <span data-start="376.509" data-end="381.069">If you're like me, you're thinking about how you would have done it yourself.</span> <span data-start="381.069" data-end="383.569">I've shown you how it happens.</span> <span data-start="383.569" data-end="387.53">Every field from GraphQL gets a default resolver.</span> <span data-start="387.53" data-end="389.919">The default resolver is straightforward.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="389.919" data-end="394.979">For any field, it takes the object, the parent object and tries to be the access a field</span> <span data-start="394.979" data-end="398.43">as a function call, or an object property on the parent.</span> <span data-start="398.43" data-end="404.13">Importantly, this happens recursively, so, if a field returns a type, the field's return</span> <span data-start="404.13" data-end="409.24">type is a custom type, then all the fields on that type have their resolvers called.</span> <span data-start="409.24" data-end="411.74">This is what happens in our case.</span> <span data-start="411.74" data-end="415.87">The schema for our speaker's query returns return type to a null or an array of speaker</span> <span data-start="415.87" data-end="417.69">type.</span> <span data-start="417.69" data-end="419.35">GraphQL takes the speaker value.</span> <span data-start="419.35" data-end="421.72">If it is null, it's returned.</span> <span data-start="421.72" data-end="425.49">If it is an array, the value is iterated over and a resolver default is called for each</span> <span data-start="425.49" data-end="427.8">speaker field.</span> <span data-start="427.8" data-end="432.569">The parent armed for the resolver is the object at the current loop of the array.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="432.569" data-end="437.02">If a resolver for a field returns the wrong time, GraphQL throws an error.</span> <span data-start="437.02" data-end="442.509">Also, if the return type of the initial speaker's query isn't null or an array, we also get</span> <span data-start="442.509" data-end="443.509">an error.</span> <span data-start="443.509" data-end="448.61">The default resolver is a great example of how we use building blocks to solve tricky</span> <span data-start="448.61" data-end="450.719">problems like validation.</span> <span data-start="450.719" data-end="457.15">So, a common use case for GraphQL is putting it in front of existing APIs.</span> <span data-start="457.15" data-end="461.099">This really its bread and butter and what gave it momentum to start off with.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="461.099" data-end="463.33">Even here, there are interesting possibilities.</span> <span data-start="463.33" data-end="468.54">Here, I've updated our speaker query to make an HTTP request instead of returning a hard-coded</span> <span data-start="468.54" data-end="471.77">API.</span> <span data-start="471.77" data-end="474.58">The schema could have different types.</span> <span data-start="474.58" data-end="482.71">In this case, you iterate over the JSON and transform it to the phenotype you expect.</span> <span data-start="482.71" data-end="486.61">Once again, we've added the conference resolver to the speaker type.</span> <span data-start="486.61" data-end="489.469">There are a couple of interesting things happening here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="489.469" data-end="492.27">Firstly, using both jQuery and fetch.</span> <span data-start="492.27" data-end="493.849">Because, why wouldn't you?</span> <span data-start="493.849" data-end="498.122">You have the entire power of JavaScript and MPM at our resolvers, so we might as well</span> <span data-start="498.122" data-end="500.43">use it all.</span> <span data-start="500.43" data-end="508.73">We are iterating over the array of speakers, and for each of those speakers, the conference</span> <span data-start="508.73" data-end="511.5">resolver has called from an entirely different API.</span> <span data-start="511.5" data-end="517.5">Here, GraphQL's essentially aggregating across multiple APIs in order to resolve a single</span> <span data-start="517.5" data-end="518.5">query.</span> <span data-start="518.5" data-end="522.06">The remaining queries are resolved using a default resolver.</span> <span data-start="522.06" data-end="525.38">You can have a resolver with any or all fields.</span> <span data-start="525.38" data-end="532.18">You can resolve all fields by its own API and users wouldn't be any the wiser.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="532.18" data-end="537.8">I'm not saying you should do this but you could if you wanted to.</span> <span data-start="537.8" data-end="541.649">GraphQL got a lot of attention early on because of how well it worked as a facade on top of</span> <span data-start="541.649" data-end="547.17">these fragmented APIs which often had incompatible methods of authentication, different transport</span> <span data-start="547.17" data-end="550.17">types or content types.</span> <span data-start="550.17" data-end="556.93">We can expose a single interface over — you have, APIs, without having to rewrite any</span> <span data-start="556.93" data-end="557.93">of them.</span> <span data-start="557.93" data-end="562.55">It wasn't long before people start rescinding these ideas, sometimes cutting out the APIs</span> <span data-start="562.55" data-end="565.05">altogether and going straight to the database.</span> <span data-start="565.05" data-end="569.29">Some truly innovative people have gone as far as defining the schemas themselves in</span> <span data-start="569.29" data-end="571.88">a different language.</span> <span data-start="571.88" data-end="577.81">Here, we are resolving a speaker query by making a -gate query.</span> <span data-start="577.81" data-end="587.53">We are pulling the database operation — we set this up earlier.</span> <span data-start="587.53" data-end="591.209">Because you have the full power of JavaScript to get a disposal here, you can do all the</span> <span data-start="591.209" data-end="597.66">things you would do in an attractional RM, like read or write instances, whatever the</span> <span data-start="597.66" data-end="599.79">requirements of that field might be.</span> <span data-start="599.79" data-end="605.73">If you can use a database, there's no reason you can't use any other kind of of data store.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="605.73" data-end="611.51">Here, we are mixing and matching between relation al databases, elastic searches, at the field</span> <span data-start="611.51" data-end="612.51">resolver level.</span> <span data-start="612.51" data-end="617.44">Being able to make these choices at the field resolver levels allows us to fit best-fit</span> <span data-start="617.44" data-end="621.68">solutions for the requirements of an individual field and changes of requirements over time</span> <span data-start="621.68" data-end="623">as our systems change.</span> <span data-start="623" data-end="628.29">By no means saying this is unique to GraphQL, simply aiming to illustrate the ease as which</span> <span data-start="628.29" data-end="634.29">these capabilities are achieved between — within the play between schemas and resolvers within</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="634.29" data-end="635.29">GraphQL.</span> <span data-start="635.29" data-end="637.88">This is actually my favourite use case.</span> <span data-start="637.88" data-end="642.63">I said earlier that the platform team is a bubble, we focus on enabling everyone, not</span> <span data-start="642.63" data-end="643.63">just engineers.</span> <span data-start="643.63" data-end="648.04">The way we do this is let people bring their own tools and adapt our systems to work with</span> <span data-start="648.04" data-end="649.62">them.</span> <span data-start="649.62" data-end="651.28">Enter spreadsheets.</span> <span data-start="651.28" data-end="656.26">Who doesn't love a good spreadsheet in I know I do, our copy writers do, our data scientists</span> <span data-start="656.26" data-end="657.8">do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="657.8" data-end="663.279">They're practically ubiquitous and this makes them a powerful tool for enabling and encouraging</span> <span data-start="663.279" data-end="665.5">contributions.</span> <span data-start="665.5" data-end="668.889">Spreadsheets are fantastic for GraphQL because they are already structured.</span> <span data-start="668.889" data-end="673.49">They come with their own schemas in the form of columns and rows.</span> <span data-start="673.49" data-end="683.389">Here our speaker's query is loading it from disk, filtering the speakers to knows matching</span> <span data-start="683.389" data-end="686.04">the emoji we passed them as a query alter.</span> <span data-start="686.04" data-end="691.949">Now, anyone in our organisation can drag and drop a new spreadsheet on the GitHub UI.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="892.87" data-end="897.1">I think there are a couple of good reasons for this.</span> <span data-start="897.1" data-end="901.43">We live in a world of heavy browser feature fragmentation, and even when those features</span> <span data-start="901.43" data-end="906.74">exist, like the rolled out in a progressive manner, with API fragmentation in those features.</span> <span data-start="906.74" data-end="912.889">There's the complexities of dealing with progressive enhance the and degradation because it's fun.</span> <span data-start="912.889" data-end="917.279">Admittedly, I did if for the fun, but there's something valuable in the idea of the interface</span> <span data-start="917.279" data-end="919.209">across all our web languages.</span> <span data-start="919.209" data-end="923.24">Let's look at some examples.</span> <span data-start="923.24" data-end="928.829">We've looked at how we use resolvers to interact with data stores, but the browser has a bunch</span> <span data-start="928.829" data-end="929.829">of its own data stores.</span> <span data-start="929.829" data-end="935.98">We have the web storage APIs in local storage and session storage, web SQL databases, and</span> <span data-start="935.98" data-end="936.98">cookies.</span> <span data-start="936.98" data-end="942.48">With a bit of creativity, you can stuff any kind of data inside a URL.</span> <span data-start="942.48" data-end="947.04">There's a handful of libraries that do this for us acting as an interface across a buffer</span> <span data-start="947.04" data-end="955.35">of these storage engines with using a mix of feature detection or polyfills.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="955.35" data-end="957.6">And so abstracting over data source is something that GraphQL is already good at.</span> <span data-start="957.6" data-end="960.24">It's a really great fit for the scenario.</span> <span data-start="960.24" data-end="964.5">We are, we've taken the spreadsheet consolidate from earlier, but reading a file off disk</span> <span data-start="964.5" data-end="969.779">we're using it as an abstraction over various browser storage APIs.</span> <span data-start="969.779" data-end="974.529">Libraries will progressively enhance or degrade, depending on which APIs are available in the</span> <span data-start="974.529" data-end="977.59">current environment.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="977.59" data-end="981.319">More importantly, the user APIs don't get to juggle all the different APIs themselves</span> <span data-start="981.319" data-end="984.17">or learn a whole new third-party API.</span> <span data-start="984.17" data-end="988.519">They're just looking at the schema for the types required and executing queries and mutations</span> <span data-start="988.519" data-end="992.269">as they already know how to on server.</span> <span data-start="992.269" data-end="998.069">Just like on the server, a browser has equally capable of making network requests to APIs.</span> <span data-start="998.069" data-end="1002.63">Just like on the server, we can call it working APIs within the resolvers.</span> <span data-start="1002.63" data-end="1008.33">Just like — we can gratefully degrade depending on what is available in the operating environment.</span> <span data-start="1008.33" data-end="1013.66">And that, my friends, is running GraphQL in the browser.</span> <span data-start="1013.66" data-end="1016.089">I think that's pretty cool.</span> <span data-start="1016.089" data-end="1017.269">So I thought I would end it here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1017.269" data-end="1021.689">Like, in many ways, browser JS isn't different from the server side JS.</span> <span data-start="1021.689" data-end="1027.089">It's not surprising they're able to use GraphQL as an abstraction layer over finicky APIs.</span> <span data-start="1027.089" data-end="1030.47">There's something unique to the browser.</span> <span data-start="1030.47" data-end="1034.22">Does GraphQL still hold up in this new world?</span> <span data-start="1034.22" data-end="1036.68">For example, our good old buddy, the DOM.</span> <span data-start="1036.68" data-end="1039.3">DOM libraries are nothing new.</span> <span data-start="1039.3" data-end="1042.64">Some started our JavaScript journeys with DOJO.</span> <span data-start="1042.64" data-end="1055.09">Even new, like, in React — here is an example of what a schema might look like for document</span> <span data-start="1055.09" data-end="1056.29">query selector.</span> <span data-start="1056.29" data-end="1059.4">All the dollar-sign functions in jQuery.</span> <span data-start="1059.4" data-end="1063.44">And this is what the resolvers might look like.</span> <span data-start="1063.44" data-end="1067.82">We have a document query to get to our document object and the document type has APIs we care</span> <span data-start="1067.82" data-end="1069.32">about and fields.</span> </p>
