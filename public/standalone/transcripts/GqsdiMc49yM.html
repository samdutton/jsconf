<p><span data-start="20.87" data-end="24.8">By the way, I have a lot of resources to go along with this talk.</span> <span data-start="24.8" data-end="27.539">You can find it at the URL at the bottom of this slide.</span> <span data-start="27.539" data-end="30.73">And don't worry, this URL will also be on the side of most of the other slides in the</span> <span data-start="30.73" data-end="31.98">presentation.</span> <span data-start="31.98" data-end="36.87">So, like LED art is something that I find really fascinating in a lot of ways.</span> <span data-start="36.87" data-end="41.989">Because it really is a hybrid of technologies, specifically technology that we already tend</span> <span data-start="41.989" data-end="45.06">to know, and art.</span> <span data-start="45.06" data-end="49.4">And I think there's a lot of misconceptions about what art really is.</span> <span data-start="49.4" data-end="53.3">We tend to think of it as this world that's just completely separate from technology.</span> <span data-start="53.3" data-end="57.11">We kind of view them as having no overlap whatsoever.</span> <span data-start="57.11" data-end="58.11">But I don't think that's true.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="58.11" data-end="60.28">I think there's actually quite a bit of overlap.</span> <span data-start="60.28" data-end="65.661">Because when we really dig into it, art is quite technical, when you look at it.</span> <span data-start="65.661" data-end="67.26">We just don't see or think of that.</span> <span data-start="67.26" data-end="70.13">But it really is.</span> <span data-start="70.13" data-end="73.64">For example, have you ever looked at how paints actually work?</span> <span data-start="73.64" data-end="78.63">We ought to think of painting as one of the sort of classic arts and we think of it as</span> <span data-start="78.63" data-end="79.78">an artistic medium.</span> <span data-start="79.78" data-end="83.67">When we look at how paints work, they are deeply technical.</span> <span data-start="83.67" data-end="89.09">There are all sorts of different types of paints that have different effects, cure differently,</span> <span data-start="89.09" data-end="91.71">different textures, different material properties.</span> <span data-start="91.71" data-end="94.7">There's different ways you can mix them, different ways they age.</span> <span data-start="94.7" data-end="96.55">There's science behind paint.</span> <span data-start="96.55" data-end="99.29">There's a lot of technology behind paints.</span> <span data-start="99.29" data-end="102.02">And this is true of most art that's out there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="102.02" data-end="103.58">There's quite a bit of technology.</span> <span data-start="103.58" data-end="106.3">People who create art are really good at their craft.</span> <span data-start="106.3" data-end="110.46">They're really good at the technology of their arts.</span> <span data-start="110.46" data-end="111.96">But there's still a difference.</span> <span data-start="111.96" data-end="115.7">We do classify these as different things for a reason.</span> <span data-start="115.7" data-end="118.06">So, why is that?</span> <span data-start="118.06" data-end="121.531">So, the question of what is art, how do we define art?</span> <span data-start="121.531" data-end="125.09">That's one of those questions that's sort of puzzled philosophers for pretty much all</span> <span data-start="125.09" data-end="126.67">of human history.</span> <span data-start="126.67" data-end="131.33">And I don't have toï£° claim to have an answer to that question in its entirety.</span> <span data-start="131.33" data-end="136.46">But I do have one small claim to make to sort of get at the edges.</span> <span data-start="136.46" data-end="142.55">What I would say about art is that we create art by using technology to express emotional</span> <span data-start="142.55" data-end="144.36">truth.</span> <span data-start="144.36" data-end="147.81">And this is what separates art from the typical ways that we use technology.</span> <span data-start="147.81" data-end="149.69">And what we think of as technology.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="149.69" data-end="155.03">Because in the case of technology, or in our case what we think of as technology is really</span> <span data-start="155.03" data-end="156.52">we're thinking about products.</span> <span data-start="156.52" data-end="162.31">We're thinking about using technology to create a product, usually with the intention of generating</span> <span data-start="162.31" data-end="163.31">a profit.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="163.31" data-end="170.58">Or perhaps with users in theory, some magic Silicon Valley math generates revenue.</span> <span data-start="170.58" data-end="173.67">But we have a concept of revenue at the end of the day that drives it.</span> <span data-start="173.67" data-end="177.59">And with art, there really isn't that concept.</span> <span data-start="177.59" data-end="178.79">Our business is a weird thing.</span> <span data-start="178.79" data-end="180.57">We're going to set that aside for a moment.</span> <span data-start="180.57" data-end="183.05">But with art, we're not trying to create revenue.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="183.05" data-end="184.36">That's not our intention.</span> <span data-start="184.36" data-end="189.54">Our intention is to express truth about ourselves or the society or the world.</span> <span data-start="189.54" data-end="192.76">It's kind of an inward look and taking it out.</span> <span data-start="192.76" data-end="200.49">And we express this outside for what is inside of ourselves.</span> <span data-start="200.49" data-end="203.26">The way we do that, we first have to master our craft.</span> <span data-start="203.26" data-end="205.7">We have to understand the basics of what we do.</span> <span data-start="205.7" data-end="212.06">And for LED art specific, like this piece here, there's some technology that goes behind</span> <span data-start="212.06" data-end="213.35">it.</span> <span data-start="213.35" data-end="216.53">And so, the first thing I want to talk about, I want to talk about how we can create visualizations</span> <span data-start="216.53" data-end="218.2">that look kind of like this.</span> <span data-start="218.2" data-end="220.35">And we have to start by talking about color.</span> <span data-start="220.35" data-end="221.54">And color spaces.</span> <span data-start="221.54" data-end="226.35">And specifically I want to talk about the HSV color space.</span> <span data-start="226.35" data-end="232.13">Which is the hue saturation value is what the acronym stands for, color space.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="232.13" data-end="237.33">This is very similar to one you might have seen on the web, HSL, hue saturation luminous.</span> <span data-start="237.33" data-end="242.599">They're almost the same, there's a tiny difference to them.</span> <span data-start="242.599" data-end="247.2">But this is pretty important for understanding color and especially for doing art with it.</span> <span data-start="247.2" data-end="251.42">And to explain why we need this, first let's talk about RGB.</span> <span data-start="251.42" data-end="254.07">We all know what RGB is, red green blue.</span> <span data-start="254.07" data-end="259.61">We express it in the space in terms of how much red is in it, how much green and how</span> <span data-start="259.61" data-end="264.1">much blue and they add together to create color.</span> <span data-start="264.1" data-end="270.85">We use this model because RGB is mechanically how we create color and work with color with</span> <span data-start="270.85" data-end="272.31">various visual devices.</span> <span data-start="272.31" data-end="278.15">So, for example, with these LEDs, the way we create a specific color and hue is actually</span> <span data-start="278.15" data-end="281.52">three LEDs embedded in it, red, green and blue.</span> <span data-start="281.52" data-end="285.52">And we change how bright those three are to create any color.</span> <span data-start="285.52" data-end="291.27">Same with LED screens, projectors and anything we can think that have creates a visual device.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="291.27" data-end="295.9">In fact the oldest RGB device is our eyes themselves.</span> <span data-start="295.9" data-end="299.3">We have three nerves that are light sensitive.</span> <span data-start="299.3" data-end="303.43">And specifically sensitive to relatively narrow ranges of light.</span> <span data-start="303.43" data-end="306.38">One towards green, one towards red, one towards blue.</span> <span data-start="306.38" data-end="308.68">RGB isï£°very important.</span> <span data-start="308.68" data-end="312.93">We user it for color production and color sensing, it's a mechanical thing.</span> <span data-start="312.93" data-end="315.96">But it's not how we think about color.</span> <span data-start="315.96" data-end="317.41">We look at my pants.</span> <span data-start="317.41" data-end="321.21">I don't look at this and see equal amounts of red, green and blue.</span> <span data-start="321.21" data-end="322.43">That's not what I'm thinking.</span> <span data-start="322.43" data-end="324.06">I see white.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="324.06" data-end="325.31">Right?</span> <span data-start="325.31" data-end="328.23">We don't think in terms of color of RGB.</span> <span data-start="328.23" data-end="330.82">This is where HSV is really, really useful.</span> <span data-start="330.82" data-end="334.87">Because HSV expresses how we think about color.</span> <span data-start="334.87" data-end="338.41">So, to illustrate that, let's talk about it a little bit.</span> <span data-start="338.41" data-end="340.5">Let's talk about hue first.</span> <span data-start="340.5" data-end="345.84">So, hue is kind of like the base color in a lot of ways.</span> <span data-start="345.84" data-end="348.56">We measure this in degrees from zero to 360.</span> <span data-start="348.56" data-end="352.139">There's mathematical reasons, graphs, coordinates, whatever.</span> <span data-start="352.139" data-end="354.09">We're not going to talk about that.</span> <span data-start="354.09" data-end="358.81">This represents sort of the spectrum of color and spectrums.</span> <span data-start="358.81" data-end="367.479">The color there is are similar to the colors from the hue here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="367.479" data-end="368.8">Same thing with a rainbow.</span> <span data-start="368.8" data-end="371.46">We can start at zero degrees.</span> <span data-start="371.46" data-end="375.14">And at 360 degrees, by the way, same as zero degrees, circle.</span> <span data-start="375.14" data-end="376.77">And we get a red color.</span> <span data-start="376.77" data-end="382.87">But then we go in and shift the hue around a little bit and we can see the color changes.</span> <span data-start="382.87" data-end="384.75">We've gone up a little bit.</span> <span data-start="384.75" data-end="387.81">Oh, that's not great.</span> <span data-start="387.81" data-end="391.08">[ Laughter ] And so, like, we get a little bit of a color</span> <span data-start="391.08" data-end="392.08">there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="392.08" data-end="393.08">We can shift it further.</span> <span data-start="393.08" data-end="395.33">We get a blue color.</span> <span data-start="395.33" data-end="397.46">We kind of go further, we get a purple.</span> <span data-start="397.46" data-end="400.02">And then eventually we come back around to red.</span> <span data-start="400.02" data-end="402.94">And so, this is what hue is.</span> <span data-start="402.94" data-end="404.58">It's sort of like a base color.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="404.58" data-end="407.8">Sort of a primary color in a lot of ways.</span> <span data-start="407.8" data-end="413.08">So, the next step we have is saturation and saturation is kind of like basically how washed</span> <span data-start="413.08" data-end="415.16">out is this color?</span> <span data-start="415.16" data-end="419">If you've ever done any sort of image editing using Photoshop or light room, you'll notice</span> <span data-start="419" data-end="420.419">a saturation slider.</span> <span data-start="420.419" data-end="422.77">You bump it up to make it more colorful.</span> <span data-start="422.77" data-end="427.63">This is what it's doing under the hood, messing with the color space.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="427.63" data-end="431.169">At 100%, saturation is measured from zero to 100%.</span> <span data-start="431.169" data-end="433.86">100%, this is full color.</span> <span data-start="433.86" data-end="436.74">This is as much color as you can get.</span> <span data-start="436.74" data-end="439.82">Here we have this fire engine red kind of color.</span> <span data-start="439.82" data-end="444.17">We start to drop that down and we see it getting just a little lighter.</span> <span data-start="444.17" data-end="446.6">Starts to turn into sort of a pinkish.</span> <span data-start="446.6" data-end="448.44">It's not really a vibrant red anymore.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="448.44" data-end="450.68">It's lacking vibrancy.</span> <span data-start="450.68" data-end="452.669">And we keep going all the way to zero.</span> <span data-start="452.669" data-end="455.27">And eventually we end up with white.</span> <span data-start="455.27" data-end="457.19">There's a complete lack of color.</span> <span data-start="457.19" data-end="463.38">In fact, taking the saturation to zero on any color will give us white as it turns out.</span> <span data-start="463.38" data-end="466.919">Now, similar to saturation is the value.</span> <span data-start="466.919" data-end="470.139">And in a sort ofï£° it's actually mathematically related.</span> <span data-start="470.139" data-end="472.55">We're not going talk about the math too much.</span> <span data-start="472.55" data-end="475.38">But we think of it as how bright is the color.</span> <span data-start="475.38" data-end="478.8">Again, we have this really bright colored red.</span> <span data-start="478.8" data-end="483.61">But as we start to drop this value from 100% to zero, we see it just getting dimmer and</span> <span data-start="483.61" data-end="487.38">we're sort of getting a maroon color at about 50%.</span> <span data-start="487.38" data-end="490.56">We take it all the way and then we can get to black.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="490.56" data-end="496.311">And so, these are the three channels that make up hue, saturation, and value on a color</span> <span data-start="496.311" data-end="497.311">space.</span> <span data-start="497.311" data-end="500.18">We put it together, we can create anything we want.</span> <span data-start="500.18" data-end="503.69">Say we want to create a lilac sort of color.</span> <span data-start="503.69" data-end="504.69">That light purple.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="504.69" data-end="507.9">My hair is purple, I love purple.</span> <span data-start="507.9" data-end="511.05">Purple, I happen to remember, is kind of over here.</span> <span data-start="511.05" data-end="515.909">But if I didn't remember where purple was, there's not that much to go through.</span> <span data-start="515.909" data-end="518.929">Mess with the slider, find the color you want.</span> <span data-start="518.929" data-end="519.929">This is the base color.</span> <span data-start="519.929" data-end="521.789">But this isn't a lilac.</span> <span data-start="521.789" data-end="524.35">Lilac is a fairly washed out color.</span> <span data-start="524.35" data-end="526.55">That tells you that we need to drop the saturation on that.</span> <span data-start="526.55" data-end="535.429">We will take the saturation and put it over here and thus we have a lilac color.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="535.429" data-end="540.339">So, we've got that, we mess with hue and saturation.</span> <span data-start="540.339" data-end="544.19">But then the next thing we can do is we can just make it, you know, darker if we want</span> <span data-start="544.19" data-end="545.19">to.</span> <span data-start="545.19" data-end="546.19">We can make it dimmer.</span> <span data-start="546.19" data-end="549.91">Let's say we're having two color themes for a  â  we're doing a light and a dark.</span> <span data-start="549.91" data-end="554.749">The nice thing about the color space, we can take different colors and make them brighter</span> <span data-start="554.749" data-end="557.99">and darker, but they are the same color.</span> <span data-start="557.99" data-end="561.42">It's dark colored, but it's the same thing.</span> <span data-start="561.42" data-end="565.8">They're super, super related and all the I'm doing is changing one number.</span> <span data-start="565.8" data-end="571.85">in RGB we have to change it.</span> <span data-start="571.85" data-end="578.12">I have no idea what this is in RGB because we can't reason about RGB.</span> <span data-start="578.12" data-end="579.97">But we can about HSV.</span> <span data-start="579.97" data-end="581.91">And so, this is a great thing.</span> <span data-start="581.91" data-end="586.709">Like HSV color space provides a really great sort of foundation to start doing any sort</span> <span data-start="586.709" data-end="591.61">of color work in art especially but even in products too.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="683.92" data-end="689.749">But we miss it with, start to increase, we can see our sine wave starts to get busier.</span> <span data-start="689.749" data-end="693.6">It just starts getting faster and faster.</span> <span data-start="693.6" data-end="699.85">So, next up we have phi, this is the other part in the sine wave.</span> <span data-start="699.85" data-end="702.17">This is an offset.</span> <span data-start="702.17" data-end="703.389">Where does the sine wave start?</span> <span data-start="703.389" data-end="710.759">We mess with this and we see that sine wave sliding around on the screen of it.</span> <span data-start="710.759" data-end="714.88">I don't use it myself, but I want to include it for completeness sake.</span> <span data-start="714.88" data-end="720.029">Then next up we have A, which is kind of a scaling factor for the sine wave.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="720.029" data-end="723.35">Right now this is going from negative 1 to 1.</span> <span data-start="723.35" data-end="728.269">But if we dropped this to, say, 0.5, we could see this gets a little thinner.</span> <span data-start="728.269" data-end="730.779">And it's not as tall of a sine wave.</span> <span data-start="730.779" data-end="736.989">And then last up we have theï£° and this isï£°sort of a final offset, like a constant offsetï£°</span> <span data-start="736.989" data-end="743.16">and which allows us to shift our sine wave around the graph like this.</span> <span data-start="743.16" data-end="746.68">With these parameters, we can combine them to create all kinds of stuff.</span> <span data-start="746.68" data-end="751.67">Now, there's some interesting things that happen at edges, sort of the edge cases to</span> <span data-start="751.67" data-end="752.67">this.</span> <span data-start="752.67" data-end="756.679">So, for example, I'm going to scoot this you were a bit, let's say we drop our angular</span> <span data-start="756.679" data-end="760.399">frequency all the way to zero.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="760.399" data-end="762.769">We do that, it's getting slower and slower.</span> <span data-start="762.769" data-end="766.709">Eventually we just get a straight line.</span> <span data-start="766.709" data-end="773.189">And this can be useful if we ever need to do something constant or unchanging.</span> <span data-start="773.189" data-end="775.1">But there's another way that we can achieve this too, though.</span> <span data-start="775.1" data-end="779.819">We can also take A, you know, that scaling factor of the sine wave, and drop it to zero.</span> <span data-start="779.819" data-end="781.819">And we also get a straight line.</span> <span data-start="781.819" data-end="787.989">Once we have done that, we get the straight line, we can use B to increase or decrease</span> <span data-start="787.989" data-end="789.899">how strong it is.</span> <span data-start="789.899" data-end="794.799">So, you can think of B as sort of an overall brightness for constant, and A is an overall</span> <span data-start="794.799" data-end="797.86">constant for the changes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="797.86" data-end="800.91">How does this map to LEDs and color spaces?</span> <span data-start="800.91" data-end="804.069">Well, basically like this.</span> <span data-start="804.069" data-end="806.54">So, here we have thatï£°exact same formula.</span> <span data-start="806.54" data-end="811.079">Instead of F and T, I say color value of X.</span> <span data-start="811.079" data-end="818.949">What this is saying is we have a color, the value channel in HSV, that value, that channel,</span> <span data-start="818.949" data-end="821.449">we're going to set if based on the sine wave.</span> <span data-start="821.449" data-end="824.97">And it's going to be a function of X which is distance, again, which LED are we talking</span> <span data-start="824.97" data-end="825.97">about here.</span> <span data-start="825.97" data-end="830.31">So, we can see at the bottom we have kind of what the LED output looks like.</span> <span data-start="830.31" data-end="834.439">When we vary the value across the distance according to the sine wave.</span> <span data-start="834.439" data-end="839.67">And the software powering the LEDs on the screen, a lot of it is shared with the power</span> <span data-start="839.67" data-end="840.67">here.</span> <span data-start="840.67" data-end="841.67">It's sharing the same thing.</span> <span data-start="841.67" data-end="845.769">By the way, it's really fun.</span> <span data-start="845.769" data-end="847.059">And really hard.</span> <span data-start="847.059" data-end="851.91">So, we can go in and we can change the angular frequency and according to distance and if</span> <span data-start="851.91" data-end="855.929">we increase this, we can see we start to get these tiny little waves.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="855.929" data-end="857.67">Like almost just a couple of dots.</span> <span data-start="857.67" data-end="861.79">But then as we spread it out, we can see them getting longer and longer.</span> <span data-start="861.79" data-end="865.06">And eventually we end up with just a flat line.</span> <span data-start="865.06" data-end="867.51">Now, there's still a little bit of color here.</span> <span data-start="867.51" data-end="869.55">You might be wondering why that is.</span> <span data-start="869.55" data-end="873.899">So, well a perfect sine wave, this is essentially like floating point math.</span> <span data-start="873.899" data-end="876.769">These are floating numbers between negative 1&1.</span> <span data-start="876.769" data-end="884.699">But a colored space, including HSV, we have a value that's been zero and 100% which under</span> <span data-start="884.699" data-end="889.029">the hood is represented as zero to 255 just like RGB.</span> <span data-start="889.029" data-end="890.49">We have to map those.</span> <span data-start="890.49" data-end="895.989">The way I set this up is so that negative 1 is equal to 0% and positive 1 is equal to</span> <span data-start="895.989" data-end="897.499">100%.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="897.499" data-end="901.36">Right now we're at basically 50% brightness and this is a flat line.</span> <span data-start="901.36" data-end="905.24">We can use B to make this bright.</span> <span data-start="905.24" data-end="909.029">About as bright as it can get and also turn it completely off.</span> <span data-start="909.029" data-end="910.519">And it's a weird thresholding.</span> <span data-start="910.519" data-end="914.72">It's actually a little bit weird.</span> <span data-start="914.72" data-end="917.26">But nonetheless, we can still do all of this kind of work.</span> <span data-start="917.26" data-end="923.809">We can control how the LEDs work inï£° across distance and we can also make it uniform.</span> <span data-start="923.809" data-end="927.879">Now, what if we decided to set value as a function of another variable.</span> <span data-start="927.879" data-end="931.459">I mentioned distance as one, but we can do it for something else.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="931.459" data-end="934.66">Let's make it a function of time.</span> <span data-start="934.66" data-end="938.929">With time, we get something a that looks like this.</span> <span data-start="938.929" data-end="942.8">We can see I have where the current marker in time is shifting across the graph.</span> <span data-start="942.8" data-end="946.359">Again, positive 1 is 100%, negative 1 is zero.</span> <span data-start="946.359" data-end="950.529">You can see the lovely fading in and out sort of animation.</span> <span data-start="950.529" data-end="954.329">Again, it's a sine value.</span> <span data-start="954.329" data-end="956.2">And we can change this just like before.</span> <span data-start="956.2" data-end="962.23">We will increase the angular frequency and we get something that's flashing really fast.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="962.23" data-end="966.059">And so, when I look at something like this, I'm kind of thinking like this kind of makes</span> <span data-start="966.059" data-end="968.41">me think of an emergency warning light.</span> <span data-start="968.41" data-end="971.369">This is an intense animation.</span> <span data-start="971.369" data-end="973.8">It's a little bit of anxiety producing, a little bit in your face.</span> <span data-start="973.8" data-end="979.259">So, we can use these mathematical parameters to evoke an emotional mood.</span> <span data-start="979.259" data-end="987.199">We can use light in society, we have those correlations, fast, flashing red, that's a</span> <span data-start="987.199" data-end="988.199">warning sign.</span> <span data-start="988.199" data-end="993.279">So, I can evoke a little bit of a mood just by setting a couple of sine wave parameters.</span> <span data-start="993.279" data-end="998.689">And I can also slow this way down.</span> <span data-start="998.689" data-end="1003.769">And so, this is just like very slowly changing over time.</span> <span data-start="1003.769" data-end="1008.85">And if I picked another color, say, then, you know, this could be a very calming.</span> <span data-start="1008.85" data-end="1012.139">It's almost like a sort of breathing a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1012.139" data-end="1016.049">So, we can evoke a different mood by just changing the rate on this.</span> <span data-start="1016.049" data-end="1019.44">But we can effect this and do even more complicated things.</span> <span data-start="1019.44" data-end="1022.619">We can drop A to, say, half.</span> <span data-start="1022.619" data-end="1026.19">And B we can bump up so that's sit up top like that.</span> <span data-start="1026.19" data-end="1029.38">And here we go to full brightness with a little bit of clipping.</span> <span data-start="1029.38" data-end="1031.94">Let me drop that a bit.</span> <span data-start="1031.94" data-end="1033.12">And down to like half.</span> <span data-start="1033.12" data-end="1035">So, it never gets fully dark.</span> <span data-start="1035" data-end="1041.72">But we could still see a changing and just sort of morphing a little bit over time.</span> <span data-start="1041.72" data-end="1047.95">Now, what if we made this a function about time and space?</span> <span data-start="1047.95" data-end="1052.65">Turns out we can do that with this modification of the formula here.</span> <span data-start="1052.65" data-end="1056.18">So, now you'll notice we've added a little bit more to the sine wave.</span> <span data-start="1056.18" data-end="1061.6">We have Omega T times T plus Omega X times X plus phi.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1061.6" data-end="1068.46">And we combined them together and we get this roving wave pattern.</span> <span data-start="1068.46" data-end="1073.84">With this, you can see how this is assembled in the art piece here.</span> <span data-start="1073.84" data-end="1081.43">Yeah, we can slow this down and you can justï£° this is barely moving across.</span> <span data-start="1081.43" data-end="1087.14">Again, this is a very kind of soothing slow sort of animation.</span> <span data-start="1087.14" data-end="1089.4">We can also make it go really fast.</span> <span data-start="1089.4" data-end="1090.89">This is kind of zipping across.</span> <span data-start="1090.89" data-end="1095.53">Now, what's interesting here though is because this does until we go away, they always see</span> <span data-start="1095.53" data-end="1096.99">some light.</span> <span data-start="1096.99" data-end="1100.78">It's a little bit of a different mood than we had on the previous in which we were flashing</span> <span data-start="1100.78" data-end="1102.25">it really fast.</span> <span data-start="1102.25" data-end="1106.4">It's not quite that, you know, warning, warning kind of feeling.</span> <span data-start="1106.4" data-end="1109.3">To me this just feels more like energy and movement.</span> <span data-start="1109.3" data-end="1114.28">Again, by the tweaking of this, we can get slightly different emotional feelings out</span> <span data-start="1114.28" data-end="1117.3">of it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1117.3" data-end="1120.03">And we can also, you knowï£° that's changing how fast it is.</span> <span data-start="1120.03" data-end="1125.15">We can also change this distance and change it, again, like are they little things?</span> <span data-start="1125.15" data-end="1129.55">We can take this down, now it kind of makes me think of like ants marching along or something</span> <span data-start="1129.55" data-end="1130.55">like that.</span> <span data-start="1130.55" data-end="1134.85">So, you can get some really fun stuff just by, again, tweaking some mathematical parameters.</span> <span data-start="1134.85" data-end="1136.23">All right.</span> <span data-start="1136.23" data-end="1140.03">That's how we edit the value channel and that's kind of what we can do when we're playing</span> <span data-start="1140.03" data-end="1141.03">with the value.</span> <span data-start="1141.03" data-end="1142.4">What about the other channels?</span> <span data-start="1142.4" data-end="1146.8">Saturation, again, is very closely related to value in practice.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1146.8" data-end="1149.1">Just sort of an inverse.</span> <span data-start="1149.1" data-end="1154.67">Here we can see it's fading from red all the way down to white.</span> <span data-start="1154.67" data-end="1160.12">And same thing, we could make this fade really fast or slow.</span> <span data-start="1160.12" data-end="1166.16">We can also give itï£° how to change over distance and again we get this sort of roving</span> <span data-start="1166.16" data-end="1168.62">wave pattern that we saw before.</span> <span data-start="1168.62" data-end="1172.47">It's slightlyï£° it's a different way of doing it mathematically and gives a different effect,</span> <span data-start="1172.47" data-end="1174.65">but we can still do that.</span> <span data-start="1174.65" data-end="1179.24">And we can also do things like drop that down, bump this up.</span> <span data-start="1179.24" data-end="1181.08">Now we have it going from red to pink.</span> <span data-start="1181.08" data-end="1185.84">It's like this could be a great one to do on Valentine's Day if you celebrate that with</span> <span data-start="1185.84" data-end="1188.95">the red motif going on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1188.95" data-end="1197.23">We can get different things going on by tweaking programmers in we saw saturation and value.</span> <span data-start="1197.23" data-end="1198.23">What about hue?</span> <span data-start="1198.23" data-end="1199.51">Hue is different.</span> <span data-start="1199.51" data-end="1201.07">It's less related.</span> <span data-start="1201.07" data-end="1202.22">We get a different effect.</span> <span data-start="1202.22" data-end="1204.49">I want to start here.</span> <span data-start="1204.49" data-end="1208.37">We have everything set to zero.</span> <span data-start="1208.37" data-end="1209.94">Nothing is changing over time.</span> <span data-start="1209.94" data-end="1212.7">And we have B set in the middle.</span> <span data-start="1212.7" data-end="1217">The way this is map 140 zero degrees is negative 1.</span> <span data-start="1217" data-end="1219.77">And 360 is positive 17.</span> <span data-start="1219.77" data-end="1225.36">Right now we're at the middle, this is the light blue color.</span> <span data-start="1225.36" data-end="1231.2">And you will see it just shifting across the hue.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1275.8" data-end="1279.87">And this is where I think this gets the most unusual as far as these equations go.</span> <span data-start="1279.87" data-end="1284.7">Because with this, we get this sort of like roving rainbow color.</span> <span data-start="1284.7" data-end="1288.54">And this can be a pretty interesting one in and of itself too because we're changing the</span> <span data-start="1288.54" data-end="1289.56">hue over time.</span> <span data-start="1289.56" data-end="1294.27">So, it's like we're going around that circle of hue all the way to the end.</span> <span data-start="1294.27" data-end="1298.65">And the only way we can make that faster or slower.</span> <span data-start="1298.65" data-end="1303.06">What also gets interesting is let's say we're going to drop this down to here.</span> <span data-start="1303.06" data-end="1306.62">What this is doing is sort of clamping what part of the circle we're on.</span> <span data-start="1306.62" data-end="1308.88">You notice we don't have the all the colors anymore.</span> <span data-start="1308.88" data-end="1311.06">We're not going red it to red.</span> <span data-start="1311.06" data-end="1315.23">We're sticking in one part of the circle.</span> <span data-start="1315.23" data-end="1320.34">This is gonna be, I think, maybe 120 to 180?</span> <span data-start="1320.34" data-end="1321.34">Like 240 degrees?</span> <span data-start="1321.34" data-end="1322.34">Something like that?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1322.34" data-end="1324.4">We're taking like the slice of colors in the middle.</span> <span data-start="1324.4" data-end="1325.95">But we can shift this up and down.</span> <span data-start="1325.95" data-end="1332.12">If you shift it down, we're gonna mostly see some more colorsï£° I have that weird clipping</span> <span data-start="1332.12" data-end="1333.12">thing.</span> <span data-start="1333.12" data-end="1338.51">But here to the top, we're mostly in the blue purple side of the spectrum.</span> <span data-start="1338.51" data-end="1343.26">So, we can sort of clamp into certain ranges of colors and not get all the colors as well</span> <span data-start="1343.26" data-end="1346.52">by just tweaking a few more parameters.</span> <span data-start="1346.52" data-end="1356.71">And so, that's how the three colorï£° we can vary the three color channels to create animations</span> <span data-start="1356.71" data-end="1358.01">using sine waves.</span> <span data-start="1358.01" data-end="1362.26">However, it turns out in most cases there's usually a fourth channel.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1362.26" data-end="1366.071">When we talk about color spaces, we pretty much talk about three chances, RGB, we talk</span> <span data-start="1366.071" data-end="1367.35">about three.</span> <span data-start="1367.35" data-end="1368.83">But in practice, there's always four.</span> <span data-start="1368.83" data-end="1371.82">If the fourth one is alpha or transparency.</span> <span data-start="1371.82" data-end="1376.72">We talk about the RGBA, or red, green, blue alpha.</span> <span data-start="1376.72" data-end="1382.82">We can do the same in the other color space, HSVA, hue, plus alpha.</span> <span data-start="1382.82" data-end="1386.62">We can add transparency to these.</span> <span data-start="1386.62" data-end="1389.93">Here on the next slide, I'm doing exactly that.</span> <span data-start="1389.93" data-end="1392">In this case, it's a black background.</span> <span data-start="1392" data-end="1394.76">This looks exactly like with value.</span> <span data-start="1394.76" data-end="1399.78">I take parameters and we get the same thing we saw when we were tweaking value.</span> <span data-start="1399.78" data-end="1405.32">But this is trans parent so it means we can put a layer underneath it, composite layers</span> <span data-start="1405.32" data-end="1408.11">together and put in multiple waves.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1408.11" data-end="1411.89">I didn't put all the controls on here, it would have been a lot.</span> <span data-start="1411.89" data-end="1417.59">But we have the full controls are for the alpha channel on the top and the B on the</span> <span data-start="1417.59" data-end="1418.59">bottom.</span> <span data-start="1418.59" data-end="1424.93">And we have the roving wave, make it faster or slower, we can change the distance.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1424.93" data-end="1427.28">And now I'm going to bring in the bottom layer.</span> <span data-start="1427.28" data-end="1431.63">The bottom layer, by the way, I have a hue of 180 degrees, a teal color.</span> <span data-start="1431.63" data-end="1438.95">As we bring this in, we start to see, we get a little bit of blue mixed under the red.</span> <span data-start="1438.95" data-end="1443.73">With this, we have two separate colors we have two completely separate waves doing their</span> <span data-start="1443.73" data-end="1445.61">own thing layered in together.</span> <span data-start="1445.61" data-end="1452.99">And so, by the way, the full set of equations running on this looks kind of like that.</span> <span data-start="1452.99" data-end="1454.17">It's a lot, I know.</span> <span data-start="1454.17" data-end="1455.17">It's hard to read.</span> <span data-start="1455.17" data-end="1456.17">I don't like looking at it.</span> <span data-start="1456.17" data-end="1459.88">Let's look at code instead.</span> <span data-start="1459.88" data-end="1461.6">This is a little more what we're used to.</span> <span data-start="1461.6" data-end="1462.7">This is a little friendlier looking.</span> <span data-start="1462.7" data-end="1464.6">Like, I can do this.</span> <span data-start="1464.6" data-end="1468.71">In this case, it's an array of colors.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1468.71" data-end="1472.86">But accept instead of sending hue to a constant, we're sending it to a function.</span> <span data-start="1472.86" data-end="1476.76">We can tweak those parameters and then layer them together.</span> <span data-start="1476.76" data-end="1483">When we look at this piece right here, for example, there's three layers going on.</span> <span data-start="1483" data-end="1486.62">The very bottom layer is just a solid blue color.</span> <span data-start="1486.62" data-end="1489.31">It never changes, it's just sitting there being blue.</span> <span data-start="1489.31" data-end="1493.44">And on top of that, another layer set to green.</span> <span data-start="1493.44" data-end="1497.13">But what I'm doing with that, varying the alpha over time.</span> <span data-start="1497.13" data-end="1498.13">Nothing with distance.</span> <span data-start="1498.13" data-end="1504.81">Just going from fully opaque green across the strip to trans parent green.</span> <span data-start="1504.81" data-end="1506.05">Fading from blue to green.</span> <span data-start="1506.05" data-end="1509.49">You can see the color in there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1509.49" data-end="1515.26">But on top that have, then I have that sort of roving wave pattern we saw in red that</span> <span data-start="1515.26" data-end="1516.82">makes it look like it's going over.</span> <span data-start="1516.82" data-end="1518.21">And that's how I created that animation.</span> <span data-start="1518.21" data-end="1523.53">And I used to do this, the system, it's a little bit complex.</span> <span data-start="1523.53" data-end="1526.22">But we can do all of this from JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1526.22" data-end="1531.38">This is one of the really cool things about Johnny Five and node bots and that whole world</span> <span data-start="1531.38" data-end="1534.11">is we can write some code that looks like this.</span> <span data-start="1534.11" data-end="1541.05">So, we can bring in a library called node pixel written by A.J. Fisher over there somewhere.</span> <span data-start="1541.05" data-end="1544.86">And taking in Johnny Five which there's a number of collaborators here on.</span> <span data-start="1544.86" data-end="1550.49">And this node animations which I wrote, that's some of the stuff here.</span> <span data-start="1550.49" data-end="1552.32">And mix them together.</span> <span data-start="1552.32" data-end="1555.441">And most of the code is initialization.</span> <span data-start="1555.441" data-end="1558.83">It's import libraries, getting the node ready, and the strip.</span> <span data-start="1558.83" data-end="1562.16">And inside of the event, we're going to set colors.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1562.16" data-end="1563.2">Create the layer.</span> <span data-start="1563.2" data-end="1565.38">I created a helper method.</span> <span data-start="1565.38" data-end="1568.08">Sometimes I don't want to use those coefficients directly.</span> <span data-start="1568.08" data-end="1570.48">We create an animation, create a layer.</span> <span data-start="1570.48" data-end="1575.28">And we composite that into a whole set of wave parameters that we have a helper method</span> <span data-start="1575.28" data-end="1576.28">for.</span> <span data-start="1576.28" data-end="1582.98">And then from the wave parameters into a list of RGB pixels.</span> <span data-start="1582.98" data-end="1588.35">And finally set each pixel in our LED using Node Pixel.</span> <span data-start="1588.35" data-end="1590.81">This code is functional.</span> <span data-start="1590.81" data-end="1592.43">I think it is, I didn't test it.</span> <span data-start="1592.43" data-end="1594.52">What can I say?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1594.52" data-end="1598.43">But this should be functional JavaScript code, a few bugs aside.</span> <span data-start="1598.43" data-end="1602.29">That's not very much code to get something like this going.</span> <span data-start="1602.29" data-end="1606.64">And like this is the thing that I love about JavaScript and why this is so powerful is</span> <span data-start="1606.64" data-end="1609.25">that once we have this in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1609.25" data-end="1614.88">Once we're inside of Node, which is where this is running, that opens all of the web</span> <span data-start="1614.88" data-end="1616.26">to us.</span> <span data-start="1616.26" data-end="1619.2">Specifically, we could do something like this.</span> <span data-start="1619.2" data-end="1626.12">Now, in this case the screen that we see here isn't quiteï£° I think I can do this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1626.12" data-end="1631.64">So, most of this the slides were synced to the specific pageï£° all right.</span> <span data-start="1631.64" data-end="1632.64">I can't show you.</span> <span data-start="1632.64" data-end="1633.64">That's all right.</span> <span data-start="1633.64" data-end="1638.47">But there's a Node server running on the Raspberry Pi that I have kind of hidden behind here</span> <span data-start="1638.47" data-end="1641.05">which is ultimately controlling this piece right here.</span> <span data-start="1641.05" data-end="1642.05">And this is the control panel.</span> <span data-start="1642.05" data-end="1643.05">This is a web app.</span> <span data-start="1643.05" data-end="1647.15">You can load it this up on your mobile phone if you're connected to the Wi Fi.</span> <span data-start="1647.15" data-end="1652.37">And we have this one animation, let's just set it to rainbow.</span> <span data-start="1652.37" data-end="1655.23">Now we haveï£° we can see it cycling through the hue.</span> <span data-start="1655.23" data-end="1658.51">That's a nice animation as well.</span> <span data-start="1658.51" data-end="1663.47">We can make it go really fast like it's just really chugging along.</span> <span data-start="1663.47" data-end="1667.53">And again, just controlling this from the web application.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1667.53" data-end="1670.02">We can goï£° there's just like a pulsing of color.</span> <span data-start="1670.02" data-end="1671.38">We get that reading effect.</span> <span data-start="1671.38" data-end="1674.36">I kind of like this one myself.</span> <span data-start="1674.36" data-end="1676.48">We can just cycle through colors as well.</span> <span data-start="1676.48" data-end="1679.61">Like, you know, we have this now in a web application.</span> <span data-start="1679.61" data-end="1680.61">It's open to the Internet.</span> <span data-start="1680.61" data-end="1683.18">And once we have this, we can like bring people in.</span> <span data-start="1683.18" data-end="1688.37">You know, we can create art pieces that encourage other people to come and interact with it.</span> <span data-start="1688.37" data-end="1692.39">Like, this is one of the things I think is so exciting about a lot of art coming up these</span> <span data-start="1692.39" data-end="1694.26">days is that it's interactive.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1694.26" data-end="1697.76">It encourages people to engage and explore with it.</span> <span data-start="1697.76" data-end="1704.51">There's a lot of profound ways that we can create experiences for people.</span> <span data-start="1704.51" data-end="1708.61">And so, the thing I want to come back to is where this is all about doing art.</span> <span data-start="1708.61" data-end="1713.68">And I want to encourage all of you to express yourself.</span> <span data-start="1713.68" data-end="1717.09">Like, art is really, really important.</span> <span data-start="1717.09" data-end="1721.9">And I personally think that art is the single greatest thing our species has ever created,</span> <span data-start="1721.9" data-end="1722.9">ever.</span> <span data-start="1722.9" data-end="1727.88">Like, I think art is what makes us so unique and I think it represents the best side of</span> <span data-start="1727.88" data-end="1728.88">us.</span> <span data-start="1728.88" data-end="1732.55">And so, I really encourage all of you to try it out.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1732.55" data-end="1735.61">You know, we have these skills, we have these technology skills.</span> <span data-start="1735.61" data-end="1740.49">With if we just rethink how we're going to use them, we can use it to create art.</span> <span data-start="1740.49" data-end="1745.1">Think about art, and one of the reasons I think it's so important though is it's about</span> <span data-start="1745.1" data-end="1747.05">expressing emotional truth.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1747.05" data-end="1751.29">And to do that, we have to understand ourselves.</span> <span data-start="1751.29" data-end="1756.49">In order to express what we're feeling through art, we first have to know what we are feeling.</span> <span data-start="1756.49" data-end="1762.9">And that may sound like a tautology or something simple, but it takes introspection.</span> <span data-start="1762.9" data-end="1768.5">That's really, really important because it makes us better people.</span> <span data-start="1768.5" data-end="1775.69">When we know who we really are, how we engage and fit in the world, that enables us to then</span> <span data-start="1775.69" data-end="1779.02">start interacting with the world in a better way.</span> <span data-start="1779.02" data-end="1785.1">Allows us to be more honest, allows us to be more authentic and be our true selves.</span> <span data-start="1785.1" data-end="1789.16">It's better for us as individuals and for our relationships.</span> <span data-start="1789.16" data-end="1790.16">Create art.</span> <span data-start="1790.16" data-end="1795.99">The one thing I want to leave you all with today is how can you feed your inner artist</span> <span data-start="1795.99" data-end="1797.47">and not just feed capitalism?</span> </p>
