data-end="370.32">think is really interesting is technical</span> <span data-start="370.32" data-end="374.34">computing like the the very early days</span> <span data-start="374.34" data-end="377.22">of technical computing were in C and</span> <span data-start="377.22" data-end="378.87">then there was Fortran and then there is</span> <span data-start="378.87"

data-end="450.649">years could become commonplace is</span> <span data-start="450.649" data-end="453.719">instrumentation so there's this company</span> <span data-start="453.719"

there are all these great tools</span> <span data-start="535.55" data-end="539.589">like d3 and you get interactivity so</span> <span data-start="539.589" data-end="541.97">these chart on these charts you can</span> <span data-start="541.97" data-end="544.13">hover and you can zoom and you can pan</span> <span data-start="544.13" data-end="547.64">around and if you compare that to MATLAB</span>
