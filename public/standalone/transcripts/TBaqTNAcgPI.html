<p><span data-start="7.169" data-end="8.929">I don't know what that looks like, and he's also a craft beer fan, who likes craft beer</span> <span data-start="8.929" data-end="9.929">here?</span> <span data-start="9.929" data-end="10.929">Cool, all right.</span> <span data-start="10.929" data-end="11.929">OK.</span> <span data-start="11.929" data-end="12.929">So advancing focus with, please him a round of applause, Glen Goodwin!</span> <span data-start="12.929" data-end="13.929">[applause]</span> <span data-start="13.929" data-end="14.929">So thank you, Paris, for the introduction.</span> <span data-start="14.929" data-end="15.929">Greetings, everyone.</span> <span data-start="15.929" data-end="16.929">Before I start, I just want to say as I look out into these blinding lights, look out at</span> <span data-start="16.929" data-end="22.779">everyone, that I, like all speakers who get up on the stage, am nervous as hell, so thank</span> <span data-start="22.779" data-end="27.89">you all in advance for bearing with me, for laughing at my really lame jokes, and for</span> <span data-start="27.89" data-end="30.83">joining me on this ride.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="30.83" data-end="34.16">So  —  [applause]</span> <span data-start="34.16" data-end="36.29">So let's get this ball going.</span> <span data-start="36.29" data-end="37.73">Ball rolling.</span> <span data-start="37.73" data-end="43.489">My name is Glen and I am here today to talk to you about the most exciting part of working</span> <span data-start="43.489" data-end="49.75">with browsers, a topic that will literally make you shout with joy and I can tell that</span> <span data-start="49.75" data-end="57.46">you are all super-eager to hear about the stupendous, amazing, and totally riveting,</span> <span data-start="57.46" data-end="58.46">focus subsystem.</span> <span data-start="58.46" data-end="59.46">Yeah?</span> <span data-start="60.46" data-end="61.46">[cheers and applause]</span> <span data-start="61.46" data-end="63.29">Wow, that was pretty good.</span> <span data-start="63.29" data-end="66.22">I had a whole section, everybody cheer again.</span> <span data-start="66.22" data-end="67.71">But you do pretty good.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="67.71" data-end="75.37">There so I know this isn't the most glamorous thing we could be discussing today but sometimes</span> <span data-start="75.37" data-end="80.3">we have to go down into the weeds, we have to take a long hard look at the tools that</span> <span data-start="80.3" data-end="85.22">we are given as web developers and we need to ask, could it be better and that's what</span> <span data-start="85.22" data-end="91.5">I want to do today, with the Focus subsystem and specifically how we interact with the</span> <span data-start="91.5" data-end="100.71">Focus subsystem programmatically within JavaScript, so we're going to dive deep, and we're going</span> <span data-start="100.71" data-end="107.06">to ask, does it work well, does it meet the needs of the developers?</span> <span data-start="107.06" data-end="111.21">Could it do more to be better?</span> <span data-start="111.21" data-end="115.92">So in order to answer these questions, we need to know exactly what we're talking about.</span> <span data-start="115.92" data-end="118.92">So I want to be very clear on this point.</span> <span data-start="118.92" data-end="124.49">When I speak about Focus, I am not talking about this.</span> <span data-start="124.49" data-end="128.89">As cute as this little guy is, we're not here to talk about focus in terms of attention.</span> <span data-start="128.89" data-end="140.61">We're not talking about, you know, blink and MarqUee elements.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="140.61" data-end="145.9">So fields and elements is what we're talking about, where input is directed.</span> <span data-start="145.9" data-end="153.89">When we press a key on our keyboard, focus is the system that directs that our form and</span> <span data-start="153.89" data-end="160.36">specifically to the field, so when I press a G here, the focus system ensures that the</span> <span data-start="160.36" data-end="164.12">G appears in the correct place.</span> <span data-start="164.12" data-end="169.96">Specifically, Focus as it relates to user interfaces is the process by which with the</span> <span data-start="169.96" data-end="175.94">computer decides what part of the user interface receives any human interaction.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="175.94" data-end="182.62">Be it a mouse click, a keystroke or any other type of user input, including accessibility</span> <span data-start="182.62" data-end="183.62">devices.</span> <span data-start="183.62" data-end="187.15">For any given input the computer must decide where in all of its interfaces that input</span> <span data-start="187.15" data-end="194.81">is being directed to and once it determines where the input is being targeted at, it needs</span> <span data-start="194.81" data-end="196.23">to send it there.</span> <span data-start="196.23" data-end="204.69">I call this the focus flow and I press a key, it reports an operating system that a keystroke</span> <span data-start="204.69" data-end="207.06">occurred.</span> <span data-start="207.06" data-end="210.6">The operating system determines what key was pressed.</span> <span data-start="210.6" data-end="215.84">Next, the operating system then determines where the user is currently targeting their</span> <span data-start="215.84" data-end="221.12">input A More precisely which window is the focus?</span> <span data-start="221.12" data-end="226.85">If the browser is the current window focus, it tells the browser about the keyboard press,</span> <span data-start="226.85" data-end="232.22">browser then does exactly what the operating system just did, but it does it within itself,</span> <span data-start="232.22" data-end="233.22">right?</span> <span data-start="233.22" data-end="240.13">So it determines which window or tab within the browser is targeted to receive the input.</span> <span data-start="240.13" data-end="245.24">Once the browser has determined which window or tab has the focus, it finds the associated</span> <span data-start="245.24" data-end="248.99">top-level DOM element for that window or tab.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="248.99" data-end="255.52">The DOM document tracks which specific element of the DOM is currently targeted to receive</span> <span data-start="255.52" data-end="256.52">input.</span> <span data-start="256.52" data-end="260.53">It does this in a property called activeElement.</span> <span data-start="260.53" data-end="275.83">Whenever focus is changed in a document, this is the series of focus decisions at every</span> <span data-start="275.83" data-end="276.83">level.</span> <span data-start="276.83" data-end="287.44">The  active element, along with the focus and blur</span> <span data-start="287.44" data-end="291.8">methods, and the four events, focus, blur, focusin and focusout.</span> <span data-start="291.8" data-end="309.13">These make up the focus systems that we know and I don't want to say love, but use every</span> <span data-start="309.13" data-end="310.13">day.</span> <span data-start="310.13" data-end="312.87">That's what we're going to talk about today with the focus subsystem.</span> <span data-start="312.87" data-end="320.77">So I'm going to take a long draw of water.</span> <span data-start="320.77" data-end="323.63">Bear with me.</span> <span data-start="323.63" data-end="332.37">So the focus subsis is tem was introduced in January of 1998, with a few tweaks a few</span> <span data-start="332.37" data-end="334.05">years later.</span> <span data-start="334.05" data-end="340.76">And unsurprisingly, the focus subsystem hasn't changed significantly since then and that's</span> <span data-start="340.76" data-end="345.48">fine, it's a 20-year-old API, and it does its job.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="345.48" data-end="347.52">Or does it?</span> <span data-start="347.52" data-end="353.27">So say that you are an incredibly dashing web developer named Glen, and you need to</span> <span data-start="353.27" data-end="357.11">write a web component that wraps a single field for entering a user name, something</span> <span data-start="357.11" data-end="358.949">like this, right?</span> <span data-start="358.949" data-end="364.36">And your customer comes to you and say they want the "Enter" key to advance the focus</span> <span data-start="364.36" data-end="367.41">to the next field.</span> <span data-start="367.41" data-end="370.28">So our code might look like this.</span> <span data-start="370.28" data-end="375.96">And a note here: I am using a library called ZephJS to define the web component.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="375.96" data-end="381.56">It's a tiny and powerful way to write web components super easily, you can check it</span> <span data-start="381.56" data-end="384.23">out at ZephJS.com.</span> <span data-start="384.23" data-end="389.58">So we have a customer that wants a web component for entering a user name and that they could</span> <span data-start="389.58" data-end="393.75">reuse and it must advance the focus when" Enter "Is pressed.</span> <span data-start="393.75" data-end="397.59">So here's our code again.</span> <span data-start="397.59" data-end="403.38">I'm going to go through this pretty quick, so bear with me.</span> <span data-start="403.38" data-end="406.6">So we define our my user field component.</span> <span data-start="406.6" data-end="411.02">So with ZephJS you provide the name of the component you are defining and a function</span> <span data-start="411.02" data-end="415.59">that describes the detail of the new component.</span> <span data-start="415.59" data-end="420.36">Within this definition function we define our HTML content for our component and we</span> <span data-start="420.36" data-end="425.77">need to tell our component how we want to handle the key-up event in the interval element.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="425.77" data-end="430.94">The keyup event is what we are watching when enter is pressed, right?</span> <span data-start="430.94" data-end="432.16">So that's our code.</span> <span data-start="432.16" data-end="437.1">That's our admittedly simple component division for our user field.</span> <span data-start="437.1" data-end="443.63">Once defined this code is going to be used.</span> <span data-start="443.63" data-end="448.04">So by now, most of you have noticed this line right here.</span> <span data-start="448.04" data-end="454">This is where we want to put the code that will change focus when the enter key is pressed.</span> <span data-start="454" data-end="456.96">But there is a big problem here.</span> <span data-start="456.96" data-end="462.74">With our current focus subsystem, in order to advance the focus from one element to the</span> <span data-start="462.74" data-end="466.26">next, we use the element focus method.</span> <span data-start="466.26" data-end="473.509">Element focus is executed on the element we want to give the focus to, but then how does</span> <span data-start="473.509" data-end="479.13">our web component know what element it wants to advance the focus to?</span> <span data-start="479.13" data-end="487.539">A web component is built to actively not know what exists outside of it.</span> <span data-start="487.539" data-end="493.77">So using the current focus subsystem, we actually have no easy way to just tell the focus to</span> <span data-start="493.77" data-end="496.389">advance to the next place.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="496.389" data-end="501.36">This is the first problem I want to call your attention to with the current focus subsystem.</span> <span data-start="501.36" data-end="506.02">There exists no programmatic way to advance focus.</span> <span data-start="506.02" data-end="512.579">Now, some of you are thinking that Glen, you should probably just walk the tree and you</span> <span data-start="512.579" data-end="516.449">can start at the current element and locate the next element which can receive focus and</span> <span data-start="516.449" data-end="519.069">you can advance to that that's super-easy.</span> <span data-start="519.069" data-end="524.579">Well, this brings up the second problem with our current focus system.</span> <span data-start="524.579" data-end="528.589">What makes an element able to receive focus?</span> <span data-start="528.589" data-end="532.499">What indicates something isfocusable?</span> <span data-start="532.499" data-end="535.649">And there are some easy elements here.</span> <span data-start="535.649" data-end="544.629">If an element is an input tag or a select tag or a button tag or or the this was a new</span> <span data-start="544.629" data-end="552.779">one to me the first summary element of a child element or it's content editable, except if</span> <span data-start="552.779" data-end="560.3">it's disabled or the tabindex is equal to -1 or it's hidden or it's within a disabled</span> <span data-start="560.3" data-end="567.79">forum or it's otherwise not visible, or, or, or, I mean there's so much I could keep going</span> <span data-start="567.79" data-end="568.79">on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="568.79" data-end="577.17">See, determining what is focusable is really hard and even more problematic is that it's</span> <span data-start="577.17" data-end="585.16">incredibly inconsistent across different browsers, Chrome may handle a select element different</span> <span data-start="585.16" data-end="596.97">than Firefox does, and that doesn't even begin to take account in the are react.</span> <span data-start="596.97" data-end="601.829">They didn't account for them at all 20 years ago.</span> <span data-start="601.829" data-end="607.629">Aria a has huge implications on focus.</span> <span data-start="607.629" data-end="622.089">It's a big part of this question understanding it is very tricky and it's full of edge cases.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="622.089" data-end="625.11">Someone made this lovely chart.</span> <span data-start="625.11" data-end="631.93">This compares all the an element could be focusable.</span> <span data-start="631.93" data-end="638.709">I tried to shrink this down but it would be 16 stories high on the monitors if I did it.</span> <span data-start="638.709" data-end="642.059">It's just crazy long.</span> <span data-start="642.059" data-end="648.24">Of course, we can all go to the specification and that should be super-easy to understand,</span> <span data-start="648.24" data-end="649.24">right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="649.24" data-end="650.24">Yeah?</span> <span data-start="650.24" data-end="656.31">So Section 6.4 of the HTML specification details the focus subsystem, and here's what it says</span> <span data-start="656.31" data-end="660.639">about how to determine if an element is folk focusable.</span> <span data-start="660.639" data-end="663.739">So I was going to read this aloud verbatim.</span> <span data-start="663.739" data-end="670.529">I suspect half of you would have left immediately, but honestly if you just look at it, it's</span> <span data-start="670.529" data-end="675.579">complicated and it's confusing and even if you read the whole thing and you get down</span> <span data-start="675.579" data-end="680.47">to this last line right here, this basically says that browsers can make anything they</span> <span data-start="680.47" data-end="684.49">want be focusable or not at any time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="684.49" data-end="689.759">So trying to determine what is focusable is not something we really should be in the business</span> <span data-start="689.759" data-end="692.6">of doing as developers.</span> <span data-start="692.6" data-end="700.63">Smarter people have tried to do this and every single time they try to do this, they get</span> <span data-start="700.63" data-end="701.8">it wrong.</span> <span data-start="701.8" data-end="704.1">So essentially we have two problems that I mentioned, right?</span> <span data-start="704.1" data-end="710.97">We have no easy way to programmatically advance the focus or programmatically move the focus</span> <span data-start="710.97" data-end="712.48">backwards.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="712.48" data-end="718.319">We also have no easy way determine what can receive the focus, what isfocusable if we</span> <span data-start="718.319" data-end="724.399">wanted to read the tree.</span> <span data-start="724.399" data-end="732.18">And internally in the browser, both of these problems are already solved.</span> <span data-start="732.18" data-end="736.119">This is just not exposed.</span> <span data-start="736.119" data-end="739.179">The focus subsystem today is mostly a passive thing.</span> <span data-start="739.179" data-end="743.959">We can read it, we can tell where the focus is and what it changes and we can direct it</span> <span data-start="743.959" data-end="748.749">if we know exactly where to direct T and this is OK, but it's not enough.</span> <span data-start="748.749" data-end="753.029">It's not enough for modern web development.</span> <span data-start="753.029" data-end="757.68">This is a 20-year-old API and it's really starting to show its age.</span> <span data-start="757.68" data-end="763.66">My web component example there, it's only one small slice, one small example of the</span> <span data-start="763.66" data-end="765.809">problems we are facing with focus.</span> <span data-start="765.809" data-end="773.029">20 years ago, we hadn't even begun to envision all the things we would want or need to do</span> <span data-start="773.029" data-end="775.85">with the web.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="775.85" data-end="781.04">And as we continue to move the needle of what can be done in a browser, focus will continue</span> <span data-start="781.04" data-end="786.55">to become more and more of a pain point for developers, but I think that we can solve</span> <span data-start="786.55" data-end="787.55">these problems.</span> <span data-start="787.55" data-end="790.779">I believe we can make focus better.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="790.779" data-end="796.629">We can make it more powerful and easier to work with, and we can make focus help us do</span> <span data-start="796.629" data-end="797.769">what we need to do.</span> <span data-start="797.769" data-end="802.339">And all of that begins by exposing three simple functions.</span> <span data-start="802.339" data-end="808.369">First, we need to expose that method that determines if something can receive the focus.</span> <span data-start="808.369" data-end="813.029">Second and third, we need to expose the methods to move the focus forward or backwards, regardless</span> <span data-start="813.029" data-end="816.11">of where the focus currently is.</span> <span data-start="816.11" data-end="821.72">And consider what other focussings we could expose or add to make focus better.</span> <span data-start="821.72" data-end="827.619">What about a function to trap or limit focus to a particular container, meaning that focus</span> <span data-start="827.619" data-end="832.35">would cycle through the focusable elements in that container, but never out of it until</span> <span data-start="832.35" data-end="834.5">told otherwise.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="834.5" data-end="843.37">Especially useful in dialogue boxes.</span> <span data-start="843.37" data-end="851.31">wouldn't a function that takes an array of elements and does the ordering for us programmatically</span> <span data-start="851.31" data-end="854.629">be really helpful?</span> <span data-start="854.629" data-end="858.389">And there are other things we could be doing to make focus more understandable.</span> <span data-start="858.389" data-end="859.79">Lots more.</span> <span data-start="859.79" data-end="864.779">What if we had a previous active property or a history array to track what was previously</span> <span data-start="864.779" data-end="865.779">focused.</span> <span data-start="865.779" data-end="866.98">That could be useful.</span> <span data-start="866.98" data-end="871.99">Or a programmatic way to set an element once the page was loaded.</span> <span data-start="871.99" data-end="878.709">That might be nice and there are probably other things I haven't considered.</span> <span data-start="878.709" data-end="883.899">All of these functions and properties, they can make focus so much more useful, so much</span> <span data-start="883.899" data-end="890.329">more better, we just need the courage to make the changes.</span> <span data-start="890.329" data-end="898.17">So let's get some more water.</span> <span data-start="898.17" data-end="905.709">So like any good developer with a new idea, I set out to address the shortcomings of focus</span> <span data-start="905.709" data-end="908.429">by writing a new library.</span> <span data-start="908.429" data-end="913.379">Obviously I didn't want to try and write my own isfocusable method, so naturally I did</span> <span data-start="913.379" data-end="917.779">what we all do on the internet: I stole one.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="917.779" data-end="922.739">The tabbable library is written by David Clark and it has a passable isfocusable method.</span> <span data-start="922.739" data-end="930.001">But  it's passable for what I needed to do, so</span> <span data-start="930.001" data-end="932.47">I used that to get started.</span> <span data-start="932.47" data-end="939.31">And from there I added a global object called focusManager.</span> <span data-start="939.31" data-end="951.209">And I had to ask the question, why isn't this something browsers natively have?</span> <span data-start="951.209" data-end="953.929">Isn't this something everyone would want?</span> <span data-start="953.929" data-end="957.79">Isn't a better focus-system something everyone deserves?</span> <span data-start="957.79" data-end="962.37">Surely there must be a way to help everyone.</span> <span data-start="962.37" data-end="969.019">So let me tell you about how I tried to change the HTML specification.</span> <span data-start="969.019" data-end="975.639">First, as most of you may be aware, there are actually two separate governing bodies</span> <span data-start="975.639" data-end="979.239">maintaining the HTML standard at the same time.</span> <span data-start="979.239" data-end="985.139">We have the W3C and we have the whatwg and each much them work on the specification at</span> <span data-start="985.139" data-end="989.569">the same time, independent of each other.</span> <span data-start="989.569" data-end="993.36">One might think that isn't a good idea and it really wasn't.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="993.36" data-end="1004.759">So they signed an agreement to work together, and they decide that the HTML specification</span> <span data-start="1004.759" data-end="1010.669">work is going to be done entirely in the whatwg and we finally have a single body overseeing</span> <span data-start="1010.669" data-end="1017.19">the standard and everyone is super happy, hurray, cheers, right?</span> <span data-start="1017.19" data-end="1018.19">Yeah!</span> <span data-start="1018.19" data-end="1025.07">Now, let us say that you can an incredibly dashing but not super well known or popular</span> <span data-start="1025.07" data-end="1037.74">web developer and you want to propose changes to the HTML standard and you might Google</span> <span data-start="1037.74" data-end="1045.079">and surprisingly enough, you might get the WC3 process document as the first hit.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1045.079" data-end="1048.559">Yay, that sounds like great fun, right?</span> <span data-start="1048.559" data-end="1050.28">It was not.</span> <span data-start="1050.28" data-end="1053.02">Seriously it is an awful thing to have to read.</span> <span data-start="1053.02" data-end="1055.88">Never, ever read that document.</span> <span data-start="1055.88" data-end="1061.07">But if you were persistent, you might eventually find something called the web platform incubator</span> <span data-start="1061.07" data-end="1063.88">community group or the WICG.</span> <span data-start="1063.88" data-end="1073.11">It allows people like you and I to make proposals so this sounds exactly what you were looking</span> <span data-start="1073.11" data-end="1074.11">for, right?</span> <span data-start="1074.11" data-end="1082.24">So you write up your idea and you submit it to the WICG discourse group for discussion.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1082.24" data-end="1084.69">But things go really slowly.</span> <span data-start="1084.69" data-end="1096.58">A few people read it but none of them seem to care and right about that time</span> <span data-start="1096.58" data-end="1106.3">you realize that you need to get your proposal in front of the whatwg eyeballs.</span> <span data-start="1106.3" data-end="1114.17">What you don't realize is both of these processes have the same fundamental flaw.</span> <span data-start="1114.17" data-end="1119.14">The process for submitting the proposal is pretty easy, but the process for getting anyone</span> <span data-start="1119.14" data-end="1125.73">to look at it or consider it for that matter is incredibly hard.</span> <span data-start="1125.73" data-end="1131.85">In order for your proposal to get any kind of response, you are first required to sell</span> <span data-start="1131.85" data-end="1132.85">it.</span> <span data-start="1132.85" data-end="1134.9">And not everybody is good at selling.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1134.9" data-end="1137.97">I am not good at selling.</span> <span data-start="1137.97" data-end="1149.53">The whatwg process requires you to find, you have to convince buyers that your idea is</span> <span data-start="1149.53" data-end="1155.99">worthy and that's really hard, especially if you're an incredibly dashing but not very</span> <span data-start="1155.99" data-end="1159.88">popular or well known web developer named Glen.</span> <span data-start="1159.88" data-end="1164">So you do what you think is the right thing.</span> <span data-start="1164" data-end="1167.47">You do what you think is best, and you make a tweet and you write a few articles and you</span> <span data-start="1167.47" data-end="1172.6">post to Reddit and Hacker News, and you promote, promote, promote, you do literally everything</span> <span data-start="1172.6" data-end="1173.65">you can think of.</span> <span data-start="1173.65" data-end="1177.26">But still, eyeballs are hard to find.</span> <span data-start="1177.26" data-end="1184.39">So you decide to take your idea on the road and you tell the best developers in the world</span> <span data-start="1184.39" data-end="1185.39">about your idea.</span> <span data-start="1185.39" data-end="1186.39">Hi, everybody!</span> <span data-start="1186.39" data-end="1194.15">I have an idea! [applause]</span> <span data-start="1194.15" data-end="1198.02">And that's called pandering, just in case anyone is keeping track.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1198.02" data-end="1202.99">You take a roomful of great minds and you tell them about the focus traversal API proposal.</span> <span data-start="1202.99" data-end="1205.99">This is my proposal to make focus better.</span> <span data-start="1205.99" data-end="1209.17">A formal proposal to the HTML specification.</span> <span data-start="1209.17" data-end="1220.77">This proposal formally introduces the concepts of focus traversal.</span> <span data-start="1220.77" data-end="1228.31">In the proposal I suggest a set of additions to move focus forward.</span> <span data-start="1228.31" data-end="1233.93">This includes creating the top-level window property called focus manager and to using</span> <span data-start="1233.93" data-end="1238.87">that, to expose a series of properties and methods for working with focus traversal.</span> <span data-start="1238.87" data-end="1244.99">It contains as previously described functions for determining what is focusable.</span> <span data-start="1244.99" data-end="1254.02">Functions for incrementing and decrementing focus.</span> <span data-start="1254.02" data-end="1263.32">This is the proposal that I have submitted to the WICG and the whatwg and now I'm telling</span> <span data-start="1263.32" data-end="1265.58">all of you fine folks about it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1265.58" data-end="1271.36">I have even fleshed out my original library and I've made a working polyfill for the proposal</span> <span data-start="1271.36" data-end="1278.39">that you can use today to shim all of these cool functions into your applications until</span> <span data-start="1278.39" data-end="1282.57">we can get an actual implementation in the browsers.</span> <span data-start="1282.57" data-end="1287.66">Unfortunately, though, actual implementation is a long, long way away.</span> <span data-start="1287.66" data-end="1295.76">As I've said, the whatwg process for enacting change requires you to convince browser manufacturers</span> <span data-start="1295.76" data-end="1301.76">on your own that your idea is worthy of your time and I can count on zero hands the number</span> <span data-start="1301.76" data-end="1306.05">of browser manufacturers I know how to talk to.</span> <span data-start="1306.05" data-end="1309.35">But there is hope.</span> <span data-start="1309.35" data-end="1311.78">You.</span> <span data-start="1311.78" data-end="1313.25">You can help me.</span> <span data-start="1313.25" data-end="1319.05">I need people to comment on the proposal, on the WICG or the whatwg and get involved</span> <span data-start="1319.05" data-end="1320.75">in this process.</span> <span data-start="1320.75" data-end="1325.4">I need people to download the polyfill and try it out and find the bugs and help me grow</span> <span data-start="1325.4" data-end="1327.51">the code.</span> <span data-start="1327.51" data-end="1331.85">I need people to come up with new ideas for new focus functionality.</span> </p>
