<p><span data-start="61.44" data-end="64.89">We are going to dive straight into it.</span> <span data-start="64.89" data-end="66.17">What is bittorrent?</span> <span data-start="66.17" data-end="69">How does it work?</span> <span data-start="69" data-end="72.04">How many people have heard about Bittorrent?</span> <span data-start="72.04" data-end="75.39">All right.</span> <span data-start="75.39" data-end="79.59">Usually when I ask this question, what is bittorrent?</span> <span data-start="79.59" data-end="85.95">People tend to think this one thing.</span> <span data-start="85.95" data-end="88.14">Which is not completely untrue.</span> <span data-start="88.14" data-end="89.61">It is a bit sad.</span> <span data-start="89.61" data-end="95.14">Actually bittorrent is just like way more than this.</span> <span data-start="95.14" data-end="97.46">Application is way beyond piracy.</span> <span data-start="97.46" data-end="104.2">So, yeah, let's talk about how it works.</span> <span data-start="104.2" data-end="108.69">Normally when you fetch a file online it could be any file.</span> <span data-start="108.69" data-end="110.79">Video of this talk.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="110.79" data-end="117.03">You have the scenario where you have a server and you trust this server and you go to the</span> <span data-start="117.03" data-end="120.119">server and do send me this file.</span> <span data-start="120.119" data-end="121.83">Yes, here is the file.</span> <span data-start="121.83" data-end="125.11">It is kind of nice.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="125.11" data-end="127.62">It is super simple and nice.</span> <span data-start="127.62" data-end="131.04">A diagram with 2 things on it.</span> <span data-start="131.04" data-end="133.19">Awesome.</span> <span data-start="133.19" data-end="135.19">What's the problem?</span> <span data-start="135.19" data-end="140.06">Well, what happens when 1 million clients come in.</span> <span data-start="140.06" data-end="143.16">We want to watch the video.</span> <span data-start="143.16" data-end="149.51">I don't know if you saw the Apple keynote.</span> <span data-start="149.51" data-end="157.02">They had this experience zozer The server is like, sending the files to everybody.</span> <span data-start="157.02" data-end="158.449">It is going okay.</span> <span data-start="158.449" data-end="165.919">You can see some of the iPhone things going on.</span> <span data-start="165.919" data-end="170.27">One natural thing that can happen, the server explodes.</span> <span data-start="170.27" data-end="176.389">It is not really viral anymore.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="176.389" data-end="177.63">How about we improve that?</span> <span data-start="177.63" data-end="182.71">And a simple way would be to have every client send data to eachother.</span> <span data-start="182.71" data-end="185.51">It looks like this.</span> <span data-start="185.51" data-end="188.31">We call them peers.</span> <span data-start="188.31" data-end="190.621">They are sending and receiving data.</span> <span data-start="190.621" data-end="194.04">Swapping data around.</span> <span data-start="194.04" data-end="195.04">That's awesome.</span> <span data-start="195.04" data-end="197.63">This is what we call P2P.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="197.63" data-end="202.97">I mean, there are problems.</span> <span data-start="202.97" data-end="207.04">Because, now we are sending data from arbitrary people.</span> <span data-start="207.04" data-end="208.32">Getting data.</span> <span data-start="208.32" data-end="216.2">How do we know that no one will come in and be like, this is the other talk that nobody</span> <span data-start="216.2" data-end="218.81">likes.</span> <span data-start="218.81" data-end="221.88">Coffeescript talks.</span> <span data-start="221.88" data-end="226.979">So, there is a simple solution.</span> <span data-start="226.979" data-end="229.419">Take the file.</span> <span data-start="229.419" data-end="231.59">We split it into equally sized pieces.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="231.59" data-end="234.04">Half or 10 megs.</span> <span data-start="234.04" data-end="237.18">And hash them.</span> <span data-start="237.18" data-end="240.38">People know what it is.</span> <span data-start="240.38" data-end="241.62">Digest.</span> <span data-start="241.62" data-end="245.16">So, we can just get a piece from everybody.</span> <span data-start="245.16" data-end="247.26">Assuming we had these hashes.</span> <span data-start="247.26" data-end="253.36">If the hash doesn't match, it is a bad peer.</span> <span data-start="253.36" data-end="256.13">Throw it away.</span> <span data-start="256.13" data-end="261.28">We have to take this list of hashes, what we call torrent file.</span> <span data-start="261.28" data-end="263.05">And we put it on the server.</span> <span data-start="263.05" data-end="268.12">It needs to distribute that.</span> <span data-start="268.12" data-end="269.48">That's pretty nice.</span> <span data-start="269.48" data-end="272.53">But it has to do with the problem.</span> <span data-start="272.53" data-end="276.759">You need people to talk to, to get the stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="276.759" data-end="277.9">How do we do that?</span> <span data-start="277.9" data-end="279.08">Well, dht.</span> <span data-start="279.08" data-end="280.85">Distributed hash table.</span> <span data-start="280.85" data-end="283.81">You know what it is?</span> <span data-start="283.81" data-end="284.99">All right!</span> <span data-start="284.99" data-end="292.78">So, it is basically a table that is dristributed.</span> <span data-start="292.78" data-end="295.25">So like a table, you put a key and value in.</span> <span data-start="295.25" data-end="301.85">And you can get the things that are stored, you get the values back.</span> <span data-start="301.85" data-end="304.2">We can just do something like this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="304.2" data-end="306.88">Take the torrent file and hash that.</span> <span data-start="306.88" data-end="308.7">A hash of hashers.</span> <span data-start="308.7" data-end="311.91">20 byte thing.</span> <span data-start="311.91" data-end="314.82">We store an address.</span> <span data-start="314.82" data-end="319.99">If we want to find out to share this file, we do a list of keys.</span> <span data-start="319.99" data-end="324.13">On the torrent file and we get peers back.</span> <span data-start="324.13" data-end="325.13">Supersimple.</span> <span data-start="325.13" data-end="332.12">And the bittorrent Dht is huge.</span> <span data-start="332.12" data-end="333.16">Crazy.</span> <span data-start="333.16" data-end="335.04">There are around 10 million nodes.</span> <span data-start="335.04" data-end="343.36">The database at any time is a database where you have 1 million nodes distributing data.</span> <span data-start="343.36" data-end="347.5">You need to take the 1 million people down to bring it down.</span> <span data-start="347.5" data-end="354">The biggest database out there.</span> <span data-start="354" data-end="356.01">It is how it works.</span> <span data-start="356.01" data-end="357.99">It is pretty simple.</span> <span data-start="357.99" data-end="359.9">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="359.9" data-end="363.72">So, let's move on.</span> <span data-start="363.72" data-end="367.92">So, bittorrent is good for distributing a bunch of data.</span> <span data-start="367.92" data-end="373.24">There is a huge amount of data on bittorrent.</span> <span data-start="373.24" data-end="375.05">That's cool.</span> <span data-start="375.05" data-end="378.61">But wouldn't it be cool if we could access all this data instantly.</span> <span data-start="378.61" data-end="383.05">That we don't have to wait to download all the data?</span> <span data-start="383.05" data-end="385.07">If we can make a bittorrent stream?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="385.07" data-end="387.76">It would be cool.</span> <span data-start="387.76" data-end="391.55">So, how can we do that?</span> <span data-start="391.55" data-end="393.08">All right.</span> <span data-start="393.08" data-end="399.92">So, streaming bittorrent means that we have these pieces, each equal pieces.</span> <span data-start="399.92" data-end="402.09">We fetch the piece we need.</span> <span data-start="402.09" data-end="408.7">If someone wants piece 5, we get piece 5.</span> <span data-start="408.7" data-end="411.06">You have a peer with piece 5.</span> <span data-start="411.06" data-end="414.61">You ask that peer to give it.</span> <span data-start="414.61" data-end="416.78">Again this introduces a problem.</span> <span data-start="416.78" data-end="418.55">This guy can become evil.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="418.55" data-end="421.95">And start being slow.</span> <span data-start="421.95" data-end="423.47">We are not getting our data.</span> <span data-start="423.47" data-end="427.4">If this peer is slow, we are not streaming.</span> <span data-start="427.4" data-end="429.11">That is a problem.</span> <span data-start="429.11" data-end="432.51">Luckily it is easy to improve this.</span> <span data-start="432.51" data-end="435.06">We fetch the piece from multiple peers.</span> <span data-start="435.06" data-end="439.91">We take the top 5 peers.</span> <span data-start="439.91" data-end="442.77">Rank them based on speed or something.</span> <span data-start="442.77" data-end="446.88">And we fetch the same piece from multiple people.</span> <span data-start="446.88" data-end="454.45">If one of the peers becomes slow, we can detect it and swap him out.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="454.45" data-end="456.08">With someone else.</span> <span data-start="456.08" data-end="460.09">That's pretty cool.</span> <span data-start="460.09" data-end="462.8">This gives the scenario where we waste bandwidth.</span> <span data-start="462.8" data-end="466.62">We are fetching the same data more than we need.</span> <span data-start="466.62" data-end="467.93">It doesn't really matter.</span> <span data-start="467.93" data-end="470.2">It is for critical pieces.</span> <span data-start="470.2" data-end="475.46">Only for when we have a..</span> <span data-start="475.46" data-end="481.56">It turns out it is a good algorithm.</span> <span data-start="481.56" data-end="483.77">As a module.</span> <span data-start="483.77" data-end="484.77">That's what we do these days.</span> <span data-start="484.77" data-end="487.29">It is called torrent-stream.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="487.29" data-end="493.08">It is a node module that allows you to fetch data.</span> <span data-start="493.08" data-end="496.48">And do this nice thing.</span> <span data-start="496.48" data-end="498.88">Where you just patch a torrentfile to a constructor.</span> <span data-start="498.88" data-end="506.49">You get the list of files in the torrent.</span> <span data-start="506.49" data-end="510.21">You can create streams right away.</span> <span data-start="510.21" data-end="512.07">You can do random access.</span> <span data-start="512.07" data-end="513.289">10 files.</span> <span data-start="513.289" data-end="514.5">Whyf wait?</span> <span data-start="514.5" data-end="522.51">It is transmitting data when it is ready.</span> <span data-start="522.51" data-end="524.54">What can we use that for?</span> <span data-start="524.54" data-end="528.7">It turns out streaming is pretty big on internet.</span> <span data-start="528.7" data-end="532.21">It is a billion dollar industry.</span> <span data-start="532.21" data-end="534.37">There are huge players out there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="534.37" data-end="536.3">People like Netflix.</span> <span data-start="536.3" data-end="541.33">And as it turns out that during peak hours when everybody is trying to watch House of</span> <span data-start="541.33" data-end="547.9">Cards it consumes 1/3 of internet traffic.</span> <span data-start="547.9" data-end="550.49">If you think about this number.</span> <span data-start="550.49" data-end="552.47">Fucking huge.</span> <span data-start="552.47" data-end="555.91">1/3 of the internet!</span> <span data-start="555.91" data-end="557.089">What?</span> <span data-start="557.089" data-end="566.42">So, natural conclusion, wouldn't it be cool if we take it if we use P2P.</span> <span data-start="566.42" data-end="569.529">Instead of Netflix?</span> <span data-start="569.529" data-end="572.74">I implemented this, peerflix.</span> <span data-start="572.74" data-end="582.9">It is a program that streams video using P2P and Bittorrent to Vlc.</span> <span data-start="582.9" data-end="586.029">I try to do a demo of that.</span> <span data-start="586.029" data-end="590.13">It is a live demo.</span> <span data-start="590.13" data-end="593.27">So, things might blow up.</span> <span data-start="593.27" data-end="595.55">There we go.</span> <span data-start="595.55" data-end="597.07">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="597.07" data-end="600.11">Just do like peerflix</span> <span data-start="600.11" data-end="604.85">You pass it a torrent.</span> <span data-start="604.85" data-end="613.81">What it will do now..</span> <span data-start="613.81" data-end="619.01">Go out and start fetching data from peers.</span> <span data-start="619.01" data-end="624.44">What you will see, it is on my screen here.</span> <span data-start="624.44" data-end="628.79">This is actually streaming now live, no caching.</span> <span data-start="628.79" data-end="630.589">This is like a video.</span> <span data-start="630.589" data-end="631.63">Documentary.</span> <span data-start="631.63" data-end="638.12">We can even do cool things like skip in the movie.</span> <span data-start="638.12" data-end="644.13">Even though we are streaming.</span> <span data-start="644.13" data-end="646.31">Hopefully.</span> <span data-start="646.31" data-end="648.49">(applause)</span> <span data-start="648.49" data-end="659.399">so, yeah, that's pretty awesome.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="659.399" data-end="664.85">And this gives us, I was watching the worldcup a couple of months back.</span> <span data-start="664.85" data-end="669.01">Germany won I think.</span> <span data-start="669.01" data-end="670.01">It was noticeable.</span> <span data-start="670.01" data-end="672">Where you had a game a lot of people were watching.</span> <span data-start="672" data-end="680.899">The quality, their online broadcasting dropped.</span> <span data-start="680.899" data-end="683.92">We can flip this around and do something opposite.</span> <span data-start="683.92" data-end="688.05">The more are watching, the better it runs.</span> <span data-start="688.05" data-end="690.07">We can actually increase quality.</span> <span data-start="690.07" data-end="691.99">Which is crazy.</span> <span data-start="691.99" data-end="696.24">The more people watch, the better it runs.</span> <span data-start="696.24" data-end="700.56">It is really cool.</span> <span data-start="700.56" data-end="703.75">And I mean, this is streaming video.</span> </p>
