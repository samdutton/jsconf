<p><span data-start="24.56" data-end="27.47">Hi everyone, and thank you for being here.</span> <span data-start="27.47" data-end="31.48">I am Razvan, I work for Adobe with a bunch of awesome</span> <span data-start="31.48" data-end="35.53">people on interesting things like CSS shapes, masking,</span> <span data-start="35.53" data-end="39.39">CSS blend modes, CSS regions, some of you may</span> <span data-start="39.39" data-end="42.96">know me for building the CSS shapes added to your Chrome</span> <span data-start="42.96" data-end="45.89">extension which allows you to edit shapes on the browser.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="45.89" data-end="48.93">In general I work on practical things.</span> <span data-start="48.93" data-end="53.42">None of that matters today, because today I want to show</span> <span data-start="53.42" data-end="56.78">you something which I'm fascinated about, and</span> <span data-start="56.78" data-end="60.98">that is unconventional uses of technology to admit</span> <span data-start="60.98" data-end="62.96">data and input.</span> <span data-start="62.96" data-end="69.979">This isn't so much a talk, but actually just a collection of demos other people have built,</span> <span data-start="69.979" data-end="72.36">and stories I founding really interesting in the</span> <span data-start="72.36" data-end="76.47">sense that they use technology in unexpected ways with</span> <span data-start="76.47" data-end="81.32">unexpected results .. so today I'm going to go briefly</span> <span data-start="81.32" data-end="85.45">into sound, how we can transmit data using sound, and</span> <span data-start="85.45" data-end="89.68">how we can build our own cheap version of the litmotion</span> <span data-start="89.68" data-end="91.82">just using sounds on your laptop.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="91.82" data-end="96.399">Then I'm just going to talk about a way of using light to communicate</span> <span data-start="96.399" data-end="98.89">to your computer, and if there's time depending, two</span> <span data-start="98.89" data-end="101.13">short stories about interesting ways to transmit</span> <span data-start="101.13" data-end="103.2">input to devices.</span> <span data-start="103.2" data-end="107.369">So without further ado, let's begin.</span> <span data-start="107.369" data-end="109.619">The year is 2013, October.</span> <span data-start="109.619" data-end="114.079">I come across this article on arstechnica, and it is about a</span> <span data-start="114.079" data-end="118.28">respected security researcher who supposedly found this</span> <span data-start="118.28" data-end="120.479">sophisticated piece of malware.</span> <span data-start="120.479" data-end="124.929">This was infecting his machines and spreading by ultrasound.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="124.929" data-end="129.27">What is more devious about it is that it couldn't be diagnosed</span> <span data-start="129.27" data-end="132.51">with forensic stools, and it didn't leave any traces.</span> <span data-start="132.51" data-end="134.62">That was odd.</span> <span data-start="134.62" data-end="140.319">This guy found out the ultrasound was the means of infection by repeatedly removing</span> <span data-start="140.319" data-end="146.3">stuff from the computers, the hard drive, network interface,</span> <span data-start="146.3" data-end="149.37">the memory, he changed so many components, and</span> <span data-start="149.37" data-end="152.14">it wasn't until he actually removed the soundcard, which</span> <span data-start="152.14" data-end="154.819">was controlling the speakers and microphone, that</span> <span data-start="154.819" data-end="156.26">the infection stopped.</span> <span data-start="156.26" data-end="161.269">Now, these claims are being contested by other security researchers who haven't been able</span> <span data-start="161.269" data-end="165.599">to reproduce the same effects using the logs.</span> <span data-start="165.599" data-end="169.629">But other security researchers have proved that it is actually</span> <span data-start="169.629" data-end="173.15">possible to infect the bias of another computer just using</span> <span data-start="173.15" data-end="175.349">ultrasound.</span> <span data-start="175.349" data-end="177.739">Quite scary, if you ask me.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="177.739" data-end="181.48">Around the same time, Boris Smus is an engineer for</span> <span data-start="181.48" data-end="185.959">Google, he was playing around with the WebAudio API and</span> <span data-start="185.959" data-end="190.329">trying to send data between devices using messages</span> <span data-start="190.329" data-end="192.68">encoded as ultrasound.</span> <span data-start="192.68" data-end="196.599">And he put together this library called Sonicnet.JS, which I'm going to use</span> <span data-start="196.599" data-end="200.64">today, and the way this works is that it takes a part</span> <span data-start="200.64" data-end="203.659">of the sound spectrum, specifically the part where you</span> <span data-start="203.659" data-end="207.579">can't hear it, the ultrasound spectrum, and it chunks that</span> <span data-start="207.579" data-end="211.54">into various bits and pieces and each letter of the alphabet</span> <span data-start="211.54" data-end="214.531">gets a portion of this ultrasound spectrum, so</span> <span data-start="214.531" data-end="218.55">when you want to send a message, you essentially encode</span> <span data-start="218.55" data-end="222.12">this as ultrasound and send it in a frequency which,</span> <span data-start="222.12" data-end="224.84">as adults, we can't hear.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="224.84" data-end="230.519">Some pets can hear it and small children, but it is kind of invisible or inaudible,</span> <span data-start="230.519" data-end="232.39">but rather than talk about it, I want to show</span> <span data-start="232.39" data-end="233.989">you a demo.</span> <span data-start="233.989" data-end="238.78">Full disclosure, this is a demo idea I took from Boris's</span> <span data-start="238.78" data-end="240.239">original experiments.</span> <span data-start="240.239" data-end="243.319">I just adapted it for this presentation.</span> <span data-start="243.319" data-end="246.29">So all credit goes to him on that.</span> <span data-start="246.29" data-end="249.23">What I'm going to do here, exit full screen mode and</span> <span data-start="249.23" data-end="251.75">on the right-hand side of the screen you're going to see</span> <span data-start="251.75" data-end="254.57">that I have this demo running on two devices: one is my</span> <span data-start="254.57" data-end="257.46">laptop and the other is a phone I have connected over</span> <span data-start="257.46" data-end="259.91">here via cable.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="259.91" data-end="265.13">They're both running the same demo and what I'm going to try to do is get them synchronised</span> <span data-start="265.13" data-end="268.23">just using ultrasound, and I really really hope this</span> <span data-start="268.23" data-end="270.59">works because there's so many things to go wrong with</span> <span data-start="270.59" data-end="273">the demos today.</span> <span data-start="273" data-end="274.89">Okay.</span> <span data-start="274.89" data-end="279.55">So just to get a sense of what is going on here, I'm going to turn on the visualiser.</span> <span data-start="279.55" data-end="282.65">This is bouncing around because it is hearing me speak,</span> <span data-start="282.65" data-end="284.86">but as I'm going to click on the icons on each one</span> <span data-start="284.86" data-end="287.889">of the devices, they are going to send out a message</span> <span data-start="287.889" data-end="290.72">in encoded ultrasound, and you're going to see a distinct</span> <span data-start="290.72" data-end="293.22">peak towards the right-hand side of the spectrum</span> <span data-start="293.22" data-end="294.74">over there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="294.74" data-end="296.43">Let's try this.</span> <span data-start="296.43" data-end="302.24">I'll start with my phone and start sending emoticons to my laptop.</span> <span data-start="302.24" data-end="305.99">It works!</span> <span data-start="311.28" data-end="317.24">This is unexpected.</span> <span data-start="317.24" data-end="318.24">It works.</span> <span data-start="318.24" data-end="320.68">Most of the time it works.</span> <span data-start="320.68" data-end="322.65">My laptop is picking up the ultrasound from the</span> <span data-start="322.65" data-end="327.99">phone, the phone itself, sometimes it doesn't actually</span> <span data-start="327.99" data-end="331.81">catch its own ultrasound back, so the speaker is over</span> <span data-start="331.81" data-end="334.259">here and the microphone is down here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="334.259" data-end="336.759">And there is actually a big caveat with microphones and</span> <span data-start="336.759" data-end="337.759">phones.</span> <span data-start="337.759" data-end="339.49">They're optimised for speech, not necessarily for</span> <span data-start="339.49" data-end="340.49">ultrasound.</span> <span data-start="340.49" data-end="343.78">This is one of the few devices I have which actually works with this.</span> <span data-start="343.78" data-end="347.28">But if you don't have ultrasound capable devices, you can do the</span> <span data-start="347.28" data-end="351.639">other thing and reverse, you can use audible sound spectrum,</span> <span data-start="351.639" data-end="354.759">so I'm going to switch both devices to audible.</span> <span data-start="354.759" data-end="355.759">Okay.</span> <span data-start="355.759" data-end="356.759">Allow.</span> <span data-start="356.759" data-end="358.68">And this is going to blast out a very annoying high</span> <span data-start="358.68" data-end="361.52">pitched sound, but doing essentially the same thing, so</span> <span data-start="361.52" data-end="368.87">I'll try this with my laptop now.</span> <span data-start="368.87" data-end="373.23">You can probably pick it up from my microphone.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="373.23" data-end="375.87">Ah.</span> <span data-start="375.87" data-end="380.819">Okay, it worked.</span> <span data-start="380.819" data-end="382.19">[applause].</span> <span data-start="382.19" data-end="386.569">You can't believe how happy I am.</span> <span data-start="386.569" data-end="391.68">I tried it many times, but all props to Boris, who built the library.</span> <span data-start="391.68" data-end="396.44">His work is amazing, and he should get the applause.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="396.44" data-end="399.87">So use case for this, we synchronise two devices.</span> <span data-start="399.87" data-end="404.009">Google used this library with a few motivations to use Google tone.</span> <span data-start="404.009" data-end="406.49">This is a browser extension which allows people who have the</span> <span data-start="406.49" data-end="410.78">same extension to share links using audible sound.</span> <span data-start="410.78" data-end="413.55">It has a nicer sound, but essentially if you're in</span> <span data-start="413.55" data-end="415.441">the room with someone, you want to share a link, you</span> <span data-start="415.441" data-end="419.129">just press a button and your laptop just speaks the link</span> <span data-start="419.129" data-end="422.25">towards the other device, which is kind of cool.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="422.25" data-end="424.5">It works over handouts, over a lot of things.</span> <span data-start="424.5" data-end="428.449">Nobody has to install everything more than Chrome, in this extension.</span> <span data-start="428.449" data-end="432.03">The big problem, though, is that you have to  —  your</span> <span data-start="432.03" data-end="435.77">laptop is always listening to the environment, so it</span> <span data-start="435.77" data-end="436.87">can pick up these links.</span> <span data-start="436.87" data-end="440.91">And I don't know about you, but that kind of creeps me out, so I don't use it.</span> <span data-start="440.91" data-end="443.22">Nonetheless, very cool extension.</span> <span data-start="443.22" data-end="447.87">Okay, switching gears to motion sensing using ultrasound.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="447.87" data-end="450.24">This one is very cool.</span> <span data-start="450.24" data-end="452.62">So the doppler effect.</span> <span data-start="452.62" data-end="454.139">You've all experienced these.</span> <span data-start="454.139" data-end="459.58">The doppler effect is this phenomenon of the apparent</span> <span data-start="459.58" data-end="464">frequency shift of a wave to a static observer as the</span> <span data-start="464" data-end="467.11">wave is being emitted by something in motion.</span> <span data-start="467.11" data-end="470.751">So imagine the last time you heard an ambulance siren, as</span> <span data-start="470.751" data-end="473.43">the ambulance is travelling towards you, you're hearing</span> <span data-start="473.43" data-end="477.509">a higher and higher pitch and the reason is that the source</span> <span data-start="477.509" data-end="479.68">of the sound, the ambulance, is travelling, and each</span> <span data-start="479.68" data-end="482.58">soundwave has to travel less and less to get to your</span> <span data-start="482.58" data-end="484.94">ear, therefore you're going to have more soundwaves</span> <span data-start="484.94" data-end="488.169">hitting your ear as the ambulance travels towards</span> <span data-start="488.169" data-end="489.169">you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="489.169" data-end="491.52">The same thing happens in reverse as it goes away from</span> <span data-start="491.52" data-end="495.37">you: soundwaves have to travel longer to get to</span> <span data-start="495.37" data-end="498.08">you because the source of the sound is going away, therefore</span> <span data-start="498.08" data-end="501.759">the pitch sounds like it is going lower and lower.</span> <span data-start="501.759" data-end="504.77">This is one of the fundamental principles in radar.</span> <span data-start="504.77" data-end="507.069">In radar, you have a base station which is emitting</span> <span data-start="507.069" data-end="509.8">a radio frequency, and it is listening for that same</span> <span data-start="509.8" data-end="512.72">frequency around the same spectrum.</span> <span data-start="512.72" data-end="516.03">Those radio frequencies are going to bounce back everything</span> <span data-start="516.03" data-end="518.72">they hit, so if you have an aeroplane in motion</span> <span data-start="518.72" data-end="521.71">coming towards you, the radar is able to use the</span> <span data-start="521.71" data-end="524.91">doppler effect in a lot more technology in maths than I'm</span> <span data-start="524.91" data-end="527.56">capable of, to basically determine if the aeroplane is</span> <span data-start="527.56" data-end="530.63">coming towards it or going away, then using an array</span> <span data-start="530.63" data-end="533.93">of radar systems you actually know where that aeroplane</span> <span data-start="533.93" data-end="538">is in space by triangulating the sound.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="538" data-end="543.029">Of course we have everything to build a radar system in the</span> <span data-start="543.029" data-end="546.57">computers, first of all replace the base station with</span> <span data-start="546.57" data-end="549.39">our laptop speakers, and we have the microphone over</span> <span data-start="549.39" data-end="553.93">there, and then we can use our hand to basically understand</span> <span data-start="553.93" data-end="556.06">where it is in relationship to the speakers and</span> <span data-start="556.06" data-end="559.95">what  —  how we're going to do that is use ultrasound.</span> <span data-start="559.95" data-end="566.25">Daniel Rapp built this very small library called doppler.</span> <span data-start="566.25" data-end="569.69">It sends out an ultrasound from my laptop speakers</span> <span data-start="569.69" data-end="571.99">and is also back for the same frequency.</span> <span data-start="571.99" data-end="577.01">What you're seeing on screen right now, once it settles, is actually</span> <span data-start="577.01" data-end="580.57">my laptop emitting around 20-kilohertz sound.</span> <span data-start="580.57" data-end="583.029">You can't hear it, I can't hear it, but it is here.</span> </p>
