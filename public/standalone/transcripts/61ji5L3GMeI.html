and</span> <span data-start="518.05" data-end="520">then we'll all come back together and</span> <span data-start="520" data-end="521.47">talk about what we did wrong because we</span> <span

data-end="528.52">better meetings with your team it's</span> <span data-start="528.52" data-end="530.32">about changing the way you actually</span> <span data-start="530.32" data-end="532.42">spend your time together and how you get</span> <span data-start="532.42" data-end="534.7">that work done so after this you can go</span> <span data-start="534.7" data-end="536.32">tell your team guess what

<span data-start="540.43" data-end="542.41">the term working session even in the</span> <span data-start="542.41" data-end="544.87">calendar in might I saw a change in the</span> <span

data-end="558.04">curious so these are working sessions</span> <span data-start="558.04" data-end="560.77">outside of that so what exactly is this</span> <span data-start="560.77" data-end="563.17">collaborative remote design working</span> <span data-start="563.17" data-end="563.77">session</span> <span data-start="563.77" data-end="566.11">well it's collaborative because no

this is a tricky layer right what</span> <span data-start="591.19" data-end="592.81">does it mean to be remote it doesn't</span> <span data-start="592.81" data-end="594.34">mean that everyone's working from home</span> <span data-start="594.34" data-end="596.08">it just means that you're not physically</span> <span data-start="596.08" data-end="597.73">co-located maybe there's people in a</span> <span data-start="597.73" data-end="599.26">different office or a different</span> <span data-start="599.26" data-end="600.82">conference room across campus this</span> <span

in</span> <span data-start="645.73" data-end="648.25">the room with them so when you set up</span> <span data-start="648.25" data-end="650.41">these working sessions to work remotely</span> <span data-start="650.41" data-end="652.57">you're forcing the adoption of tools and</span> <span data-start="652.57" data-end="654.46">best practices that make this content</span> <span data-start="654.46"

to</span> <span data-start="744.01" data-end="746.2">work remotely such as creating a virtual</span> <span data-start="746.2" data-end="747.82">whiteboard it creates a much more</span> <span

data-end="765.4">black hole or maybe you posted it on</span> <span data-start="765.4" data-end="767.14">slack and got a thumbs up emoji</span> <span data-start="767.14" data-end="770.11">until one day

with</span> <span data-start="775.39" data-end="776.86">the virtual whiteboard it can be</span> <span data-start="776.86" data-end="779.35">revisited modified updated and used</span> <span

so this is an example of mural a</span> <span data-start="789.85" data-end="791.65">tool that we use to recreate these</span> <span data-start="791.65" data-end="793.66">virtual whiteboards and share

everyone</span> <span data-start="809.89" data-end="811.69">along this journey of designing</span> <span data-start="811.69" data-end="813.7">something together the source here is</span> <span data-start="813.7" data-end="815.62">the Stanford d.school they have several</span> <span data-start="815.62" data-end="817.93">great resources for how to run workshops</span> <span data-start="817.93" data-end="820.75">with this lots of play books and sort of</span> <span data-start="820.75" data-end="822.43">worksheets and stuff to walk you through</span> <span data-start="822.43" data-end="823.75">how to do this but I'm going to cover</span> <span data-start="823.75" data-end="825.28">the quick basics because this could be</span> <span data-start="825.28" data-end="829.06">its own talk so just quickly first you</span> <span data-start="829.06" data-end="831.07">want to empathize with your users you</span> <span data-start="831.07" data-end="832.9">want to understand how they're feeling</span> <span data-start="832.9" data-end="834.43">what are their motivations gain an</span> <span data-start="834.43" data-end="836.86">empathic understanding of the problem</span> <span data-start="836.86" data-end="838.75">you're trying to solve then you're going</span> <span data-start="838.75" data-end="841.06">to define the problem or the hypothesis</span> <span data-start="841.06" data-end="842.98">so typically you create a human centered</span> <span data-start="842.98" data-end="844.96">problem statement which is really just a</span> <span data-start="844.96" data-end="846.73">fancy way of saying what are we doing</span> <span data-start="846.73" data-end="849.63">here for example how can we use</span> <span data-start="849.63" data-end="852.13">storytelling in a visual and compelling</span> <span data-start="852.13" data-end="853.96">way so our readers will want to learn</span> <span data-start="853.96" data-end="856.03">more and feel empowered to keep coming</span> <span data-start="856.03" data-end="858.76">back to our website instead of we want</span> <span data-start="858.76" data-end="860.68">our users to click and read our magazine</span> <span data-start="860.68" data-end="863.14">articles to drive up the number of page</span> <span data-start="863.14"

data-end="870.01">designs this is brainstorm this is where</span> <span data-start="870.01" data-end="871.99">the magic happens so you can include</span> <span data-start="871.99" data-end="874.57">ideas for visuals user experience how</span> <span data-start="874.57" data-end="877">you might talk to users even ideas for</span> <span data-start="877" data-end="878.29">infrastructure you think you might need</span> <span data-start="878.29" data-end="880.69">to solve the problem and then jump into</span> <span data-start="880.69" data-end="883.06">the prototype experimental phase this is</span> <span data-start="883.06" data-end="885.91">low fidelity designs wireframes whatever</span> <span data-start="885.91" data-end="887.77">you need to get a prototype together so</span> <span data-start="887.77" data-end="889.45">you can get it in front of users as</span> <span data-start="889.45" data-end="891.13">quickly as possible for immediate</span> <span data-start="891.13" data-end="893.35">feedback which brings you to testing and</span> <span data-start="893.35" data-end="895.66">it's okay to fail fast because you're</span> <span data-start="895.66" data-end="896.68">going to keep going through each of</span> <span data-start="896.68" data-end="898.36">these different stages as you learn more</span> <span data-start="898.36" data-end="901.45">about your users means how they're</span> <span data-start="901.45" data-end="903.28">feeling how they're thinking and</span> <span data-start="903.28" data-end="905.59">behaving to your designs so you can keep</span> <span data-start="905.59" data-end="909.67">improving so I want to share an example</span> <span

data-end="1444.45">more aware of when you're interrupting</span> <span data-start="1444.45" data-end="1445.86">someone when you have control of your</span> <span data-start="1445.86"

data-end="1519.07">of legacy code so that just kind of came</span> <span data-start="1519.07" data-end="1521.44">up but you can discuss and decide things</span> <span data-start="1521.44" data-end="1523.75">like slack is great but when is it</span> <span data-start="1523.75" data-end="1526.809">appropriate to use email maybe never we</span> <span data-start="1526.809"
