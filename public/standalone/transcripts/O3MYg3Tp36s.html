data-start="70.32" data-end="73.71">been an active contributor to know chess</span> <span data-start="73.71" data-end="75.42">since December 2015</span> <span data-start="75.42" data-end="78.93">it's like quite a while ago and I'm and</span> <span data-start="78.93" data-end="81.03">I know just to see like technical</span> <span data-start="81.03" data-end="82.56">steering committee and what that means</span> <span data-start="82.56" data-end="86.49">is that I am one of the people who like</span> <span data-start="86.49" data-end="88.74">if there is no consensus among the you</span> <span data-start="88.74" data-end="91.619">know chess collaborator group where the</span> <span data-start="91.619" data-end="93.42">people who decide what actually happens</span> <span data-start="93.42" data-end="96.119">or we try to set the the general</span> <span data-start="96.119" data-end="98.72">direction for where the project is going</span> <span data-start="98.72" data-end="101.52">like that that also means that like if</span> <span data-start="101.52" data-end="103.11">you want to complain about something or</span> <span data-start="103.11" data-end="105.149">anything you can like I personally can</span> <span data-start="105.149" data-end="110.82">come to and it's like I'm gonna start</span> <span data-start="110.82" data-end="112.439">this start by like describing how I</span> <span data-start="112.439" data-end="115.979">originally got into coding in Noches I'm</span> <span data-start="115.979" data-end="118.799">contributing to know chess itself and so</span> <span data-start="118.799" data-end="121.5">like there's this I hope you can you all</span> <span data-start="121.5" data-end="129.39">read that I not that's what so like</span> <span data-start="129.39" data-end="132.54">basically it's like setting using</span> <span data-start="132.54" data-end="134.31">timeout with like invalid parameters</span> <span data-start="134.31" data-end="137.43">using the like accidentally passing a</span> <span data-start="137.43" data-end="139.769">number twice and like don't ask me why I</span> <span data-start="139.769" data-end="142.469">did that I I had something like that in</span> <span data-start="142.469" data-end="144.18">my code once and like I couldn't really</span> <span data-start="144.18" data-end="145.92">figure out where wearing that coat that</span> <span data-start="145.92" data-end="147.719">was means like that was the original</span> <span data-start="147.719" data-end="150.06">stack race that you were getting and I'm</span> <span data-start="150.06" data-end="151.92">still I just don't think you're getting</span> <span data-start="151.92" data-end="155.34">it unknown far and so yeah just like</span> <span data-start="155.34" data-end="156.989">it's it's blowing up when it tries to</span> <span data-start="156.989" data-end="159.72">call that function which is 1000 which</span> <span data-start="159.72" data-end="161.939">is not a function so it's not going to</span> <span data-start="161.939" data-end="166.17">work and so like yeah that was</span> <span data-start="166.17" data-end="167.76">frustrating to debug and actually the</span> <span data-start="167.76" data-end="169.769">the easiest way that I could think of</span> <span data-start="169.769" data-end="171.26">debugging this was like to actually</span> <span data-start="171.26" data-end="173.909">patch note card so that it would like</span> <span data-start="173.909" data-end="177.12">throw an error if if the function first</span> <span data-start="177.12" data-end="180.299">the timeout is not actually function so</span> <span data-start="180.299" data-end="182.879">like this is I mean there were tests and</span> <span data-start="182.879" data-end="184.23">there were what's the documentation</span> <span data-start="184.23" data-end="185.79">change and everything it like with this</span> <span data-start="185.79" data-end="187.769">but basically this was all the patch to</span> <span data-start="187.769" data-end="191.069">us like if the callbacks not a function</span> <span data-start="191.069" data-end="194.069">then like complain immediately so you</span> <span data-start="194.069" data-end="197.909">would get a proper stack trace and yeah</span> <span data-start="197.909" data-end="200.4">and like i mentioning this because like</span> <span data-start="200.4" data-end="203.94">it's it's just that a like no jess is</span> <span data-start="203.94" data-end="205.56">part of your application if you build</span> <span data-start="205.56" data-end="209.04">something in note so it means like every</span> <span data-start="209.04" data-end="210.329">improvement that you make to note makes</span> <span data-start="210.329" data-end="212.489">your code better and like if there is</span> <span data-start="212.489" data-end="214.379">something that you think that note could</span> <span data-start="214.379" data-end="215.22">do better</span> <span data-start="215.22" data-end="217.409">you can like try to come up with a pull</span> <span data-start="217.409" data-end="219.209">request or maybe even choose open issue</span> <span data-start="219.209" data-end="221.579">or something it's a lot of these small</span> <span data-start="221.579" data-end="224.639">things that that actually make note a</span> <span data-start="224.639" data-end="229.489">great software like for example like</span> <span data-start="229.489" data-end="231.93">after he like seven or eight last pull</span> <span data-start="231.93" data-end="234.15">requests that I opened like two were</span> <span data-start="234.15" data-end="237.449">actual bug fixes for like HTTP to stuff</span> <span data-start="237.449" data-end="240.06">and the like five of them were just like</span> <span data-start="240.06" data-end="242.22">stuff that I ran along the way while I</span> <span data-start="242.22" data-end="244.919">was debugging them just like thinking</span> <span data-start="244.919" data-end="247.049">okay yeah this is not helpful what note</span> <span data-start="247.049" data-end="249.419">does their so let's do something more</span> <span data-start="249.419" data-end="253.109">helpful okay yeah so why was I talking</span> <span data-start="253.109" data-end="254.579">about that and like why I'm talking</span> <span data-start="254.579" data-end="257.579">about no chase in general it's not just</span> <span data-start="257.579" data-end="260.13">because like I'm a core contributor it's</span> <span data-start="260.13" data-end="263.34">also because like before I made that</span> <span data-start="263.34" data-end="265.229">patch and like before later I started</span> <span data-start="265.229" data-end="266.22">watching the no J</span> <span data-start="266.22" data-end="269.19">no repository and everything I didn't</span> <span data-start="269.19" data-end="272.22">really have a lot of a lot of concept</span> <span data-start="272.22" data-end="274.47">about what was going on inside the court</span> <span data-start="274.47" data-end="277.92">no just community it's kind of like it</span> <span data-start="277.92" data-end="280.53">was kind of like its own separate world</span> <span data-start="280.53" data-end="283.98">and and I know that a lot of people in</span> <span data-start="283.98" data-end="285.3">the community still feel kind of</span> <span data-start="285.3" data-end="288.69">disconnected from from what's happening</span> <span data-start="288.69" data-end="291.51">there like most of you probably just</span> <span data-start="291.51" data-end="294.12">like take the releases of notice they</span> <span data-start="294.12" data-end="295.65">come and like update every once in a</span> <span data-start="295.65" data-end="299.07">while and sometimes hear about new cool</span> <span data-start="299.07" data-end="302.37">features or something but but basically</span> <span data-start="302.37" data-end="305.55">that's it and like I think it would be</span> <span data-start="305.55" data-end="310.05">cool for both sides if they're like if</span> <span data-start="310.05" data-end="311.25">people had more of an idea what was</span> <span data-start="311.25" data-end="313.62">happening a note and if we note core</span> <span data-start="313.62" data-end="315.2">people have more of an idea what was</span> <span data-start="315.2" data-end="319.169">what what users actually do it need any</span> <span data-start="319.169" data-end="321.36">like it's not like none of us are</span> <span data-start="321.36" data-end="324.18">actually are aren't users either but you</span> <span data-start="324.18" data-end="328.83">know okay so and where are we now with</span> <span data-start="328.83" data-end="330.87">note as to like no tennis just around</span> <span data-start="330.87" data-end="334.08">the corner it's probably going to come</span> <span data-start="334.08" data-end="336.84">out in April until yesterday I thought</span> <span data-start="336.84" data-end="338.28">it was definitely coming out in April</span> <span data-start="338.28" data-end="341.419">[Laughter]</span> <span data-start="341.419" data-end="344.64">okay yeah so I'm gonna like maybe</span> <span data-start="344.64" data-end="350.669">mention that later but yeah probably so</span> <span data-start="350.669" data-end="353.04">like what's gonna have its features like</span> <span data-start="353.04" data-end="359.04">yes modules which yet excited like too</span> <span data-start="359.04" data-end="366.39">early it's like I probably can't speak</span> <span data-start="366.39" data-end="368.28">as much to it as I should because like I</span> <span data-start="368.28" data-end="369.81">try to stay away from that topic because</span> <span data-start="369.81" data-end="373.61">like it's</span> <span data-start="373.61" data-end="376.439">it's not it's not like healthy to like</span> <span data-start="376.439" data-end="378.449">talk about it a lot</span> <span data-start="378.449" data-end="381.779">htv-2 which is like a lot more fun and</span> <span data-start="381.779" data-end="385.559">which like I'm participating in a lot</span> <span data-start="385.559" data-end="389.3">more icing hooks which you may have</span> <span data-start="389.3" data-end="392.869">heard of might probably not have used</span> <span data-start="392.869" data-end="395.129">but like it's pretty cool thing and</span> <span data-start="395.129" data-end="396.779">people are building pretty cool things</span> <span data-start="396.779" data-end="400.11">with it and yeah you're gonna want to</span> <span data-start="400.11" data-end="403.709">know about that an API just like also</span> <span data-start="403.709" data-end="406.019">very very specific it's just like for</span> <span data-start="406.019" data-end="410.069">native add-on authors but it's is it's a</span> <span data-start="410.069" data-end="413.969">cool new thing and note then there are</span> <span data-start="413.969"

after</span> <span data-start="1181.299" data-end="1183.789">ok and because it's a request like</span> <span data-start="1183.789" data-end="1186.489">request means it only like it's when</span> <span

<span data-start="1349.66" data-end="1351.64">have like to do things like explicitly</span> <span data-start="1351.64" data-end="1354.61">convert like say this value convert it</span> <span

data-end="1408.49">that and so like we have like if you</span> <span data-start="1408.49" data-end="1410.26">don't use async await at this point you</span> <span data-start="1410.26" data-end="1412">should just like telling you this is</span> <span data-start="1412" data-end="1418.57">just like really really really nice you</span> <span data-start="1418.57" data-end="1420.46">have we have a weight support entity in</span> <span data-start="1420.46" data-end="1423.25">the wrapper right now I think that's</span> <span data-start="1423.25" data-end="1426.09">also just like coming out in no 10</span> <span data-start="1426.09" data-end="1428.92">because like we actually have to like do</span> <span data-start="1428.92" data-end="1432.73">some weird transpiration inside the</span> <span data-start="1432.73" data-end="1435.91">repple like previously previously didn't</span> <span data-start="1435.91" data-end="1437.5">do that</span> <span data-start="1437.5" data-end="1439.39">but we think it's</span> <span data-start="1439.39" data-end="1441.88">it's like we have to ship an actual like</span> <span data-start="1441.88" data-end="1446.23">parsing library

data-end="1466.75">module FS / promises coming in no 10 and</span> <span data-start="1466.75" data-end="1469.21">that is actually going to be like all</span> <span data-start="1469.21"

<p><span data-start="1483.91" data-end="1486.64">API you're working with the actual raw</span> <span data-start="1486.64" data-end="1489.16">numbers which is not that nice piece</span> <span data-start="1489.16" data-end="1491.23">like I mean you can open a file and</span> <span data-start="1491.23" data-end="1493.18">basically forget to close it and just</span> <span data-start="1493.18" data-end="1498.13">like it's going to leak resources if you</span> <span data-start="1498.13" data-end="1499.72">are not really really careful</span> <span data-start="1499.72" data-end="1502">like if

leak it's</span> <span data-start="1506.47" data-end="1508.57">like there's the one change that is</span> <span data-start="1508.57" data-end="1511.42">different from the normal FS API that</span> <span data-start="1511.42" data-end="1513.1">you don't actually work with your raw</span> <span data-start="1513.1" data-end="1514.9">file descriptors to work with wrappers</span> <span data-start="1514.9" data-end="1518.29">and like if you if they get garbage</span> <span data-start="1518.29" data-end="1519.55">collected they're going to show you a</span> <span data-start="1519.55" data-end="1521.35">warning it's like hey you forgot to</span> <span data-start="1521.35" data-end="1525.91">close this that's also pretty nice and I</span> <span data-start="1525.91" data-end="1530.5">think iterators which is like something</span> <span data-start="1530.5" data-end="1534.25">that I think is like you don't need a</span> <span data-start="1534.25" data-end="1536.77">flag for it in no.10 anymore like just</span> <span data-start="1536.77" data-end="1539.49">to have the the engine exposed to us and</span> <span data-start="1539.49" data-end="1541.63">like we're going to implement that in</span> <span data-start="1541.63" data-end="1543.88">some way for for redline and for screams</span> <span data-start="1543.88" data-end="1545.95">it's like you can actually do something</span> <span data-start="1545.95" data-end="1549.58">like for racing cons shank off-screen</span> <span data-start="1549.58" data-end="1551.83">instead of like listening to the data</span> <span data-start="1551.83" data-end="1554.17">event of a stream also like really</span> <span data-start="1554.17" data-end="1557.89">really cool and so like yeah I mentioned</span> <span data-start="1557.89" data-end="1559.45">in the beginning that there were changes</span> <span data-start="1559.45" data-end="1563.35">to our error system and it's like every</span> <span data-start="1563.35" data-end="1565.36">error in node is going to eventually</span> <span data-start="1565.36"

look something</span> <span data-start="1572.92" data-end="1574.75">like this like this is just like a very</span> <span data-start="1574.75" data-end="1577.29">simple example of use like passing in a</span> <span data-start="1577.29" data-end="1580.66">just like invalid thing to a function</span> <span data-start="1580.66" data-end="1583.12">like you can't listen on an array with a</span> <span

data-start="1596.68" data-end="1602.09">code on that on that error</span> <span data-start="1602.1" data-end="1604.51">yeah and that also means like if you're</span> <span data-start="1604.51" data-end="1607.24">currently like the motivation for this</span> <span data-start="1607.24" data-end="1608.8">is that like a lot of people were</span> <span data-start="1608.8" data-end="1611.74">checking the the error text the error</span> <span data-start="1611.74" data-end="1614.5">message when they like to figure out</span> <span data-start="1614.5"

data-end="1624.07">and that's not really cool because that</span> <span data-start="1624.07" data-end="1625.63">means that changing an error message is</span> <span data-start="1625.63"

data-end="1693.13">and want to make that happen really soon</span> <span data-start="1693.13" data-end="1695.77">like that is what the API would</span> <span data-start="1695.77" data-end="1697.54">currently look like if those patches</span> <span data-start="1697.54" data-end="1700.15">were accepted as they currently are it's</span> <span data-start="1700.15" data-end="1703.41">like completely up for debate but</span> <span data-start="1703.41" data-end="1705.63">yeah you could just like have work as a</span> <span data-start="1705.63"
