I should</span> <span data-start="3227.764" data-end="3232.57">share a bit about context and  how Supportingbox does code</span> <span data-start="3232.571" data-end="3235.818">reviews. We store nearly all of our code</span> <span data-start="3237.353" data-end="3241.154">on GitHub. We used shared  repositories dedicated to</span> <span data-start="3241.79" data-end="3243.795">whatever engagement we are  working on. Developers have -</span> <span data-start="3244.407" data-end="3247.358">whenever developers have new  code to add to the project, they</span> <span data-start="3247.684" data-end="3249.684">ask another developer for code  review of the</span> <span data-start="3253.569" data-end="3257.527">pull request. I've come up with  six rules that Sparkbox adheres</span> <span data-start="3257.528" data-end="3262.801">to. I came up with these rules.  So, I do not represent the</span> <span data-start="3262.802" data-end="3264.802">thoughts and ideas of</span> <span data-start="3269.011" data-end="3271.246">my employer. Rule number one is  no-one merges their own</span> <span data-start="3275.172" data-end="3279.508">close. One developer is writing  emerging piece for a website.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3280.02" data-end="3282.62">Last year, we had a client who  wanted an additional full-time</span> <span data-start="3282.621" data-end="3284.918">developer for the project but  they would be the only developer</span> <span data-start="3285.209" data-end="3288.25">on that project. We offered  instead two developers at half</span> <span data-start="3288.461" data-end="3290.461">time. Having a reviewer is that</span> <span data-start="3295.452" data-end="3297.526">important to us. The second rule is never push directly to</span> <span data-start="3298.02" data-end="3301.356">master. It is the easiest way to break everything. Requiring code</span> <span data-start="3302.396" data-end="3307.037">review reinforces the quality  that comes value as the company.</span> <span data-start="3307.413" data-end="3312.037">Third rule:  if you're working  with UI, get a design review. We</span> <span data-start="3312.357" data-end="3315.919">have a position called a  front-end designer. Every</span> <span data-start="3316.197" data-end="3319.68">project we design, this special  designer will often write for an</span> <span data-start="3320.067" data-end="3323.47">end code so they may use some  CSS but not every company has</span> <span data-start="3326.954" data-end="3329.856">designers who knows how to code, and nor should they. If you're</span> <span data-start="3330.495" data-end="3332.495">working on copy, get a</span> <span data-start="3336.536" data-end="3339.837">copy review. This is usually the project manager or the client</span> <span data-start="3340.175" data-end="3342.175">themselves. We have an  integrated development process,</span> <span data-start="3342.776" data-end="3346.703">so the clients usually have  access to the repositories we're</span> <span data-start="3346.704" data-end="3350.754">working on. Rule number 5 is  never, ever push directly to</span> <span data-start="3350.959" data-end="3352.959">master. Again, unless you</span> <span data-start="3355.952" data-end="3359.749">messed up. Which, if you did,  find a Buddy to pair with, which</span> <span data-start="3360.163" data-end="3363.908">leads me to rule number of 6,  these rules are more like</span> <span data-start="3363.909" data-end="3366.162">guidelines.  If you follow these six rules it</span> <span data-start="3366.163" data-end="3371.015">ensures that we follow the basic Sparkbox creed which is working</span> <span data-start="3371.317" data-end="3374.742">together for a web bit right. If every piece of code has at least</span> <span data-start="3374.743" data-end="3377.888">two people contributing to it,  we often catch mistakes before</span> <span data-start="3378.165" data-end="3382.497">they happen. All of that is  context for about what I'm about</span> <span data-start="3382.671" data-end="3385.757">to talk about. It may be  different for you in your</span> <span data-start="3386.078" data-end="3389.035">company; it's just how we like  to work. I'm not telling you how</span> <span data-start="3389.557" data-end="3391.557">you should do code</span> <span data-start="3394.223" data-end="3396.549">reviews. Some challenges of  collaboration are getting a PR</span> <span data-start="3396.55" data-end="3402.84">from a non-coder, or or a PR  review from someone in a</span> <span data-start="3402.841" data-end="3406.098">different time zone. It's not  that easy. Working with</span> <span data-start="3406.503" data-end="3409.765">developers who may be only doing reviews on your project</span> <span data-start="3412.897" data-end="3418.424">or working with people who are  assigned directly to PR review</span> <span data-start="3418.62" data-end="3424.606">and nothing else. So, how do we  improve these things? So I'm</span> <span data-start="3424.607" data-end="3427.796">going to give you six steps, I  think. I guess I like the number</span> <span data-start="3428.498" data-end="3433.712">6!  Tip number 1:  write good  stories. Two, ensure good pull</span> <span data-start="3434.148" data-end="3436.148">requests. We have to write good</span> <span data-start="3438.169" data-end="3444.694">issues. At Sparkbox,ee use  Trello to organise engagements,</span> <span data-start="3445.206" data-end="3448.895">usually with something like Scrm which involves creating stories</span> <span data-start="3448.896" data-end="3453.608">which is a GitHub issue  representing a bite-sized chunk</span> <span data-start="3453.609" data-end="3457.123">of work. Stories should include  the requirements of the work,</span> <span data-start="3457.124" data-end="3460.789">and potentially a solution if  you have one in mind. A story or</span> <span data-start="3461.004" data-end="3464.296">issue doesn't need to be overly  complicated but it should be</span> <span data-start="3464.297" data-end="3468.14">easy to understand. A  well-written story makes for</span> <span data-start="3468.141" data-end="3470.864">clear requirements when it comes time to do a PR, and this leads</span> <span data-start="3471.526" data-end="3476.333">you to my very first  recommendation:  the only one</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3476.643" data-end="3479.132">GitHub exclusive but I'm sure  there's one similar on the other</span> <span data-start="3479.724" data-end="3483.267">technologies. For reference in  the photo, this is my co-worker</span> <span data-start="3483.268" data-end="3486.259">Austin who is a project manager  explaining that this footer is</span> <span data-start="3486.26" data-end="3490.16">not great so maybe we can use  some of the other colours</span> <span data-start="3490.776" data-end="3496.731">instead. So GitHub issue and  GitHub issue templates and PR</span> <span data-start="3497.071" data-end="3499.633">templates allow you to add a  markdown file to the root</span> <span data-start="3499.634" data-end="3502.915">directory to outline the issue  process. I will share this link</span> <span data-start="3503.645" data-end="3506.119">again in a minute. This is an  issue template. Here is my</span> <span data-start="3506.531" data-end="3508.607">markdown. It is included</span> <span data-start="3515.589" data-end="3517.634">directly in my project. In  addition to adding the template</span> <span data-start="3518.062" data-end="3522.218">file to the root of your  template, you can add a GitHub</span> <span data-start="3522.219" data-end="3525.692">directory. PR templates work in  the same way but have a</span> <span data-start="3526.103" data-end="3528.581">different file name and they  come up with you do a PR instead</span> <span data-start="3528.778" data-end="3533.101">of an issue. So here is the  issue template on GitHub. When I</span> <span data-start="3533.102" data-end="3537.134">click the new issue button, the  text field pop lays with the</span> <span data-start="3537.564" data-end="3539.728">contents of the template file  and the example files are stored</span> <span data-start="3540.702" data-end="3545.172">in the repo I linked at the  begin. I will link it again, I</span> <span data-start="3545.563" data-end="3547.563">think.  If you want to take a</span> <span data-start="3549.972" data-end="3552.107">closer look. Talk with your  project team to decide what you</span> <span data-start="3552.586" data-end="3556.393">should put into a template. Mine is just an example. It is a very</span> <span data-start="3558.306" data-end="3561.711">flat example. A checklist is  nice. There is that link again.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3561.712" data-end="3563.712">I will give you about 30</span> <span data-start="3568.726" data-end="3572.075">seconds. Tip number 2 is to get  the basics right. A good way to</span> <span data-start="3572.624" data-end="3574.925">frustrate your pull request  reviewer is to send them</span> <span data-start="3575.096" data-end="3577.096">something with absolutely</span> <span data-start="3578.466" data-end="3581.682">no context. You could respond in kind. These are</span> <span data-start="3586.477" data-end="3589.41">real PRs. But but a few extra  minutes to write a thoughtful PR</span> <span data-start="3589.85" data-end="3593.463">description can go a long way  towards easing the work of the</span> <span data-start="3593.464" data-end="3599.699">reviewer. We try to include a  quick summary of the work being</span> <span data-start="3599.7" data-end="3601.7">done, usually matching your  commit</span> <span data-start="3604.223" data-end="3607.333">descriptions. Link to any GitHub issues or stories, especially if</span> <span data-start="3607.717" data-end="3615.297">you're using something like  sudden hub, Giraffe or Agile. A</span> <span data-start="3615.574" data-end="3619.155">link or screen shot of the  original design work if you're</span> <span data-start="3619.156" data-end="3623.82">working in UI.

Step by</span> <span data-start="3628.046" data-end="3630.875">step instructions including how  to run the lint or how to run</span> <span data-start="3631.424" data-end="3634.536">the tests, how to navigate to  any new work, how specifically</span> <span data-start="3634.537" data-end="3638.768">your new work is meant to  function. So here's that PR</span> <span data-start="3640.516" data-end="3643.995">example again. My other  co-worker, Bryan, he has hit a</span> <span data-start="3645.789" data-end="3648.81">number of these tips. They  should be written in the context</span> <span data-start="3649.178" data-end="3652.066">of the developer reviewing the  work. For example, a PR to a</span> <span data-start="3652.067" data-end="3656.957">developer who is only doing  review or QA may look completely</span> <span data-start="3656.958" data-end="3660.489">different to the one who wrote  the build process. All right.</span> </p>

What is it, and why is it so</span> <span data-start="5799.733" data-end="5804.052">important to talk about?  Before we understand what</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="5804.839" data-end="5807.245">Houdini is, we need to  understand the history behind</span> <span data-start="5807.789" data-end="5811.283">it, which led to the creation of Houdini. Of course, as</span> <span data-start="5811.284" data-end="5815.822">developers, how does that help  us? I must mention that this is</span> <span data-start="5816.212" data-end="5819.692">going to be a bit of a technical talk, so we will be seeing a lot</span> <span data-start="5819.864" data-end="5825.319">of code here. But before we get, I want to know how many guys</span> <span data-start="5825.687" data-end="5828.048">have heard about Houdini or  maybe have experimented with</span> <span data-start="5831.796" data-end="5835.188">Houdini before? Okay. A few  people. That's great. You guys</span> <span data-start="5835.935" data-end="5838.429">might be wondering why I'm  talking about CSS in a</span> <span data-start="5838.959" data-end="5841.528">JavaScript conference, right? It doesn't make any sense. If you</span> <span data-start="5841.529" data-end="5848.54">look at it, Houdini is not just  about CSS or writing better UI,</span> <span data-start="5848.925" data-end="5852.623">it is more about its connection  with JavaScript that makes</span> <span data-start="5853.887" data-end="5856.859">extending and developing not  just CSS but the complete</span> <span data-start="5857.067" data-end="5861.676">experience, and we will get to  it. First, let's travel back to</span> <span data-start="5863.686" data-end="5867.415">1994 when the W3C was formed.  More and more people are getting</span> <span data-start="5867.899" data-end="5871.715">involved with the World Wide  Web, and as they did, they</span> <span data-start="5871.716" data-end="5877.021">started bringing in new ideas,  suggestions and feedback. And</span> <span data-start="5877.716" data-end="5882.817">within a year or two, JavaScript and CSS were released. The web</span> <span data-start="5882.818" data-end="5889.031">seemed to be growing at an  extremely rapid pace, and the</span> <span data-start="5889.032" data-end="5891.563">feedback cycle in place, there  was the need to keep the process</span> <span data-start="5891.564" data-end="5896.609">stable. So the W3C was  performed. Its job s to to</span> <span data-start="5898.58" data-end="5900.58">ensure that the web was built on</span> <span data-start="5902.889" data-end="5907.395">open standards. A lot of things  happened between 1995 to 2007.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="5907.396" data-end="5911.919">The DOM was introduced. Ajax  came into play, and made</span> <span data-start="5911.92" data-end="5915.859">possible the development of  truly asynchronous applications,</span> <span data-start="5916.705" data-end="5923.42">and, of course, proper web 2.0.  Development started awaiting</span> <span data-start="5923.934" data-end="5926.169">their own solutions for common  problems, you know, in the form</span> <span data-start="5926.17" data-end="5934.299">of small tools and libraries,  made the famous library by John,</span> <span data-start="5934.55" data-end="5942.514">and then in 2010, Sharpe  introduced the idea of ..</span> <span data-start="5942.515" data-end="5945.257">levels. The whole game was  shifting and backwards</span> <span data-start="5945.965" data-end="5948.146">compatibility has been a huge  deal for us, so keeping that in</span> <span data-start="5948.534" data-end="5954.352">mind, developers starting using  and developing levels. As the</span> <span data-start="5954.353" data-end="5960.719">web grew further, there was sort of a feeling of dissatisfaction</span> <span data-start="5960.72" data-end="5964.456">or a disconnect between the  community on how these web</span> <span data-start="5964.888" data-end="5967.47">standard committees were  creating and prioritising new</span> <span data-start="5969.382" data-end="5972.759">features. So, that's what led to the creation of the</span> <span data-start="5975.957" data-end="5981.979">ostensible web manifesto. It  aims at creating this feedback -</span> <span data-start="5982.663" data-end="5986.334">virtues feedback cycle with  developers having the ability to</span> <span data-start="5987.547" data-end="5991.283">experiment and Polyfill  standards so they can test</span> <span data-start="5991.284" data-end="5994.812">implementation and gain insight  out of it. This movement started</span> <span data-start="5997.41" data-end="6001.155">by some of the most notable  members of the community, Alex</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="6001.156" data-end="6005.919">Russell, Bryan Carlisle, and  many other people.</span> <span data-start="6005.92" data-end="6008.529">And for the first couple of  years, the standard bodies have</span> <span data-start="6009.009" data-end="6015.109">been worked really hard on  working on projects, providing</span> <span data-start="6015.599" data-end="6019.557">early access to features,  building transpilers, and in</span> <span data-start="6019.558" data-end="6022.069">general, giving developers the  freedom to build and to build</span> <span data-start="6022.806" data-end="6026.57">new proposals and  specifications. And obviously,</span> <span data-start="6026.571" data-end="6031.338">in order to do this,  environments need to understand</span> <span data-start="6031.902" data-end="6034.168">the — developers need to  understand the underlying magic</span> <span data-start="6034.448" data-end="6037.086">of the underlying browser  features, because if you look at</span> <span data-start="6037.087" data-end="6041.745">it, most of the web is high  level, and it's extremely hard</span> <span data-start="6041.746" data-end="6048.886">to Polyfill or test new features out. And that's why the</span> <span data-start="6049.669" data-end="6051.669">ostensible web manifesto also  argues that the standard bodies</span> <span data-start="6051.874" data-end="6055.674">should also expose and explain  the underlying platform</span> <span data-start="6056.124" data-end="6059.093">features, or the low-level  capabilities of the platform.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="6059.69" data-end="6061.774">This obviously leads to quicker  feedback by the community and</span> <span data-start="6063.371" data-end="6066.709">new APIs and features, and  quicker bug fixes, improvements,</span> <span data-start="6066.983" data-end="6073.324">and overall streamlining of the  standardisation process. Now,</span> <span data-start="6074.555" data-end="6080.206">taking this further, what if we  were to Polyfill a new script</span> <span data-start="6081.209" data-end="6085.207">feature? Can we do that? Of  course we can, right. How many</span> <span data-start="6085.621" data-end="6089.334">have been using the latest  browser features since Year 6</span> <span data-start="6089.811" data-end="6093.291">came out? Gentlemen, exactly. A  lot of people. That's how</span> <span data-start="6093.609" data-end="6095.609">flexible things have become.</span> <span data-start="6099.096" data-end="6102.88">Instead of waiting for browser  vendors to implement you in</span> <span data-start="6103.895" data-end="6106.991">features, developers can make  and experiment with the latest</span> <span data-start="6107.88" data-end="6111.548">features. But what if you were  to Polyfill may be a new CSS</span> <span data-start="6112.291" data-end="6117.466">layout, or maybe a new fill  type? Can we do that? Well, not</span> <span data-start="6119.548" data-end="6122.048">really, because producers don't  understand how to extend to CSS.</span> <span data-start="6122.281" data-end="6128.999">I mean, we cannot simply define  a new display, or a new fill</span> <span data-start="6129" data-end="6131.996">type because all unknown values  are discarded by the CSS engine.</span> <span data-start="6132.209" data-end="6138.955">That's the main problem. So  where is the underlying CSS</span> <span data-start="6140.646" data-end="6145.141">magic? It's all here in front of us. In order to fix this</span> <span data-start="6146.931" data-end="6150.902">disconnect, between the  extensible web guidelines and</span> <span data-start="6150.903" data-end="6155.647">the ability of CSS itself, W3C  have formed this sort of a joint</span> <span data-start="6155.963" data-end="6158.092">task-force, and this task-force  is codenamed</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="6162.807" data-end="6167.342">Houdini. It's named after one of the most magicians of all time,</span> <span data-start="6167.343" data-end="6172.335">Mr Harry Houdini.  The aim is to expose the</span> <span data-start="6172.859" data-end="6174.61">rendering engine internals to  developers so that they can</span> <span data-start="6174.611" data-end="6180.337">extend it and create better user experiences. So Houdini will</span> <span data-start="6180.905" data-end="6184.863">help in explaining and exposing  the magic of layout and styling</span> <span data-start="6185.059" data-end="6189.195">done by the CSS engine, so we  will be able to hook into the</span> <span data-start="6189.534" data-end="6191.75">processes in the rendering  pipeline, and be able to do all</span> <span data-start="6191.917" data-end="6196.292">sorts of things — create custom  layouts, define new paint and</span> <span data-start="6196.842" data-end="6200.886">fill types, whatever. Basically, an extension of CSS it will be a</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="6202.407" data-end="6204.407">JavaScript, which is</span> <span data-start="6211.864" data-end="6215.534">amazing.  So, so Houdini has started</span> <span data-start="6216.236" data-end="6221.401">working on these new drafts  which include a parser API, a</span> <span data-start="6221.832" data-end="6225.946">layout API, and a few other APIs that expose the rendering engine</span> <span data-start="6227.329" data-end="6230.699">internals. So let's cover them  one by one. But before we begin,</span> <span data-start="6230.865" data-end="6234.071">I should let you guys now that  many of the things I will be</span> <span data-start="6234.393" data-end="6239.178">sharing are in very early  stages, so the syntax might</span> <span data-start="6239.853" data-end="6244.33">change. The APS might get  change, you know? But</span> <span data-start="6244.784" data-end="6247.201">nonetheless, let's set started  and she what Houdini</span> <span data-start="6250.702" data-end="6252.702">has.</span> <span data-start="6259.693" data-end="6262.903">First is the .. yeah. First is  the properties and values of the</span> <span data-start="6264.6" data-end="6269.922">API. So, this particular API  extends the CSS variable spec</span> <span data-start="6269.923" data-end="6275.234">which obviously allows us to  create custom variables, and it</span> <span data-start="6275.235" data-end="6280.908">extends it and allows us to  create custom typed properties,</span> <span data-start="6281.783" data-end="6285.934">so like you can define a type in CSS now, define a type in CSS</span> <span data-start="6285.935" data-end="6291.068">values. This also provides us  the ability to have like I say a</span> <span data-start="6291.069" data-end="6295.572">type. We can have, we can  specify initial values to the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="6296.414" data-end="6300.698">CSS variables, and we can define the behaviour. So all CSS</span> <span data-start="6301.081" data-end="6304.344">variables inherit by default, so this might be come in handy in</span> <span data-start="6305" data-end="6307">order to disable this particular</span> <span data-start="6309.512" data-end="6311.512">behaviour. So, let's see what  the API looks</span> <span data-start="6315.482" data-end="6319.637">like. So, we have this  registered property function.</span> <span data-start="6319.638" data-end="6325.291">And we are using it to define a  new type of property called BG</span> <span data-start="6325.292" data-end="6330.55">colour, and I'm providing a type here which is of colour. And</span> <span data-start="6330.551" data-end="6335.592">with an initial value of black,  and the inheritance parameters</span> <span data-start="6335.593" data-end="6337.593">option</span> <span data-start="6339.633" data-end="6343.331">which is — so, having a type  here is something new. Now, we</span> <span data-start="6345.482" data-end="6350.084">are talking about typed CSS  values. This obviously prevents</span> <span data-start="6350.719" data-end="6354.616">invalid property value  declarations, and so with a</span> <span data-start="6355.322" data-end="6358.037">particular type defined, we  always make sure that only the</span> <span data-start="6358.038" data-end="6361.492">value of a required type is used by the custom property,</span> <span data-start="6361.919" data-end="6364.668">otherwise it throws an error. By default, syntax which is the</span> <span data-start="6364.669" data-end="6368.739">type that can support any type  of value, but with the type</span> <span data-start="6368.94" data-end="6372.541">defined, such as in this case,  where I'm defining the type of</span> <span data-start="6373.402" data-end="6377.505">colour, the initial value option becomes a requirement, so that's</span> <span data-start="6378.858" data-end="6384.918">why I'm providing an initial  value. So, let's look at a</span> <span data-start="6387.122" data-end="6392.253">complete example. So we use the  same BG colour of property of</span> <span data-start="6392.681" data-end="6395.328">the type colour with the value  of black. We're using it to set</span> <span data-start="6398.2" data-end="6401.568">the background colour of the  think class, using the standard</span> <span data-start="6401.962" data-end="6406.495">functions. It is pretty simple,  right? Overriding the default</span> <span data-start="6406.908" data-end="6408.708">values is pretty  straightforward, so in this</span> <span data-start="6408.709" data-end="6413.774">case, the background would be  coloured back, so you can simply</span> <span data-start="6414.368" data-end="6418.09">overriding it by redeclaring  your custom property. Now the</span> <span data-start="6418.091" data-end="6421.891">property will be — now the  background will be coloured</span> <span data-start="6422.073" data-end="6425.822">green. I think we noticed that  all registered properties are</span> <span data-start="6426.295" data-end="6429.104">bound to the root scope, so  overriding a customs value</span> <span data-start="6429.413" data-end="6432.52">property like this will only  have its effect on the current</span> <span data-start="6433.882" data-end="6438.192">element scope which is pink. If  you were to access the BG colour</span> <span data-start="6438.595" data-end="6440.595">property, it would still give  you the</span> <span data-start="6453.977" data-end="6455.41">value black. What if a non-value like this string over here?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="6455.411" data-end="6457.648">Since we got this property  registered with the type of</span> <span data-start="6458.305" data-end="6460.283">colour, and we have a default  value set to it value black.</span> <span data-start="6460.284" data-end="6463.576">What if a  which is black, the  CSS engine set up, and it</span> <span data-start="6464.163" data-end="6467.695">applies the background colour of black to the class, so, this</span> <span data-start="6468.05" data-end="6472.545">becomes extremely using in cases where you would want to resort</span> <span data-start="6472.923" data-end="6476.091">to back values for your custom  properties, and, of course, this</span> <span data-start="6476.571" data-end="6478.792">prevents any inconsistencies in  your UI which</span> <span data-start="6482.883" data-end="6486.358">is great. The syntax string  supports the following types. We</span> <span data-start="6487.34" data-end="6493.415">can have colours, we can have  numbers, percentages, URLs,</span> <span data-start="6493.416" data-end="6501.269">images, and a few other types.  We can view the list over here.</span> <span data-start="6501.27" data-end="6508.106">Next up is the time OM, so we've been talking about typed values</span> <span data-start="6508.107" data-end="6509.929">over here.  This is what gives the ability</span> <span data-start="6509.93" data-end="6511.93">to give type CSS</span> <span data-start="6513.839" data-end="6519.229">values. So the typed CSS object  model gives us the ability to</span> <span data-start="6519.23" data-end="6524.854">convert value strings, the CSS  value strings into meaningful</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="6524.855" data-end="6528.291">JavaScript-type presentations,  so we have a specific API for</span> <span data-start="6528.292" data-end="6531.761">this which we can have typed  representations using</span> <span data-start="6531.762" data-end="6537.662">JavaScript. So the title, the  rendering engine, what which</span> <span data-start="6537.663" data-end="6541.016">particular types of values are  to be manipulated so does not</span> <span data-start="6541.67" data-end="6547.343">involve any sort of extra  parting of value strings in the</span> <span data-start="6547.867" data-end="6554.26">case of the — parsing, so this  offers significant performance</span> <span data-start="6554.749" data-end="6557.663">improvement. And it also  provides us this new class</span> <span data-start="6557.839" data-end="6562.018">called the CSS style value  class, so it also has a number</span> <span data-start="6564.034" data-end="6567.013">of subclasses. Which can be used for defining all sorts of type</span> <span data-start="6567.462" data-end="6572.893">values, so we can have length  values, we can have transform</span> <span data-start="6573.51" data-end="6575.51">values, position, and a few  other types of</span> <span data-start="6577.611" data-end="6583.247">values. It also exposes style  map, so style map is basically</span> <span data-start="6583.248" data-end="6589.669">an interface which helps in  setting and getting CSS values.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="6589.67" data-end="6595.021">So we can use — access the style map and use the set method if we</span> <span data-start="6595.022" data-end="6599.916">want to set a new property value here, like in this case, I'm</span> <span data-start="6599.917" data-end="6602.892">turning the height property to  100 pixels.</span> <span data-start="6602.893" data-end="6609.136">And we can use the same — we can use the "get" method to get the</span> <span data-start="6609.137" data-end="6613.498">height back which is returned as a subclass, obviously, as a</span> <span data-start="6613.693" data-end="6621.834">style value class, which is a  simple CSS class. There is this</span> <span data-start="6622.215" data-end="6627.288">open-source type OM available.  You can play with it if you want</span> <span data-start="6627.646" data-end="6631.053">to, get a feeling of how it's  supposed to work. Again, this is</span> <span data-start="6631.572" data-end="6636.702">just a proof-of-concept, so for  experimentation only. I will get</span> <span data-start="6636.703" data-end="6638.703">to the browser support for the</span> <span data-start="6652.869" data-end="6655.925">APS. Allows to hook into the  processes in the pipeline and</span> <span data-start="6656.366" data-end="6660.877">extending those processes to  apply our own  custom CSS so</span> <span data-start="6660.878" data-end="6662.878">this is where the fun</span> <span data-start="6667.579" data-end="6669.718">part is. This is what it looks  like. We have different</span> <span data-start="6669.719" data-end="6675.364">processes in the CSS engine, and we have different worklets</span> <span data-start="6675.365" data-end="6679.716">attached to it. Each are at the  various point in the rendering</span> <span data-start="6679.717" data-end="6682.331">pipeline. You can see that we  have a separate worklet for the</span> <span data-start="6682.332" data-end="6686.462">paint stage, and a separate  worklet for the layout</span> <span data-start="6700.358" data-end="6706.344">the rendering engine, and  worklets are meant to be threat</span> <span data-start="6706.592" data-end="6706.685">agnostic which meansstage, and  so on. They are called for any</span> <span data-start="6706.686" data-end="6709.584">of the process of the they're  not intended to run on a</span> <span data-start="6709.585" data-end="6712.713">particular thread, so the  rendering engine can choose to</span> <span data-start="6712.714" data-end="6717.32">run them wherever it wants,  which it can be a separate</span> <span data-start="6717.321" data-end="6720.874">worklet thread. They run in sync with the rendering engine, but</span> <span data-start="6720.875" data-end="6723.854">they are completely independent  on the main thread, so that's</span> <span data-start="6723.855" data-end="6725.855">the best</span> <span data-start="6737.25" data-end="6740.928">part. So this is how you would  register a worklet. In this case</span> <span data-start="6741.496" data-end="6744.833">where we're hoping in the paint  part. So this is how you stage,</span> <span data-start="6744.834" data-end="6749.527">and when defining the worklet,  we give it a name, and a</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="6752.134" data-end="6754.979">JavaScript class. This is where  all the magic happens inside</span> <span data-start="6755.311" data-end="6757.311">this JavaScript class.</span> <span data-start="6760.866" data-end="6764.615">Let's see how this magic  actually works at the paint</span> <span data-start="6764.616" data-end="6766.616">stage of the rendering pipeline.</span> <span data-start="6768.801" data-end="6773.727">So this is what the paint stage  does. It's responsible for a</span> <span data-start="6773.728" data-end="6776.632">painting background of the  content, and highlight of the</span> <span data-start="6776.633" data-end="6781.294">box. Based on its size and  style. So, during this stage,</span> <span data-start="6781.295" data-end="6788.002">the paint API will allow us to  create custom fills for our</span> <span data-start="6788.003" data-end="6791.219">elements. Inform an image which  we can use in the background</span> <span data-start="6791.22" data-end="6796.239">image property, something like  this. So, here we are applying a</span> <span data-start="6799.077" data-end="6804.074">custom-filled, using the paint  function provided by the API.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="6804.075" data-end="6807.435">The first things first. We need  to hook into the paint stage of</span> <span data-start="6807.436" data-end="6815.226">the rendering pipeline, so what  do we need for that? Worklet,</span> <span data-start="6815.227" data-end="6820.647">right? So we define the paint  worklet. This example is</span> <span data-start="6821.775" data-end="6825.609">actually taken from the Google  developers' website, so they are</span> <span data-start="6825.867" data-end="6831.384">planning to ship the Houdini  paint API with the Chrome 65</span> <span data-start="6831.385" data-end="6835.35">some day next week is the  release date. So we can see</span> <span data-start="6835.776" data-end="6837.776">that, we have a paint</span> <span data-start="6839.33" data-end="6845.959">worklet, called checkerboard,  and we use it to paint in div,</span> <span data-start="6845.96" data-end="6852.114">so we attached the checkerboard  paint to its property. This is</span> <span data-start="6852.115" data-end="6854.115">the</span> <span data-start="6866.226" data-end="6867.577">we are using to paint our div.  This is like a standard function</span> <span data-start="6867.578" data-end="6872.918">used in the paint worklet, so we get access to these threeworklet</span> <span data-start="6872.919" data-end="6874.291">using to paint our div.   arguments in paint function</span> <span data-start="6874.292" data-end="6876.292">which is basically the</span> <span data-start="6879.89" data-end="6883.342">context, the geom is the metric  which returns the height of the</span> <span data-start="6883.343" data-end="6885.343">element, and the properties are  the style map properties we want</span> <span data-start="6886.271" data-end="6888.271">to access inside</span> <span data-start="6891.043" data-end="6892.613">our worklet.  Using this be paint function, we</span> <span data-start="6892.614" data-end="6897.163">create the checkerboard with the three colours defined, which are</span> <span data-start="6897.164" data-end="6900.221">red, green, and blue. If you  have some experience with</span> <span data-start="6900.822" data-end="6905.644">canvas, then this might look  familiar. Here, we're using the</span> <span data-start="6905.645" data-end="6907.924">context to apply the fill, so  it's quite</span> <span data-start="6912.029" data-end="6917.062">the same. This is what the  output looks like. It is a</span> <span data-start="6917.063" data-end="6920.682">checkerboard fill made of  specified colours. I know it is</span> <span data-start="6921.388" data-end="6925.098">very simple example, but it  still tries to demonstrate how</span> <span data-start="6925.099" data-end="6927.099">easy it is to extend</span> <span data-start="6930.021" data-end="6932.022">the paint, paint process in the  rendering</span> <span data-start="6935.521" data-end="6939.295">pipeline, and the paint worklet  will be called every time and a</span> <span data-start="6940.051" data-end="6942.051">screen resize operation happens,</span> <span data-start="6945.411" data-end="6950.459">so, the button is redrawn on  demand and kept intact. This is</span> <span data-start="6950.778" data-end="6953.086">completely normal because every  time a fill happens, it is</span> <span data-start="6953.489" data-end="6955.509">calculated on the elements cut  in size which is generated</span> <span data-start="6956.24" data-end="6958.24">during the layout stage.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="6960.43" data-end="6963.645">Additionally, we can use custom  properties in our paint worklet.</span> <span data-start="6963.912" data-end="6970.305">This is where the properties  arguments comes in. And the</span> <span data-start="6970.696" data-end="6975.244">properties arguments returns the style maps, so we use the type</span> <span data-start="6975.476" data-end="6979.315">here to get the custom  properties from inside the</span> <span data-start="6980.859" data-end="6987.15">worklet. As of now in Chrome,  these properties are mostly, the</span> <span data-start="6987.151" data-end="6991.282">style map is mostly a wraparound strings which is why you need to</span> <span data-start="6991.283" data-end="6994.265">convert it to a string over  here. Going forward, it will</span> <span data-start="6996.099" data-end="7001.406">change as soon as we have table  support for type OM. The input</span> <span data-start="7001.407" data-end="7005.224">function is required to fetch  the required custom properties</span> <span data-start="7005.225" data-end="7009.177">on any other properties that we  need to use in the</span> <span data-start="7014.079" data-end="7016.602">worklet.  >> Paint can be used anyway, but</span> <span data-start="7016.603" data-end="7021.026">these are two simple examples.  Multiple coloured, backgrounds,</span> <span data-start="7021.428" data-end="7025.686">the material design ripple  effect, so that what is of</span> <span data-start="7026.053" data-end="7028.897">benefit here is that using a  paint worklet, this sort of</span> <span data-start="7028.898" data-end="7034.725">effect becomes pretty simple to  make, so you don't need inject</span> <span data-start="7034.726" data-end="7039.817">extra DOM nodes here in this  case, and it's pretty simple to</span> <span data-start="7039.818" data-end="7044.063">use it. You can use a full list  of examples over here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="7044.064" data-end="7047.157">Obviously, you can use it to  Polyfill any of the proposed</span> <span data-start="7047.158" data-end="7049.533">fill types that the browser  currently does</span> <span data-start="7054.049" data-end="7057.747">not support. Next up is the  layout API. The layout API gives</span> <span data-start="7058.002" data-end="7062.159">you see the layout worklet which we can hook into the rendering</span> <span data-start="7062.16" data-end="7066.926">pipeline to recreate our own  display types.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="7066.927" data-end="7073.691">So, first let's understand what  the layout stage does. So, it is</span> <span data-start="7073.692" data-end="7079.535">responsible for generating the  and positioning fragments from</span> <span data-start="7081.664" data-end="7085.002">the box stream, so a lot was  there. Let's see what each of</span> <span data-start="7086.126" data-end="7090">these mean. The box tree shows  how the document structure looks</span> <span data-start="7090.001" data-end="7094.28">like, and what sort of elements  are there in the structure, and</span> <span data-start="7094.846" data-end="7098.623">this structure, and this is the  structure that the API operates</span> <span data-start="7098.624" data-end="7104.5">on, and let's us arrange all the elements together. And each of</span> <span data-start="7105.643" data-end="7110.454">these elements can have multiple fragments. As we can see,</span> <span data-start="7110.455" data-end="7113.924">fragments are like the tiniest  bits in the whole box tree, and</span> <span data-start="7114.407" data-end="7118.862">they're created for each of the  pseudo elements. In this case,</span> <span data-start="7119.076" data-end="7123.314">we have a fragment for the first letter pseudo element, the first</span> <span data-start="7123.832" data-end="7126.942">line pseudo element, which is  provided by the black outline.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="7127.604" data-end="7131.318">Now, the latout API gives us the ability to create our own</span> <span data-start="7131.755" data-end="7136.828">display types with respect to  this particular box structure.</span> <span data-start="7137.039" data-end="7139.039">This is what the broader picture looks</span> <span data-start="7147.427" data-end="7151.617">like. We have the parent element applying the layout on and the</span> <span data-start="7151.618" data-end="7154.591">child elements further  containing the child fragments.</span> <span data-start="7154.592" data-end="7156.592">So the access to the child  elements is important here</span> <span data-start="7156.807" data-end="7161.551">because obviously we need to  arrange the elements and the</span> <span data-start="7162.323" data-end="7166.18">fragments within them, to  generate our custom layout. So</span> <span data-start="7166.181" data-end="7168.181">let's look at the worklet</span> <span data-start="7170.757" data-end="7173.691">now.  This is what the class looks</span> <span data-start="7174.334" data-end="7179.221">like. So we have a few started  functions. Properties help</span> <span data-start="7179.583" data-end="7182.376">stretching the property values  of the current element like you</span> <span data-start="7183.477" data-end="7185.728">saw in the paint worklet, for  example. Children input</span> <span data-start="7185.729" data-end="7189.384">properties gives the property  values of the child elements,</span> <span data-start="7190.66" data-end="7194.304">and the child play function  let's us define how the children</span> <span data-start="7194.606" data-end="7200.968">elements are to be displayed,  whether they are to be inline,</span> <span data-start="7201.666" data-end="7204.419">blockified, whatever. Then we  have two generator functions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="7204.42" data-end="7208.04">The first one is in sizes and  the second one is</span> <span data-start="7214.124" data-end="7217.007">layout. The intrinsic sizes  function allows us to figure out</span> <span data-start="7217.008" data-end="7223.559">what the max or min size of a  block is. So that we place our</span> <span data-start="7223.56" data-end="7226.601">elements accordingly and don't  waste any space available</span> <span data-start="7226.602" data-end="7229.088">because they're the specified  amount of space available for us</span> <span data-start="7229.322" data-end="7235.659">to do our layouts within the  parent. And the layout method</span> <span data-start="7235.66" data-end="7239.108">actually defines how the  elements are to be arranged by a</span> <span data-start="7239.279" data-end="7242.461">custom layout.  So, we create a constraint space</span> <span data-start="7242.462" data-end="7245.848">here which is basically the  space available for us to do our</span> <span data-start="7247.72" data-end="7252.664">layout. And, within the parent,  and, we position our fragments,</span> <span data-start="7252.905" data-end="7255.932">and it's all the block sizes to  finish up the arrangement of</span> <span data-start="7259.063" data-end="7261.063">the blocks.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="7262.199" data-end="7265.927">So this example is taken from  the official blocks.</span> <span data-start="7265.928" data-end="7268.587">The example here talks about  stacking the elements on top of</span> <span data-start="7268.588" data-end="7272.751">each other which are inside the  parent. You can't really play</span> <span data-start="7272.957" data-end="7276.373">with it at the moment. It is  API, none of the browsers have</span> <span data-start="7278.474" data-end="7282.225">got it implemented. But it seems extremely promising, I mean,</span> <span data-start="7282.852" data-end="7287.462">imagine writing a performant  layout without any JavaScript</span> <span data-start="7287.817" data-end="7289.817">packs. It's going to be awesome,</span> <span data-start="7294.742" data-end="7299.965">right? Now let's talk about the  an makes worklet. So animation</span> <span data-start="7300.37" data-end="7305.338">worklet allows us to create  highly performant scroll or</span> <span data-start="7306.213" data-end="7308.657">input-based animations — you  know, things like sticky</span> <span data-start="7311.657" data-end="7314.084">headers, parallax effect, and  all that. All of this is done</span> <span data-start="7314.573" data-end="7316.871">off the main thread. Because  we're using a worklet here, this</span> <span data-start="7317.286" data-end="7319.286">offers us significant</span> <span data-start="7324.805" data-end="7330.552">performance. No janky scroll  effect, I guess. Animations</span> <span data-start="7330.553" data-end="7334.606">running inside the worklet also  exposes the animation interface</span> <span data-start="7334.986" data-end="7339.304">from the web animations API  which means the worklet data can</span> <span data-start="7340.057" data-end="7343.052">be accessed on the main thread  using any of the animation's</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="7346.239" data-end="7350.945">APIs before now, let's look at  an example of a</span> <span data-start="7354.048" data-end="7356.048">scroll-based</span> <span data-start="7357.105" data-end="7363.503">header. This is the structure of the document. We have a header</span> <span data-start="7364.081" data-end="7369.175">element, and an avatar element.  So, these elements based on the</span> <span data-start="7369.455" data-end="7373.584">scroll position, so I just  scroll down the element that</span> <span data-start="7373.585" data-end="7377.549">will animate and get fixed to  the top, and the header element</span> <span data-start="7377.987" data-end="7383.457">will lose its transparency. So  it also includes a worklet</span> <span data-start="7383.918" data-end="7387.962">module inclusion call. As you  can see here, this is a promise,</span> <span data-start="7388.378" data-end="7393.752">and inside the promise we attach the key frame effects, so these</span> <span data-start="7394.151" data-end="7398.052">key frame effects are provided  by the animations API, and we</span> <span data-start="7398.332" data-end="7401.204">attach these to each of the  elements that we want to</span> <span data-start="7401.401" data-end="7403.994">animate. In this case, we are  passing an area of effects</span> <span data-start="7404.365" data-end="7406.365">attached with each element,</span> <span data-start="7408.258" data-end="7412.965">so we want to the avatar element to scale down and the header</span> <span data-start="7413.224" data-end="7415.224">element to loose its</span> <span data-start="7418.652" data-end="7421.262">transparency.  —  to lose its  transparency. Each of these</span> <span data-start="7421.491" data-end="7425.195">effects are available in our  worklet. We also create a new</span> <span data-start="7425.788" data-end="7428.309">scroll timeline on the scrolling container which is the parent</span> <span data-start="7428.73" data-end="7432.479">container, which listens for the scroll events, and it has an end</span> <span data-start="7433.748" data-end="7442.287">and start offset. So this is the worklet class. It contains our</span> <span data-start="7442.749" data-end="7449.32">constructor where we define our  easing function. Then Geneva an</span> <span data-start="7449.755" data-end="7453.886">animate process.the animate  —   then we have an animate process.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="7454.122" data-end="7458.958">This gives the current scroll  position in document. And it</span> <span data-start="7458.959" data-end="7461.881">also gives us this group of  effects which are to be applied</span> <span data-start="7462.459" data-end="7465.733">on the specified elements. So we said the scroll position on the</span> <span data-start="7466.1" data-end="7469.603">- which is the current time, and the scroll timeline, and we</span> <span data-start="7469.604" data-end="7474.278">adjust the time of the effects  passed to us that gives us the</span> <span data-start="7474.45" data-end="7476.739">ability to control the timeline  of our key frames.</span> <span data-start="7481.486" data-end="7485.27">So this is how it would look.  You can see that, as we scroll,</span> <span data-start="7485.271" data-end="7489.43">the targeted elements are being  animated as expected. The best</span> <span data-start="7489.431" data-end="7492.796">part is all of this happens off  our main thread. This can</span> <span data-start="7492.797" data-end="7496.505">provide us some really high  performance benefits. Especially</span> <span data-start="7498.869" data-end="7505.556">things with that are parallax  effects. This is a demo created</span> <span data-start="7505.557" data-end="7509.368">by Sirma, so that team put  together a small Polyfill for</span> <span data-start="7509.369" data-end="7513.663">the animation worklet, and this  Polyfill is being used by an</span> <span data-start="7513.664" data-end="7517.38">example listed on their  repository. You can view the</span> <span data-start="7517.381" data-end="7519.381">entire example</span> <span data-start="7527.757" data-end="7530.874">over there. There are are two  more elements left which are</span> <span data-start="7530.875" data-end="7533.702">fuzzy at the moment. Even the  specs don't have too much</span> <span data-start="7533.703" data-end="7537.342">information about them to cover. One is the parser API and the</span> <span data-start="7537.343" data-end="7541.284">other is the foreign metrics API but we will still look into it,</span> <span data-start="7541.285" data-end="7544.646">and see where each of these APIs can potentially</span> <span data-start="7548.668" data-end="7552.787">offer us. So the first one is  the parser API. As the name</span> <span data-start="7553.359" data-end="7558.186">suggests it will allow us to  parse CSS rules, or CSS rules</span> <span data-start="7561.03" data-end="7565.125">typed into interpretations. So  string-based based rules</span> <span data-start="7565.368" data-end="7569.172">representations, and it will  also have utilities to parse</span> <span data-start="7569.364" data-end="7571.364">entire style sheets, rule sets,  and all</span> <span data-start="7575.146" data-end="7579.486">those things. It's still like in the early stages, so I can't say</span> <span data-start="7579.487" data-end="7586.315">much about it. The last one is  the font metrics API, so this</span> <span data-start="7586.316" data-end="7591.07">will provide basic font metrics, or the font intended for our</span> <span data-start="7591.071" data-end="7595.626">information.  So, the two methods specified in</span> <span data-start="7595.829" data-end="7600.4">the spec, so there is this thing called measure element method</span> <span data-start="7600.725" data-end="7604.084">which basically takes in an  element, and returns a font</span> <span data-start="7604.551" data-end="7609.126">metrics object, and we have a  measured text method which takes</span> <span data-start="7609.447" data-end="7614.459">in a DOM string and a style map  and returns a fonts metric</span> <span data-start="7615.379" data-end="7617.77">object which basically is  supposed to store information</span> <span data-start="7618.911" data-end="7622.965">regarding the width, height, the boundary box baseline, and all</span> <span data-start="7626.393" data-end="7628.81">of that of the element. So this  will allow us to measure our</span> <span data-start="7629.422" data-end="7632.402">text actual elements and the  orientation, and allow us to do</span> <span data-start="7632.768" data-end="7638.662">some really cool things like  creating some interesting</span> <span data-start="7643.191" data-end="7646.014">effects, maybe.  So this was more of a brief</span> <span data-start="7646.84" data-end="7650.804">introduction to the Houdini  APIs. The main question is can</span> <span data-start="7652.763" data-end="7655.627">we use Houdini today? And most  of you might have guessed it:</span> <span data-start="7655.839" data-end="7664.274">the answer is no. But it's  coming soon. So this is what the</span> <span data-start="7664.724" data-end="7670.722">current situation looks like.  The Chrome team is definitely</span> <span data-start="7671.107" data-end="7674.517">push it hard to ship the new  APIs. You can experiment with</span> <span data-start="7675.015" data-end="7678.644">the properties and values API  and the typed OM which is</span> <span data-start="7680.196" data-end="7684.856">available behind the experiments web features flag, so you can go</span> <span data-start="7685.174" data-end="7689.182">to Chrome flags, and turn the  flag on. As far as I know, I</span> <span data-start="7691.591" data-end="7694.589">think it is available in stable  chrome as well. Again, behind</span> <span data-start="7694.942" data-end="7698.331">the same flag. A fully  functional paint API like I said</span> <span data-start="7699.244" data-end="7702.707">is to be released with Chrome  65, some time around next week.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="7703.226" data-end="7707.601">So that is a good sign. Clearly, no signals to implement the font</span> <span data-start="7708.33" data-end="7714.237">metrics API or the parser API by any of the vendors. Few other</span> <span data-start="7714.553" data-end="7718.759">browsers also seem to be  catching up — well, kind of — so</span> <span data-start="7718.76" data-end="7722.602">we might see some of the API  being implemented in a few of</span> <span data-start="7723.17" data-end="7726.588">the browsers. Not really sure  about the timeline, but be sure</span> <span data-start="7726.589" data-end="7728.589">to check</span> <span data-start="7733.342" data-end="7735.342">out</span> <span data-start="7739.298" data-end="7742.47">ishoudiniready.com. With that being said, Houdini</span> <span data-start="7744.098" data-end="7746.32">will cover us capabilities to  extend rendering engines and</span> <span data-start="7747.508" data-end="7749.871">come up with really amazing  tools and patterns that will</span> <span data-start="7751.711" data-end="7755.629">facilitate the development of  truly rich web experiences. And</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="7755.895" data-end="7759.974">I'm really looking forward to  it. That's it from this side.</span> <span data-start="7760.522" data-end="7762.522">Thank you.

So the first</span> <span data-start="12253.616" data-end="12257.832">things that we have decided to  do is to change our style</span> <span data-start="12257.833" data-end="12262.373">engine. So the style  engineengine, as I said, takes</span> <span data-start="12262.374" data-end="12264.374">the different CSS</span> <span data-start="12266.178" data-end="12269.112">properties, look at the  selectors, at the specification,</span> <span data-start="12269.113" data-end="12273.152">and, in fact, for each of the  boxes, define, okay, this</span> <span data-start="12273.153" data-end="12277.165">property with this value applies to this one. For example, the</span> <span data-start="12277.166" data-end="12281.651">background colour of the text  colour, the font, and so on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="12281.652" data-end="12287.158">This is something that has to be done to each and every box, so</span> <span data-start="12287.159" data-end="12295.099">this is at first sight something that can be used easily with the</span> <span data-start="12296.409" data-end="12302.419">parallelisation. So we tried it in Rust, on</span> <span data-start="12303.337" data-end="12305.429">Stylo. Basically, we had several processes, several threads, that</span> <span data-start="12305.862" data-end="12309.047">makes part of the tree and makes the calculation, and of course,</span> <span data-start="12309.048" data-end="12314.585">it's not that easy because first you don't have one thread or one</span> <span data-start="12314.808" data-end="12317.308">process per element on the page  because there are sometimes</span> <span data-start="12317.496" data-end="12322.442">several thousand of them, so you have to give chunk of the pages</span> <span data-start="12322.443" data-end="12326.378">to each of the processes, so  that means that some of these</span> <span data-start="12328.692" data-end="12331.595">processes are just either at  some point because there is</span> <span data-start="12331.596" data-end="12333.868">nothing happening, finishing  work while others may be</span> <span data-start="12334.463" data-end="12337.46">extremely busy. So there is a  big complex algorithm here that</span> <span data-start="12337.867" data-end="12340.881">allows a different thread,  different processes still to</span> <span data-start="12341.185" data-end="12344.001">work from the other when they</span> <span data-start="12347.877" data-end="12353.821">are idle. With this, we created  and we validated that the new</span> <span data-start="12353.822" data-end="12359.204">way of doing styling in the  browser is, in fact, much, much</span> <span data-start="12359.205" data-end="12361.76">more efficient. But that was  only the first step, because</span> <span data-start="12362.215" data-end="12366.507">this is in servo, in the  experimental browser. We needed</span> <span data-start="12366.508" data-end="12370.14">to sort out the detail and to  integrate this into the real</span> <span data-start="12370.712" data-end="12374.785">browser. And integrating a new  style engine in a browser, it's</span> <span data-start="12375.315" data-end="12380.07">a little bit like doing heart  surgery, but with a person that</span> <span data-start="12380.349" data-end="12384.134">is still conscious. You want  your browser to continue to</span> <span data-start="12384.135" data-end="12388.386">work, you don't want suddenly to have no new release for one</span> <span data-start="12388.57" data-end="12395.808">year, two years, while you put  all the wires together. So we</span> <span data-start="12397.202" data-end="12404.602">took the styles of Quantum with  the parallelism, the rule, and</span> <span data-start="12404.603" data-end="12406.603">the cache from — the</span> <span data-start="12409.142" data-end="12412.837">style-sharing cache from Chrome. Sometimes, it — a lot of nodes</span> <span data-start="12412.838" data-end="12417.638">have the same ancestors and the  same values, so it works pretty</span> <span data-start="12418.097" data-end="12420.097">well, and, in fact, it wasn't  working that well any more</span> <span data-start="12420.865" data-end="12425.269">because lately, with all the  pseudo classes and so on, it</span> <span data-start="12425.494" data-end="12429.786">became more complex, and there  are less of these elements that</span> <span data-start="12430.17" data-end="12433.781">are — that were cached. So we  modified the style-sharing cache</span> <span data-start="12433.782" data-end="12440.299">in order for it to work again.  And then we just transplanted</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="12440.671" data-end="12444.965">Stilo into the browser, and this happened last November in</span> <span data-start="12445.316" data-end="12449.647">Firefox 57 and we got for this  part a very, very large</span> <span data-start="12449.903" data-end="12456.372">improvement in speed.

That means that you have to have go out of the main</span> <span data-start="12519.364" data-end="12521.562">thread as soon as possible  because while you're on the main</span> <span data-start="12522.445" data-end="12526.414">thread, you cannot harm the next event, so the next event, when</span> <span data-start="12526.745" data-end="12530.302">you're scrolling a page W3C, or  when you are clicking and so on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="12531.938" data-end="12534.793">Initially, browser had  everything in the main thread,</span> <span data-start="12534.794" data-end="12537.089">and little by little over the  years, they start to take things</span> <span data-start="12537.731" data-end="12541.868">out, so first of them is a video they are encoding happening now</span> <span data-start="12542.132" data-end="12546.124">most of the time on the graphic  card itself. There was a plug-in</span> <span data-start="12547.012" data-end="12553.034">also at this stage, kind of as a worker and several others. What</span> <span data-start="12553.896" data-end="12559.354">is quite interesting is we have  another piece of computer power</span> <span data-start="12559.625" data-end="12561.625">on the browser that is</span> <span data-start="12564.493" data-end="12566.493">a GPU.</span> <span data-start="12571.633" data-end="12574.244">The GPU is designed for games,  is designed for the operating</span> <span data-start="12574.565" data-end="12578.673">system when you have a lot of  calculations to do on a lot of</span> <span data-start="12579.068" data-end="12583.162">data. The same operation on a  very large amount of data. And</span> <span data-start="12583.163" data-end="12586.55">it's very, very efficient for  this kind of thing. It is very</span> <span data-start="12588.35" data-end="12590.935">efficient for gaming. On the  browser, we have this kind of</span> <span data-start="12591.101" data-end="12595.512">operation. One of them is a  compositing, the last bit of the</span> <span data-start="12596.046" data-end="12598.345">calculation where you have all  the layers, and you have to</span> <span data-start="12598.783" data-end="12602.244">define which ones are visible  enough. It's the same operation</span> <span data-start="12602.245" data-end="12607.26">a lot of the time on a lot of  data. We decided in 2016, we do</span> <span data-start="12608.097" data-end="12613.332">offload the composition to the  GPU, and we did it. At the same</span> <span data-start="12613.727" data-end="12615.926">time, a little bit later, in  fact, we noticed that the</span> <span data-start="12618.659" data-end="12621.777">crashes just increased. We had a lot of crashes. In fact, it</span> <span data-start="12622.312" data-end="12624.981">wasn't the browser itself that  was buggy, it was the drivers</span> <span data-start="12625.172" data-end="12629.604">that were buggy, so the crashes  were mostly happening on</span> <span data-start="12630.171" data-end="12633.661">windows, and, for example, Mac  has had very few crashes because</span> <span data-start="12634.118" data-end="12641.191">there are far less types of  drivers and graphic cards. So we</span> <span data-start="12641.192" data-end="12643.192">decided last year to solve the  crashes by having the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="12646.277" data-end="12649.959">GPU, the graphic drivers loading a different process, so the</span> <span data-start="12650.498" data-end="12653.167">process crash, the browser  detected the crash, it</span> <span data-start="12653.361" data-end="12657.047">restarted, and then it works  without using the GPU for this</span> <span data-start="12657.371" data-end="12660.87">part. So you don't have all the  speed improvement of the GPU but</span> <span data-start="12661.33" data-end="12665.843">you don't have the crashes,  either. That's a way we had to</span> <span data-start="12666.117" data-end="12668.258">mitigate the bugs in graphics</span> <span data-start="12671.363" data-end="12678.363">drivers. So the come positioner  was the first part — the</span> <span data-start="12678.547" data-end="12680.956">compositor was the part that  went to the GPU. The painting is</span> <span data-start="12681.318" data-end="12688.857">to take a texture and apply it  to a surface, colour ra — we</span> <span data-start="12689.32" data-end="12693.518">want to do the same. This is a  project called web-runner — not</span> <span data-start="12694.229" data-end="12698.074">yet finished, it's in process.  This is the ultimate goal. I</span> <span data-start="12698.075" data-end="12701.922">don't know when it will be  finished. If you ask manage,</span> <span data-start="12701.923" data-end="12704.305">they say soon, and the  developers say a couple of</span> <span data-start="12704.487" data-end="12706.487">years. It is somewhere in</span> <span data-start="12713.488" data-end="12715.621">between!  don't send it to the GPU, we can</span> <span data-start="12715.868" data-end="12721.174">remove it from the main thread  so we have what we call off-main</span> <span data-start="12722.196" data-end="12724.778">thread painting. This has been  done in Firefox 58 which went</span> <span data-start="12725.031" data-end="12730.797">out in January, so basically we  create a set of instructions</span> <span data-start="12730.963" data-end="12734.4">that is policed, that is  assigned to the layers, and then</span> <span data-start="12734.7" data-end="12744.487">we send it to another process  that is ratarized which is the</span> <span data-start="12744.488" data-end="12750.328">actual painting operation, and  uses its own process on the GPU.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="12750.677" data-end="12752.71">That way, as soon as the</span> <span data-start="12756.91" data-end="12761.205">ratarization is not on the main  thread. We remove the</span> <span data-start="12761.545" data-end="12766.011">bottleneck. It is not as perfect as having everything on the GPU,</span> <span data-start="12766.657" data-end="12771.759">but it's no more the problem. So this landed in Firefox 58, and</span> <span data-start="12772.199" data-end="12776.009">there is an improvement coming  the next version in two weeks</span> <span data-start="12776.423" data-end="12778.529">where we discovered that we  don't need to recalculate it</span> <span data-start="12784.756" data-end="12788.868">each time.  It's simple. We have Heweristic in place so we don't</span> <span data-start="12789.608" data-end="12792.246">have to calculate the whole of  the display list each</span> <span data-start="12796.921" data-end="12800.589">time. We have mostly seen  replacement of the PCs, the</span> <span data-start="12800.59" data-end="12804.409">browser. In fact, if you want to have browsers that are as</span> <span data-start="12804.41" data-end="12809.303">efficient that feel quick,  responsive, you need to consider</span> <span data-start="12809.304" data-end="12813.774">it as a system as a whole  because, yes, you can have a</span> <span data-start="12813.775" data-end="12816.35">very efficient-style engine but  maybe the bottleneck is</span> <span data-start="12816.873" data-end="12822.892">somewhere else. So we changed a  way to do development, and to</span> <span data-start="12822.893" data-end="12829.955">prioritise the development in  Mozilla by having the triage,</span> <span data-start="12829.956" data-end="12835.964">privatise, and we applied this,  and we still apply this to fight</span> <span data-start="12836.399" data-end="12844.195">freeze in the UI. There is a  collection of 30 block pass</span> <span data-start="12844.781" data-end="12846.474">variation that is explain the  changes that happen all over the</span> <span data-start="12846.475" data-end="12850.771">place. It's going in a lot of  details, and he coins the name</span> <span data-start="12851.294" data-end="12856.78">"death by a million cuts". We  found bugs where we had to fix</span> <span data-start="12856.781" data-end="12862.176">ten bugs, and suddenly, we get  back a lot of them. Each of the</span> <span data-start="12862.839" data-end="12865.302">bugs was shaving one millisecond here or there, but no</span> <span data-start="12868.554" data-end="12870.554">significant difference, but  together, they were giving a lot</span> <span data-start="12871.384" data-end="12873.384">of differences. One of the  things that we change is the way</span> <span data-start="12874.485" data-end="12878.493">we were doing. It is not  specific to Firefox at all and</span> <span data-start="12878.705" data-end="12882.234">it has been pioneered by Apple,  and it is called</span> <span data-start="12882.647" data-end="12886.498">checkerboarding. When you scroll on your screen with a mouse or</span> <span data-start="12886.984" data-end="12891.247">with the finger, you never want  to scroll to stop. But</span> <span data-start="12892.057" data-end="12895.052">sometimes, it goes too quick,  and you don't have the time to</span> <span data-start="12895.571" data-end="12897.827">calculate what you present to  the screen, so you present a</span> <span data-start="12898.864" data-end="12902.689">default value and people,  instead of being confused,</span> <span data-start="12903.66" data-end="12905.66">scroll less quickly. The data  appears, the images appear, and,</span> <span data-start="12906.558" data-end="12909.72">initially, it was a  checkerboard, which is why it is</span> <span data-start="12910.212" data-end="12914.816">called checkerboarding. The  overall speed is not better, but</span> <span data-start="12915.2" data-end="12917.2">the feeling is completely</span> <span data-start="12925.62" data-end="12927.756">different. Another big things  we've changed is IPC. It say</span> <span data-start="12928.253" data-end="12931.188">known for a long time that, when you communicate with a disk, it</span> <span data-start="12931.189" data-end="12935.328">takes a lot of time, and you  don't want to do this on the</span> <span data-start="12935.329" data-end="12938.266">hard — main thread. It is the  same when you communicate with</span> <span data-start="12939.252" data-end="12943.466">another process, especially if  it is a synchronous</span> <span data-start="12943.467" data-end="12948.28">communication, you don't want to do this on the main thread. We</span> <span data-start="12948.281" data-end="12951.781">filed synchronous communication  and we wanted to have as much</span> <span data-start="12952.377" data-end="12955.225">synchronous communication. This  is where we did a lot of — there</span> <span data-start="12955.226" data-end="12957.226">were two people working for six  months on the</span> <span data-start="12959.961" data-end="12964.976">cookies. Because cookies were  needed a lot of synchronous</span> <span data-start="12964.977" data-end="12968.15">communication. They wrote the  cookies mechanism in Firefox,</span> <span data-start="12968.151" data-end="12974.7">and, in fact, it was 25 per cent of our blocking on interprocess</span> <span data-start="12974.701" data-end="12978.103">communication, and, on big  websites, when it was fixed,</span> <span data-start="12978.104" data-end="12982.572">like Facebook is making several  — writing several times per</span> <span data-start="12982.573" data-end="12987.681">second to the cookies store, in  this website, like Twitter, or</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="12987.682" data-end="12994.651">Facebook, we were able to win in the order of the second in the</span> <span data-start="12994.652" data-end="12999.176">time we made to display the  page. There were other offenders</span> <span data-start="12999.636" data-end="13003.112">like plugins but they're gone  today. Or the traditional</span> <span data-start="13003.65" data-end="13011.03">extension on Firefox and — often does that, so we had to decide</span> <span data-start="13011.267" data-end="13013.267">to stop having</span> <span data-start="13015.723" data-end="13017.307">that.   There are plenty other things</span> <span data-start="13017.308" data-end="13021.586">that we have done. For example,  we have changed some algorithm.</span> <span data-start="13022.265" data-end="13026.805">They are still efficient but  they were already efficient,</span> <span data-start="13027.545" data-end="13029.606">but, in fact, sometimes they  were not making good use of the</span> <span data-start="13029.976" data-end="13035.718">cache, so we keep an algorithm  with the same complexity, but</span> <span data-start="13036.331" data-end="13038.588">that works better with the  cache, for example, and</span> <span data-start="13039.294" data-end="13042.547">suddenly, you have an  improvement of your performance</span> <span data-start="13042.548" data-end="13047.572">on complex pages that are the  same complexity of the</span> <span data-start="13047.573" data-end="13051.311">algorithm. Also, the garbage  collection, the parts that take</span> <span data-start="13051.533" data-end="13054.681">back the memory has been  changed. Instead of having to do</span> <span data-start="13055.588" data-end="13060.489">a complete sweep, or we can now  do an incremental sweep, so we</span> <span data-start="13060.49" data-end="13064.282">take a bit of the memory, and we start because we only have a few</span> <span data-start="13064.966" data-end="13067.487">milliseconds, and we continue  later, so that means the memory</span> <span data-start="13067.908" data-end="13071.077">grows a little bit but when the  browser is idle, it goes back to</span> <span data-start="13071.248" data-end="13073.248">normal. At the same time, we  notice that memories</span> <span data-start="13076.103" data-end="13079.389">that is used towards the end  very quickly and so on is the</span> <span data-start="13079.39" data-end="13083.782">one that is usually released  very quickly, and what you have</span> <span data-start="13083.783" data-end="13087.219">done, I don't know, two hours  before, usually, you will keep</span> <span data-start="13087.22" data-end="13091.401">it until you cross the browser.  So we also have changed, these</span> <span data-start="13091.402" data-end="13095.725">kinds of things.  The last thing is we tried to</span> <span data-start="13096.34" data-end="13098.34">remove all timers in the  interface. Timers are really,</span> <span data-start="13101.493" data-end="13105.617">really bad. At first sign, first look, it looks very nice because</span> <span data-start="13106.535" data-end="13108.535">you deal with the execution  later, but, in fact, you don't</span> <span data-start="13109.247" data-end="13112.777">control when the execution will  happen, and when the timer will</span> <span data-start="13113.355" data-end="13115.355">file. Not only will it fire on  the main thread, but maybe it is</span> <span data-start="13115.713" data-end="13118.595">a moment that is important for  something else. You have no</span> <span data-start="13118.596" data-end="13123.315">control. In fact, the web  platform in this can be used on</span> <span data-start="13123.316" data-end="13128.058">the website. We have redressed  idle callbacks saying fire this</span> <span data-start="13128.466" data-end="13133.107">or do this when the main thread  is free. We also did things like</span> <span data-start="13134.114" data-end="13138.618">throttling background tabs, so,  if it is in the back, it is less</span> <span data-start="13138.619" data-end="13140.733">important, but if there is  mutesic playing in the back, you</span> <span data-start="13140.981" data-end="13142.981">don't want it</span> <span data-start="13144.989" data-end="13149.72">stop, so we are defensive here,  and we progress with</span> <span data-start="13149.721" data-end="13153.566">experimentation. Finally, we  designed our user interface.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="13153.567" data-end="13155.567">So the feeling of the user  interface is something</span> <span data-start="13159.45" data-end="13161.9">really important. The look has  to look modern. It doesn't</span> <span data-start="13161.901" data-end="13163.901">change the indeed but the</span> <span data-start="13166.716" data-end="13170.435">perception of the speed. Every  animation is happening on the</span> <span data-start="13170.436" data-end="13174.361">GPU, through the CSS. We had in  the previous interface animation</span> <span data-start="13174.362" data-end="13180.181">done in JavaScript, and they  were causing a good deal of the</span> <span data-start="13180.182" data-end="13185.374">- so that's really important  that animation, not in</span> <span data-start="13185.375" data-end="13187.762">JavaScript on the main thread.  We changed a bit the structure</span> <span data-start="13187.763" data-end="13192.149">of the user interface so it's  quicker for the user to find</span> <span data-start="13192.15" data-end="13195.638">elements. It is not quicker in  speed proper but it is quicker</span> <span data-start="13195.639" data-end="13201.909">for the user. And with all these things together, we have now a</span> <span data-start="13201.91" data-end="13211.573">new engine. And it looks still a nice robot but it looks much</span> <span data-start="13211.574" data-end="13216.894">more modern. And it's not  finished. In fact, Quantum was</span> <span data-start="13216.895" data-end="13222.097">released in November but already the next two versions of the</span> <span data-start="13222.098" data-end="13226.631">browser had more improvements,  so web renderer is coming at</span> <span data-start="13226.632" data-end="13230.201">some point. We have other ideas  to improve things, and, in</span> <span data-start="13230.202" data-end="13234.207">general, the browser is still  evolving. It is not the end.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="13234.208" data-end="13237.971">It's a new beginning because it  is the first time we have now</span> <span data-start="13237.972" data-end="13243.71">this power of having a massive  parliamentism on a browser. I</span> <span data-start="13243.711" data-end="13248.426">want to thank you for listening. Also, you can help by installing</span> <span data-start="13248.986" data-end="13253.624">Firefox, by reporting problems,  especially when your application</span> <span data-start="13253.625" data-end="13255.524">is slower that Firefox than  another browser.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="13255.525" data-end="13258.45">This interests us because it is  difficult to have real live</span> <span data-start="13258.617" data-end="13263.061">data. Each time we do a commit,  there are 2,000 hours of tests</span> <span data-start="13263.062" data-end="13268.717">going on on a farm of computers.

<p><span data-start="14181.696" data-end="14183.696">That's a lot of things to</span> <span data-start="14185.406" data-end="14187.102">learn. I would like to talk to you</span> <span data-start="14187.103" data-end="14195.497">first about the physics of life. So, here you see — the physics</span> <span data-start="14195.498" data-end="14198.576">of light. This is a simple  scene. We have this apartment.</span> <span data-start="14199.174" data-end="14202.368">We see a computer standing on  the desk. We have a chair, we</span> <span data-start="14202.603" data-end="14207.48">have a window, and, outside, we  have the sun which is primarily</span> <span data-start="14207.481" data-end="14211.135">the source of light which makes  us see everything. But how does</span> <span data-start="14211.136" data-end="14213.136">it actually</span> <span data-start="14220.367" data-end="14225.117">work? Every light source is  emitting electromagnetic rays.</span> <span data-start="14225.118" data-end="14229.055">As soon as these rays are hid  hitting an object, they're going</span> <span data-start="14229.385" data-end="14233.878">to interact with that object.  Either the object is absorbing</span> <span data-start="14233.879" data-end="14238.287">all the light — in that case, a  lot of energy is being produced</span> <span data-start="14238.886" data-end="14242.445">- or parts of the ray of the sun are going to be bouncing after</span> <span data-start="14244.11" data-end="14247.041">and reflecting a different  surfaces until that light energy</span> <span data-start="14247.211" data-end="14249.211">is</span> <span data-start="14252.27" data-end="14255.797">used up. I already said that the electromagnetic waves consist of</span> <span data-start="14256.04" data-end="14259.754">different frequencies, so that  means different frequencies are</span> <span data-start="14259.755" data-end="14262.784">different colours. If one  frequency is absorbed, the other</span> <span data-start="14263.124" data-end="14267.83">two frequencies are going to hit our eye, the retina of our eye,</span> <span data-start="14268.172" data-end="14270.172">therefore creating this colour  in our eyes, and we can</span> <span data-start="14275.933" data-end="14278.773">see it.  Different materials react very</span> <span data-start="14279.247" data-end="14281.891">differently, which I'm going to  talk about the differences</span> <span data-start="14282.544" data-end="14287.749">afterwards. But there are three  major things, as I said already:</span> <span data-start="14288.327" data-end="14290.522">absorption, reflection, and  transmission of light. We can</span> <span data-start="14291.28" data-end="14296.836">see this here a little bit more  graphically. Imagine you have a</span> <span data-start="14299.289" data-end="14302.329">perfect mirror which it is not  possible, even if you polish</span> <span data-start="14302.561" data-end="14305.912">your surface very well, you're  never going to have it, but</span> <span data-start="14306.272" data-end="14311.312">theoretically, a perfect mirror  will reflect all the light rays</span> <span data-start="14311.606" data-end="14320.014">uniformly. This we call specular reflection. Then we have diffuse</span> <span data-start="14320.371" data-end="14324.298">material like cloth, wood, and  other things, that are not so</span> <span data-start="14324.841" data-end="14328.683">much reflective, so it's going  to take the rays and bounce them</span> <span data-start="14328.684" data-end="14330.684">back in a very chaotic</span> <span data-start="14333.127" data-end="14337.299">way. And you have propagated  light, so, if you have glass or</span> <span data-start="14337.3" data-end="14340.518">water, the light is not only  going to reflect, it's also</span> <span data-start="14340.519" data-end="14342.519">going to transmit through the</span> <span data-start="14347.246" data-end="14351.686">solid. It creates these really  cool effects. This is not</span> <span data-start="14351.687" data-end="14355.079">everything that defines in the  material, but as we can see in</span> <span data-start="14355.08" data-end="14357.483">this illustration, these three</span> <span data-start="14360.96" data-end="14363.231">components make a lot of our  real-life materials, and it's</span> <span data-start="14363.855" data-end="14365.855">never just one component</span> <span data-start="14367.454" data-end="14374.098">that is there in one material.  For example, if you imagine you</span> <span data-start="14374.099" data-end="14378.609">have a wooden floor, that is not polished, the rays of light are</span> <span data-start="14379.116" data-end="14384.915">going to bounce back  chaotically. If you put a polish</span> <span data-start="14385.237" data-end="14389.865">or finish on, it will be shiny  from specific angles. That is</span> <span data-start="14389.866" data-end="14393.624">what I really want you to think  about when you get started with</span> <span data-start="14393.83" data-end="14396.96">3D because that's what a lot of  people get wrong or don't think</span> <span data-start="14397.364" data-end="14402.707">about because, why would you?  How do we now translate this</span> <span data-start="14412.297" data-end="14415.567">into computer graphics? I would  like to go a few centuries back</span> <span data-start="14415.913" data-end="14419.073">when the first cameras were  appearing called pinhole</span> <span data-start="14419.588" data-end="14421.256">cameras. You have a  light-sensitive film on the back</span> <span data-start="14421.257" data-end="14426.607">of a box with a little hole  inside. Only runway of light per</span> <span data-start="14426.945" data-end="14428.945">angle is allowed to pass through</span> <span data-start="14431.317" data-end="14434.265">that hole. It reads then the  colour on that spot of</span> <span data-start="14437.471" data-end="14439.565">the film. — it creates then the colour of</span> <span data-start="14439.566" data-end="14443.895">that spot on the film. We're  also using this technique in the</span> <span data-start="14444.237" data-end="14448.319">render technique called  raytracing, and that's what I'm</span> <span data-start="14449.383" data-end="14452.944">going to talk about. However, if you imagine again the sun, it's</span> <span data-start="14453.331" data-end="14457.869">not only shooting one ray at a  time, it's like a really big</span> <span data-start="14458.254" data-end="14460.355">energy source shooting down all  these billions and billions of</span> <span data-start="14461.733" data-end="14464.942">rays at the same time. Most of  these rays are never going to</span> <span data-start="14465.158" data-end="14469.058">hit our eye. They're never going to hit our camera or whatever</span> <span data-start="14469.059" data-end="14472.474">specific spot we want to look  at. So what computer graphics</span> <span data-start="14473.661" data-end="14477.975">are doing is they use a  technique called backwards</span> <span data-start="14479.338" data-end="14482.271">raytracing, so we are tracing  the rays, but instead of going</span> <span data-start="14482.672" data-end="14486.007">from the light source, we are  going from our camera through</span> <span data-start="14486.008" data-end="14489.639">the pixel that we want to trace, and we shoot the ray into the</span> <span data-start="14489.833" data-end="14493.211">scene, and we look at the first  object that we are going to hit,</span> <span data-start="14493.798" data-end="14498.538">the closest one. From there, we  want to see if this one object</span> <span data-start="14499.123" data-end="14502.754">is in shadow. Or if it is</span> <span data-start="14516.693" data-end="14517.6">in light. So, if the object is  actually lit, we're going to use</span> <span data-start="14517.601" data-end="14523.002">the colour of the material that  is defined at that space. in</span> <span data-start="14523.003" data-end="14525.976">light. So, if the object is   Basically multiplying it,</span> <span data-start="14526.963" data-end="14529.713">simplify that, multiplying it  with the colour of the light,</span> <span data-start="14529.714" data-end="14533.311">the intensity of the light. If  the object is in shadow, we're</span> <span data-start="14533.823" data-end="14542.291">just going to use black for now  as for shadow. This is very</span> <span data-start="14544.309" data-end="14546.592">simplified. Now, I also talked  about these other things that</span> <span data-start="14546.929" data-end="14548.929">are called like</span> <span data-start="14550.35" data-end="14554.651">transmission, and reflection, so how are we handling this in</span> <span data-start="14554.652" data-end="14560.705">raytracing?  Imagine we want to see if we</span> <span data-start="14561.026" data-end="14565.843">have a transparent material,  like glass, we would like to see</span> <span data-start="14565.844" data-end="14569.134">what can we see through that  glass, and what is reflected on</span> <span data-start="14569.135" data-end="14576.203">the surface of that glass? So,  on the impact point, we have to</span> <span data-start="14576.559" data-end="14578.559">calculate the different rays  that we are going to trace. One</span> <span data-start="14578.716" data-end="14582.443">of those rays is going to be  reflection ray, and one of them</span> <span data-start="14582.993" data-end="14587.493">is going to be the refraction  ray. It's going to be, yeah, not</span> <span data-start="14587.959" data-end="14591.732">very nice the names are so  close!  And from there, from</span> <span data-start="14592.479" data-end="14595.284">these rays, we're going to do  another check if they are</span> <span data-start="14595.749" data-end="14599.64">hitting the next object, so, if  the reflection ray is hitting</span> <span data-start="14600.898" data-end="14605.298">this red sphere, it's going to  be red at that point, but the</span> <span data-start="14606.214" data-end="14609.63">refraction rays hitting the  green sphere, so we have to</span> <span data-start="14610.008" data-end="14614.107">calculate together if we want to have the pixel there red or</span> <span data-start="14614.454" data-end="14618.854">green. From the impact point of  the secondary rays, we are going</span> <span data-start="14619.585" data-end="14624.186">to trace towards the sun, and  see if these points are in light</span> <span data-start="14624.187" data-end="14626.187">or</span> <span data-start="14627.554" data-end="14630.295">not. I want you to have a moment to look at</span> <span data-start="14637.283" data-end="14639.283">this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="14646.314" data-end="14649.095">Did everybody get it?  [Laughter].</span> <span data-start="14649.096" data-end="14653.32">Can you come here and explain it to me? Because this is how I</span> <span data-start="14653.321" data-end="14655.68">feel about my own code after two weeks of not looking at</span> <span data-start="14659.389" data-end="14662.222">it!   What you're looking at is the</span> <span data-start="14662.493" data-end="14666.012">basic implementation of a  raytracing engine that can do</span> <span data-start="14666.475" data-end="14676.073">reflection and refraction with  geometry primitives of spheres,</span> <span data-start="14676.074" data-end="14680.305">and I think — and this is a  common challenge among people</span> <span data-start="14680.797" data-end="14684.482">who do computer graphics, is how to make the most compact</span> <span data-start="14684.729" data-end="14690.02">raytracing engine that can be  fit on a business card. So this</span> <span data-start="14690.296" data-end="14693.948">actually compiles, and I think  that's pretty ghoul. Let's take</span> <span data-start="14693.949" data-end="14700.378">it apart a little bit. What we  want to do is define our</span> <span data-start="14701.737" data-end="14705.177">geometry primitives. And for  now, we're going to talk about</span> <span data-start="14705.704" data-end="14709.939">the sphere. The sphere is one of the most easy shapes to</span> <span data-start="14711.034" data-end="14713.697">calculate at intersection. For  that, we need a centre, a</span> <span data-start="14714.047" data-end="14716.061">radius, and we want to have  material, because as I explained</span> <span data-start="14716.478" data-end="14719.797">before, that's the most  interesting part. And we're</span> <span data-start="14720.345" data-end="14724.101">going to make another algorithm  that will calculate our</span> <span data-start="14724.102" data-end="14728.896">intersection from that. If we  are successful, we're going to</span> <span data-start="14729.11" data-end="14732.553">return both points that are  intersecting with the sphere</span> <span data-start="14732.554" data-end="14737.423">because usually, you will have  two of them, so the distance to</span> <span data-start="14737.802" data-end="14740.407">the closest one, and the  distance to the furthest</span> <span data-start="14749.927" data-end="14754.345">away one. We are going to define the geometries. Our light source</span> <span data-start="14755.042" data-end="14758.236">will also be spheres but just  with a different material that</span> <span data-start="14759.98" data-end="14763.012">actually emit light and for that we can test afterwards. We are</span> <span data-start="14763.466" data-end="14766.474">going to have a buffer for our  canvas, and we're going to</span> <span data-start="14766.751" data-end="14771.398">traverse through each pixel.   And we're going to trace for</span> <span data-start="14771.835" data-end="14775.997">each pixel one ray which is what we did before, right?  In the</span> <span data-start="14776.338" data-end="14779.968">trace function, we want to see  again, this is the primary ray</span> <span data-start="14780.476" data-end="14785.929">that we talked about before, and we want to see which is the</span> <span data-start="14786.493" data-end="14791.819">closest objects. We're going to  test the ray against every</span> <span data-start="14792.3" data-end="14795.438">object. And as a result, we get  the nearest one back. If we</span> <span data-start="14795.64" data-end="14798.774">don't have one, we can return  the background colour because</span> <span data-start="14799.193" data-end="14802.938">there's nothing there. And there will never be something there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="14803.331" data-end="14805.988">That's the really cool thing  about raytracing. You actually</span> <span data-start="14806.511" data-end="14808.511">test against the</span> <span data-start="14810.65" data-end="14813.302">whole scene. If there is an  object there, and it's a</span> <span data-start="14813.303" data-end="14818.106">transparent or a reflective  material, we are going to have</span> <span data-start="14818.107" data-end="14823.782">to shoot the second race for  each of those, and we do this</span> <span data-start="14823.783" data-end="14827.435">recursively until we are  satisfied, and usually, you</span> <span data-start="14827.436" data-end="14830.873">don't want to do this endless by because it is going to take</span> <span data-start="14830.874" data-end="14834.085">forever. So we're going to  decide how often you want to do</span> <span data-start="14834.086" data-end="14838.288">this recursion, and, at the end  of that, you will test it</span> <span data-start="14838.737" data-end="14843.575">against the light and see if  these points are in shadow or</span> <span data-start="14843.576" data-end="14845.576">not. Then you're going</span> <span data-start="14847.754" data-end="14852.456">to use the algorithm to see how  you should calculate the light</span> <span data-start="14852.851" data-end="14854.875">together. I'm not going to  explain that right now, but it</span> <span data-start="14855.555" data-end="14859.833">is very interesting look at. If  it doesn't fall into this, that</span> <span data-start="14860.04" data-end="14864.155">means we are hitting a light  source, or a diffuse material</span> <span data-start="14864.337" data-end="14869.208">that is not going to reflect on  the different points so we can</span> <span data-start="14869.653" data-end="14872.16">break the recursion there. I did not make another slide for this</span> <span data-start="14872.49" data-end="14875.528">because I think it is clear.  This is the result we are</span> <span data-start="14883.25" data-end="14887.762">getting. I think it is very  interesting to see, from this</span> <span data-start="14888.685" data-end="14893.571">rather simple algorithm, we  already get really cool effects.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="14894.035" data-end="14898.578">Like, we can really see the  spheres which are close to each</span> <span data-start="14899.121" data-end="14902.681">other, reflecting each other. We can see shall quotes, and we can</span> <span data-start="14903.47" data-end="14909.567">also  —  we can see shadows, and  what is behind thedows, and we</span> <span data-start="14909.568" data-end="14911.143">can also  —  we can see shadows,  and what is behind the camera.</span> <span data-start="14911.144" data-end="14914.028">this is not something that you  see in games, for example, or in</span> <span data-start="14915.181" data-end="14918.923">different render engines. And  why is that? We're going to get</span> <span data-start="14919.096" data-end="14923.824">to that later on. So, this was  really easy, I think. But now we</span> <span data-start="14924.514" data-end="14928.96">want to really go realistic  because we said before there is</span> <span data-start="14929.264" data-end="14933.685">not one ray per pixel; usually,  the sun shoots so many rays that</span> <span data-start="14933.944" data-end="14937.567">make up one pixel of your image. There are so many things that</span> <span data-start="14938.111" data-end="14943.217">come together, we want to have  soft shadows. We want to use</span> <span data-start="14944.667" data-end="14947.044">multiple light sources. How are  we going to compute these</span> <span data-start="14947.395" data-end="14952.356">together? How are we going to  decide on what is more weighted,</span> <span data-start="14952.596" data-end="14957.543">which pixel should be what? And  we really want to have this</span> <span data-start="14958.049" data-end="14960.386">physical correctness which means that we have to basically bounce</span> <span data-start="14961.523" data-end="14967.15">the ray for ever until it hits  the light source by itself.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="14967.151" data-end="14970.746">Right now, we're just making a  short cut because we just test</span> <span data-start="14971.26" data-end="14974.722">if it will be hitting the right  or not, if there is something in</span> <span data-start="14974.938" data-end="14976.938">between</span> <span data-start="14982.139" data-end="14985.401">or not. This is going to use a  lot of computational power.</span> <span data-start="14985.402" data-end="14991.198">Raytracing is an old technique.  1984 was the first conference</span> <span data-start="14991.199" data-end="14995.495">that was taking this as a topic, and since then, we are still not</span> <span data-start="14997.379" data-end="15002.561">there where we have real time  raytraced engines that are</span> <span data-start="15002.562" data-end="15007.393">working. It has a lot to do with this that you cannot make short</span> <span data-start="15007.394" data-end="15011.132">cuts to make it look good. You  have to have a certain amount of</span> <span data-start="15012.614" data-end="15016.524">samples, unless you're going —  otherwise you're going to have a</span> <span data-start="15017.919" data-end="15019.919">really noisy</span> <span data-start="15022.043" data-end="15024.372">scenery.  So we have a lot of new light</span> <span data-start="15024.8" data-end="15029.21">sources in the room that are  also casting rays. I would like</span> <span data-start="15029.64" data-end="15031.64">to just very</span> <span data-start="15034.379" data-end="15036.379">briefly interviews</span> <span data-start="15038.768" data-end="15043.514">to you rastarization technique.  This is the most common real</span> <span data-start="15043.515" data-end="15046.015">time technique being used. It is just as fundamental, this</span> <span data-start="15046.363" data-end="15048.802">technique. It has been around  almost the same time because</span> <span data-start="15049.473" data-end="15052.617">when raytracing was introduced,  the computational power</span> <span data-start="15053.057" data-end="15055.172">notifications good or strong  enough. It would have taken them</span> <span data-start="15055.888" data-end="15059.546">forever to render one frame of  an animated movie, for example.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="15063.766" data-end="15065.766">So, what is interesting</span> <span data-start="15068.727" data-end="15070.727">about</span> <span data-start="15072.78" data-end="15077.561">rasteriziation, it is trying to  find out which object is in the</span> <span data-start="15078.001" data-end="15080.001">shadow, or what is the colour of it.</span> <span data-start="15086.232" data-end="15091.87">Raytracing is going from the eye to the camera into the scene,</span> <span data-start="15091.871" data-end="15096.033">rasteriziation is going from the objects from the scenery on to</span> <span data-start="15096.034" data-end="15102.144">the screen, due to perspective  projection. So we take all the</span> <span data-start="15102.145" data-end="15109.117">numbers and all our points, and  all our vertices and everything</span> <span data-start="15109.118" data-end="15113.775">and we project it on to the  screen. It is currently using</span> <span data-start="15113.776" data-end="15118.336">triangles, which is also a  rendering primitive. The cool</span> <span data-start="15118.768" data-end="15121.736">thing about triangles is that  you can't sub divide it any</span> <span data-start="15122.17" data-end="15126.33">more. You can't make more areas  out of it, and the area is</span> <span data-start="15127.539" data-end="15131.722">always planar, so we never have  a perspective warp or something,</span> <span data-start="15132.139" data-end="15137.075">which makes it really cool to  them project and test.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="15144.063" data-end="15151.06">What we do with the triangles  mapped on to the screen base,</span> <span data-start="15151.061" data-end="15153.061">we're</span> <span data-start="15154.683" data-end="15159.894">rasterizing each pixel and map  its C value and measure how far</span> <span data-start="15160.229" data-end="15164.571">away it is from the camera, and  if we we have transparency, then</span> <span data-start="15164.572" data-end="15169.301">we have to consider the C buffer because that's how we're going</span> <span data-start="15169.302" data-end="15175.191">to put it together, which also  tells us that the C buffer, so a</span> <span data-start="15175.499" data-end="15180.193">transparent object is basically  just a look-through with a</span> <span data-start="15180.456" data-end="15186.117">different alpha value which does not have this refraction rates</span> <span data-start="15186.118" data-end="15188.118">that are warped around in</span> <span data-start="15192.291" data-end="15196.466">this scene. Here in this image,  you can see two basic</span> <span data-start="15196.911" data-end="15201.904">implementations:  one basic  images of rasterization, and the</span> <span data-start="15201.905" data-end="15204.008">implementation of raytracing.  You can already see the</span> <span data-start="15218.535" data-end="15221.148">long way, if you have played any 3D games recently, or if you're</span> <span data-start="15222.07" data-end="15224.24">working with VR, you're going to know it is not going to look</span> <span data-start="15224.446" data-end="15224.648">like thedifference, I think.  While rasterization has come a</span> <span data-start="15224.649" data-end="15226.34">really long way, if you have  played any image up there, so</span> <span data-start="15226.341" data-end="15233.614">there is a lot of simulations of real physics happening in</span> <span data-start="15233.929" data-end="15236.284">rasterization but generally, the implementation is also a lot of</span> <span data-start="15236.795" data-end="15242.936">work to do to simulate these  physics. But they are doing a</span> <span data-start="15243.121" data-end="15248.84">pretty good job. The only  probably is still transparency,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="15248.841" data-end="15254.045">I think. So, just a quick  overview of the two:  raytracing</span> <span data-start="15254.317" data-end="15260.69">is mostly physically correct if  you put a rot of efforts in it.</span> <span data-start="15261.275" data-end="15264.139">It has nice side details that  you don't have to think about,</span> <span data-start="15264.369" data-end="15268.975">you get the soft shadows, the  interreflections, you get the</span> <span data-start="15269.614" data-end="15271.946">caustics, but it is  computationally heavy, so we're</span> <span data-start="15273.264" data-end="15275.91">going to use a lot of  computation time to render</span> <span data-start="15276.365" data-end="15279.077">frames, and, if we ever want to  do this real time, we're going</span> <span data-start="15279.536" data-end="15281.999">either have of to break it down, or we have to make</span> <span data-start="15286.083" data-end="15289.811">cuts.  Rasterization is super fast. It</span> <span data-start="15290.556" data-end="15295.526">is really only one  transformation from your</span> <span data-start="15296.453" data-end="15304.119">co-ordinates to your screen-base co-ordinates. Your GPU and your</span> <span data-start="15305.287" data-end="15309.914">computer is designed to do  rasterization, not raytracing.</span> <span data-start="15310.393" data-end="15313.888">Pixar and most of the rendering  people I know, they're still</span> <span data-start="15314.581" data-end="15318.274">rendering raytracing with CPUs  because it doesn't matter to</span> <span data-start="15318.805" data-end="15322.468">them if they're three times  faster or not. What matters is</span> <span data-start="15323.295" data-end="15325.331">that they have to change their  tools, and they have to change</span> <span data-start="15328.32" data-end="15331.672">their engines to be supportive  of GPUs. For just a little</span> <span data-start="15336.01" data-end="15339.15">benefit. So the physics that are not really correct, you have</span> <span data-start="15339.45" data-end="15341.45">like approximation of what you  can do. And you</span> <span data-start="15345.596" data-end="15349.02">have quality loss due to that.  This is kind of the point where</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="15349.021" data-end="15353.319">I hope you are all, "Oh, God,  how should I even get started?</span> <span data-start="15353.32" data-end="15358.003">It seems very complicated." I  would like to introduce you a</span> <span data-start="15358.004" data-end="15365.298">frame tool kit, and A Frame of  is a web tool kit where you can</span> <span data-start="15365.299" data-end="15368.509">Alf get started with making your own 3D scenes.</span> <span data-start="15368.51" data-end="15372.646">If you're a fan of HTML, you're  going to be really happy!</span> <span data-start="15372.647" data-end="15374.647">Because this is what it going to</span> <span data-start="15378.556" data-end="15385.024">look like. You can define the  HTML tags. You define the sky,</span> <span data-start="15385.338" data-end="15389.639">you can put sources in if you  want to use a sky texture. If</span> <span data-start="15389.89" data-end="15395.651">you prefer to use a sky colour,  you can put the colour. Then you</span> <span data-start="15395.652" data-end="15400.812">have this geometry primitives,  you have usually boxes, spheres,</span> <span data-start="15401.392" data-end="15407.291">cubes, whatever. Planes are also very common, and you can also</span> <span data-start="15407.292" data-end="15411.088">define the lights. And that's  where we come back to the</span> <span data-start="15413.643" data-end="15418.188">beginning, because, with this  component, you're going to make</span> <span data-start="15418.497" data-end="15421.06">or break your scene. If your  lighting is</span> <span data-start="15424.319" data-end="15428.789">good, you can really achieve a  lot by just having three or</span> <span data-start="15428.79" data-end="15435.106">four, or five different objects  in the game. And the best part</span> <span data-start="15435.107" data-end="15440.163">of A Frame is that it comes with web VR integration, so you don't</span> <span data-start="15440.616" data-end="15444.554">have to do anything. You can  lean back, you can import your</span> <span data-start="15444.555" data-end="15448.496">live controls, or every major  headset is supported. Also</span> <span data-start="15448.497" data-end="15453.657">mostly every major headset  controller is. So this is what</span> <span data-start="15453.658" data-end="15455.658">that example would</span> <span data-start="15459.494" data-end="15462.856">look like. But that did not look very good. I mean, the</span> <span data-start="15463.202" data-end="15468.432">background does, but the  foreground ..!  So, it's still</span> <span data-start="15468.86" data-end="15474.086">the big question in the room is  how do I get my 3D models? That</span> <span data-start="15474.087" data-end="15476.087">is where also we come in. For</span> <span data-start="15480.749" data-end="15483.487">example, this is going to be in  the head of your HTML. You learn</span> <span data-start="15484.187" data-end="15487.002">the external components called A Frame components and I think the</span> <span data-start="15487.415" data-end="15490.325">open-source community is really  doing an amazing job here</span> <span data-start="15490.326" data-end="15495.922">because you have all these  really cool components like A</span> </p>

This would</span> <span data-start="15575.876" data-end="15578.988">be a talk on its own, but this  is what I've been asked most of</span> <span data-start="15579.696" data-end="15581.696">the time. Again, how do I</span> <span data-start="15584.105" data-end="15589.4">get my content? Should I start  to learn Blender? That's a</span> <span data-start="15589.401" data-end="15593.015">pretty frustrating tool to  learn. I've worked a lot with</span> <span data-start="15593.016" data-end="15595.703">Blender, but it is pretty  powerful. However, you don't</span> <span data-start="15595.704" data-end="15601.326">have to do that because some  people, like my co-worker,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="15601.327" data-end="15607.31">Thomas, is writing an inspector  plug-in for A Team, which has a</span> <span data-start="15607.311" data-end="15611.72">3D inspector to try out your  values that you can then import</span> <span data-start="15611.721" data-end="15614.759">into your HTML file. You can use this inspector</span> <span data-start="15615.039" data-end="15621.643">plug-in to get models from  example Google Blogs. Try it</span> <span data-start="15622.967" data-end="15625.129">out, scale the models and have  fun with</span> <span data-start="15629.214" data-end="15635.776">it. Lighting is going to make or break your scene. I think it</span> <span data-start="15635.777" data-end="15640.329">really makes a big difference.  If you're interested in this, I</span> <span data-start="15640.33" data-end="15645.006">have high motivations to write  blog posts about this topic. And</span> <span data-start="15645.007" data-end="15649.324">then for the end is content  optimisation. We are people that</span> <span data-start="15649.812" data-end="15656.577">work mostly with the web, and  with different devices.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="15656.578" data-end="15659.791">So if you start working with 3D  for a project, think about what</span> <span data-start="15659.792" data-end="15664.64">is your target group. If you  want to use 3D on different</span> <span data-start="15664.641" data-end="15669.74">devices at the same time, keep  in mind you might want to design</span> <span data-start="15669.926" data-end="15673.938">it differently for whatever you  want to do. If you want to do a</span> <span data-start="15674.575" data-end="15678.908">fast-paced game, then you have  maybe to not be so detailed; but</span> <span data-start="15679.362" data-end="15683.953">if you want to do product, like  you want to do a scene of your</span> <span data-start="15684.385" data-end="15686.85">product which you try to sell,  you might want to be more</span> <span data-start="15687.187" data-end="15694.041">detailed on that. So, you should be thinking about loading your</span> <span data-start="15695.376" data-end="15697.661">assets progressively. That means you could have your textures in</span> <span data-start="15698.543" data-end="15702.941">different sizes or different  formats depending on what your</span> <span data-start="15703.624" data-end="15707.047">device is capable of doing. And  you should design for level of</span> <span data-start="15707.529" data-end="15709.529">detail. If there's an object  near scene that you are only</span> <span data-start="15709.844" data-end="15715.14">going to see two pixels, don't  make it have a million polygons,</span> <span data-start="15716.166" data-end="15721.375">please!  And these are all the  lessons that we have for free</span> <span data-start="15722.039" data-end="15725.06">from game development. Also, one other lesson that we are</span> <span data-start="15725.731" data-end="15732.002">actually doing, or that I was  working on is we do use</span> <span data-start="15732.663" data-end="15737.564">raytracing for calculating light simulation, for static scenery,</span> <span data-start="15737.977" data-end="15743.694">so the parts of our scenes that  are static, we use a raytracing</span> <span data-start="15744.73" data-end="15747.416">engine to calculate in the cloud what is our realistic light, and</span> <span data-start="15747.417" data-end="15753.945">then we put it back into the  rasterization with the real time</span> <span data-start="15754.237" data-end="15760.916">stuff. This is a really cool  workaround. So two takeaways and</span> <span data-start="15760.917" data-end="15764.589">then I'm done. Models,  materials, and light do matter,</span> <span data-start="15765.783" data-end="15770.091">and this one is mostly for  myself:  I love raytracing, it's</span> <span data-start="15770.416" data-end="15772.899">really cool, but are we ever  going to have it real</span> <span data-start="15776.273" data-end="15781.187">time? And we are having cool  demos on this, but it is still a</span> <span data-start="15781.546" data-end="15783.756">question in a is unanswered.  Thank you very much for</span> <span data-start="15783.757" data-end="15785.757">listening.

[Applause].   MARTIN: Is it working? Yes, it's</span> <span data-start="18287.119" data-end="18292.248">working. Okay, perfect. Thanks  for the intro. We're going to</span> <span data-start="18292.249" data-end="18298.118">start quickly with our — this is about Daedalus. You saw it in</span> <span data-start="18298.119" data-end="18301.82">the description, it's a bit  scriptic, but you will see a</span> <span data-start="18302.201" data-end="18306.466">pattern here during the talk,  because we're going to focus on</span> <span data-start="18306.467" data-end="18311.726">some parts of the Greek  mythology, and we have to have</span> <span data-start="18313.035" data-end="18315.959">the Maze as the labyrinth for  the topic. Let's</span> <span data-start="18319.22" data-end="18324.447">get started, and let's reveal  the topic. The topic today will</span> <span data-start="18324.448" data-end="18328.628">be creative coding in different  ways. I talked to many people</span> <span data-start="18328.629" data-end="18331.42">already, and they have different ideas. I try to cover many</span> <span data-start="18331.421" data-end="18335.555">aspects of creative coding now  during this talk. The first one</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="18335.556" data-end="18340.333">I'm going to show is quite odd,  it's — quite old. It's five</span> <span data-start="18340.334" data-end="18346.347">years old. It is things I show  at JSConf in Berlin five years</span> <span data-start="18346.886" data-end="18352.223">ago. It is some script that is  1024 characters long, an HTML</span> <span data-start="18352.224" data-end="18356.258">page, and, once you run this in  a browser, you will see a</span> <span data-start="18356.259" data-end="18361.639">spinning globe inside of that  page. So, that's something that</span> <span data-start="18361.64" data-end="18368.509">we call a quine, a computer  programme that outputs its that</span> <span data-start="18368.51" data-end="18374.619">is modifying itself. You can see this going on. Yes. Another</span> <span data-start="18374.62" data-end="18380.579">thing is this competition just  ended for 2018, the tenth time</span> <span data-start="18380.58" data-end="18386.244">the JS competition took place  which is a competition where</span> <span data-start="18386.245" data-end="18392.325">people can do something in 1K of JavaScript with no external</span> <span data-start="18392.326" data-end="18396.233">resources. I just want to show  one example because I think it</span> <span data-start="18396.234" data-end="18403.865">is a good fit here, by Johnny  Jikanga, new on the scene, and</span> <span data-start="18403.866" data-end="18406.87">he created an animation showing  the northern lights. I picked</span> <span data-start="18406.871" data-end="18410.952">this because we are all waiting  for this. At least you saw it</span> <span data-start="18410.953" data-end="18413.754">virtually here. Virtual reality. But I'm really</span> <span data-start="18414.807" data-end="18420.633">hoping to see it the next days.  It's really cool. You can see</span> <span data-start="18421.203" data-end="18424.246">some strange patterns going on.  I'm not going to go into the</span> <span data-start="18424.247" data-end="18427.573">detail because we don't have  much time. They closed the</span> <span data-start="18428.896" data-end="18432.958">competition, and you're able to  see the demo and see what is</span> <span data-start="18432.959" data-end="18438.999">going on in the background. Yes. The second topic I want to talk</span> <span data-start="18439.267" data-end="18446.934">about is code golf. Code golf is a mix of art, sport, and</span> <span data-start="18446.935" data-end="18450.329">programming. Because, you know,  from the term "golf", you try to</span> <span data-start="18450.33" data-end="18455.149">hit the ball into a hole with  the at least amount of strokes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="18455.32" data-end="18457.531">What you have here is you have a problem that you try to solve in</span> <span data-start="18457.867" data-end="18461.892">the least amount of characters.  So you're trying to shorten it</span> <span data-start="18461.893" data-end="18464.261">as much as possible. A good  example here</span> <span data-start="18467.696" data-end="18474.523">is this makes Pacman, an old  game, and like the theme we came</span> <span data-start="18474.9" data-end="18478.84">up with was we would like to  create this Pacman game but with</span> <span data-start="18478.841" data-end="18481.579">the least amount of characters  that we have, and one thing that</span> <span data-start="18481.778" data-end="18485.917">you usually start with is reduce the graphics, so, instead of</span> <span data-start="18485.918" data-end="18494.992">this nice little Pacman icon, we have an X and a dot. It's like</span> <span data-start="18494.993" data-end="18501.166">you're able to distinguish — you can see the -</span> <span data-start="18501.167" data-end="18506.207">the dots are the things that  you're going to collect. The 0</span> <span data-start="18506.452" data-end="18510.775">is the ghost and the X is the  Pacman.  You can move around,</span> <span data-start="18524.595" data-end="18526.119">collect all the dots. It is as  minimalistic, and the source</span> <span data-start="18526.12" data-end="18530.019">code is only 348bytes long.  collect all the dots. It is as</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="18533.262" data-end="18537.519">This was maybe two or three  years ago. It's not using some</span> <span data-start="18537.52" data-end="18546.045">year 6 things, so it could be  even shorter. Another thing is</span> <span data-start="18548.063" data-end="18551.938">instead of doing something small with the result, we pick only a</span> <span data-start="18552.197" data-end="18555.613">subset of characters and do  something big, and it's another</span> <span data-start="18556.007" data-end="18559.198">project I'm famous for,</span> <span data-start="18563.966" data-end="18567.616">JSFuck,.js Beep here on the  stage!  What you can do is you</span> <span data-start="18567.792" data-end="18572.074">can have a web page where you  can enter your JavaScript, and</span> <span data-start="18573.057" data-end="18577.131">it will output code that you can check and execute wherever you</span> <span data-start="18577.504" data-end="18579.504">like. It</span> <span data-start="18581.846" data-end="18588.522">only takes brackets, braces,  plus and ampersand as the</span> <span data-start="18588.523" data-end="18594.202">output. And this will be the —  so quite long, but quite</span> <span data-start="18594.378" data-end="18600.82">interesting to read. I have to  show this because it's like a</span> <span data-start="18601.168" data-end="18603.053">fundamental principle that we  are going to see in the next</span> <span data-start="18603.054" data-end="18606.447">example how this works behind  the scene. So what we are doing</span> <span data-start="18607.11" data-end="18615.819">here is, if we have not an MD  array, it will be converted into</span> <span data-start="18616.501" data-end="18621.904">naughts. If we don't have an MD  array, we have two, and if we</span> <span data-start="18622.718" data-end="18628.787">have the same, we get the string falls and the — the stringfalls</span> <span data-start="18629.01" data-end="18634.423">and the string — string false  true — we can pick several</span> <span data-start="18634.424" data-end="18636.718">cashing degrees out of this  word. Zero would be a plus in</span> <span data-start="18637.088" data-end="18640.09">the empty area, and we can pick  out the character T. We've got</span> <span data-start="18640.658" data-end="18645.438">the character R, the character U and the character E. If we then</span> <span data-start="18646.276" data-end="18648.907">take different words with  different characters and combine</span> <span data-start="18649.236" data-end="18652.943">them, then we can join them  again, and we can then create</span> <span data-start="18652.944" data-end="18657.123">new words out of this — for  example, "alert". That's</span> <span data-start="18657.449" data-end="18659.879">something I call playing  scrabble with the JavaScript, so</span> <span data-start="18660.303" data-end="18664.494">you have basic types, like   true, objects, also he</span> <span data-start="18665.178" data-end="18668.045">, as I mentioned, and  you can combine these characters</span> <span data-start="18668.603" data-end="18670.603">to new</span> <span data-start="18672.1" data-end="18675.034">words. One word that is super  important here is the</span> <span data-start="18675.528" data-end="18678.948">constructor. So we can get the  constructor as a string. And, if</span> <span data-start="18679.235" data-end="18684.598">you then take this constructor  and place it next to an empty</span> <span data-start="18685.035" data-end="18691.103">array and call constructor  constructor and then parsing</span> <span data-start="18691.862" data-end="18694.422">something, it is interesting  because first place will be</span> <span data-start="18694.886" data-end="18697.141">empty area constructor which is  basically the function, and, if</span> <span data-start="18697.142" data-end="18701.563">you have a function, and then  take the constructor, then we</span> <span data-start="18701.83" data-end="18706.843">have the function constructor  which lets us pass the code like</span> <span data-start="18707.05" data-end="18713.551">which is basically eval. So you  can combine this, and like</span> <span data-start="18713.552" data-end="18716.46">execute code without writing it. Another example that recently</span> <span data-start="18716.787" data-end="18724.216">came up is similar to JSFuck,  uses the same mechanics, it is</span> <span data-start="18725.649" data-end="18727.649">symmetric — symmetric to  JavaScript.  The a simple</span> <span data-start="18728.614" data-end="18735.56">example. But, every column that  you see is symmetric. If you do</span> <span data-start="18735.951" data-end="18740.022">just reroutes here, and the see  the first row is the words, the</span> <span data-start="18740.023" data-end="18743.1">second row is the character  index, and the third row is to</span> <span data-start="18743.271" data-end="18748.345">add these characters. Yes, so  you get this alert again. That's</span> <span data-start="18750.393" data-end="18754.718">it for the first part. Was there something? No. Oh.  Yes, here it</span> <span data-start="18755.345" data-end="18761.064">is. As you might have read in  the description of my talk, I</span> <span data-start="18761.065" data-end="18766.973">used the Daedalus writing and  the Latin alphabet and the Greek</span> <span data-start="18766.974" data-end="18770.957">version. The next part of my  talk was on different writing</span> <span data-start="18771.875" data-end="18777.927">systems that we have. For  example, Greek, we have</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="18777.928" data-end="18781.418">Cyrillic, Arabic, Korean, we  have Hebrew, and then Japanese,</span> <span data-start="18781.634" data-end="18783.634">and the last one. Who knows the</span> <span data-start="18797.026" data-end="18801.481">last one? It is A — I created a  website that is able to convert</span> <span data-start="18801.997" data-end="18807.006">your input last one? It is into  Arabish JavaScript, and you can</span> <span data-start="18807.007" data-end="18811.495">type not only different symbols, you could write this as</span> <span data-start="18811.496" data-end="18818.654">Icelandic characters, or runes  with your axe, you can hammer</span> <span data-start="18818.655" data-end="18823.962">them in, so you get an output  like this which looks — but it</span> <span data-start="18823.963" data-end="18828.059">is auto  —   Aurebesh. You can choose</span> <span data-start="18829.019" data-end="18833.621">different symbols, alpha bets,  then did will all do what you</span> <span data-start="18835.701" data-end="18837.701">want. For example, quite  interesting to do this, because</span> <span data-start="18840.699" data-end="18845.031">it uses this writing system, the first ones, once you have this</span> <span data-start="18845.519" data-end="18849.561">on the iPhone or a Mac it will  crash. While preparing my</span> <span data-start="18849.766" data-end="18852.364">presentation, I had this  somewhere in the file system,</span> <span data-start="18852.365" data-end="18855.041">and I took some time to get it  back because I had to install</span> <span data-start="18855.042" data-end="18857.042">some software to not display</span> <span data-start="18862.502" data-end="18865.041">it. This is JavaScript for some</span> <span data-start="18865.474" data-end="18869.707">machines. I like this personally because it used German words,</span> <span data-start="18869.877" data-end="18872.594">like ja nein,</span> <span data-start="18878.998" data-end="18885.991">scnit — this is Aurebesh, you  might see this in a Star Wars</span> <span data-start="18885.992" data-end="18889.386">movie. You can play around with  that and make it more graphical,</span> <span data-start="18889.991" data-end="18894.269">like only using underscores,  only using the upper half of the</span> <span data-start="18896.405" data-end="18900.336">vertical repeat marker, the  representation to write</span> <span data-start="18900.337" data-end="18905.448">variables, and to sign them with other variables. How does it</span> <span data-start="18908.38" data-end="18911.642">work? This is the simple example where I used the Latin alphabet,</span> <span data-start="18911.915" data-end="18917.221">and you see, they are quite  distributed over code, and, in</span> <span data-start="18917.654" data-end="18922.611">the end, it's the same principle as I showed you with the JSFuck</span> <span data-start="18923.073" data-end="18925.94">code, so we have strings and  single characters out of this,</span> <span data-start="18925.941" data-end="18930.206">and then you combine them to get the constructor, key word, and</span> <span data-start="18930.207" data-end="18935.086">then you also have a way to get  an alert in there and execute</span> <span data-start="18935.087" data-end="18941.445">that. This is an odd one where  we use Hebrew. Once you have</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="18941.446" data-end="18945.287">Hebrew words in the code, it's  funny because browser might</span> <span data-start="18945.697" data-end="18948.847">switch depending on your browser the writing direction. This code</span> <span data-start="18948.848" data-end="18953.947">is not read from right to left  but from right to left, which is</span> <span data-start="18953.948" data-end="18955.948">super interesting in</span> <span data-start="18958.297" data-end="18965.114">a way. Next step. We've seen  these variables and this, some</span> <span data-start="18965.115" data-end="18967.115">interesting ways</span> <span data-start="18968.63" data-end="18977.1">of hiding code. I think it is  the hangul until if a bet which</span> <span data-start="18977.101" data-end="18981.864">is used in the Korean alphabet.  They have a filler character.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="18981.865" data-end="18985.326">This filler character doesn't  take up any space, and it's</span> <span data-start="18985.69" data-end="18989.704">invisible. But you can still use this as a variable name in</span> <span data-start="18989.88" data-end="18993.288">JavaScript. So what you have in  the end is code that looks like</span> <span data-start="18993.831" data-end="18997.695">this, or actually, it is this.  And it's an odd version, I</span> <span data-start="18997.93" data-end="19004.75">shortened it a bit, so this is  alert one, and I call it the</span> <span data-start="19005.469" data-end="19008.423">invisible alert. It has some  character but you can't read</span> <span data-start="19008.424" data-end="19014.205">what's going on here.  Is yes.  You can do creative things with</span> <span data-start="19014.492" data-end="19021.145">that. When you see triple plus  signs, there's something where</span> <span data-start="19021.472" data-end="19023.753">it simply adds characters  together before you can have</span> <span data-start="19023.932" data-end="19028.44">something which looks like a fat arrow, with the assignment of an</span> <span data-start="19028.441" data-end="19033.762">arrow function, or you can put  backslash backslash into your</span> <span data-start="19034.19" data-end="19040.769">code. It looks like a regular  comment but it is a regular</span> <span data-start="19041.934" data-end="19045.996">expression. So what I did is I  combined these two aspects and</span> <span data-start="19046.261" data-end="19048.914">have something that looks like a comma in</span> <span data-start="19052.566" data-end="19056.738">the beginning, and something, a  bit of ping, empty string in the</span> <span data-start="19056.739" data-end="19060.957">centre of the code, you will see what is going on, and, if I</span> <span data-start="19060.958" data-end="19062.958">reformat this, I put this</span> <span data-start="19065.187" data-end="19070.048">into a script, this is the  source code of an HTML page, and</span> <span data-start="19070.049" data-end="19076.687">if I execute, it will show you  the void in an animated way.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="19076.688" data-end="19080.587">The missing link is here how to  buy invisible code. This is</span> <span data-start="19080.588" data-end="19085.962">quite easy to do, so you can use fillers or something from the</span> <span data-start="19085.963" data-end="19091.794">first ASC IoT page that still  takes up space, but on a second</span> <span data-start="19092.121" data-end="19094.121">ASC IoT page, there</span> <span data-start="19098.115" data-end="19105.432">are  —  ASC IoT page  you can wrap them in a string</span> <span data-start="19105.869" data-end="19112.26">and you can have a small snippet that will — so this is the code</span> <span data-start="19112.261" data-end="19114.261">we're going to use.</span> <span data-start="19118.355" data-end="19121.371">We are going to replace every  third and sixth characters and</span> <span data-start="19121.372" data-end="19123.372">join them</span> <span data-start="19125.364" data-end="19127.364">together with the backslash.</span> <span data-start="19133.18" data-end="19138.798">To give an example. These are  some control characters. We get</span> <span data-start="19138.799" data-end="19142.88">this percentage sign in front.  Numbers. We strip them away, and</span> <span data-start="19142.881" data-end="19147.39">then we combine every third and  sixth characters, and escape</span> <span data-start="19147.817" data-end="19152.063">them, and once we have that, we  have the other one.</span> <span data-start="19161.464" data-end="19163.3">[Applause].  Thank you, thank you. It's just</span> <span data-start="19163.301" data-end="19165.301">the beginning!  [Laughter].</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="19168.534" data-end="19175.49">Let's go back to the Greek  mythology. I showed this</span> <span data-start="19175.491" data-end="19178.472">labyrinth — I'm not sure you  know the different between a</span> <span data-start="19178.473" data-end="19187.528">maze and a labyrinth? The has  many ways and the — the Maze has</span> <span data-start="19188.032" data-end="19193.422">many ways and the labyrinth. The half man and half bull is eating</span> <span data-start="19193.869" data-end="19195.869">boys and girls that enter into</span> <span data-start="19199.788" data-end="19204.59">the labyrinth. What I like here  is that it has two aspects, it</span> <span data-start="19204.96" data-end="19208.263">is man and also the bull, and  there is something similar in</span> <span data-start="19208.565" data-end="19215.985">programming which is called  polyglots, which is a computer</span> <span data-start="19215.986" data-end="19219.798">programme that is written in  different languages at the same</span> <span data-start="19220.294" data-end="19223.41">time, and depending on the  compiler, it will execute</span> <span data-start="19223.411" data-end="19225.411">something different.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="19230.327" data-end="19235.825">I thought can we build jpeg,  HTML and CSS at the same time? I</span> <span data-start="19236.207" data-end="19238.901">created this page called  Inception, and this is when you</span> <span data-start="19238.902" data-end="19241.268">look at it, you have this image  in</span> <span data-start="19244.295" data-end="19248.038">there. We need to go deeper, and you can see some characters.</span> <span data-start="19248.039" data-end="19254.144">What it does is basically, it's  like one page with four</span> <span data-start="19254.145" data-end="19257.624">different types in it. It's hard to explain. I'm trying</span> <span data-start="19257.892" data-end="19261.594">my best now. So, what happens is that the browser opens the</span> <span data-start="19264.765" data-end="19271.243">file, and we will run it as an  HTML page. This HTML page has</span> <span data-start="19271.244" data-end="19278.288">the script with the source to a  hash. That will force it to load</span> <span data-start="19278.289" data-end="19282.377">it to the JavaScript. This  JavaScript will write a link tag</span> <span data-start="19282.378" data-end="19286.883">also pointing to hash and  interpret it as CSS, and this</span> <span data-start="19286.884" data-end="19291.259">CSS file then has a background  URL which is empty which also</span> <span data-start="19291.837" data-end="19296.945">takes the same page again, and  renders this in the browser.</span> <span data-start="19297.946" data-end="19303.398">Okay. Maybe a bit more in the  detail. We have the HTML which</span> <span data-start="19304.52" data-end="19307.982">is — whenever we open the  document for the first type, the</span> <span data-start="19309.142" data-end="19314.194">content type is an indicator  what to do with that, so it's an</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="19315.023" data-end="19317.648">HTML file. We simply have  something going on, but the most</span> <span data-start="19318.073" data-end="19322.277">important thing is we have to  attack our own tag called</span> <span data-start="19322.861" data-end="19326.591">inception. And another thing  where we have a script tag with</span> <span data-start="19327.6" data-end="19331.046">the chart set to lesson one  which points to the same</span> <span data-start="19331.047" data-end="19335.179">picture. This is now loading the JavaScript, and you see the</span> <span data-start="19335.75" data-end="19341.622">first variable here is a bit  strange. It's a bit like — it is</span> <span data-start="19341.984" data-end="19346.449">an object with the property  inception that is with the value</span> <span data-start="19347.355" data-end="19349.355">of</span> <span data-start="19350.495" data-end="19355.908">TT, and yes, the next line is  something strange because it</span> <span data-start="19356.476" data-end="19363.2">will multiply inception with an  object that has a property that</span> <span data-start="19363.201" data-end="19366.586">calls the function URL. So, you  might see the problem here</span> <span data-start="19367.987" data-end="19372.04">because JavaScript will fail if  it is not valid, and, in this</span> <span data-start="19372.219" data-end="19375.261">case, it would not be valid  because it doesn't know the URL</span> <span data-start="19375.563" data-end="19380.733">function, and it doesn't have  inception as a variable. What we</span> <span data-start="19381.087" data-end="19385.747">do later is we see inception and function URL, and this will</span> <span data-start="19385.748" data-end="19390.654">hoist the thing to the top, so  it's valid. And then, we have</span> <span data-start="19391.316" data-end="19394.792">some comments that will hide  code that we don't need but make</span> <span data-start="19394.793" data-end="19398.388">sure that it is valid. The most  important thing here is that</span> <span data-start="19398.389" data-end="19402.619">we're going to write a link tag  pointing to the same page to</span> <span data-start="19402.907" data-end="19406.811">load the style sheet. So this is the style sheet now. The same</span> <span data-start="19407.188" data-end="19414.155">page again. The first one is a  strange selector. So it tries to</span> <span data-start="19414.505" data-end="19418.792">find a tag with this strange  name, and then it has this other</span> <span data-start="19419.147" data-end="19421.147">equals sign.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="19428.995" data-end="19432.806">It not defined but it's valid  syntax. It will want to know</span> <span data-start="19432.807" data-end="19434.893">what is going on here.  The third line here, this is</span> <span data-start="19435.127" data-end="19439.829">something that is not valid in  CSS and what is happening in CSS</span> <span data-start="19439.83" data-end="19443.633">is that once the browser or once the browser has found something</span> <span data-start="19443.634" data-end="19447.267">that it is not valid, it will  break and not execute or follow</span> <span data-start="19447.735" data-end="19453.07">on, so it will only focus on the second line here which is that</span> <span data-start="19453.734" data-end="19456.376">every tag inside of our  inception tag will have the</span> <span data-start="19457.051" data-end="19462.715">background URL with the same  page. Yes. And this now loads</span> <span data-start="19463.104" data-end="19466.177">the same page again. The jpeg.</span> <span data-start="19471.952" data-end="19475.906">The most important thing here at the beginning, and then the</span> <span data-start="19475.907" data-end="19477.999">image data, and everything that  you see in the green, the</span> <span data-start="19483.301" data-end="19489.406">yellow part is metadata that  will simply be ignored in the</span> <span data-start="19489.768" data-end="19493.646">display. If we look at the hex  editor, it looks like this, but</span> <span data-start="19494.093" data-end="19502.516">you can zoom in to see what is  going on, FFE8 FFE1 is the eider</span> <span data-start="19502.727" data-end="19510.88">that says that is a jpeg. The  follow two bytes, they define</span> <span data-start="19511.1" data-end="19518.914">the helpful header side, so they — the hex header size saying we</span> <span data-start="19518.915" data-end="19525.024">take up the bites to do the  —   take up the bytes to do the</span> <span data-start="19525.025" data-end="19529.915">thing we want to do. If we look  at the hex presentation and, for</span> <span data-start="19530.633" data-end="19536.075">example, convert it to ACSII, we can see that this is looking</span> <span data-start="19540.27" data-end="19542.595">similar.SCII, we can see that  this is looking similar. This is</span> <span data-start="19542.981" data-end="19547.721">out of the defined range. As you remember before, we forced the</span> <span data-start="19547.722" data-end="19549.722">look at 1</span> <span data-start="19551.749" data-end="19557.033">one ISO589/1 encoding, and this  will turn our first hex codes</span> <span data-start="19557.034" data-end="19563.052">into something that is a valid  JavaScript area, but yep. That's</span> <span data-start="19563.542" data-end="19568.789">it. So this is the page that you will see in the end, and I call</span> <span data-start="19568.79" data-end="19570.79">this Inception. [Applause].</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="19580.277" data-end="19584.205">Daedalus. Maybe I have to  explain a bit more, so this is a</span> <span data-start="19584.206" data-end="19587.094">odd picture about Daedalus.  Daedalus, he was the inventor of</span> <span data-start="19588.762" data-end="19598.337">the first labyrinth on the  island Crete, and he was — I'm</span> <span data-start="19598.632" data-end="19605.648">not sure if you know the story,  son Icaru is who flew too close</span> <span data-start="19605.649" data-end="19609.456">to the son and fell into the  see. It is a tragic story. But</span> <span data-start="19609.868" data-end="19618.716">what I want to take here is  later, the one who got into the</span> <span data-start="19620.315" data-end="19625.034">labyrinth and tried to hill the  Taurus. If you studied computer</span> <span data-start="19625.773" data-end="19630.44">signs, you might have come  across the project. But what I</span> <span data-start="19630.658" data-end="19636.748">wanted to do is to draw a  labyrinth, or tool, a maze in</span> <span data-start="19636.749" data-end="19641.428">this case, because it has many  ways and JavaScript. This is the</span> <span data-start="19642.674" data-end="19648.083">lay-out I've chosen, and instead of walls, I had code. This code</span> <span data-start="19651.214" data-end="19654.669">is also valid. You can copy it,  and it will output a bigger</span> <span data-start="19658.166" data-end="19660.166">maze. To take some</span> <span data-start="19662.468" data-end="19666.154">steps further, I first tried to  minimise it. This is now the</span> <span data-start="19666.155" data-end="19671.51">whole programme that you need to generate this maze. It's only</span> <span data-start="19672.368" data-end="19677.872">133 bytes and it was originally  created by EDC65. I don't know</span> <span data-start="19678.076" data-end="19683.889">his real name, unfortunately,  but I was able to get it down so</span> <span data-start="19684.558" data-end="19688.144">we can play around with that.  During my studies, I came across</span> <span data-start="19688.427" data-end="19690.427">a</span> <span data-start="19693.238" data-end="19695.238">project called</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="19696.905" data-end="19699.622">Tasors where he is known as the  father of the information</span> <span data-start="19699.623" data-end="19705.533">theory, and he always created  crazy machines.</span> <span data-start="19705.534" data-end="19708.013">And one example, some people say the first example of machine</span> <span data-start="19708.3" data-end="19716.486">learning that he created was the so-called Theseus project and it</span> <span data-start="19717.396" data-end="19720.353">had two different phases — the  training phase and the testing</span> <span data-start="19720.641" data-end="19722.641">phase. It was</span> <span data-start="19724.308" data-end="19728.227">all working mechanically in  1952. He could set up a maze.</span> <span data-start="19728.228" data-end="19733.273">There was a mouse in there, and  the mouse tried to find</span> <span data-start="19739.26" data-end="19742.838">the Maze. So this is the  exploration strategy, so you</span> <span data-start="19743.399" data-end="19747.303">see, it's bumping against the  wall, it's moving back, and</span> <span data-start="19747.304" data-end="19752.146">tried to find this. There's the  second thing. Once it hit the</span> <span data-start="19752.147" data-end="19756.036">goal, wherever you place the  mouse, it will go straight to</span> <span data-start="19756.416" data-end="19760.276">the goal without bumping against walls. And what is interesting</span> <span data-start="19761.951" data-end="19765.009">here is the algorithm behind  because it fits on a sheet of</span> <span data-start="19765.729" data-end="19770.556">paper, and, so sum this up, the  exploration strategy, it reads</span> <span data-start="19770.557" data-end="19775.334">the direction where it come in.  It will rotate by 90 degrees,</span> <span data-start="19775.579" data-end="19781.128">move the mouse, and go back if  there was a wall and do it</span> <span data-start="19781.501" data-end="19785.15">again. It will always try to  return by 90 degrees, and then</span> <span data-start="19785.151" data-end="19791.324">try to move again. Yes, it is  the exploration strategy, and</span> <span data-start="19792.337" data-end="19795.984">this has been proved that we  always find the goal. Once it</span> <span data-start="19796.839" data-end="19799.798">has the goal, it switches to  something called the goal</span> <span data-start="19799.799" data-end="19803.194">strategy, and it's the same  thing but without the rotation</span> <span data-start="19803.565" data-end="19808.477">part, and it won't hit any wall. So it reaches the direction</span> <span data-start="19809.147" data-end="19811.963">where it enters, or last level  the cell, and it moves the</span> <span data-start="19812.151" data-end="19814.151">mouse, so it will go directly to</span> <span data-start="19817.161" data-end="19823.962">do both. And to put this in a  code, it's only 256 bytes. The</span> <span data-start="19823.963" data-end="19827.927">first part is to create the  Maze, the second part is to</span> <span data-start="19828.171" data-end="19831.112">solve this maze, and this part  is only to render the Maze, and</span> <span data-start="19831.373" data-end="19838.153">to see what the output looks  like, it will draw a maze with</span> <span data-start="19838.566" data-end="19843.009">hashes and the Os. They are the  way out. It will create a maze</span> <span data-start="19843.437" data-end="19845.437">and also solve</span> <span data-start="19848.392" data-end="19852.504">the Maze. An animation to show  you what is going on. This is</span> <span data-start="19852.505" data-end="19857.069">the representation used in the  background. This is the more</span> <span data-start="19857.493" data-end="19860.418">visible representation where you can see the arrows around, and</span> <span data-start="19860.892" data-end="19862.892">always turn them by 90 degrees  until it finds</span> <span data-start="19869.534" data-end="19875.369">the goal. Five minutes left. So  this talk was all about creating</span> <span data-start="19876.78" data-end="19881.238">the different aspects about  creative coding, how people can</span> <span data-start="19881.239" data-end="19883.239">squeeze code, how they do</span> <span data-start="19885.618" data-end="19889.985">visual stuff, and one thing that is important here and super</span> <span data-start="19889.986" data-end="19892.955">interesting in our language that we use in JavaScript is the</span> <span data-start="19892.956" data-end="19894.956">community behind, because</span> <span data-start="19899.185" data-end="19902.198">everything that you see, you can look to the source code to see</span> <span data-start="19902.199" data-end="19907.489">what is going on. In the 1980s,  there was this scene where they</span> <span data-start="19907.49" data-end="19910.969">were trying to hide their  source, not show how they did</span> <span data-start="19910.97" data-end="19914.304">it, and this switched in the  JavaScript community, because</span> <span data-start="19914.305" data-end="19918.663">everything was visible, and that is also a nice slack channel if</span> <span data-start="19918.664" data-end="19924.381">you want to get involved into  this. Once you have there, you</span> <span data-start="19924.382" data-end="19928.583">have a form to sign up. It was  established by</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="19935.039" data-end="19938.084">Maxime Auxillere. There are  discussions coming on. People</span> <span data-start="19938.085" data-end="19942.651">are discussing how to improve  stuff, and it's super</span> <span data-start="19943.122" data-end="19945.488">interesting. I want to use the  last two minutes, two and a half</span> <span data-start="19946.61" data-end="19948.61">minutes, to show you more</span> <span data-start="19952.199" data-end="19955.225">demos. Another website is popping up,</span> <span data-start="19955.967" data-end="19962.162">and what you can do here is you  can, similar to JS Bin, so you</span> <span data-start="19962.163" data-end="19965.943">type in some code, and the  update will be instant once you</span> <span data-start="19966.292" data-end="19973.01">type, and you have exactly 140  characters to do something. And</span> <span data-start="19973.214" data-end="19979.648">what they also do, they provide  you with some short cuts. For</span> <span data-start="19980.343" data-end="19984.498">Xenos, you have the capital S,  you have the access to the</span> <span data-start="19985.213" data-end="19988.138">canvas with a C. There's also  some savings. You have 140</span> <span data-start="19988.139" data-end="19993.17">characters left to do whatever  you like. So it's good play</span> <span data-start="19993.661" data-end="19995.865">around. It lists the examples,  if you can vote on this, and you</span> <span data-start="19996.754" data-end="20002.733">can see, for example, a game of  life. 140 characters. You can</span> <span data-start="20003.55" data-end="20007.677">see a 3D fish swimming in the  pool. That was something I was</span> <span data-start="20008.09" data-end="20011.585">working on, so we tried to find  the shortest way to render ocean</span> <span data-start="20012.064" data-end="20014.822">waves in only 66 bytes,</span> <span data-start="20019.013" data-end="20022.078">and we have wave casting that  fits on a business card!</span> <span data-start="20022.079" data-end="20024.079">[Applause].</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="20037.33" data-end="20042.446">The roller coaster, and really  crazy example stuff. It is We</span> <span data-start="20042.447" data-end="20044.731">have this crazy tuna going on.   like code pam, you can discover</span> <span data-start="20044.732" data-end="20047.112">them. Once you've found something that</span> <span data-start="20047.955" data-end="20052.228">is interesting, for example,  this piece where it will draw</span> <span data-start="20052.871" data-end="20055.149">the ball, so, it is basically a  bit map</span> <span data-start="20058.412" data-end="20063.787">encoder, it draws the ball. You  can use this to create your own</span> <span data-start="20063.788" data-end="20066.607">forks out of this. I create  something different here, so I</span> <span data-start="20066.608" data-end="20068.608">had a</span> <span data-start="20070.165" data-end="20072.165">spinning globe made</span> <span data-start="20077.518" data-end="20081.248">using some formula, and another  one come up with the spinning</span> <span data-start="20081.626" data-end="20086.437">sphere, and we tried to reduce  this until we only had 77 bytes,</span> <span data-start="20086.783" data-end="20090.881">and I said let's combine this  one with the bitmap rendering</span> <span data-start="20091.264" data-end="20096.453">which took some time, but, in  the end, Matthew Henri came up</span> <span data-start="20096.91" data-end="20101.505">with the spinning world in 140  bytes. He managed to create a</span> <span data-start="20101.713" data-end="20106.963">bitmap that looks like the world map on a spinning sphere. This</span> <span data-start="20106.964" data-end="20110.017">was not the end, so I tried to  do something different with</span> <span data-start="20110.878" data-end="20112.878">that, and the in the</span> <span data-start="20116.084" data-end="20120.159">end, Chun came up with the  coloured version of that. It has</span> <span data-start="20120.16" data-end="20124.712">some glitches. The one I started was about 500bytes that you saw</span> <span data-start="20124.713" data-end="20129.715">in the beginning, and this is  only 140 bytes.

Webpack 4 may not  exist. So, I just wanted to take</span> <span data-start="20691.381" data-end="20693.381">a second and recognise</span> <span data-start="20695.709" data-end="20700.531">those people. So, you know, we  wanted to create this</span> <span data-start="20700.532" data-end="20703.672">higher-level story about webpack 4 meant for our universities,</span> <span data-start="20703.673" data-end="20707.089">meant for us, and so the first  thing with smaller buildings and</span> <span data-start="20708.886" data-end="20710.886">faster buildings. The second was</span> <span data-start="20714.981" data-end="20716.875">modernisation. Finally, probably one of the most important, what</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="20716.876" data-end="20719.384">I mean, all of these are really  important, and not mutually</span> <span data-start="20719.965" data-end="20721.965">exclusive, which is developer</span> <span data-start="20724.53" data-end="20727.785">experience. And if I talk about  smaller and faster buildings,</span> <span data-start="20728.224" data-end="20731.32">and we try and break it down,  you can kind of categorise it</span> <span data-start="20731.679" data-end="20734.478">here. So like to have a smaller  build, you're going to need to</span> <span data-start="20734.88" data-end="20736.88">do more analysis on the</span> <span data-start="20739.629" data-end="20743.236">code.  You're going to have to process</span> <span data-start="20743.237" data-end="20746.112">more of the module graph, and  for faster buildings, you're</span> <span data-start="20746.292" data-end="20749.981">going to have to do less work  and reuse existing work that's</span> <span data-start="20750.342" data-end="20753.722">already been done. So these are</span> <span data-start="20756.73" data-end="20761.982">kind of conflicting, but for  faster buildings, we — builds,</span> <span data-start="20763.449" data-end="20767.945">we rearchitected what a chunk  is. It's the in-memory version</span> <span data-start="20768.184" data-end="20773.705">of the thing you secreted. We  added additional features like</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="20773.925" data-end="20776.551">JS. We're going to be using it  in parallel and caching it out</span> <span data-start="20776.552" data-end="20780.242">of the box. We also modernised a lot of the pieces that we had in</span> <span data-start="20781.232" data-end="20785.02">just old ES5 objects syntax, and we used to moving maps</span> <span data-start="20790.397" data-end="20791.205">and sets. Significantly, one of the most</span> <span data-start="20791.206" data-end="20794.822">important is the migration of  our plug-in system. We wrote it</span> <span data-start="20794.823" data-end="20796.823">completely from the ground</span> <span data-start="20798.732" data-end="20801.384">up.  Now, we have what are called</span> <span data-start="20801.385" data-end="20808.039">hooks which are monomorphic  code, and we lazy-compiled them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="20808.04" data-end="20810.883">I want to take a moment to  explain what does this even</span> <span data-start="20811.08" data-end="20813.569">mean? Who here is familiar with</span> <span data-start="20816.93" data-end="20818.93">monomorphism or Polly</span> <span data-start="20822.269" data-end="20825.304">morp —  this may look available to prior</span> <span data-start="20825.752" data-end="20830.564">to rewriting it. If you see  here, this method is what</span> <span data-start="20831.183" data-end="20834.468">certain classes in webpack will  call and plugins are listening</span> <span data-start="20834.469" data-end="20839.213">to this event, and what is  parsing is an arbitrary event</span> <span data-start="20839.214" data-end="20842.817">stream. It is like an event  emitter if you've ever used it</span> <span data-start="20843.201" data-end="20847.419">before. The problem is that this is Polly morphic. It can be any</span> <span data-start="20848.026" data-end="20850.381">amount of arguments. There's no  way for the JavaScript engines</span> <span data-start="20850.769" data-end="20852.769">to optimise this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="20865.334" data-end="20866.389">Why don't we get clever and have single arguments for all of</span> <span data-start="20866.39" data-end="20869.952">them. You can have an infinite  amount of different event names</span> <span data-start="20869.953" data-end="20871.258">and  Why don't we get clever and have single argument types that</span> <span data-start="20871.259" data-end="20875.373">you can parse in, so it's  unmaintainable and not really a</span> <span data-start="20875.374" data-end="20881.459">great contributor experience, so it's, like, how could we solve</span> <span data-start="20881.46" data-end="20887.231">this where we are creating  monomorphism functionings — mono</span> <span data-start="20887.522" data-end="20891.407">morphic functions but they're  unique, and we don't have a</span> <span data-start="20891.578" data-end="20896.63">billion of them we don't have to maintain? We use the technique</span> <span data-start="20896.631" data-end="20898.981">to lazily compile based on what  is listening to these events. I</span> <span data-start="20899.21" data-end="20902.387">know I'm going a little deep  here, but it might make more</span> <span data-start="20902.606" data-end="20906.328">sense in a moment. You can see  at the bottom, we are literally</span> <span data-start="20906.941" data-end="20912.973">just composing a bunch of  strings that our JavaScript</span> <span data-start="20913.364" data-end="20917.777">compiled to these hooks, and  then we evaluate it. So a really</span> <span data-start="20917.997" data-end="20921.754">great resource if you're  interested in this, and I will</span> <span data-start="20922.367" data-end="20927.614">try not to butcher the name,  Egerov wrote a great explain</span> <span data-start="20927.615" data-end="20933.129">article that you can go to and  take a look at it to understand</span> <span data-start="20933.777" data-end="20940.724">how this Acomb accomplishes  monomorphic code. You may — you</span> <span data-start="20942.049" data-end="20945.715">may not need Rust and — it turns out, that looks pretty familiar.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="20946.091" data-end="20950.304">The code that he show cased.  Look, he's doing the same thing.</span> <span data-start="20950.801" data-end="20956.766">So the point is that we can read this monomorphic code but we're</span> <span data-start="20957.88" data-end="20963.344">doing it evaluatatively or  lazily compiling it. Please to</span> <span data-start="20963.532" data-end="20966.728">not do it on normal projects.  There are some parts of webpack</span> <span data-start="20966.99" data-end="20972.364">that execute 19 plumb times on  large code basis, so everything</span> <span data-start="20972.543" data-end="20979.333">is in the hot path for us. So  just as Benedict Moyer says,</span> <span data-start="20979.334" data-end="20984.112">don't, please don't do this.  Please don't do this. So, like,</span> <span data-start="20984.309" data-end="20986.309">what did this</span> <span data-start="20992.402" data-end="20995.983">represent to us?  On most webpack builds, we saw</span> <span data-start="20996.231" data-end="20999.765">it get 98 per cent faster. 98  per cent of the build time was</span> <span data-start="21000.021" data-end="21005.321">reduced just by people upgrading to webpack four. 98. [Applause].</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="21010.777" data-end="21016.829">And you will be, "John, you're  lying — Sean, you're lying,</span> <span data-start="21016.83" data-end="21021.765">stop!" It turns out we had  people reporting reporting six</span> <span data-start="21022.634" data-end="21027.114">hours of webpack 3, nine hours  and stopped it at 6 on this run.</span> <span data-start="21027.554" data-end="21033.521">And so we were like, we have —  yes, and after the showcasing</span> <span data-start="21034.635" data-end="21041.222">this in the webpack 4 alpha, we  found 17 minutes — 17 minutes -</span> <span data-start="21041.768" data-end="21047.244">from mine hours. There's the  URL. You can go to it. I'm not</span> <span data-start="21047.245" data-end="21053.579">lying. And just to make sure, so that people are, "You're still</span> <span data-start="21054.009" data-end="21057.131">lying," once we had gotten to  our release candidacy, I decided</span> <span data-start="21057.394" data-end="21063.476">to play a little game to see  could we get people to upgrade</span> <span data-start="21063.872" data-end="21067.277">to the beta so we can catch  early bugs, warning signs,</span> <span data-start="21067.278" data-end="21072.331">things like that? Two, it's like this speed boost, is this for</span> <span data-start="21072.794" data-end="21080.117">real? Yes, I shot this out, and  like we were seeing 75 per cent.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="21080.418" data-end="21087.413">In some cases, we were seeing 90 per cent, 80 per cent. So it's</span> <span data-start="21087.691" data-end="21089.691">the real</span> <span data-start="21094.135" data-end="21098.734">deal. Build speed, to sum it up, we were able to accomplish that</span> <span data-start="21098.735" data-end="21103.472">first piece in what our goals  were. Then we still had smaller</span> <span data-start="21103.473" data-end="21106.371">builds. Now we had to do  something basically opposite to</span> <span data-start="21106.372" data-end="21109.885">what trying to get a faster  build will do for you. So the</span> <span data-start="21109.886" data-end="21114.315">first thing that we tried to  implement, and we were able to</span> <span data-start="21115.996" data-end="21120.424">do so, is JSON tree-shaking. If  you ever used JSON with webpack,</span> <span data-start="21120.741" data-end="21125.508">you will notice that, in version 3, it would bundle all the</span> <span data-start="21125.818" data-end="21130.627">pieces you import into it. We  found out that JSON is just a</span> <span data-start="21130.875" data-end="21137.518">stricter set of what JavaScript  is, and so we could treat it</span> <span data-start="21137.519" data-end="21141.012">like an atmospheric module, and  only the pieces that are now use</span> <span data-start="21141.712" data-end="21146.041">will actually get — will stay in your code. In this case, you can</span> <span data-start="21147.087" data-end="21149.514">just see, we're pulling in and  importing one property, and that</span> <span data-start="21149.717" data-end="21152.254">is all that compiles when we  minify</span> <span data-start="21156.1" data-end="21159.037">the code. We also have a future. I will explain the problem</span> <span data-start="21159.038" data-end="21165.094">first. So, according to module  specification, or the Harmony</span> <span data-start="21165.095" data-end="21170.448">module spec, when you have  multiple exports inside of a</span> <span data-start="21170.449" data-end="21175.88">file, every single one of them  has to be evaluated and executed</span> <span data-start="21176.406" data-end="21179.833">to ensure that they are not  creating side effects against</span> <span data-start="21180.19" data-end="21182.19">each other. So what does that</span> <span data-start="21185.085" data-end="21188.444">mean? Well, if low dash is  exporting from a file</span> <span data-start="21188.445" data-end="21191.748">essentially 1,000 exports, each  one of them has to be included</span> <span data-start="21192.101" data-end="21194.101">into your</span> <span data-start="21196.275" data-end="21198.275">bundle. You can see that here in this tiny</span> <span data-start="21202.206" data-end="21204.008">example.  We created this trick. We had to</span> <span data-start="21204.009" data-end="21207.189">tell the compiler some way there are no side effects here, you</span> <span data-start="21207.547" data-end="21210.389">can go ahead and ignore those  properties. So that is what we</span> <span data-start="21211.148" data-end="21215.222">did. We created the side effects property which now we're asking</span> <span data-start="21215.223" data-end="21219.011">library authors to include in  their package JSONs because what</span> <span data-start="21219.372" data-end="21223.36">webpack will do in production  mode is it will look for the</span> <span data-start="21223.361" data-end="21227.563">presence of this report, and it  will simply prune it out. And,</span> <span data-start="21228.041" data-end="21231.936">in fact, it actually makes  buildings faster when we're in</span> <span data-start="21232.537" data-end="21236.011">the beta stage that we found our production builds were faster</span> <span data-start="21236.012" data-end="21238.532">than the development mode build  because of this feature, because</span> <span data-start="21238.933" data-end="21245.557">what you're doing is ignoring  tracing those parts of the — so,</span> <span data-start="21247.51" data-end="21252.231">in this case, we thought  something like in webpack 3,</span> <span data-start="21252.559" data-end="21256.053">200kb of minimised code turned  actually to 1kb.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="21260.303" data-end="21264.645">So, really all you need to do,  it's so easy, all you have to do</span> <span data-start="21265.017" data-end="21269.973">is just tree-shake, minimise,  and then package authors had the</span> <span data-start="21270.19" data-end="21273.532">side side effect. No!  That's  ridiculous. You should not have</span> <span data-start="21274.075" data-end="21276.814">to do any of that. That kind of  gets into what developer</span> <span data-start="21276.815" data-end="21280.104">experience is about. All you  should have to do is freaking</span> <span data-start="21284.23" data-end="21289.133">run webpack. So out of the box  now in webpack 4, we default to</span> <span data-start="21289.471" data-end="21293.153">a production mode. All of those  things you saw in that bullet</span> <span data-start="21293.366" data-end="21298.854">point, they just happened. So  developer experience to us meant</span> <span data-start="21298.855" data-end="21302.396">we need to lower the barrier to  entry to people who are trying</span> <span data-start="21302.708" data-end="21306.635">these tools for the first time.  Not everybody understands the</span> <span data-start="21307.857" data-end="21310.817">rigorous and obnoxious history  of JavaScript modules where they</span> <span data-start="21311.255" data-end="21313.892">started and where they are now.  We also need to have better</span> <span data-start="21314.315" data-end="21319.286">defaults, and thanks to  libraries like Parcel, we can</span> <span data-start="21319.593" data-end="21327.45">coin something like zero config  JS. For us, zero config doesn't</span> <span data-start="21327.749" data-end="21330.754">mean doing whatever you want and shoving it into one package and</span> <span data-start="21330.928" data-end="21333.427">hope in the future you don't use breaks and cause the major</span> <span data-start="21333.769" data-end="21335.769">breaking change, it means being</span> <span data-start="21338.549" data-end="21345.159">able to actually extend a base  scenario to your users, so you</span> <span data-start="21345.16" data-end="21349.644">can bring your own zero config  JS. This is the line that we</span> <span data-start="21350.825" data-end="21355.687">wanted to cross. So, you know,  by default, you don't need a</span> <span data-start="21356.058" data-end="21361.993">webpack configure to use webpack 4. Every property has been</span> <span data-start="21363.29" data-end="21365.29">defaulted. And what the future -</span> <span data-start="21373.977" data-end="21376.924">[Applause].  What I'm trying to  say shall not everyone will end</span> <span data-start="21377.21" data-end="21380.604">up ripping up their webpack  because the power of webpack is</span> <span data-start="21381.67" data-end="21384.889">deeply rooted in how extensible  we are.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="21388.245" data-end="21392.518">Instead, why don't we extend  this idea? We created this</span> <span data-start="21392.519" data-end="21396.868">feature called mode. It's a  property on the config or a flag</span> <span data-start="21396.869" data-end="21401.029">that you can pass on the CLI,  and we default to production,</span> <span data-start="21401.03" data-end="21403.072">like I said. What it represents  for development is you want to</span> <span data-start="21403.43" data-end="21406.104">have tooling for the browser.  You're going to want to have</span> <span data-start="21406.436" data-end="21408.791">really fast incremental  compilation, and you're going to</span> <span data-start="21409.394" data-end="21413.188">have better error messages that  don't take up an entire console.</span> <span data-start="21414.861" data-end="21419.516">And then for production, we are  optimising for size. We are</span> <span data-start="21420.88" data-end="21424.594">optimising for the right kind of source code, and we are opt</span> <span data-start="21425.111" data-end="21428.95">missing for file paths that are  understandable but don't leek,</span> <span data-start="21428.951" data-end="21432.797">you know, information — don't  leak the information to people</span> <span data-start="21433.523" data-end="21435.434">using your website.

<p><span data-start="21441.667" data-end="21445.052">We've replaced it with an API  that does much of this out of</span> <span data-start="21445.053" data-end="21447.904">the box by default. But on top  of that, we have properties that</span> <span data-start="21447.905" data-end="21455.741">give you more control than  common chunks did. Then finally,</span> <span data-start="21456.619" data-end="21459.34">build speed was something we  took so seriously, that we</span> <span data-start="21459.341" data-end="21463.342">wanted to be able to profile and analyse really deeply any</span> <span data-start="21464.523" data-end="21470.886">long-running build.

<p><span data-start="21470.887" data-end="21474.478">Google who helped us implement a special profiler that allows you</span> <span data-start="21474.479" data-end="21479.675">to see every plugin and how long it takes, right inside of the</span> <span data-start="21480.53" data-end="21482.53">DevTools timeline viewer online. [Applause]</span> <span data-start="21496.057" data-end="21498.719">You. It allows us to say pop in  a plug-in and send us the event</span> <span data-start="21498.72" data-end="21501.247">in the JSON file. It is really  useful for those who You. It</span> <span data-start="21501.248" data-end="21503.927">allows us to are creating  plugins themselves, and trying</span> <span data-start="21503.928" data-end="21505.928">to</span> <span data-start="21509.323" data-end="21512.084">analyse interactions. That kind  of leaves us to the</span> <span data-start="21512.085" data-end="21514.828">modernisation and the  architecture. Is to so, one of</span> <span data-start="21514.829" data-end="21517.68">the most important things that  held us back in webpack 3 is</span> <span data-start="21517.681" data-end="21519.681">that we treat everything as a  JavaScript</span> <span data-start="21523.125" data-end="21528.731">module. But we also were  championed with being able to</span> <span data-start="21528.732" data-end="21531.417">implement web assembly as a  first-class citizen, giving us</span> <span data-start="21531.418" data-end="21537.165">the opportunity to remove all of these everything is.js hacks, or</span> <span data-start="21537.545" data-end="21545.98">- everything is JS hacks or  allowed us to WASM and a method</span> <span data-start="21547.364" data-end="21553.728">actual type and enable JSON, and we are now working on HTML and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="21554.081" data-end="21557.379">CSS module types. We had to  remove from our module factories</span> <span data-start="21557.582" data-end="21560.013">what we call them all the code  generation systems that were</span> <span data-start="21561.191" data-end="21567.137">specific to JavaScript, and we  isolated it. And so now, with</span> <span data-start="21567.338" data-end="21570.723">web assembly as a first-class  module type, you have code like</span> <span data-start="21570.724" data-end="21579.349">this. This is a newer library  called Walt. It is a</span> <span data-start="21580.822" data-end="21584.522">subset of TypeScript. It allows  you to write a JavaScript-like</span> <span data-start="21584.523" data-end="21586.523">syntax, as you see at</span> <span data-start="21588.561" data-end="21591.035">the top, is it and all you have  to do is import it like a</span> <span data-start="21591.036" data-end="21595.893">JavaScript module into your  code. You have used web assembly</span> <span data-start="21595.894" data-end="21600.931">without doing anything else at  your fingertips.</span> <span data-start="21600.932" data-end="21603.315">[Applause].  This is probably  one of the most exciting things</span> <span data-start="21603.585" data-end="21607.378">to me is that you want to use A  Frame or you want to use these</span> <span data-start="21607.92" data-end="21611.517">things. Now, what these library  authors can do is instantly</span> <span data-start="21611.766" data-end="21615.005">compile a web assembly module,  and, if it's available in the</span> <span data-start="21615.006" data-end="21617.858">package, webpack will consume  that instead of the JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="21617.859" data-end="21623.887">So you get the 10x speed-up  instantly at your fingertips. So</span> <span data-start="21623.888" data-end="21629.268">the other pieces were dropping  Node 4, so that is no longer</span> <span data-start="21629.869" data-end="21632.162">supported for webpack and Node 6 is our minimum version. But this</span> <span data-start="21632.43" data-end="21637.649">allowed us to convert the rest  of the code base to using ES6</span> <span data-start="21638.107" data-end="21641.454">features. It allowed our code to be more readable. Easier to</span> <span data-start="21642.08" data-end="21645.815">change.

We need something that could</span> <span data-start="22649.588" data-end="22652.73">analyse, build, manage, and sort for us.

We don't have a  tonne of time to go into it, but</span> <span data-start="22724.532" data-end="22728.159">we're going to talk about  challenges to democracy through</span> <span data-start="22728.441" data-end="22730.441">machine-learning. We are also  going to talk about</span> <span data-start="22730.526" data-end="22734.136">machine-learning for good.  Machine-learning does a lot of</span> <span data-start="22734.137" data-end="22737.057">cool things, and we're going to  talk about those too. We're</span> <span data-start="22737.432" data-end="22740.172">going to talk about some of the  practical tech that we all know,</span> <span data-start="22740.521" data-end="22742.969">so not necessarily  machine-learning but how we can</span> <span data-start="22742.97" data-end="22746.995">make a difference with some of  the things that we know today.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="22747.185" data-end="22750.264">Let's talk on a high level about what machine-learning is and</span> <span data-start="22750.644" data-end="22754.039">kick it off by the quote from  the fellow who coined the term:</span> <span data-start="22754.467" data-end="22758.528">machine learning gives computers the ability to learn without</span> <span data-start="22758.529" data-end="22763.038">being explicitly proceeding. We  are programmers, we're familiar</span> <span data-start="22763.039" data-end="22766.803">with if-then statement. What if  the conditions for these</span> <span data-start="22767.384" data-end="22771.011">statements become complex? I  mean really complex? If you're</span> <span data-start="22771.012" data-end="22773.884">building a programme to  understand that this is a pug,</span> <span data-start="22774.075" data-end="22776.783">and this is a kitten, you don't  necessarily want to programme an</span> <span data-start="22777.07" data-end="22781.452">if statement for every single  pixel here, or the possibility</span> <span data-start="22781.704" data-end="22785.962">for every pixel for every single pug photo. That's not how our</span> <span data-start="22786.284" data-end="22789.326">brains work, right? How do you  programme it? You want to teach</span> <span data-start="22790.237" data-end="22794.766">it a certain puliness. You want  your model to learn the essence</span> <span data-start="22796.923" data-end="22799.537">of the pug. So, in truth, there  are a few ways of doing this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="22800.193" data-end="22802.523">Sometimes, like the example  above, we can tag a set of data</span> <span data-start="22803.389" data-end="22806.491">and your model will use this  supervised data set to</span> <span data-start="22806.908" data-end="22809.117">distinguish between these  classes and this will help it</span> <span data-start="22809.118" data-end="22811.337">learn better. This is called  supervised machine learning. But</span> <span data-start="22812.051" data-end="22814.697">there are other times where we  don't really know the answer, so</span> <span data-start="22815.101" data-end="22818.952">if I asked a computer what those pugs would look like if bred</span> <span data-start="22819.783" data-end="22823.743">together with Stegosauruses,  that's not really a thing!  So,</span> <span data-start="22824.038" data-end="22826.088">there's nothing we can check  against. That's when we will use</span> <span data-start="22826.436" data-end="22830.53">an unsupervised process. But  let's dive into supervised</span> <span data-start="22831.434" data-end="22833.517">process because it's the east to explain in the time we have, and</span> <span data-start="22834.218" data-end="22837.154">it's also pretty common. Within  supervised machine learning,</span> <span data-start="22838.311" data-end="22840.446">there are thousands of  algorithms that you could use,</span> <span data-start="22840.916" data-end="22844.127">and among those convolutional  neuronetworks are probably the</span> <span data-start="22844.128" data-end="22847.415">most popular, but genetic is the easiest to understand, so we're</span> <span data-start="22847.416" data-end="22849.522">going to use that to kind of  discuss things on a</span> <span data-start="22853.027" data-end="22856.214">high level today. Let's explore  a simple toy model. In order to</span> <span data-start="22856.215" data-end="22861.777">make a pug kitten-sorter, we  build an algorithm that builds</span> <span data-start="22862.196" data-end="22865.131">algorithms. It will build many  of these and they will do their</span> <span data-start="22865.132" data-end="22869.131">best to sort these, and do their best sorting. At first, they</span> <span data-start="22869.516" data-end="22874.04">will be bad at it. They will be  terrible. But, we have another</span> <span data-start="22874.383" data-end="22877.235">function that will check this,  and they will check it against</span> <span data-start="22877.797" data-end="22881.192">that tagged data, and, for every kitten and pug scenario, so the</span> <span data-start="22881.193" data-end="22885.242">ones that get it wrong, they are thrown away, and the ones that</span> <span data-start="22885.906" data-end="22888.552">get it right, circle back to the builder, and then the builder</span> <span data-start="22889.176" data-end="22893.36">starts using those to create new builders. Now, this might seem</span> <span data-start="22893.864" data-end="22897.425">hackie and imperfect, and that's because it is. If we did this</span> <span data-start="22897.886" data-end="22900.603">once, twice, or three times, it  would fail, but we do it</span> <span data-start="22903.141" data-end="22905.283">thousands of times. We don't do  it for a small amount of</span> <span data-start="22905.284" data-end="22908.084">conditions, either. We build up  all of the gradients that make</span> <span data-start="22908.47" data-end="22911.707">up an eye, and then we match it  up against all of the other ice</span> <span data-start="22911.708" data-end="22916.208">that we know of, and then we  match that against the</span> <span data-start="22916.209" data-end="22920.157">likelihood of snouts. Our own  classification system,</span> <span data-start="22924.228" data-end="22927.131">genus et cetera is composed of  this set of rules. The part I</span> <span data-start="22927.132" data-end="22930.093">want you to remember is this  moving forward.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="22930.094" data-end="22933.376">The point where we check, you  can see how that is a very</span> <span data-start="22933.726" data-end="22937.122">important part of this. We have  to check if we want to get the</span> <span data-start="22937.123" data-end="22941.304">data right. We must do so, and  keep on checking. Another really</span> <span data-start="22941.564" data-end="22946.885">important part here is if I only gave these pug pictures that it</span> <span data-start="22947.077" data-end="22951.438">was fed on, that would be  correct, right? These are all</span> <span data-start="22951.868" data-end="22953.868">pugs, but what might happen is  that it might fail when it's</span> <span data-start="22954.337" data-end="22958.373">trying to find our one true pug. So the type of data that we</span> <span data-start="22958.607" data-end="22961.373">train on is really vital to  whether or not we have an</span> <span data-start="22963.031" data-end="22966.387">accurate model. Okay. So let's  explore some ways that</span> <span data-start="22966.735" data-end="22969.326">machine-learning has failed but  I'm going to call this section</span> <span data-start="22969.327" data-end="22972.674">the road to hell is paved with  good intentions. None of what</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="22973.395" data-end="22976.092">I'm showing this here today is  made with the idea of corrupting</span> <span data-start="22976.335" data-end="22979.283">society. Quite the opposite. All of these are really</span> <span data-start="22979.284" data-end="22982.56">well-intentioned examples. But  their failure is good for us to</span> <span data-start="22982.879" data-end="22986.25">explore so that we don't fail in the future. So let's say you</span> <span data-start="22986.251" data-end="22989.906">need to patrol a city but you  don't have enough patrol units</span> <span data-start="22989.907" data-end="22992.537">completely to cover this city.  So it might make sense to figure</span> <span data-start="22992.797" data-end="22996.694">out where all the crime is  happening. And just have some</span> <span data-start="22997.709" data-end="23000.982">patrol units that focus on the  areas of most activity. But the</span> <span data-start="23000.983" data-end="23003.86">problem is, not all crime is  equal. To get enough data, you</span> <span data-start="23004.611" data-end="23008.739">have to include nuisance crimes  in which no-one is hurt like</span> <span data-start="23009.246" data-end="23012.258">homelessness or pan-handling  with the violent crimes like</span> <span data-start="23012.259" data-end="23016.132">rape and murder but they don't  tend to be clustered in this</span> <span data-start="23016.541" data-end="23020.118">way. It takes a lot more data to build an area which is why the</span> <span data-start="23020.119" data-end="23023.94">nuisance data is included.  Another issue that those</span> <span data-start="23025.207" data-end="23027.977">nuisance data areas tend to be  the poor areas. What ends up</span> <span data-start="23028.576" data-end="23031.828">happening is you get more patrol areas in the poor areas, and</span> <span data-start="23031.829" data-end="23034.888">then we have more data on those  patrol areas, and we get into</span> <span data-start="23035.546" data-end="23039.05">this weird feedback loop where  we're just patrolling those and</span> <span data-start="23039.313" data-end="23042.648">then the rapes and murders that  happen in the affluent areas</span> <span data-start="23044.12" data-end="23047.05">start not to be reported. This  is what the software does in the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="23047.051" data-end="23049.593">United States, and it's an  example of sample bias, in</span> <span data-start="23058.856" data-end="23061.75">machine learning. We found once  you're a criminal, you're likely</span> <span data-start="23061.952" data-end="23065.703">to become a criminal again. A  lot of people keep re-offending.</span> <span data-start="23065.948" data-end="23069.568">They found the reason people do  this is that they find it hard</span> <span data-start="23069.569" data-end="23073.279">to fit back into society once  they're in jail. Another thing</span> <span data-start="23073.28" data-end="23076.563">is that employment becomes more  difficult because you have to</span> <span data-start="23077.059" data-end="23079.161">disclose that you were once in  jail on your employment forms,</span> <span data-start="23079.352" data-end="23082.964">and then people are less likely  to employ you. But here's an</span> <span data-start="23082.965" data-end="23087.659">important part. Employment tends to be the number-one indicator</span> <span data-start="23087.66" data-end="23091.465">of whether you're going to end  up back in prison. Even the</span> <span data-start="23091.466" data-end="23094.535">analysis of who ends up in the  system uses machine-learning,</span> <span data-start="23095.295" data-end="23099.914">so, when most defendants are  booked in jail, they respond to</span> <span data-start="23100.453" data-end="23104.4">a questionnaire fed into a  system that defines the risk</span> <span data-start="23104.401" data-end="23107.2">level for used in the length of  their sentencing. Whether you're</span> <span data-start="23107.573" data-end="23110.738">in for a short amount of time or a long amount of time. An</span> <span data-start="23111.278" data-end="23114.954">evaluation of more than 10,000  of these people found that the</span> <span data-start="23114.955" data-end="23118.459">risk scores showed a startling  difference. Black defendants had</span> <span data-start="23118.813" data-end="23122.703">scores pretty evenly matched  across the board — one meaning</span> <span data-start="23122.704" data-end="23126.947">no, and then you have a very  long sentence, whereas the white</span> <span data-start="23126.948" data-end="23129.936">risk assessments look quite  different:  many are assessed at</span> <span data-start="23130.814" data-end="23135.196">1, steadily decreasing to very  few at 10. You might say what if</span> <span data-start="23135.883" data-end="23140.323">that is just valid data? Except  upon analysis, it is not really.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="23140.588" data-end="23144.188">The studies showed that blacks  were twice as likely to be</span> <span data-start="23144.421" data-end="23149.201">labelled higher risk and not  re-offend, while their white</span> <span data-start="23149.76" data-end="23152.305">counterparts labelled not as  risky. If we look at this in</span> <span data-start="23152.84" data-end="23154.84">human terms, we see James</span> <span data-start="23158.541" data-end="23162.818">Ravelil — Ravelli had a  aggravated assault, drug</span> <span data-start="23163.186" data-end="23168.37">tasking, and he subsequently did re-offend. Robert canon had one</span> <span data-start="23168.371" data-end="23174.657">petty theft. There are more too. Lu go. O, low risk at one.</span> <span data-start="23174.658" data-end="23182.743">Mallory Williams, medium risk at 6. Lugo had three DUYs, Williams</span> <span data-start="23183.103" data-end="23186.52">had two misdemeanours and never  offended again. This is just a</span> <span data-start="23187.03" data-end="23190.618">couple of them. There's a lot.  These kind of algorithms don't</span> <span data-start="23191.027" data-end="23194.245">just affect black people,  either. A construction worker</span> <span data-start="23194.246" data-end="23198.756">who sold a piece of equipment  and sold it for parts low on</span> <span data-start="23200.072" data-end="23202.565">cash, since then, he's been  going to church and volunteering</span> <span data-start="23202.93" data-end="23206.891">but says his risk score doesn't  indicate any of the ways he is</span> <span data-start="23207.353" data-end="23210.096">bettering himself as a person  and therefore not a good</span> <span data-start="23210.097" data-end="23213.758">indicator of whether or not he's going to offend again. What</span> <span data-start="23215.765" data-end="23218.26">makes Compus fail as a  machine-learning algorithm? One</span> <span data-start="23218.539" data-end="23221.546">is that it has no transparency.  You make the algorithm, and then</span> <span data-start="23222.016" data-end="23224.722">they are sending it out.  Basically be the people who are</span> <span data-start="23224.898" data-end="23228.696">using it don't know how it  works. Another thing is, because</span> <span data-start="23228.697" data-end="23231.171">of this, because of that  relationship, it doesn't adapt</span> <span data-start="23231.48" data-end="23234.173">over time. Remember, we talked  about how important that step of</span> <span data-start="23234.439" data-end="23237.918">adapting is. And related to  these things, people use it</span> <span data-start="23238.272" data-end="23242.312">without any question. Another  question that might be asked at</span> <span data-start="23242.313" data-end="23246.422">this time is whether this is a  good place for machine-learning</span> <span data-start="23247.182" data-end="23248.868">algorithms. Machine-learning  algorithms are super powerful</span> <span data-start="23248.869" data-end="23251.198">and really wonderful but  sometimes, this should be in the</span> <span data-start="23251.49" data-end="23254.702">hands of a judge. Here's the  main thing about</span> <span data-start="23254.703" data-end="23259.072">machine-learning algorithms:  we try to be predictive of the</span> <span data-start="23259.073" data-end="23262.509">future but machine-learning  algorithms can really only</span> <span data-start="23262.719" data-end="23269.365">evaluate the past. So, Brennan,  one of the co-creators of this</span> <span data-start="23269.366" data-end="23271.268">technology didn't build the  technology with the idea of the</span> <span data-start="23271.269" data-end="23273.344">use for sentencing. That's the  strange thing about some of this</span> <span data-start="23273.746" data-end="23276.525">tech. Once you put it in the  world, adoption can be beyond</span> <span data-start="23277.323" data-end="23279.768">us. Anyone who maintains an  open-source project will say</span> <span data-start="23280.205" data-end="23282.304">that sometimes you put something out in the world, and the way</span> <span data-start="23282.305" data-end="23285.246">people use it is totally  different than the way you</span> <span data-start="23285.247" data-end="23288.833">intended or the way you had  foreseen. This is why it is</span> <span data-start="23289.164" data-end="23291.502">critical for these types of  technologies to be transparent</span> <span data-start="23291.881" data-end="23295.952">in order not to be abused. They  can't be magical. People will</span> <span data-start="23296.378" data-end="23300.637">say algorithms can't be biased.  But algorithms are written by</span> <span data-start="23300.981" data-end="23304.811">people. So this doesn't always  happen to criminals, it happens</span> <span data-start="23304.812" data-end="23309.183">to us too. Machine-learning is  now incorporated into a lot of</span> <span data-start="23309.61" data-end="23312.534">the tools that we use every day, and a lot of our internet</span> <span data-start="23313.006" data-end="23320.589">experience is built off  machine-learning algorithms.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="23321.259" data-end="23326.095">Axiom had an average 1,500 data  points, including the entire</span> <span data-start="23326.547" data-end="23330.817">adult population of the United  States.

It might not mean houses,</span> <span data-start="23442.798" data-end="23445.313">it can also mean that the things and the studies that you're</span> <span data-start="23445.616" data-end="23449.532">seeing, and educational material that you are seeing is based on</span> <span data-start="23449.533" data-end="23454.178">what you already believe, which  like that patrolling system that</span> <span data-start="23454.39" data-end="23457.979">we saw earlier was  self-reinforcing. I've</span> <span data-start="23458.864" data-end="23461.639">personally seen this. At one  point I worked for a company</span> <span data-start="23461.64" data-end="23464.045">that was starting to use machine learning. They proposed an idea</span> <span data-start="23464.287" data-end="23468.733">to surface content based on  Demme graphics. I had happened</span> <span data-start="23468.994" data-end="23473.911">to read up on that issue, Mabel  that it wasn't legal, and -</span> <span data-start="23473.912" data-end="23476.554">mainly that it wasn't legal.  They brought it up to people</span> <span data-start="23477.125" data-end="23480.29">saying this could introduce  bias. Here's an important part.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="23480.983" data-end="23483.783">I was just a regular engineer on that project. I wasn't a data</span> <span data-start="23483.784" data-end="23486.625">scientist, and I wasn't a PM. I  wasn't the person shaping that</span> <span data-start="23487.478" data-end="23490.237">project. I was just carrying  things out. Without raising my</span> <span data-start="23490.709" data-end="23495.323">hand, we might have shipped that feature to some really bad</span> <span data-start="23496.438" data-end="23498.533">consequences.

These tales are dark but</span> <span data-start="23511.325" data-end="23514.559">machine-learning offers us a lot of amazing benefits as well, as</span> <span data-start="23514.802" data-end="23517.964">my brilliant co-worker said:  it is like the risk we take every</span> <span data-start="23518.407" data-end="23520.874">time we get into cars or  aeroplanes. They've completely</span> <span data-start="23521.182" data-end="23523.182">transformed every aspect of  life, and made things possible</span> <span data-start="23523.259" data-end="23527.258">that wouldn't be possible  before. They're inherently</span> <span data-start="23527.937" data-end="23530.423">dangerous, and they can be  seriously misused. Think about</span> <span data-start="23530.738" data-end="23534.399">it. I wouldn't be on this stage  if it wasn't for aeroplanes, and</span> <span data-start="23534.873" data-end="23537.994">some of you wouldn't be here in  the same room. That's amazing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="23537.995" data-end="23540.746">But people have used aeroplanes  as weapons so we have a certain</span> <span data-start="23540.747" data-end="23546.863">respect for it. Now that I've  bummed everyone out, let's</span> <span data-start="23546.864" data-end="23548.864">explore some of the wonderful  applications for</span> <span data-start="23550.16" data-end="23554.223">machine-learning and what we can do with it. As I mentioned, I</span> <span data-start="23554.606" data-end="23557.008">worked for Microsoft, and we  have a thing called cognitive</span> <span data-start="23557.009" data-end="23561.757">services. It is a specific API  called the emotion API. It</span> <span data-start="23561.99" data-end="23566.087">allows us to analyse things like pictures and videos and see what</span> <span data-start="23566.088" data-end="23569.466">emotion it detects from what the computer sees. It can be used to</span> <span data-start="23569.467" data-end="23576.221">make things like this which I  built in 3.js which has no</span> <span data-start="23577.008" data-end="23579.008">practical application except  entertaining my four-year-old</span> <span data-start="23585.063" data-end="23588">stepdaughter.  >> [Video] wow!</span> <span data-start="23588.001" data-end="23590.001"Audience member: Cute.  >> Yes, there's stuff up there,</span> <span data-start="23596.786" data-end="23600.196">huh? Okay. Pretty magical, to  tell you the truth. What if we</span> <span data-start="23600.391" data-end="23603.668">put this to a more useful use. I was mentoring a blind woman and</span> <span data-start="23603.669" data-end="23609.212">she mentioned to me she left out of conversations on Twitter</span> <span data-start="23610.209" data-end="23612.209">because the photos didn't have</span> <span data-start="23614.215" data-end="23617.354">alt text. I used another  cognitive services offering, the</span> <span data-start="23617.647" data-end="23622.064">computer vision API which will  not only analyse a photo but</span> <span data-start="23622.065" data-end="23626.704">also its content like words. To  show how this works, we will</span> <span data-start="23626.705" data-end="23628.705">dive briefly into some of the  code. We will get the image from</span> <span data-start="23629.126" data-end="23635.819">the user. I'm using view of js  here. You can see here we are</span> <span data-start="23637.021" data-end="23641.405">using Acxios for a six call and  use the cognitive services to</span> <span data-start="23641.631" data-end="23644.283">analyse that image. We will do  so in a couple of different</span> <span data-start="23644.691" data-end="23648.406">ways. One to see what the image  contains, and one to check for</span> <span data-start="23648.873" data-end="23654.758">text within the image, and then  we will dynamically add the alt</span> <span data-start="23655.205" data-end="23658.779">text to the image. I'm building  a chrome extension is to that</span> <span data-start="23658.78" data-end="23662.62">blind people can use it on any  website. This application of</span> <span data-start="23663.33" data-end="23665.611">machine-learning can help bring  more people into the</span> <span data-start="23665.806" data-end="23667.806">conversation conversation, and  broaden our reach.

So, there's a fire  house near where I live, and</span> <span data-start="23790.225" data-end="23792.225">they have some sufficiently  complex systems to make sure</span> <span data-start="23792.301" data-end="23794.981">that everything is online and  functioning. I went out to their</span> <span data-start="23795.292" data-end="23797.983">station, and I asked them a few  questions about how everything</span> <span data-start="23798.258" data-end="23801.946">works, and to see if there was  anything that I could do that I</span> <span data-start="23801.947" data-end="23806.051">might help. Here's what I  learned:  when the truck goes</span> <span data-start="23806.635" data-end="23810.037">out, it has to communicate with  a dispatcher, which will help</span> <span data-start="23810.038" data-end="23812.445">facilitate if they need more  water, supplies, or back-up, and</span> <span data-start="23812.446" data-end="23816.56">the app is really simple kind of purposefully so because they</span> <span data-start="23816.819" data-end="23820.33">want everyone to be able to use  it quickly at a glance, and</span> <span data-start="23820.331" data-end="23822.914">there are not that many things  that they might need. What they</span> <span data-start="23823.243" data-end="23826.453">created was really perfect. But  I asked a few questions</span> <span data-start="23826.454" data-end="23829.521">including what happens if they  are all of a sudden offline?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="23830.027" data-end="23835.878">What if they can't  —   communicate. Right now, they're</span> <span data-start="23836.377" data-end="23841.086">hosed — get it, firemen!   Terrible!  Okay, here is our</span> <span data-start="23841.402" data-end="23844.849">opportunity. What I created was  a simplified version of their</span> <span data-start="23845.391" data-end="23850.086">app preserving the basic layout  but made use of service workers</span> <span data-start="23850.087" data-end="23854.012">and background to alert them  when they're offline, to cue the</span> <span data-start="23854.321" data-end="23859.123">messages, and, back up, to back  up, even if the browser tab is</span> <span data-start="23859.443" data-end="23861.805">closed. Here's what the  application looks like. If we</span> <span data-start="23862.676" data-end="23868.825">click on water, it registers —  the sync is registered but if we</span> <span data-start="23869.394" data-end="23873.593">go off Wi-Fi, it will tell them  they're offline, and I could</span> <span data-start="23874.195" data-end="23878.518">even close out that browser tab, go back, and then we can turn</span> <span data-start="23878.519" data-end="23885.117">the Wi-Fi back on. And then the  sync is registered and what we</span> <span data-start="23885.398" data-end="23889.237">requested before is then sent  out. So the enquires thing  — </span> <span data-start="23889.665" data-end="23894.047">and the request is sent out.  We're going to do that with</span> <span data-start="23895.769" data-end="23899.27">massive greater.online and  register a service worker when a</span> <span data-start="23899.271" data-end="23903.04">request is made.

And thank you so everyone on</span> <span data-start="27645.942" data-end="27649.727">this panel. That was a great  discussion. I'm sure we could</span> <span data-start="27650.659" data-end="27653.251">have heard more questions and  answers.

I just want to take my time to</span> <span data-start="27911.985" data-end="27915.686">thank all the organisers for  doing all of this. They've</span> <span data-start="27917.194" data-end="27920.492">worked so hard. They behind the  scenes. Everything is running so</span> <span data-start="27921.286" data-end="27924.848">smoothly up here, but like  sometimes, they're dealing with</span> <span data-start="27925.158" data-end="27928.7">so much stuff, I just want to  thank them and give them a round</span> <span data-start="27929.443" data-end="27931.443">of applause because they've been so amazing.

<p><span data-start="27937.85" data-end="27942.929">So, yeah, we've come to the end. And it's, I mean, really sad.</span> <span data-start="27943.172" data-end="27946.805"Audience member: Sad face.  >> But we're not going to let</span> <span data-start="27947.03" data-end="27949.03">this get</span> <span data-start="27951.475" data-end="27955.46">to us. We are here for jokes.  Those who can't see, it says</span> <span data-start="27955.461" data-end="27962.636">roses are red, violets are blue, unexpected line, unexpected</span> <span data-start="27962.637" data-end="27964.637">basket on line</span> <span data-start="27967.627" data-end="27970.68">32.  And to those who can see it,</span> <span data-start="27970.867" data-end="27973.912">yes, I programme in Java, I've  been stuck at this enterprise</span> <span data-start="27974.142" data-end="27976.785">job for the last five years, I'm slowly deteriorating, this isn't</span> <span data-start="27977.141" data-end="27979.29">a meme, it is a legitimate call</span> <span data-start="27982.463" data-end="27987.02">for help!  It's cut off. But  there's another one. Anyway,</span> <span data-start="27987.021" data-end="27990.234">we've really enjoyed this, and  what do you think of it?</span> <span data-start="27990.235" data-end="27993.1"Audience member: It's been wonderful.  >> Best time ever.</span> <span data-start="27993.101" data-end="27998.63"Audience member: I feel like we feel like John Snow on that one. It was really</span> <span data-start="28000.221" data-end="28004.827">fun who made that photobooth.  >> The helmets were way too big</span> <span data-start="28006.721" data-end="28009.348">for my head.  >> It was heavy. It didn't fit</span> <span data-start="28012.019" data-end="28014.678">my head as well. Iceland is so  great but I decided to change my</span> <span data-start="28017.486" data-end="28020.689">name. I want it more Icelandic  sounding.</span> <span data-start="28020.69" data-end="28022.69"Audience member: So my dad's name is</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="28025.759" data-end="28028.889">Orlando.  >> So I think I'm technically</span> <span data-start="28029.581" data-end="28032.953">Orlando's daughter, so that is  my name now!</span> <span data-start="28032.954" data-end="28037.481"Audience member: Is it even approved by the  naming committee? I think they</span> <span data-start="28037.482" data-end="28039.482">have strict rules.  >> The website of the list of</span> <span data-start="28039.931" data-end="28043.752">approved names by the Icelandic  naming committee. I picked the</span> <span data-start="28043.753" data-end="28048.248">ones that were closely, very  similar to my name. So I think</span> <span data-start="28048.838" data-end="28051.516">that's how is works out.  >> I don't know if you realised</span> <span data-start="28051.968" data-end="28053.968">that people here are very tall,  and we're</span> <span data-start="28058.824" data-end="28064.732">not tall. I'm 1 centimetres 58  on a good day depending on</span> <span data-start="28064.733" data-end="28069.335">humidity. I don't know, I don't  think we will be accepted as</span> <span data-start="28069.336" data-end="28071.427">Icelandic.  >> I think that's part of their</span> <span data-start="28072.104" data-end="28076.176">citizenship test:  how tall are  you? Are you at least 170. No,</span> <span data-start="28078.517" data-end="28080.517">I'm not!  So, I</span> <span data-start="28082.237" data-end="28085.295">just want to post our Twitter  again, because I want to be</span> <span data-start="28085.296" data-end="28089.583">Twitter famous like Dan but also keep in touch with everyone,</span> <span data-start="28089.584" data-end="28093.17">because I enjoyed my  interactions with everyone so</span> <span data-start="28093.42" data-end="28097.065">far, and I have had really good  conversations with a lot of you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="28097.515" data-end="28103.628">It's been really great. Follow  me and Vanessa on Twitter, and</span> <span data-start="28104.11" data-end="28105.678">follow these conversations and  talking about JavaScript, and</span> <span data-start="28105.679" data-end="28111.014">you can also follow my memes. I  post a lot of really, I mean,</span> <span data-start="28112.804" data-end="28115.242">dumb shit sometimes. So let's  talk about the party tonight.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="28115.243" data-end="28117.243">We're going to Bazaar.</span> <span data-start="28122.322" data-end="28128.209">There are buses scheduled from  5.45 to 11 from the Marina and</span> <span data-start="28128.21" data-end="28133.097">here, so get ready to party. I  heard that there is a karaoke,</span> <span data-start="28133.098" data-end="28136.652">so I bet, like, 20 bucks  someone's going to sing, "Don't</span> <span data-start="28136.653" data-end="28140.763">stop believing". Someone's going to do that.</span> <span data-start="28140.764" data-end="28147.321"Audience member: For sure.  >> Mr Bright Side, Wonder Wall.</span> <span data-start="28147.703" data-end="28149.703">All of</span> <span data-start="28152.173" data-end="28155.787">that!  I want to promote again  how Canadian we are!  So</span> <span data-start="28162.126" data-end="28162.386">sorry!   >> Saturday.</span> <span data-start="28162.387" data-end="28165.091"Audience member: We do have a trip on Saturday which is great because we get to</span> <span data-start="28165.697" data-end="28172.934">see Iceland. We're driving down  to the south coast, it will be</span> <span data-start="28172.935" data-end="28177.078">from 10. Is that six now? I  don't know how to read time. And</span> <span data-start="28177.317" data-end="28183.331">it is cut off over here. Yes,  there's more info on the</span> <span data-start="28183.65" data-end="28188.441">website. So check it out. And,  apparently, there's been some</span> <span data-start="28189.726" data-end="28193.314">cancellations, so there will be  a waiting list opening it up at</span> <span data-start="28194.777" data-end="28198.09">the website. So, you can sign up for that if you don't already</span> <span data-start="28198.579" data-end="28202.861">have a ticket, and then we're  also going to the Blue Lagoon</span> <span data-start="28203.04" data-end="28207.854">for a farewell brunch, and this  is information. I'm really</span> <span data-start="28208.213" data-end="28213.219">excited. It's been on my bucket  list for the longest time. Yes,</span> <span data-start="28213.64" data-end="28218.56">that's us. I'm glad that most  people use the nose ring and</span> <span data-start="28218.826" data-end="28224.768">arrest ring to tell me and  Vanessa apart. Nose ring</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="28225.058" data-end="28227.058">Florida, ear</span> <span data-start="28228.195" data-end="28232.309">Rick, Vanessa. It works out.  Thanks very much to everyone.</span> <span data-start="28232.31" data-end="28236.938"Audience member: You all have been a wonderful audience, and so a round of</span> <span data-start="28238.086" data-end="28240.214">applause for all of you.  >> And I'm going to call on the</span> <span data-start="28240.677" data-end="28245.278">organisers to come up on stage  because I think they want to say</span> <span data-start="28259.573" data-end="28262.206">flying in to be the Masters of  the Ceremony. A big thank you to</span> <span data-start="28262.207" data-end="28265.884">you both. Give them a round of  applause for an awesome</span> <span data-start="28265.885" data-end="28268.351">flying in to be the Masters of  job.</span> <span data-start="28268.352" data-end="28271.098">[Cheering and Applause]. Yes,  the party tonight. It is not</span> <span data-start="28271.834" data-end="28274.66">over yet. It is just like a sore moment, tears are starting to</span> <span data-start="28275.46" data-end="28281.497">flow out. But we still have two  more days, and one night, so we</span> <span data-start="28281.977" data-end="28285.391">are technically halfway through, depending on how you look at it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="28285.673" data-end="28290.205">But, yes, we will have all of  the info on the website. Contact</span> <span data-start="28290.206" data-end="28296.729">us on Slack. We want to end like we end everything at JSConf with</span> <span data-start="28297.07" data-end="28300.429">a big family photo. I want to  get all the organisers to the</span> <span data-start="28300.714" data-end="28305.598">stage to echo what they said  without tooting my own horn.</span> <span data-start="28306.016" data-end="28308.016">Epic job by these people.  Really. Give them a round of</span> <span data-start="28308.505" data-end="28310.505">applause. [Applause].</span> <span data-start="28322.701" data-end="28325.648">And, yes, with that being said,  I want to invite all of you to</span> <span data-start="28325.649" data-end="28327.649">the stage.  We will have to move some of the</span> <span data-start="28328" data-end="28332.855">tables a bit And, yes, away. We  are probably 250 or 300 people</span> <span data-start="28332.856" data-end="28338.574">still in the audience, so it's  going to take an effort to put</span> <span data-start="28338.575" data-end="28342.757">this all on the stage. The photo will be epic. So, thank you all</span> <span data-start="28342.758" data-end="28344.758">for coming. Join us on the  stage, and enjoy</span> </p>
