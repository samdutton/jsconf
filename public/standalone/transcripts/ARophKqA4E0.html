<p><span data-start="93.21" data-end="95.04">I build requires some sort of data</span> <span data-start="95.04" data-end="98.159">storage or user authentication and so I</span> <span data-start="98.159" data-end="100.799">can either just slog through and build a</span> <span data-start="100.799" data-end="104.97">back-end I can hire bribe coerce or</span> <span data-start="104.97" data-end="106.979">somehow otherwise convince someone to</span> <span data-start="106.979" data-end="108.75">build it for me or I can just give up</span> <span data-start="108.75" data-end="111.33">and do something else so if this is a</span> <span data-start="111.33" data-end="113.43">big commercial thing you're probably not</span> <span data-start="113.43" data-end="114.299">going to have to worry about this</span> <span data-start="114.299" data-end="115.56">because somebody else is paying for</span> <span data-start="115.56" data-end="117.99">number two but if you just prototyping</span> <span data-start="117.99" data-end="119.22">an idea or if you're building something</span> <span data-start="119.22" data-end="121.77">that solves a small

scope</span> <span data-start="125.909" data-end="128.61">and option number three is depressing so</span> <span data-start="128.61" data-end="130.319">you're probably going to try and do it</span> <span data-start="130.319" data-end="132.36">yourself and then you'll be looking at</span> <span data-start="132.36" data-end="137.43">this so I can sit down and I can deal</span> <span data-start="137.43" data-end="139.11">with all that I mean I can work with</span> <span data-start="139.11" data-end="140.58">these things but at the same time these</span> <span data-start="140.58" data-end="142.59">are all jobs other people's jobs</span> <span data-start="142.59" data-end="144.659">thankfully they make a living with this</span> <span data-start="144.659" data-end="145.89">and they know it really well and while i</span> <span data-start="145.89" data-end="148.59">can use PHP and rails and find a service</span> <span data-start="148.59" data-end="150.33">that framework and set up a database and</span> <span data-start="150.33" data-end="152.669">all that i could probably hack something</span> <span data-start="152.669" data-end="154.03">together that work</span> <span data-start="154.03" data-end="156.55">but it wouldn't be very good it would</span> <span data-start="156.55" data-end="158.68">take me too long and most importantly I</span> <span data-start="158.68" data-end="162.16">just don't want to it's not my job it's</span> <span data-start="162.16" data-end="164.319">not my expertise I probably wouldn't</span> <span data-start="164.319" data-end="166.6">enjoy it and I would probably find a way</span> <span data-start="166.6" data-end="170.2">to make terrible security mistakes so</span> <span data-start="170.2" data-end="172.239">really what do I need I mean in most</span> <span data-start="172.239" data-end="174.94">cases my requirements and indeed most</span> <span data-start="174.94" data-end="176.47">people's requirements at a basic level</span> <span data-start="176.47" data-end="179.26">are relatively simple what you want is</span> <span data-start="179.26" data-end="181.569">you want to have users so they can sign</span> <span data-start="181.569" data-end="184.569">in sign out and do user stuff you want</span> <span data-start="184.569" data-end="186.97">to be able to administer them and send</span> <span data-start="186.97" data-end="188.17">the new passwords when something goes</span> <span data-start="188.17" data-end="190">wrong you want to let them save and load</span> <span data-start="190" data-end="192.36">data because otherwise what's the point</span> <span data-start="192.36" data-end="195.28">you want to let them share the data with</span> <span data-start="195.28" data-end="198.76">each other or with the public maybe send</span> <span data-start="198.76" data-end="200.89">an email or two and ideally even let</span> <span data-start="200.89" data-end="204.16">them pay me for it that's not</span> <span data-start="204.16" data-end="206.019">particularly outlandish people have been</span> <span data-start="206.019" data-end="208.6">doing this for a very long time it's so</span> <span data-start="208.6" data-end="210.37">unspectacular I'd actually go and call</span> <span data-start="210.37" data-end="213.88">it boring it's not exactly particle</span> <span data-start="213.88" data-end="215.65">physics because this is particle physics</span> <span data-start="215.65" data-end="217.66">and particle physics is dictated by the</span> <span data-start="217.66" data-end="220.48">real world the web is not it is dictated</span> <span data-start="220.48" data-end="223.11">by what people think how it should work</span> <span data-start="223.11" data-end="226.209">so this stuff I think it shouldn't be</span> <span data-start="226.209" data-end="228.549">difficult I think it only should take a</span> <span data-start="228.549" data-end="231.76">couple of minutes so we're used to doing</span> <span data-start="231.76" data-end="233.65">stuff like this in the Dom you know just</span> <span data-start="233.65" data-end="235.329">manipulating the element is very query</span> <span data-start="235.329" data-end="239.23">so why can't signing up a user be</span> <span data-start="239.23" data-end="241.63">similarly simple why can't we just go</span> <span data-start="241.63" data-end="245.019">and do that so that's where the note</span> <span data-start="245.019" data-end="247.42">back end idea comes soon basically makes</span> <span data-start="247.42" data-end="250.54">that possible it's essentially about</span> <span data-start="250.54" data-end="252.01">delegation it turns something that is</span> <span data-start="252.01" data-end="254.32">difficult and full of pitfalls into a</span> <span data-start="254.32" data-end="256.03">commodity where the tricky and or dull</span> <span data-start="256.03" data-end="257.56">bits are handled by other people who are</span> <span data-start="257.56" data-end="259.78">better at it than you are and this makes</span> <span data-start="259.78" data-end="261.16">sense because we do it all the time in</span> <span data-start="261.16" data-end="264.37">all aspects of life so I doubt let any</span> <span data-start="264.37" data-end="265.72">of you do they're distributed version</span> <span data-start="265.72" data-end="268.02">control by themselves most of us go here</span> <span data-start="268.02" data-end="270.07">when something goes wrong with our</span> <span data-start="270.07" data-end="271.51">plumbing we call the plumber and when</span> <span data-start="271.51" data-end="273.039">something goes wrong with other dirty</span> <span data-start="273.039" data-end="275.38">things we call a lawyer so why can't we</span> <span data-start="275.38" data-end="278.65">do this with backends backends are hard</span> <span data-start="278.65" data-end="280.36">they're made up of a lot of different</span> <span data-start="280.36" data-end="281.86">components that will have to interact</span> <span data-start="281.86" data-end="283.24">with each other there's a variety of</span> <span data-start="283.24" data-end="284.009">languages and</span> <span data-start="284.009" data-end="285.509">in tax and even the simplest set up</span> <span data-start="285.509" data-end="287.669">there are arcane conventions that go</span> <span data-start="287.669" data-end="290.129">back 30 years and layers and layers of</span> <span data-start="290.129" data-end="292.74">choose compounded weirdness that really</span> <span data-start="292.74" data-end="294.18">takes ages to wrap my head around and</span> <span data-start="294.18" data-end="295.589">that's before you get a single user and</span> <span data-start="295.589" data-end="297.93">start scaling and really that sounds</span> <span data-start="297.93" data-end="299.219">like the first thing I want to get rid</span> <span data-start="299.219" data-end="302.999">of and you can get rid of it so by now</span> <span data-start="302.999" data-end="305.099">there are architectures and services</span> <span data-start="305.099" data-end="307.139">that more or less let you forget about</span> <span data-start="307.139" data-end="309.169">the backend and let you build these</span> <span data-start="309.169" data-end="311.58">complete data-driven web applications</span> <span data-start="311.58" data-end="314.61">from the client side all in jas and some</span> <span data-start="314.61" data-end="316.05">of them have really nifty features like</span> <span data-start="316.05" data-end="318.449">real-time data binding or offline</span> <span data-start="318.449" data-end="321.18">capabilities so what they do is they</span> <span data-start="321.18" data-end="323.58">turn your black your back-end into a</span> <span data-start="323.58" data-end="326.639">black box with an API so no back-end is</span> <span data-start="326.639" data-end="328.05">really a bit of a misnomer of course</span> <span data-start="328.05" data-end="329.099">there's a back-end you have to put the</span> <span data-start="329.099" data-end="331.469">stuff somewhere but it's not something</span> <span data-start="331.469" data-end="332.49">you have to worry about if you don't</span> <span data-start="332.49" data-end="340.8">want to ok so my three lines of code</span> <span data-start="340.8" data-end="342.629">examples I just showed you this a minute</span> <span data-start="342.629" data-end="345.899">ago actually I didn't show you exactly</span> <span data-start="345.899" data-end="349.559">that but very nearly that so that's no</span> <span data-start="349.559" data-end="351.149">back-end code it runs in the front end</span> <span data-start="351.149" data-end="352.589">and it does exactly like what it looks</span> <span data-start="352.589" data-end="355.259">like it does you can do that a few</span> <span data-start="355.259" data-end="357.059">seconds after you've scaffold about your</span> <span data-start="357.059" data-end="358.62">project in whatever no back in service</span> <span data-start="358.62" data-end="361.11">is you're using and that's a real thing</span> <span data-start="361.11" data-end="363.029">that's code from hoodie you can use that</span> <span data-start="363.029" data-end="364.979">day and it creates a proper user account</span> <span data-start="364.979" data-end="367.05">it authenticates that user and then you</span> <span data-start="367.05" data-end="371.009">can start storing data and storing data</span> <span data-start="371.009" data-end="372.809">doesn't look too different I mean</span> <span data-start="372.809" data-end="374.339">there's a store object it has an ADD</span> <span data-start="374.339" data-end="376.439">method and you give it data and it's</span> <span data-start="376.439" data-end="379.409">just a type and Jason and you'll notice</span> <span data-start="379.409" data-end="381.419">that there's no setting up database</span> <span data-start="381.419" data-end="383.519">there are no schemas there is no config</span> <span data-start="383.519" data-end="385.11">if you want to store data you store data</span> <span data-start="385.11" data-end="387.449">go ahead the infrastructure gets out of</span> <span data-start="387.449" data-end="389.969">your way want to send a multi-part email</span> <span data-start="389.969" data-end="392.159">from the browser go ahead in 2013 you</span> <span data-start="392.159" data-end="393.419">can send a multi-part email from the</span> <span data-start="393.419" data-end="397.8">browser why the hell not so that's a</span> <span data-start="397.8" data-end="399.749">nice example of the know back in</span> <span data-start="399.749" data-end="401.699">philosophy it's all about the API it's a</span> <span data-start="401.699" data-end="403.439">front-end centric the actual</span> <span data-start="403.439" data-end="404.819">implementation of sending that email</span> <span data-start="404.819" data-end="406.74">might be complicated it might not be</span> <span data-start="406.74" data-end="408.209">complicated why should we care it's</span> <span data-start="408.209" data-end="409.439">sending an email it's not that</span> <span data-start="409.439" data-end="411.449">interesting it should just be a thing</span> <span data-start="411.449" data-end="415.919">that you call and then it works so just</span> <span data-start="415.919" data-end="417.81">to wrap all that up no back end is</span> <span data-start="417.81" data-end="419.969">essentially a design paradigm for</span> <span data-start="419.969" data-end="421.219">architectures and frameworks that</span> <span data-start="421.219" data-end="423.539">abstracts complex back-end operations</span> <span data-start="423.539" data-end="426.12">and technology into a simple to use rest</span> <span data-start="426.12" data-end="428.849">api and as i said there is a back-end</span> <span data-start="428.849" data-end="430.319">but you don't have to deal with it if</span> <span data-start="430.319" data-end="432.659">you don't want to and of course most of</span> <span data-start="432.659" data-end="435.389">these services are extensible so you can</span> <span data-start="435.389" data-end="436.769">add functionality with plugins or</span> <span data-start="436.769" data-end="439.709">packages so that all sounds pretty good</span> <span data-start="439.709" data-end="441.389">and I think you get the idea and that's</span> <span data-start="441.389" data-end="442.409">all the code you're going to see from</span> <span data-start="442.409" data-end="445.139">you today so what I really want to talk</span> <span data-start="445.139" data-end="446.699">about is why this is cool and then what</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="446.699" data-end="447.93">I really want to talk about is why it's</span> <span data-start="447.93" data-end="453.779">important so what's cool is it makes web</span> <span data-start="453.779" data-end="457.05">development simple and accessible so all</span> <span data-start="457.05" data-end="459.539">of these things oh sorry for just a</span> <span data-start="459.539" data-end="464.219">second all of these solutions typically</span> <span data-start="464.219" data-end="465.81">typically come either as a service</span> <span data-start="465.81" data-end="467.669">that's hosted somewhere or as an</span> <span data-start="467.669" data-end="469.469">installable package that just includes</span> <span data-start="469.469" data-end="472.439">everything you run it and you get your</span> <span data-start="472.439" data-end="474.029">server your database you just get all of</span> <span data-start="474.029" data-end="477.089">it and that's very quick setup it's very</span> <span data-start="477.089" data-end="479.189">easy and it's a very low barrier to</span> <span data-start="479.189" data-end="481.439">entry in essence you download a thing</span> <span data-start="481.439" data-end="483.06">you double-click it and you've got a</span> <span data-start="483.06" data-end="484.469">development environment that's very</span> <span data-start="484.469" data-end="488.129">convenient so ideally and this is for</span> <span data-start="488.129"

data-end="1524">non professionals and we came up with a</span> <span data-start="1524" data-end="1525.649">process to help us achieve this and we</span> <span data-start="1525.649" data-end="1528.71">call it dream code and that slide</span> <span data-start="1528.71" data-end="1529.94">doesn't do it justice so there's a</span> <span data-start="1529.94" data-end="1534.779">second slide</span> <span data-start="1534.789" data-end="1538.25">so when we designed the initial API for</span> <span data-start="1538.25" data-end="1540.74">our no back-end thing we each sat down</span> <span data-start="1540.74" data-end="1543.289">and wrote hypothetical apps that worked</span> <span data-start="1543.289" data-end="1544.97">with a fictional know back in the API</span> <span data-start="1544.97" data-end="1547.549">that didn't exist yet and which</span> <span data-start="1547.549" data-end="1549.62">reflected what we thought were the most</span> <span data-start="1549.62" data-end="1551.929">intuitive simple and sensible ways of</span> <span data-start="1551.929" data-end="1554.299">working so we didn't start with the</span> <span data-start="1554.299" data-end="1556.37">system's capabilities and then exposed</span> <span data-start="1556.37" data-end="1558.259">them to the user we started with the</span> <span data-start="1558.259" data-end="1559.73">users requirements and built backwards</span> <span data-start="1559.73" data-end="1561.44">from there because we wanted people to</span> <span data-start="1561.44" data-end="1563.659">have a good experience with it so</span> <span data-start="1563.659" data-end="1565.61">essentially dream code is user centered</span> <span data-start="1565.61" data-end="1568.82">design for API it and for this was</span> <span data-start="1568.82" data-end="1570.049">really crucial because our target</span> <span data-start="1570.049" data-end="1571.7">audience for Juan Pardo isn't developers</span> <span data-start="1571.7" data-end="1574.73">like us we are also aiming for the non</span> <span data-start="1574.73" data-end="1576.409">developers the non-professionals the</span> <span data-start="1576.409" data-end="1578.029">beginners the amateurs those who can</span> <span data-start="1578.029" data-end="1580.669">just barely get along with jquery that's</span> <span data-start="1580.669" data-end="1582.259">cool we just want to give them more</span> <span data-start="1582.259" data-end="1585.2">power so we've made data-driven app</span> <span data-start="1585.2" data-end="1586.759">development so much simpler and more</span> <span data-start="1586.759" data-end="1588.679">convenient it would be a huge waste not</span> <span data-start="1588.679" data-end="1590.48">to try and broaden the scope of the</span> <span data-start="1590.48" data-end="1593.059">audience that where you're dressing we</span> <span data-start="1593.059" data-end="1594.32">want the power simplicity and</span> <span data-start="1594.32"

data-end="1601.97">ends up meaning is that where we are</span> <span data-start="1601.97" data-end="1603.83">designers like we and developers we are</span> <span data-start="1603.83" data-end="1606.11">designers not in the way you think I</span> <span data-start="1606.11" data-end="1608.419">mean this I mean this differently so we</span> <span data-start="1608.419" data-end="1609.649">need to know the fundamentals of design</span> <span data-start="1609.649" data-end="1611.629">process and design thinking but not</span> <span data-start="1611.629" data-end="1614.09">because we need nice websites for our</span> <span data-start="1614.09" data-end="1616.73">projects or nicely typeset document</span> <span data-start="1616.73" data-end="1619.19">documentation pages but because using</span> <span data-start="1619.19" data-end="1621.649">what we build from finding it to</span> <span data-start="1621.649"

data-end="1627.139">ask them for help with it succeeding</span> <span data-start="1627.139" data-end="1629.62">with it all of that is user experience</span> <span data-start="1629.62" data-end="1633.169">we are experienced designers we shape</span> <span data-start="1633.169" data-end="1635.36">how people experience what we make and</span> <span data-start="1635.36" data-end="1637.549">it pays off to design towards that</span> <span data-start="1637.549" data-end="1638.929">experience because that's what Google</span> <span data-start="1638.929" data-end="1640.879">and Apple and Facebook do and what</span> <span data-start="1640.879" data-end="1643.279">developers left of themselves tend to</span> <span data-start="1643.279" data-end="1646.039">forget and I know this from myself as</span> <span data-start="1646.039" data-end="1648.44">well so how many brilliant engineering</span> <span data-start="1648.44" data-end="1649.789">projects are there on the web that go</span> <span data-start="1649.789" data-end="1651.169">under use and ignore because the</span> <span data-start="1651.169"

data-end="1659.12">should you and that's not a good</span> <span data-start="1659.12" data-end="1661.94">attitude because we're experienced</span> <span data-start="1661.94" data-end="1664.57">designers whether we like it or not as</span> <span data-start="1664.57" data-end="1666.769">programmers what we produce needs to be</span> <span data-start="1666.769" data-end="1668.36">designed to the users needs and how you</span> <span data-start="1668.36" data-end="1669.95">present it needs to be tailored to an</span> <span data-start="1669.95"

data-end="1684.139">just a matter of economy too because</span> <span data-start="1684.139" data-end="1686.029">every time a developer saves time by</span> <span data-start="1686.029"

data-end="1706.059">trickle down economics which says that</span> <span data-start="1706.059" data-end="1709.369">if we help the people at the top somehow</span> <span data-start="1709.369" data-end="1710.869">everything will just trickle down and</span> <span data-start="1710.869" data-end="1713.869">people who aren't as savvy as we are</span> <span data-start="1713.869" data-end="1716.6">will somehow benefit from it but just</span> <span data-start="1716.6" data-end="1718.369">like trickle-down economics that doesn't</span> <span data-start="1718.369" data-end="1723.529">work so we we can revel in this idea of</span> <span data-start="1723.529" data-end="1724.94">the open web and it's all well and good</span> <span data-start="1724.94" data-end="1726.71">but at the moment that open web is like</span> <span data-start="1726.71" data-end="1728.24">an open window in the second story and</span> <span data-start="1728.24" data-end="1730.1">you have to bring your own ladder it's</span> <span data-start="1730.1" data-end="1733.22">not for everyone and I think no backing</span> <span data-start="1733.22" data-end="1734.84">is a great opportunity to help more</span> <span data-start="1734.84" data-end="1738.169">people shape the web and you you don't</span> <span data-start="1738.169" data-end="1739.25">have to worry about your job in your</span> <span data-start="1739.25" data-end="1741.23">status I mean these technologies are not</span> <span data-start="1741.23" data-end="1743.809">complete replacements for any tech stack</span> <span data-start="1743.809" data-end="1745.61">or it's not a magical solution that will</span> <span data-start="1745.61"

data-end="1752.809">solution that aims to be more open and</span> <span data-start="1752.809" data-end="1755.09">brings a number of promising promising</span> <span data-start="1755.09"

data-end="1792.48">thing much easier and in the end it's</span> <span data-start="1792.48" data-end="1794.01">also checked that requires us to think</span> <span data-start="1794.01" data-end="1795.66">more like product managers and designers</span> <span data-start="1795.66" data-end="1797.31">so we can build good experiences for</span> <span data-start="1797.31"

data-end="1804.39">it's our job to make making the web more</span> <span data-start="1804.39" data-end="1806.61">accessible to more people that is our</span> <span data-start="1806.61" data-end="1808.89">power and nobody else is going to do</span> <span data-start="1808.89" data-end="1811.23">this i think if we can help people</span> <span data-start="1811.23"
