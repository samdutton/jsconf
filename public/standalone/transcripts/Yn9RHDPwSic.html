<p><span data-start="202.66" data-end="204.34">JavaScript conference I decided to</span> <span data-start="204.34" data-end="205.9">create an MVC framework for thinking</span> <span data-start="205.9"

data-end="258.07">motivate so in designing systems for</span> <span data-start="258.07" data-end="259.93">humans make sure you can identify the</span> <span data-start="259.93"

but for</span> <span data-start="289.479" data-end="291.61">humans you need a mix of quantitative</span> <span data-start="291.61" data-end="294.07">and qualitative value in order to</span> <span data-start="294.07" data-end="297.46">evaluate your system success qualitative</span> <span data-start="297.46" data-end="300.63">value is sort of like the intangible</span> <span data-start="300.63"

data-end="329.8">without some sort of process of change</span> <span data-start="329.8" data-end="332.919">if we think of the mission as an end</span> <span data-start="332.919" data-end="335.26">we'd like to see brought about changes</span> <span data-start="335.26" data-end="337.06">the means we're executing toward that</span> <span data-start="337.06" data-end="339.91">end and sometimes it's big and sometimes</span> <span data-start="339.91" data-end="342.13">it's small but either way our system</span> <span data-start="342.13" data-end="347.71">should always be changing for the whole</span>

data-end="1099.98">not be entirely rigid your organization</span> <span data-start="1099.98" data-end="1102.41">should let people in it make adjustments</span> <span data-start="1102.41"
