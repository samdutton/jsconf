<p><span data-start="347.67" data-end="352.15">In the field of technology, we don't actually face moral dilemmas that often.</span> <span data-start="352.15" data-end="356.48">When there are two, moral dilemma occurs</span> <span data-start="356.48" data-end="362.12">What you take must not violate at least one of them.</span> <span data-start="362.12" data-end="366.33">I think JavaScript is attractive and the JavaScript community is in charge</span> <span data-start="366.33" data-end="372.169">Because I think the most fascinating real moral dilemma in a decade of technology.</span> <span data-start="372.169" data-end="374.11">I will tell you later.</span> <span data-start="374.11" data-end="377.79">Some people may already know what I'm talking about.</span> <span data-start="377.79" data-end="382.5">Technical issues usually mean we don't follow ethics.</span> <span data-start="382.5" data-end="388.02">I am not saying that this is an indictment that you are a bad person, immoral, immoral person.</span> <span data-start="388.02" data-end="393.96">There are companies out there that will get a side look now, but I mean in our</span> <span data-start="393.96" data-end="396.95">Industry, we have no professional code.</span> <span data-start="396.95" data-end="400.48">Some clubs can join, but if you are one of them, please raise your hand</span> <span data-start="400.48" data-end="402.639">Like ACM or I888.</span> <span data-start="402.639" data-end="409.21">There are some, but it is not the majority.</span> <span data-start="409.21" data-end="414.45">In practice, morals are about things: they are analysis of harm and mitigation</span> <span data-start="414.45" data-end="415.45">risk.</span> </p>
