<p><span data-start="109.49" data-end="112.32">One of those is push notifications.</span> <span data-start="112.32" data-end="116.69">I think push notifications are wonderful which is why I want to talk about them today, because</span> <span data-start="116.69" data-end="118.53">I'm not sure you do!</span> <span data-start="118.53" data-end="125.51">Push notifications are probably important to cover because it is not quite everyone</span> <span data-start="125.51" data-end="129.03">because we can get there, and we can do it.</span> <span data-start="129.03" data-end="130.75">You know how to do push notifications.</span> <span data-start="130.75" data-end="132.5">You have had a native app.</span> <span data-start="132.5" data-end="134.34">We will get there.</span> <span data-start="134.34" data-end="141.239">I just wanted to show a quick example because I'm so delighted that it did appear — this</span> <span data-start="141.239" data-end="142.39">is Edge.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="142.39" data-end="143.67">It works in Edge.</span> <span data-start="143.67" data-end="150.87">Out of the box for the first version of service workers push notifications came in, it was</span> <span data-start="150.87" data-end="153.319">way, and then wooh!</span> <span data-start="153.319" data-end="159.12">And I had to redownload a VM for that, because, you know.</span> <span data-start="159.12" data-end="164.65">If I go to Can I Use, it looks red and dangerous.</span> <span data-start="164.65" data-end="166.7">If you're looking at the reds and greens on this, it's not correct.</span> <span data-start="166.7" data-end="173.44">You want to look in the top right corner there where it says almost 75 per cent of active</span> <span data-start="173.44" data-end="179.61">users based on the global stats, almost 75 per cent of people have access to these.</span> <span data-start="179.61" data-end="184.7">You need to be thinking about them and building them in the correct way.</span> <span data-start="184.7" data-end="189.14">Push notifications are good, and that's what I want to talk to you today.</span> <span data-start="189.14" data-end="192.99">We are going to cover three things.</span> <span data-start="192.99" data-end="198.55">Briefly, how to push, with then we're going to talk about good push notifications, and</span> <span data-start="198.55" data-end="201.4">then talk about permissions.</span> <span data-start="201.4" data-end="206.48">Permissions get sculls because we're doing it wrong.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="206.48" data-end="214.18">Quickly on how to push: there's quite a convoluted setup to make push notifications work.</span> <span data-start="214.18" data-end="220.17">You start with a user and a browser, and you have to register your service worker.</span> <span data-start="220.17" data-end="227.019">Once you do that, you can ask for permission to send push notifications to the user.</span> <span data-start="227.019" data-end="234.459">When they say — if they say yes, you will get back a URL and a couple of encryption</span> <span data-start="234.459" data-end="242.54">keys which you will want to save on your server somewhere so you can use them later.</span> <span data-start="242.54" data-end="246.41">When you make a push notification, from your server you send a post request to the URL</span> <span data-start="246.41" data-end="251.209">you got which is the browser's push notification service.</span> <span data-start="251.209" data-end="255.84">You can encrypt information with that with the keys you got earlier so the browsers can't</span> <span data-start="255.84" data-end="262.43">read what you're sending to your users, and then the service will send a push to your</span> <span data-start="262.43" data-end="273.12">device which will wake up the service worker, which will react, send it back and make it</span> <span data-start="273.12" data-end="274.289">happen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="274.289" data-end="278.19">I'm not going to go into the technical side of that, the code, or anything.</span> <span data-start="278.19" data-end="297.94">If you want to find out</span> <span data-start="297.94" data-end="305.729">about that [sound distorted].</span> <span data-start="305.729" data-end="311.43">This is a tweet that comes across every once in a while on Twitter.</span> <span data-start="311.43" data-end="314.49">[Inaudible].</span> <span data-start="314.49" data-end="316.57">I don't think that's true.</span> <span data-start="316.57" data-end="318.81">I don't believe that.</span> <span data-start="318.81" data-end="320.379">I want push notifications for something.</span> <span data-start="320.379" data-end="322.16">They're useful things for us.</span> <span data-start="322.16" data-end="326.56">Push notifications are incredibly useful for the right things.</span> <span data-start="326.56" data-end="334.72">I do believe that the person that says that maybe doesn't want push notifications.</span> <span data-start="334.72" data-end="338.83">It's entirely possible that you are a person who, when you get your phone, the first thing</span> <span data-start="338.83" data-end="344.21">you go is go to settings and turn off notifications and never get that, and that's fine, but it's</span> <span data-start="344.21" data-end="346.32">not true for everyone.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="346.32" data-end="353.35">I have examples of good notifications and we need to hear them.</span> <span data-start="353.35" data-end="358.94">Appointment reminders is a good one.</span> <span data-start="358.94" data-end="360.49">I work at Twilio.</span> <span data-start="360.49" data-end="367.87">We've an API for sending text messages we have had for around eight years now, and text</span> <span data-start="367.87" data-end="371.56">messages get used for notification purposes as well.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1288.49" data-end="1291.379">But I feel like that could be better as well.</span> <span data-start="1291.379" data-end="1297.45">perhaps we could have an API that asks us whether we can ask permission yet.</span> <span data-start="1297.45" data-end="1305.47">Perhaps the browser should be implementing some kind of heuristic</span> <span data-start="1305.47" data-end="1310.51">for a progressive web app, you can only add to home screen after a certain amount of engagement.</span> <span data-start="1310.51" data-end="1313.88">We need this to be deterministic as well.</span> <span data-start="1313.88" data-end="1318.86">so being asked to ask the permissions API whether I have enough engagement yet might</span> <span data-start="1318.86" data-end="1320.179">be a good.</span> <span data-start="1320.179" data-end="1325.299">but again, I need more ideas, and I need more input for this, and we need to start talking</span> <span data-start="1325.299" data-end="1326.379">about it more.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1326.379" data-end="1333.049">So, in conclusion, I think push notifications are awesome — for the right things.</span> <span data-start="1333.049" data-end="1341.12">not for breaking news, but for important timely actionable and personal actions.</span> <span data-start="1341.12" data-end="1350.549">One more time for this one: do not ever demand permissions for anything on a page load.</span> <span data-start="1350.549" data-end="1356.41">make those notifications timely, actionable, and personal, or don't, break the rules, but</span> <span data-start="1356.41" data-end="1364.809">allow those users to opt out side your application so they don't turn it off for everyone.</span> <span data-start="1364.809" data-end="1368.96">For users like that, the whole web suffers.</span> <span data-start="1368.96" data-end="1374.649">They suffer because they can't get the good notifications we're talking about.</span> <span data-start="1374.649" data-end="1377.69">they will block it if they have a bad experience.</span> <span data-start="1377.69" data-end="1389.61">but we, as good develop — we can pry good experiences for these permissions and notifications</span> <span data-start="1389.61" data-end="1392.169">in general.</span> </p>
