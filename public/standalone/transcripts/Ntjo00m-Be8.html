data-end="258.709">short it depends on the context how</span> <span data-start="258.709" data-end="261.26">about 100 millisecond is it long or</span> <span data-start="261.26" data-end="267.47">short so let me show you something I'm</span> <span data-start="267.47" data-end="270.34">going to show you a spinning chrome icon</span> <span data-start="270.34" data-end="274.16">to spinning chrome icons that shows up</span> <span data-start="274.16" data-end="278.33">for 1000 millisecond and the other one</span> <span data-start="278.33" data-end="281.51">is nine nine hundred millisecond and</span> <span data-start="281.51" data-end="287.96">let's compare which is longer which is</span> <span data-start="287.96" data-end="295.06">longer let me try once again this and</span> <span data-start="295.06" data-end="299.46">this which is longer</span> <span data-start="299.47" data-end="306.01">did you get it actually to be honest I</span> <span data-start="306.01" data-end="310.36">did a little cheat here so the icon on</span> <span data-start="310.36" data-end="313.24">the left hand side said it's 1000 meter</span> <span data-start="313.24" data-end="315.67">second but it actually showed that nine</span> <span data-start="315.67" data-end="317.77">hundred millisecond and the other one on</span> <span data-start="317.77" data-end="320.74">the right hand side it showed up one</span> <span data-start="320.74" data-end="322.57">southern Michigan although the Texas</span> <span data-start="322.57" data-end="324.73">says it's a nine hundred millisecond so</span> <span data-start="324.73" data-end="326.41">it's really difficult to tell the</span> <span data-start="326.41" data-end="329.5">difference of the 100 millisecond right</span> <span data-start="329.5" data-end="331.6">so it's very very difficult to tell the</span> <span data-start="331.6" data-end="334.6">difference but what is a point to</span> <span data-start="334.6" data-end="336.85">optimize the website to eliminate that</span> <span data-start="336.85" data-end="342.34">one hundred millisecond this is a report</span> <span data-start="342.34" data-end="346.06">from our research team at Google a few</span> <span data-start="346.06" data-end="349.6">years back this shows how small delays</span> <span data-start="349.6" data-end="353.53">affect humans behavior so in this</span> <span data-start="353.53" data-end="355.45">research we have picked up random number</span> <span data-start="355.45" data-end="358.57">of people users and we inserted</span> <span data-start="358.57" data-end="362.44">arbitrary delay between page load times</span> <span data-start="362.44" data-end="365.44">and for a few weeks don't worry too much</span> <span data-start="365.44" data-end="368.74">about the which part we inserted the</span> <span data-start="368.74" data-end="371.65">delay but the important thing is that it</span> <span data-start="371.65" data-end="374.8">actually caused users behavior by</span> <span data-start="374.8" data-end="378.04">inserting that delay for example if you</span> <span data-start="378.04" data-end="381.729">look at the role from second from the</span> <span data-start="381.729" data-end="385.21">bottom it is inserting four hundred</span> <span data-start="385.21" data-end="388.3">millisecond delay and for six weeks</span> <span data-start="388.3" data-end="392.49">after that the users with that delay</span> <span data-start="392.49" data-end="396.43">decrease the number of searches by zero</span> <span data-start="396.43" data-end="402.729">point fifty-nine percent how about 100</span> <span data-start="402.729" data-end="405.99">millisecond we we were not quite able to</span> <span data-start="405.99" data-end="409.18">detect the difference right so second</span> <span data-start="409.18" data-end="412.03">from the top says that a delay with a</span> <span data-start="412.03" data-end="415.229">100 millisecond and for four weeks and</span> <span data-start="415.229" data-end="421">you know surprisingly people did 0.2</span> <span data-start="421" data-end="425.25">percent less searches comparing to the</span> <span data-start="425.25" data-end="430.27">without the delay this mean that you</span> <span data-start="430.27" data-end="433.259">actually know the difference</span> <span data-start="433.259" data-end="437.949">unconsciously even you don't detect the</span> <span data-start="437.949" data-end="441.599">difference by you know by brain that it</span> <span data-start="441.599" data-end="444.669">you know the difference so you react to</span> <span data-start="444.669" data-end="450.789">the delay so it makes sense to optimize</span> <span data-start="450.789" data-end="453.58">your website much much faster it you</span> <span data-start="453.58" data-end="457.81">know even slightly so now we have a</span> <span data-start="457.81" data-end="462.4">reason to optimize your website how can</span> <span data-start="462.4" data-end="464.71">we make the mobile website web site</span> <span data-start="464.71" data-end="468.669">faster than now before God with before</span> <span data-start="468.669" data-end="472.69">we go deep dive deep into the concrete</span> <span data-start="472.69" data-end="474.819">techniques I'd like to review some basic</span> <span data-start="474.819" data-end="482.38">stuff first thing is cash so let me</span> <span data-start="482.38" data-end="508.58">bring up Jess conf website sure</span> <span data-start="508.59" data-end="511.44">what you are looking at is a chrome</span> <span
