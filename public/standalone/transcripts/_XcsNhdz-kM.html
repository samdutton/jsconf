<p><span data-start="20.29" data-end="21.29">Like I know everyone is saying that, but maybe it's because I'm like an inch taller but this</span> <span data-start="21.29" data-end="22.29">is super-bright.</span> <span data-start="22.29" data-end="23.539">The slides are uploaded on that URL if you want to follow along.</span> <span data-start="23.539" data-end="29.18">I want to kick things off with a kind of important message, and that's that you're all wasting</span> <span data-start="29.18" data-end="34.62">your time learning frameworks, because we got web APIs and we have web components and</span> <span data-start="34.62" data-end="40.329">other things and there is really no need for any kind of frameworks.</span> <span data-start="40.329" data-end="47.51">But before I'm getting kicked off stage, I know this statement is not 100% true and the</span> <span data-start="47.51" data-end="51.699">story is much more complex, but I think I got everyone's attention now, and I got an</span> <span data-start="51.699" data-end="57.43">excuse to use the confetti animation in Keynote, so that's great.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="57.43" data-end="65.46">So I'm Dominik, I work as a developer evangelist at Twilio.</span> <span data-start="65.46" data-end="69.08">We have a bunch of different APIs that allow you to send and receive SMS, doing phone calls,</span> <span data-start="69.08" data-end="72.24">video and a bunch of other things.</span> <span data-start="72.24" data-end="73.96">And I'm also a React developer.</span> <span data-start="73.96" data-end="75.81">I love building with React.</span> <span data-start="75.81" data-end="80.71">It's a great framework for a lot of the things I build.</span> <span data-start="80.71" data-end="85.78">I'm also an Angular developer.</span> <span data-start="85.78" data-end="90.14">I love using web components because I think there's a like a good use case for them.</span> <span data-start="90.14" data-end="95.79">I build things for the front end and the back end, and I love playing around with hardware,</span> <span data-start="95.79" data-end="100.08">as well, so I'm a hardware developer, as well, but if people ask, I describe myself as a</span> <span data-start="100.08" data-end="105.39">JavaScript developer, because all of the things that I talked about, I see much more frameworks</span> <span data-start="105.39" data-end="111.71">and libraries as tools, rather than anything else, and tools are here to solve problems,</span> <span data-start="111.71" data-end="116.15">and these problems might change over time, you know, based on my team, based on the project,</span> <span data-start="116.15" data-end="121.12">based on the time that like overall that I have for the project and that gets me back</span> <span data-start="121.12" data-end="125.83">to the statement that you're wasting time learning frameworks, because while I don't</span> <span data-start="125.83" data-end="131">believe t I think it was a got generalizer to get your attention and we've probably all</span> <span data-start="131" data-end="142.17">heard that you're wasting your time learning X because Y is faster or Y is better just</span> <span data-start="142.17" data-end="147.64">generally because I saw some benchmark saying that or it's just because Y is more popular</span> <span data-start="147.64" data-end="151.53">and I see it more often on my Twitter feed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="151.53" data-end="156">So I wanted to go back and talk about why we have frameworks in the first place, and</span> <span data-start="156" data-end="159.23">this is to solve problems.</span> <span data-start="159.23" data-end="165.21">As I said, any framework or tool is ultimately there to solve a specific problem, and if</span> <span data-start="165.21" data-end="168.81">you don't believe me, I wanted to go back in history and kind of talk about a couple</span> <span data-start="168.81" data-end="176.01">of things from the the web development history and the tools how they've developed over time,</span> <span data-start="176.01" data-end="179.819">and note that I'll be talking about a couple of things, but those are definitely not all</span> <span data-start="179.819" data-end="184.74">of them, and like there's more things that evolved over time, but those are some things</span> <span data-start="184.74" data-end="188.81">I personally interacted with, so I felt most connected to those.</span> <span data-start="188.81" data-end="191.26">And so I want to start off with JQuery.</span> <span data-start="191.26" data-end="195.78">I think we've all interacted at one time with JQuery regardless of how long you've been</span> <span data-start="195.78" data-end="201.91">doing web development and I want to figure out like why does JQuery exist in the first</span> <span data-start="201.91" data-end="202.91">place.</span> <span data-start="202.91" data-end="207">It's actually pretty easy to figure out because if we go to the website there is literally</span> <span data-start="207" data-end="213.35">a section called what is JQuery and it's an easy to use API that works across a multitude</span> <span data-start="213.35" data-end="219.819">of browsers and that might seem normal these days where we require everything to just work</span> <span data-start="219.819" data-end="225.38">in every browser, but in 2006, when JQuery was released, we were in the middle of the</span> <span data-start="225.38" data-end="229.55">browser wars, Firefox 2 was just released.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="229.55" data-end="236.27">Internet explorer 7 was just released and according to Wired it was not as standards</span> <span data-start="236.27" data-end="239.349">compliant as people hoped for.</span> <span data-start="239.349" data-end="243.62">Chrome was not yet on the market and there were a couple of others, like Camino, Flock</span> <span data-start="243.62" data-end="258.53">and browser were some of the ones: If you were not sure why that seemed to be a problem,</span> <span data-start="258.53" data-end="262.18">this is how you had to attach an event in 2006.</span> <span data-start="262.18" data-end="267.87">You had to check if add event listener actually exists, because that didn't exist in Internet</span> <span data-start="267.87" data-end="272.7">Explorer, but hey, thet attach event.</span> <span data-start="272.7" data-end="282.44">And so JQuery gave you a way to actually set an event handler.</span> <span data-start="282.44" data-end="286.78">And similarly if you wanted to do a web request you had to check if you were in IE6 and get</span> <span data-start="286.78" data-end="295.55">an add object and you had to write all this boilerplate and AJAX streamlined that process</span> <span data-start="295.55" data-end="303.37">for you and so with better access to the DOM, we ended up building more applications that</span> <span data-start="303.37" data-end="313.75">are UI-heavy from a JavaScript perspective.</span> <span data-start="313.75" data-end="324.8">So to share and build reusable components, like date pickers accordions and other things</span> <span data-start="324.8" data-end="329.23">so you can build them into your application and so we all jumped on that and kind of started</span> <span data-start="329.23" data-end="337.11">building more complex user interfaces for the browser and so our need for tools to structure</span> <span data-start="337.11" data-end="340.63">more complex applications grew.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="340.63" data-end="345.59">And so we got tools like backbone that literally focused on giving your application structure</span> <span data-start="345.59" data-end="350.26">to introduce models and views and things like that.</span> <span data-start="350.26" data-end="356.11">But at the same time, people didn't feel really comfortable that basically all of our document</span> <span data-start="356.11" data-end="360.91">structure moved into JavaScript and so some people wanted to go back to a more declarative</span> <span data-start="360.91" data-end="366.32">way of describing UIs rather than declarative through JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="366.32" data-end="377.43">Which created frameworks like Angular JS which focused on extending the HTML vocabulary rather</span> <span data-start="377.43" data-end="383.57">than having to write a bunch of JavaScript statements and as our codebases grew we needed</span> <span data-start="383.57" data-end="385.33">to have ways to handle that.</span> <span data-start="385.33" data-end="392.77">Concatenating JavaScript files was not the best use case anymore and so we came up with</span> <span data-start="392.77" data-end="401.62">module syntax like requireJS or bundlers.</span> <span data-start="401.62" data-end="406.38">And as people kept on developing those solutions and platforms developed, our problems kept</span> <span data-start="406.38" data-end="412.82">on changing and new frameworks and tools showed up, so by now, we got flooded with different</span> <span data-start="412.82" data-end="419">frameworks that could handle different use cases and so I think the important thing to</span> <span data-start="419" data-end="424.11">keep in mind here is all of these tools were created because people had problems and wanted</span> <span data-start="424.11" data-end="426.34">to find a way to solve these problems.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="426.34" data-end="431.29">They got together with others and built these solutions.</span> <span data-start="431.29" data-end="436.76">But building a framework is very much more of a life cycle, so while some, you know,</span> <span data-start="436.76" data-end="442.05">gain mainstream popularity, others often kind of stay as like niche solutions and additionally</span> <span data-start="442.05" data-end="448.61">to that, we often have some that just disappear over time for various reasons.</span> <span data-start="448.61" data-end="454.96">For example, JQuery kind of went out of the spotlight, because we moved into standards</span> <span data-start="454.96" data-end="460.32">that solved exactly these problems, so we have query selector and add event listener</span> <span data-start="460.32" data-end="465.47">now to solve a lot of the common DOM accessing problems and we have tools like fetch that</span> <span data-start="465.47" data-end="471.21">don't require us to use Ajax anymore to have a kind of cross-platform thing.</span> <span data-start="471.21" data-end="477.85">But while standards might solve a problem, I also have to disappoint you, because if</span> <span data-start="477.85" data-end="482.6">your favorite solution gets standardized, it doesn't necessarily mean it gets standardized</span> <span data-start="482.6" data-end="489.49">the same way, because it standardization is hard and it has to take into consideration</span> <span data-start="489.49" data-end="493.49">a lot of different aspects, because it has to solve the problem for everyone and not</span> <span data-start="493.49" data-end="495.65">just a share of folks.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="495.65" data-end="503.81">And the best way is with the extensible web manifesto.</span> <span data-start="503.81" data-end="508.41">It's a manifesto that was written by a bunch of folks that were involved with standardizing</span> <span data-start="508.41" data-end="516.579">web browser features  and it focuses on four key concepts.</span> <span data-start="516.579" data-end="525.39">The first one is it focuses on adding new low-level capabilities to build the web platform</span> <span data-start="525.39" data-end="527.319">that are secure and efficient.</span> <span data-start="527.319" data-end="533.829">So what that means is if we look at things like webGL, for example, or features like</span> <span data-start="533.829" data-end="538.939"> —  now, I have a hanger, oh, WebAssembly.</span> <span data-start="538.939" data-end="542.61">If you look at WebAssembly or webGL, those are very low-level things that we can build</span> <span data-start="542.61" data-end="550.279">tools on top of, like A frame or 3GS to use them, but they should also explain existing</span> <span data-start="550.279" data-end="559.009">features, so that's a good example for things like the Houdini API, or the web component</span> <span data-start="559.009" data-end="564.35">spec, because they explain how the browser already handles CSS or introduces new components,</span> <span data-start="564.35" data-end="570.499">and so it just exposes those to the outside, and then the other two are key, in my opinion,</span> <span data-start="570.499" data-end="573.37">for us to help browsers standardize things.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="573.37" data-end="579.999">The first one is to create a constant virtuous cycle of feedback, so this is very important</span> <span data-start="579.999" data-end="584.55">because it shows sort of in some standards like the web component spec why it took so</span> <span data-start="584.55" data-end="593.58">long because developers were not eager to try new things and so the browser vendors</span> <span data-start="593.58" data-end="598.129">doesn't get any feedback on standardizing this this and the other thing is they were</span> <span data-start="598.129" data-end="606.23">focusing on prioritizing efforts and deprioritizing others, which again falls into the same thing.</span> <span data-start="606.23" data-end="613.069">If we want something to come and we want to have an impact, we need to try these things</span> <span data-start="613.069" data-end="616.36">as soon as there's polyfills and things like that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="616.36" data-end="621.149">But if you want to learn about how the standardization process, you want to check out the talk from</span> <span data-start="621.149" data-end="626.22">Monica Dinculescu of how the sausage gets made from 2017.</span> <span data-start="626.22" data-end="635.29">It's also a great talk to learn more about the extensible manifesto.</span> <span data-start="635.29" data-end="641.269">The other thing is if something is standardized, it might not actually look the same way.</span> <span data-start="641.269" data-end="648.239">So we already saw the example of AJAX turning into the fetch command so that it better integrates</span> <span data-start="648.239" data-end="651.629">with the ecosystem and is more future-proof.</span> <span data-start="651.629" data-end="659.749">The other thing is things like RequireJS and CommonJS</span> <span data-start="659.749" data-end="666.029">took kind of the asynchronous aspect of RequireJS and a couple of other concepts to merge them</span> <span data-start="666.029" data-end="671.67">into something that made sense for the browser and ultimately for the ecosystem.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="671.67" data-end="676.249">One common one that I hear about at least on Twitter a lot these days is about the conversation</span> <span data-start="676.249" data-end="683.129">about standardizing JSX, and at least in my personal opinion, JSX for example makes it</span> <span data-start="683.129" data-end="686.999">fairly hard, because by nature, JSX is rendering independent.</span> <span data-start="686.999" data-end="692.899">We set the renderer to the compile time to JavaScript and it just translates that to</span> <span data-start="692.899" data-end="699.19">a bunch of function calls that we can use, and so we actually already have something</span> <span data-start="699.19" data-end="705.019">that allows you to do that, where you define a function of and then that returns some output</span> <span data-start="705.019" data-end="709.67">and we can use it in an easy way with an arbitrary syntax and that's tagged templates.</span> <span data-start="709.67" data-end="716.98">So we can perform any sort of function that takes care of the input that we put in, allows</span> <span data-start="716.98" data-end="722.11">us to interpolate values and then create any output we want, be it a new string or anything</span> <span data-start="722.11" data-end="729.399">else, and so Jason Miller, the creator of preact actually took that as an act which</span> <span data-start="729.399" data-end="736.72">allows you to use React, Preact or anything else without having to compile by using tagged</span> <span data-start="736.72" data-end="742.67">templates and yes, the tooling is not as great right now around this as JSX might be with</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="742.67" data-end="746.47">TypeScript and stuff like that, because that's because we are not as heavily invested in</span> <span data-start="746.47" data-end="755.6">this yet.</span> <span data-start="755.6" data-end="760.799">But even if things don't get standardized, sometimes projects drastically change or come</span> <span data-start="760.799" data-end="764.92">to an end, so Angular JS is a great example.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="764.92" data-end="772.589">With React and other things around 2010, the Angular team took some time and took a step</span> <span data-start="772.589" data-end="779.42">back and looked at what the current ecosystem is and wanted to create a new thing that solved</span> <span data-start="779.42" data-end="786.879">their problems in a way that they thought made sense and Angular 2 was a drastic rewrite.</span> <span data-start="786.879" data-end="796.009">And frankly that meant people moved on to React or Vue or other things because they</span> <span data-start="796.009" data-end="802.569">felt that their problems lined up better with React or Vue.</span> <span data-start="802.569" data-end="816.299">And so sometimes I hear that Angular is dead, but Angular is very much not dead.</span> <span data-start="816.299" data-end="824.059">There's for example, 21 Angular-specific conferences in 2019, versus I think I found 22 React conferences</span> <span data-start="824.059" data-end="829.79">and also, additionally to that, like we tend to be and serve our JavaScript bubble of people</span> <span data-start="829.79" data-end="834.619">who are full-time JavaScript developers, but there's lots of other people who write JavaScript</span> <span data-start="834.619" data-end="839.699">on a regular basis without identifying themselves as JavaScript developers, be it people who</span> <span data-start="839.699" data-end="843.98">write.net or Java or any other language.</span> <span data-start="843.98" data-end="848.329">The other part of the framework life cycle I that want to talk about is how frameworks</span> <span data-start="848.329" data-end="852.799">inspire each other and learn from each other, I think one good example is the origins of</span> <span data-start="852.799" data-end="853.98">Vue.</span> <span data-start="853.98" data-end="865.959">So Vue was created by Evan Hugh at the time he worked at Google or had just left Google</span> <span data-start="865.959" data-end="871.049">but he wanted to solve some of his own problems and to quote him, I wanted something that</span> <span data-start="871.049" data-end="879.43">captured the declarative nature of Angular's data binding but .. So here we can see one</span> <span data-start="879.43" data-end="887.1">of those classic examples actually written down as how they inspired each other.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="887.1" data-end="888.249">Another example is toolkits.</span> <span data-start="888.249" data-end="893.899">I think we've all used something like you Vue CLI, Angular CLI, there's lots of different</span> <span data-start="893.899" data-end="901.899">CLIs around these days, but I want to talk about the Angular CLI.</span> <span data-start="901.899" data-end="904.97">And more specifically about the Ember CLI.</span> <span data-start="904.97" data-end="910.889">Because up until last year there were plenty of references in the Angular CLI about Ember</span> <span data-start="910.889" data-end="917.29">CLI.</span> <span data-start="917.29" data-end="924.24">So took inspiration one step further by relying on that and then building on top of that but</span> <span data-start="924.24" data-end="927.339">sometimes the inspiration comes from the community.</span> <span data-start="927.339" data-end="932.959">So if you didn't hear of the term ahead of time compiling that's basically the way that</span> <span data-start="932.959" data-end="942.169">things like Angular during a compiling step remove unnecessary code and improve the startup</span> <span data-start="942.169" data-end="947.1">time and bundle size by removing parts of the library that are not necessary.</span> <span data-start="947.1" data-end="961.87">And in inspired by that, the group from swell did the same thing and called it rawact, it</span> <span data-start="961.87" data-end="968.47">replaces with direct rendering instructions for the DOM.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="968.47" data-end="972.359">But this also gets me to the fact that not everything works for every use case because</span> <span data-start="972.359" data-end="978.72">he points out in his repository that this is largely useful for things that your application</span> <span data-start="978.72" data-end="984.66">has less components than the size of the React source code, or if you're trying to do things</span> <span data-start="984.66" data-end="989.629">like building web components where you don't want to ship the entire React with every web</span> <span data-start="989.629" data-end="997.079">component so if you want to pick a date picker, you can do that without having to distribute</span> <span data-start="997.079" data-end="998.259">everything.</span> <span data-start="998.259" data-end="1004.79">And fair warning, the rawact is very much a proof of concept but I hope that React is</span> <span data-start="1004.79" data-end="1006.91">picking that up over time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1006.91" data-end="1011.679">But I can speak to the topic that people have different challenges and ultimately different</span> <span data-start="1011.679" data-end="1015.55">backgrounds and different challenges that they're trying to solve we tend to forget</span> <span data-start="1015.55" data-end="1018.999">about that.</span> <span data-start="1018.999" data-end="1030.68">A .net developer might feel more comfortable with an opinionated framework because that's</span> <span data-start="1030.68" data-end="1032.03">what they're used to.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1032.03" data-end="1043.98">And an enterprise developer might choose to use a framework that has batteries included.</span> <span data-start="1043.98" data-end="1048.42">But as much as frameworks are about solving problems, they're also about hype.</span> <span data-start="1048.42" data-end="1051.58">In fact they're very much about hype.</span> <span data-start="1051.58" data-end="1058.621">To quote Mark S, making a popular open source project is 10% idea, 15% code and 75% community</span> <span data-start="1058.621" data-end="1063.77">building and marketing and I think that's very true and by the way, you if you don't</span> <span data-start="1063.77" data-end="1070.67">know max Stoiber, he created.</span> <span data-start="1070.67" data-end="1083.82">I think two good examples are Aurelia</span> <span data-start="1083.82" data-end="1085.45">and Svelte.</span> <span data-start="1085.45" data-end="1088.99">It's actually a really good framework that is being used.</span> <span data-start="1088.99" data-end="1095.32">It's just not as widely known as Angular, for example, or React, and the other one is</span> <span data-start="1095.32" data-end="1099.69">Svelte, it's a framework that has a lot of great concepts, like the ahead of time compiling</span> <span data-start="1099.69" data-end="1102.5">and others.</span> <span data-start="1102.5" data-end="1106.77">It might actually be useful for your own project but chances are when you evaluated another</span> <span data-start="1106.77" data-end="1112.14">framework you might have just not heard of it and therefore didn't take it into consideration.</span> <span data-start="1112.14" data-end="1118.02">So hype really is what makes a framework, but less hype doesn't mean that it's killing</span> <span data-start="1118.02" data-end="1122.98">the framework, and that gets me to one of I think like the one thing I want you to take</span> <span data-start="1122.98" data-end="1128.88">away from this talk, and that's let's not call frameworks dead, because in JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1128.88" data-end="1130.93">nothing ever dies.</span> <span data-start="1130.93" data-end="1137.94">70% of the top million sites use JQuery and things like Angular and Ember and others have</span> <span data-start="1137.94" data-end="1145.64">vibrant communities and I think it's very disrespectful for the people who still maintain</span> <span data-start="1145.64" data-end="1152.6">these things but also the people who have to work with them on a regular basis.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1152.6" data-end="1156.65">But also, sometimes yes, some frameworks go unmaintained, but that still doesn't mean</span> <span data-start="1156.65" data-end="1161.87">that they are dead, because people don't have the luxury of being able to change overnight</span> <span data-start="1161.87" data-end="1168.6">to a new framework, because  —  and so as long as those tools still solve problems for people,</span> <span data-start="1168.6" data-end="1171.41">the community likely is going to stick around.</span> <span data-start="1171.41" data-end="1177.01">It might shrink in size, but that still doesn't mean that it's dead.</span> <span data-start="1177.01" data-end="1181.52">And so I like the comparison of how frameworks and libraries are like hammers, there's like</span> <span data-start="1181.52" data-end="1185.17">an unlimited amount of them and they have different sizes, different manufacturers,</span> <span data-start="1185.17" data-end="1191.18">and different specialization, but please don't tell someone to buy a new hammer, because</span> <span data-start="1191.18" data-end="1195.31">if they already have one, and it solves their problem, because they only have to put a nail</span> <span data-start="1195.31" data-end="1201.02">into a wall like once a month or once a year, don't tell them they need to drop their hammer,</span> <span data-start="1201.02" data-end="1203.7">because it's not efficient and they need to buy a new carpenter hammer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1203.7" data-end="1207.94">It's not their use case, because they don't need it that often.</span> <span data-start="1207.94" data-end="1211.31">So let's stop kind of making people feel bad about that.</span> <span data-start="1211.31" data-end="1216.11">Let's stop telling people they are wasting their time, because ultimately if they're</span> <span data-start="1216.11" data-end="1221.93">happy with their solution, they will  —  they're totally fine to keep using it, so let's not</span> <span data-start="1221.93" data-end="1223.31">make them feel bad.</span> <span data-start="1223.31" data-end="1234.18">All right, to wrap things up, I want to update an ask from Dan Abramov from 2016 and I want</span> <span data-start="1234.18" data-end="1239.82">to update it to take some time and build a side project or something with a framework</span> <span data-start="1239.82" data-end="1242.2">or a tool that you're not familiar with.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1242.2" data-end="1246.93">And approach it with an open mind so that you can use the tools and the frameworks that</span> <span data-start="1246.93" data-end="1253.35">they build around it, the philosophies of how they structure that you are applications,</span> <span data-start="1253.35" data-end="1254.67">and learn from that.</span> <span data-start="1254.67" data-end="1259.75">And then don't look down on others and try to convince them to change to your favorite</span> <span data-start="1259.75" data-end="1260.75">tools.</span> <span data-start="1260.75" data-end="1265.95">Instead, talk to each other, talk about why they chose it and why you chose your solution,</span> <span data-start="1265.95" data-end="1271.31">what they like and dislike about it, share your own experiences, and help each other</span> <span data-start="1271.31" data-end="1273.73">and learn from each other.</span> <span data-start="1273.73" data-end="1277.89">Because if frameworks can learn from each other and evolve, then you can, too.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1277.89" data-end="1283.27">All right, if you want to check out the slides, they're on this URL.</span> <span data-start="1283.27" data-end="1287.331">And I'll tweet about them afterwards, as well, and with that, I would like to say thank you</span> <span data-start="1287.331" data-end="1292.32">and if you have any questions, I'll be around, so feel free to talk to me afterwards or hit</span> <span data-start="1292.32" data-end="1294.52">me up on Twitter or via email.</span> <span data-start="1294.52" data-end="1301.83">Thank you so much.</span> </p>
