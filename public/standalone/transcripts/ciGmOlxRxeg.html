really creative so hence papayawhip</span> <span data-start="606.299" data-end="608.949">you may have noticed that a lot of these</span> <span data-start="608.949" data-end="611.47">colors which were using this and Claire</span> <span data-start="611.47" data-end="613.569">paint swatches there are a lot of beiges</span> <span data-start="613.569" data-end="616.689">and off rights so this is one of my</span> <span data-start="616.689" data-end="618.699">favorite sections but it does sort of</span> <span data-start="618.699" data-end="620.589">beg the question like why do we have so</span> <span data-start="620.589" data-end="622.629">many beiges I don't know about you guys</span> <span data-start="622.629" data-end="625.149">but I I maybe use a lot of Gray's a lot</span> <span data-start="625.149" data-end="626.98">of different like light or dark Gray's</span> <span data-start="626.98" data-end="629.379">but I don't really need that many bases</span> <span data-start="629.379" data-end="634.72">well this is because there's so many</span> <span data-start="634.72" data-end="636.85">options for different browser</span> <span data-start="636.85" data-end="638.98">backgrounds when these were standardized</span> <span data-start="638.98" data-end="642.009">in the late 80s and early 90s this was</span> <span data-start="642.009" data-end="643.689">so designers could find like the perfect</span> <span data-start="643.689" data-end="645.669">beige for their desktop browser</span> <span data-start="645.669" data-end="650.47">background so another big chunk of them</span> <span data-start="650.47" data-end="653.47">came from John see Thomas naming a lot</span> <span data-start="653.47" data-end="656.829">of the colors after Crayola 72 crayon</span> <span data-start="656.829" data-end="660.999">box that he had on hand in scrolling</span> <span data-start="660.999" data-end="662.769">through the list of the different names</span> <span data-start="662.769" data-end="664.869">of Crayola crayons you can recognize</span> <span data-start="664.869" data-end="666.779">some that are definitely rolled in I</span> <span data-start="666.779" data-end="670.51">think I counted 39 that are</span> <span data-start="670.51" data-end="672.91">definitely from this list and this also</span> <span data-start="672.91" data-end="674.08">makes sense because when you're looking</span> <span data-start="674.08" data-end="675.97">at naming a lot of colors it makes sense</span> <span data-start="675.97" data-end="678.58">to reference a commonly held standard</span> <span data-start="678.58" data-end="681.82">color nomenclature so these are ones</span> <span data-start="681.82" data-end="683.83">that are definitely from Crayola crayons</span> <span data-start="683.83" data-end="685.6">and then from there there's light and</span> <span data-start="685.6" data-end="691.03">dark variations so adding colors</span> <span data-start="691.03" data-end="692.77">actually seems to be a rare occurrence</span> <span data-start="692.77" data-end="695.62">for web standards considering we're</span> <span data-start="695.62" data-end="697.68">still working off the list released in</span> <span data-start="697.68" data-end="702.31">1989 besides Rebecca purple the names we</span> <span data-start="702.31" data-end="704.56">have today we're gathered from various</span> <span data-start="704.56" data-end="708.12">defaults and more or less are the same</span> <span data-start="708.12" data-end="710.86">even Rebecca purple which seems like an</span> <span data-start="710.86" data-end="712.81">obvious opportunity for doing something</span> <span data-start="712.81" data-end="716.14">nice and beautiful and human why not</span> <span data-start="716.14" data-end="718.12">name this color after the sweet little</span> <span data-start="718.12" data-end="720.25">girl but there was a big debate over</span> <span data-start="720.25" data-end="722.68">this over adding this and it was added</span> <span data-start="722.68" data-end="726.22">unusually quickly I think in less than I</span> <span data-start="726.22" data-end="730.45">think it was like three months but this</span> <span data-start="730.45" data-end="732.85">is because the creators of web standards</span> <span data-start="732.85" data-end="734.38">take their responsibilities very</span> <span data-start="734.38" data-end="736.42">seriously which is really good we want</span> <span data-start="736.42" data-end="738.67">that but it also means that colors never</span> <span data-start="738.67" data-end="741.61">get added to the standard list and I</span> <span data-start="741.61" data-end="743.29">just wonder why should we stop there are</span> <span data-start="743.29" data-end="745.54">we really cool with this or should we</span> <span data-start="745.54" data-end="747.61">question the standard list and make it a</span> <span data-start="747.61" data-end="749.98">part of web culture to expand this list</span> <span data-start="749.98" data-end="754.21">of colors I believe that color is one of</span> <span data-start="754.21" data-end="755.83">the ways that we can make the internet</span> <span data-start="755.83" data-end="759.79">more human and more fun I think that</span> <span data-start="759.79" data-end="761.56">default is boring and I think so many</span> <span data-start="761.56" data-end="763.45">websites seem to be generated from</span> <span data-start="763.45" data-end="766.51">defaults they have the same navies and</span> <span data-start="766.51" data-end="769.63">grays and black and default bootstrap</span> <span data-start="769.63" data-end="772.39">templates so I invite all color lovers</span> <span data-start="772.39" data-end="774.58">to think beyond the default but I also</span> <span data-start="774.58" data-end="776.2">challenge you to think about the color</span> <span data-start="776.2" data-end="779.11">of the web we have so many colors at our</span> <span data-start="779.11" data-end="783.22">disposal why aren't we using them we</span> <span data-start="783.22" data-end="785.11">have this great resource for trying</span> <span data-start="785.11" data-end="787.78">tested colors so there's kind of no</span> <span data-start="787.78" data-end="790.06">excuse to just pick some of these and</span> <span data-start="790.06" data-end="791.89">start experimenting I think that's a</span> <span data-start="791.89" data-end="793.84">theme of today is experiment and be</span> <span data-start="793.84" data-end="797.8">adventurous of course we have to keep in</span> <span data-start="797.8" data-end="799.72">mind accessibility especially when it</span> <span data-start="799.72" data-end="803.26">comes to rendering text the w3c states</span> <span data-start="803.26" data-end="804.1">that call</span> <span data-start="804.1" data-end="806.199">or should not be the only means for</span> <span data-start="806.199" data-end="808.12">conveying information or prompting in</span> <span data-start="808.12" data-end="810.16">action but still we should use more</span> <span data-start="810.16" data-end="812.949">color so I want to show you guys some</span> <span data-start="812.949" data-end="815.199">examples of sites that are using color</span> <span data-start="815.199" data-end="819.31">boldly and using it really well this is</span> <span data-start="819.31" data-end="823.36">a site for pollen Midwest and I think</span> <span data-start="823.36" data-end="825.19">that this website really struck me</span> <span data-start="825.19" data-end="827.68">because they use colors that I sort of</span> <span data-start="827.68" data-end="829.06">thought were off limits like this</span> <span data-start="829.06" data-end="831.55">magenta and bright yellow and they also</span> <span data-start="831.55" data-end="834.009">use a wider color palette than I</span> <span data-start="834.009" data-end="835.93">normally do I think typically as a</span> <span data-start="835.93" data-end="838.389">visual designer I pick one or two accent</span> <span data-start="838.389" data-end="840.519">colors and feel like I'm even pushing it</span> <span data-start="840.519" data-end="842.29">at that and then everything else I just</span> <span data-start="842.29" data-end="844">let be neutral and come stay in the</span> <span data-start="844" data-end="846.819">background but they've used all of these</span> <span data-start="846.819" data-end="850.36">really bright accent colors and because</span> <span data-start="850.36" data-end="854.529">of the mastering of design they pulled</span> <span data-start="854.529" data-end="855.79">it off and still made it look really</span> <span data-start="855.79" data-end="858.67">slick and professional but to me the</span> <span data-start="858.67" data-end="860.529">site is really memorable because of its</span> <span data-start="860.529" data-end="861.94">use of color and because of its color</span> <span data-start="861.94" data-end="865.209">palette so this is a portfolio for an</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="865.209" data-end="867.579">Australian designer and also a really</span> <span data-start="867.579" data-end="871.089">bold nice use of primary colors and a</span> <span data-start="871.089" data-end="872.98">bold color palette that I think makes</span> <span data-start="872.98" data-end="875.35">this portfolio website which we've all</span> <span data-start="875.35" data-end="877.839">seen a million of really stand out and</span> <span data-start="877.839" data-end="880.66">really be nice but you might be thinking</span> <span data-start="880.66" data-end="883.66">I have to work on serious things I have</span> <span data-start="883.66" data-end="886.089">to work on financial site and I have to</span> <span data-start="886.089" data-end="887.529">make websites that make people feel</span> <span data-start="887.529" data-end="890.8">secure about using it and doing business</span> <span data-start="890.8" data-end="895.12">on the Internet I hear you the biggest</span> <span data-start="895.12" data-end="897.279">projects I've done have have been these</span> <span data-start="897.279" data-end="899.92">types of projects for nonprofits dealing</span> <span data-start="899.92" data-end="902.23">with financials and working with</span> <span data-start="902.23" data-end="905.079">government websites too and the default</span> <span data-start="905.079" data-end="907.389">there is again to use like navy blue or</span> <span data-start="907.389" data-end="912.22">blue or blue and grey and black but my</span> <span data-start="912.22" data-end="914.8">trick is to kind of find like the little</span> <span data-start="914.8" data-end="917.079">instances where you can flip that out</span> <span data-start="917.079" data-end="919.81">and what I do a lot is use instead of</span> <span data-start="919.81" data-end="921.61">that navy blue is like a like a green</span> <span data-start="921.61" data-end="924.88">okay like a blue green and then use</span> <span data-start="924.88" data-end="927.61">illustrations as an opportunity to make</span> <span data-start="927.61" data-end="929.139">things really beautiful and you see an</span> <span data-start="929.139" data-end="930.91">even wider color palette because i think</span> <span data-start="930.91" data-end="933.73">if you nine times out of ten if you come</span> <span data-start="933.73" data-end="935.97">back with a beautiful design people are</span> <span data-start="935.97" data-end="937.69">going to be</span> <span data-start="937.69" data-end="941.47">one over by that so I say make it</span> <span data-start="941.47" data-end="943.57">beautiful and don't ask permission to</span> <span data-start="943.57" data-end="947.32">use pastels so there's one thing you</span> <span data-start="947.32" data-end="948.61">take away from this talk I hope it's</span> <span data-start="948.61" data-end="952.27">that but seriously we should have fun</span> <span data-start="952.27" data-end="954.73">with color we should use these CSS</span> <span data-start="954.73" data-end="958.63">namespace values and we should challenge</span> <span data-start="958.63" data-end="960.85">ourselves to think beyond default colors</span> <span data-start="960.85" data-end="962.98">and even push the standard list of</span> <span data-start="962.98" data-end="966.34">colors I want to make a shameless plug</span> <span data-start="966.34" data-end="969.13">for my
