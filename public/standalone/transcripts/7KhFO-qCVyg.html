<p><span data-start="11.219" data-end="13.45">Thanks everybody for being here this morning.</span> <span data-start="13.45" data-end="17.93">I thought I would start by — it's not working any more.</span> <span data-start="17.93" data-end="18.93">That's great.</span> <span data-start="18.93" data-end="19.93">Hello.</span> <span data-start="19.93" data-end="21.08">I will do without.</span> <span data-start="21.08" data-end="22.08">That's fine.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="22.08" data-end="27.07">So, again, I thought I will start, and it's not working, either.</span> <span data-start="27.07" data-end="28.07">Wow.</span> <span data-start="28.07" data-end="31.07">All right, let me my something.</span> <span data-start="31.07" data-end="32.439">And then again.</span> <span data-start="32.439" data-end="34.18">And maybe that then.</span> <span data-start="34.18" data-end="35.46">Cool.</span> <span data-start="35.46" data-end="39.61">I want to share the link to the slides, because, if you want to follow along, if I'm going</span> <span data-start="39.61" data-end="46.12">to fast or too small, I tried to use the biggest font size I could fit and the right colour</span> <span data-start="46.12" data-end="47.879">contrast, so I might have missed something.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="47.879" data-end="51.589">If you want to follow along, this is the short link.</span> <span data-start="51.589" data-end="54.449">I tried to make it pretty simple.</span> <span data-start="54.449" data-end="56.89">But so let's move on to the actual topic.</span> <span data-start="56.89" data-end="59.54">So I want to start with a pretty simple slide.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="59.54" data-end="64.07">I would assume that, if you're here, you know what these represent, but just in case, on</span> <span data-start="64.07" data-end="68.03">the left, you have a laptop, and, on the right, you have a mobile phone.</span> <span data-start="68.03" data-end="72.63">And the reason I started with that is because I want to talk about interaction.</span> <span data-start="72.63" data-end="77.79">I find that very weird that you have the internet which is like this giant network where you</span> <span data-start="77.79" data-end="83.47">can access information anywhere by almost anybody, and we decide to interact with it</span> <span data-start="83.47" data-end="88.95">in a small screen that's like our phone, or our laptop, and the way we interact with it</span> <span data-start="88.95" data-end="95.19">is that we have to learn these new gestures like swiping and tap it up on your keyboard,</span> <span data-start="95.19" data-end="100.08">and it became part of what we do, and we accepted it.</span> <span data-start="100.08" data-end="106.17">Personally, I don't really believe in the keyboard like that being around for that much</span> <span data-start="106.17" data-end="107.17">longer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="107.17" data-end="111.23">I think that there's probably other types of interacts that are a lot more natural that</span> <span data-start="111.23" data-end="112.74">we should focus on.</span> <span data-start="112.74" data-end="118.76">And this is what I like to do on my personal time, so, by day, I'm a software dev, so I</span> <span data-start="118.76" data-end="124.4">probably work on the same type of stuff as you like websites or apps, and, in my personal</span> <span data-start="124.4" data-end="128.64">time, I like to explore alternative interactions.</span> <span data-start="128.64" data-end="133.33">I like to play around with technology and see how I can interact with stuff outside</span> <span data-start="133.33" data-end="135.73">the typical keyboard and phone.</span> <span data-start="135.73" data-end="138.78">Let's talk about these interactive technologies.</span> <span data-start="138.78" data-end="141.94">When you — especially the new stuff, you can start with the wearables.</span> <span data-start="141.94" data-end="145.34">Some of you are probably wearing a FitBit.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="145.34" data-end="151.01">Yes, you have to interact with the dashboard later on on your phone or laptop, but the</span> <span data-start="151.01" data-end="154.34">whole tracking of your steps is done quite freely.</span> <span data-start="154.34" data-end="155.83">You can move around and it will count.</span> <span data-start="155.83" data-end="157.91">You don't have to hold your phone and say one step, two steps, three steps.</span> <span data-start="157.91" data-end="159.57">It is free.</span> <span data-start="159.57" data-end="163.91">It kind of does it, and you don't have to think about it.</span> <span data-start="163.91" data-end="165.7">Then you have also voice UI.</span> <span data-start="165.7" data-end="171.09">Some of you probably have an Amazon Echo, or Google Home, or other device that I don't</span> <span data-start="171.09" data-end="172.09">know about.</span> <span data-start="172.09" data-end="174.39">The same thing: it is a lot more free.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="174.39" data-end="179.12">You can move around your house, and you have to say a certain comment and access information</span> <span data-start="179.12" data-end="185.64">without being in front of a laptop or having to take your phone out of your pocket.</span> <span data-start="185.64" data-end="186.88">I think that's quite powerful.</span> <span data-start="186.88" data-end="190.83">Maybe it doesn't work as well right now, but I think it is really important to be working</span> <span data-start="190.83" data-end="193.24">on that kind of interaction.</span> <span data-start="193.24" data-end="197.69">Motion: some of you might be working in offices where you walk around and the lights turn</span> <span data-start="197.69" data-end="198.69">on.</span> <span data-start="198.69" data-end="202.71">The same thing, if nobody is in the office after a certain time, the lights turn off,</span> <span data-start="202.71" data-end="203.989">and you do vent to think about it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="203.989" data-end="208.02">It's all around us but it's disappearing.</span> <span data-start="208.02" data-end="213.07">This one is quite funny, like facial recognition.</span> <span data-start="213.07" data-end="217.42">In China, you can pay at KFC with your face.</span> <span data-start="217.42" data-end="221.29">I find that quite interesting, because I can't even imagine the interaction you go to the</span> <span data-start="221.29" data-end="228.74">shop, and, "Would you like to play by card, cash or face today?"</span> <span data-start="228.74" data-end="233.22">I don't really want to pay with my face, but they're already doing it, so, maybe in a few</span> <span data-start="233.22" data-end="235.8">years, we will all have to do it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="235.8" data-end="238.97">I want to focus on biofeedback today.</span> <span data-start="238.97" data-end="245.989">So, biofeedback is just having the data coming like getting data of physiological functions</span> <span data-start="245.989" data-end="250.4">using devices that track the activity of different systems in the body.</span> <span data-start="250.4" data-end="256.159">And especially, I'm working with the Epoch which is a brain sensor.</span> <span data-start="256.159" data-end="261.06">Before talking about how the device works, I thought we should go back to how the brain</span> <span data-start="261.06" data-end="262.06">actually works.</span> <span data-start="262.06" data-end="267.33">I'm not a neuroscientist, so I can't explain in depth how the brain actually works, and</span> <span data-start="267.33" data-end="272.65">I don't think we really know, but I'm going to do a high-level and brief intro so we can</span> <span data-start="272.65" data-end="274.35">understand what is going afterwards.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="274.35" data-end="279.88">You start with a subject, could be anybody, and, with an intent of doing something.</span> <span data-start="279.88" data-end="282.34">It triggers a certain part of the brain.</span> <span data-start="282.34" data-end="286.53">Different parts of the brain are in control of different activities.</span> <span data-start="286.53" data-end="289.389">And then the — let's say you want to talk.</span> <span data-start="289.389" data-end="291.77">You don't think about walking, you just kind of do.</span> <span data-start="291.77" data-end="298.61">You have a trigger in a think actions are in the prefrontal cortex but I don't remember</span> <span data-start="298.61" data-end="299.93">exactly.</span> <span data-start="299.93" data-end="304.26">But then, this part of the brain is going to send a signal to a body part.</span> <span data-start="304.26" data-end="309.99">So that is a hand, because I was looking for an icon of legs, and it's either strong men</span> <span data-start="309.99" data-end="314.65">legs for a sexy woman legs, and I was fuck this, I will get a hand, it's the same thing,</span> <span data-start="314.65" data-end="315.65">and it's gender-neutral.</span> <span data-start="315.65" data-end="316.65">[Applause].</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="316.65" data-end="324.47">And, yes, so, and then, so the part of the brain that is responsible for actions of walking</span> <span data-start="324.47" data-end="329.78">send a signal to your little hands, and you end up walking like that, that ends up being</span> <span data-start="329.78" data-end="331.24">an action.</span> <span data-start="331.24" data-end="335.03">All it does is basically just signals from the brain to the rest of the body.</span> <span data-start="335.03" data-end="337.97">And now, how does the emotive work?</span> <span data-start="337.97" data-end="339.759">It has 14 different sensors.</span> <span data-start="339.759" data-end="345.36">On the left, you have where these channels are placed around the head.</span> <span data-start="345.36" data-end="354.53">And, in the middle, you have how more high-level, high-definition brain sensor works, and in</span> <span data-start="354.53" data-end="359.15">green and orange, you have where the emotive is placed around is to that so trying to cover</span> <span data-start="359.15" data-end="364.66">a broad rake of the face and head without having to have too many sensors.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="364.66" data-end="369.04">When I got this brain sensor, of course I wanted to play with it, but the only thing</span> <span data-start="369.04" data-end="375.15">available was an SDK in C++ and Java.</span> <span data-start="375.15" data-end="380.53">I learned Ruby and JavaScript and I thought that was not going to work for me.</span> <span data-start="380.53" data-end="381.82">I didn't want to give up.</span> <span data-start="381.82" data-end="385.68">That's a piece of device that's quite, you know, it can be a bit expensive — it's a lot</span> <span data-start="385.68" data-end="390.199">cheaper than something you find in hospitals — but it's like a bit money.</span> <span data-start="390.199" data-end="391.66">I didn't want to give up.</span> <span data-start="391.66" data-end="397.44">So I decided to try and build something in JavaScript to allow other JavaScript devs</span> <span data-start="397.44" data-end="401.67">not to go through the struggle I went through but use the device and use JavaScript with</span> <span data-start="401.67" data-end="402.67">it.</span> <span data-start="402.67" data-end="412.72">So I built epoch.js that allows you to interact with the brain sensor in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="412.72" data-end="418.78">And so the features, when you get this sensor, you can download what is called the composer</span> <span data-start="418.78" data-end="423.139">which is an emulator, so you don't have to actually set up the sensor all the tile, you</span> <span data-start="423.139" data-end="426.19">don't have to carry it around, it can be fragile.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="426.19" data-end="429.58">You can actually open the — write your programme.</span> <span data-start="429.58" data-end="433.11">If you can send programmes from the emulator to your programme, you can do what you want.</span> <span data-start="433.11" data-end="436.21">It's sweet and working.</span> <span data-start="436.21" data-end="438.37">You can have access to the live data.</span> <span data-start="438.37" data-end="444.289">The device has a gyro scope to you can get the head movements.</span> <span data-start="444.289" data-end="450.77">You can get the performance metrics, get your level of performance, focus, excitement, stress.</span> <span data-start="450.77" data-end="455.699">You can also get facial expressions with the sensors around the front of the face, so,</span> <span data-start="455.699" data-end="461.52">for example, smiling, or looking right, looking left, up, down, and, a few others.</span> <span data-start="461.52" data-end="465.18">But the most exciting part is that you can get some mental comments.</span> <span data-start="465.18" data-end="470.11">So they have to be related to a thought of action, and I would assume — but I'm not</span> <span data-start="470.11" data-end="475.289">sure — because it is easier to recognise as a pattern than thinking about a chair or</span> <span data-start="475.289" data-end="476.289">something like that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="476.289" data-end="480.49">When you think about an action, the signals that come from the brain are easier to recognise</span> <span data-start="480.49" data-end="483.4">in different people than thinking about the beach.</span> <span data-start="483.4" data-end="490.38">In terms of technical Stack, I had to use the C++ SDK in the background — probably</span> <span data-start="490.38" data-end="498.639">badly written but it works — and then created a Node.js add-on and I used these three modules</span> <span data-start="498.639" data-end="499.639">there.</span> <span data-start="499.639" data-end="506.02">Now, I know there's a new way to create — I think it is called NAPI, but at the time,</span> <span data-start="506.02" data-end="510.491">when I started, it wasn't there, so I haven't updated it, but for now, it works, so, when</span> <span data-start="510.491" data-end="513.12">I get time, I will probably try to, like, move over.</span> <span data-start="513.12" data-end="514.19">Okay.</span> <span data-start="514.19" data-end="520.61">All right, so, with , demo time.</span> <span data-start="520.61" data-end="527.24">I always like to start my demo with a little reminder that it might not work.</span> <span data-start="527.24" data-end="528.55">It's supposed to work.</span> <span data-start="528.55" data-end="530.959">It was working a few days ago.</span> <span data-start="530.959" data-end="532.119">[Applause].</span> <span data-start="532.119" data-end="534.449">But .. yeah.</span> <span data-start="534.449" data-end="536.779">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="536.779" data-end="539.839">So, I was already nervous.</span> <span data-start="539.839" data-end="544.399">So the first thing that I build is a brain keyboard.</span> <span data-start="544.399" data-end="548.11">So it's just an interface of, well, a keyboard.</span> <span data-start="548.11" data-end="553.739">I wanted to be able to interact with it just by moving my eyes.</span> <span data-start="553.739" data-end="561.1">This demo is not not limited to thought but to actions and stuff.</span> <span data-start="561.1" data-end="567.989">The little bit annoying thing with the sensor is that you have to put some kind of gel on</span> <span data-start="567.989" data-end="572.982">all of them to conduct properly, so I did it before the talk to make sure that I will</span> <span data-start="572.982" data-end="576.279">be fine but I will just redo it quickly.</span> <span data-start="576.279" data-end="582.66">It's not that much of a pain but just a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="582.66" data-end="591.319">All right, I should be all right.</span> <span data-start="591.319" data-end="595.42">The thing is, you do look stupid when you're wearing it, so just get used to it.</span> <span data-start="595.42" data-end="603.37">As it is a demo, you might want to take a picture, which is fine.</span> <span data-start="603.37" data-end="606.1">I don't know if I turn it on and off?</span> <span data-start="606.1" data-end="608.819">So, you might want to take a picture, which is fine.</span> <span data-start="608.819" data-end="611.129">Just make sure shy eyes are open because I really look stupid.</span> <span data-start="611.129" data-end="615.749">If my eyes are closed on top of that, don't take a picture.</span> <span data-start="615.749" data-end="618.759">Don't take a picture when my owes are closed, please!</span> <span data-start="618.759" data-end="621.899">That's already quite hard.</span> <span data-start="621.899" data-end="628.259">So I'm here, and then — let me check something first.</span> <span data-start="628.259" data-end="631.399">I want to check if it's green everywhere.</span> <span data-start="631.399" data-end="634.709">So I have to launch another of the programmes.</span> <span data-start="634.709" data-end="637.339">I'm missing one.</span> <span data-start="637.339" data-end="645.32">So  I did turn it on?</span> <span data-start="645.32" data-end="646.69">That is interesting.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="646.69" data-end="648.38">So that is not great.</span> <span data-start="648.38" data-end="650.829">But it should be all right.</span> <span data-start="650.829" data-end="651.829">Let's try.</span> <span data-start="651.829" data-end="657.42">So, I have my server, and I just have — okay.</span> <span data-start="657.42" data-end="662.29">So if I look right, and I blink, blink.</span> <span data-start="662.29" data-end="663.29">It doesn't get the blink.</span> <span data-start="663.29" data-end="665.339">So I look right.</span> <span data-start="665.339" data-end="668.769">And oh, I did look left.</span> <span data-start="668.769" data-end="669.769">Okay.</span> <span data-start="669.769" data-end="670.769">Right.</span> <span data-start="670.769" data-end="671.769">Blink.</span> <span data-start="671.769" data-end="672.769">Left.</span> <span data-start="672.769" data-end="675.519">Oh, damn .. .
