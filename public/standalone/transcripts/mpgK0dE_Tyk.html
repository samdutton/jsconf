data-end="230.299">spritz water on you to make it feel as</span> <span data-start="230.299" data-end="232.79">if it's attacking so stuff like that the</span> <span data-start="232.79" data-end="234.709">idea of virtual reality and augmented</span> <span data-start="234.709" data-end="236.93">reality is that it augments all the</span> <span data-start="236.93" data-end="239.59">first senses not just vision or sound</span> <span data-start="239.59" data-end="241.729">okay what about this device it's</span> <span data-start="241.729" data-end="243.169">starting to look a little bit more like</span> <span data-start="243.169" data-end="245.449">a cardboard is it the vision box</span> <span data-start="245.449"

data-end="254.769">reality glasses listens telesphere masks</span> <span data-start="254.769" data-end="258.109">so as the years progressed these devices</span> <span data-start="258.109" data-end="259.849">became smaller and smaller and we</span> <span data-start="259.849" data-end="261.709">started attaching it to our periphery</span> <span data-start="261.709" data-end="265.43">but to our vision okay one more this is</span> <span data-start="265.43" data-end="267.5">called the VPL data suit can you guys</span> <span data-start="267.5" data-end="271.699">guess when I was invented 1980 1990 or</span> <span data-start="271.699" data-end="278.84">2000 1980 1990 2000 cool it was 1980</span> <span data-start="278.84" data-end="285.44">in the 1980s so the vpl data suit the</span> <span data-start="285.44" data-end="288.2">whole idea was that this was rigged with</span> <span data-start="288.2" data-end="290.93">motors and vibrators so that as you</span> <span data-start="290.93" data-end="292.669">walked around in this virtual world you</span> <span data-start="292.669" data-end="294.68">could feel different objects there now</span> <span data-start="294.68" data-end="296.48">it looks really doofy and it feels kind</span> <span data-start="296.48" data-end="298.669">of silly to do something like that but</span> <span data-start="298.669" data-end="300.47">the thing is stuff like this exists</span> <span data-start="300.47" data-end="304.13">today in fact one of my teammates from</span> <span data-start="304.13" data-end="306.02">one of my colleagues from university</span> <span data-start="306.02" data-end="309.08">started a company recently called hard</span> <span data-start="309.08" data-end="311.12">light VR and they do this full-on</span> <span data-start="311.12" data-end="313.28">bodysuit that you put on and as you walk</span> <span data-start="313.28" data-end="314.75">around in the virtual world it'll</span> <span data-start="314.75" data-end="316.97">vibrate across your back so that you can</span> <span data-start="316.97" data-end="319.19">feel as if you're hitting against a wall</span> <span data-start="319.19" data-end="322.22">and stuff like that so these dreams are</span> <span data-start="322.22" data-end="324.32">really becoming realities and if you</span> <span data-start="324.32" data-end="326.72">think about it there's so many different</span> <span data-start="326.72" data-end="328.7">devices on the market today this is the</span> <span data-start="328.7" data-end="330.44">vibe has anyone here tried the vibe</span> <span data-start="330.44" data-end="333.29">before okay a bunch of you guys the vibe</span> <span data-start="333.29" data-end="335.96">is a virtual reality device but it also</span> <span data-start="335.96" data-end="338.15">has a camera on the front so you can do</span> <span
