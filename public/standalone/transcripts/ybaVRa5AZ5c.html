<p><span data-start="235.51" data-end="241.28">And you know, when it is a manual process and you try to name things.</span> <span data-start="241.28" data-end="247.879">I'd be better off to explain cache and validation than anchor tags.</span> <span data-start="247.879" data-end="250.85">There are a few things you can do.</span> <span data-start="250.85" data-end="255.39">Sequential numbering pattern.</span> <span data-start="255.39" data-end="258.81">People don't do it.</span> <span data-start="258.81" data-end="263.92">People are abstracted on a Cms level.</span> <span data-start="263.92" data-end="268.55">They are not typically the used case.</span> <span data-start="268.55" data-end="273.1">In the Cms, you do have the ability to generate these.</span> <span data-start="273.1" data-end="274.1">What you can do.</span> <span data-start="274.1" data-end="278.58">Generate them in a structured manner.</span> <span data-start="278.58" data-end="285.26">But then the problem we are trying to solve is that many writers, their work will change.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="285.26" data-end="287.86">If you have an article.</span> <span data-start="287.86" data-end="290.72">We didn't change the articles very much.</span> <span data-start="290.72" data-end="294.69">Only if there was a known error or correction.</span> <span data-start="294.69" data-end="299.75">Every now and then, between the time published to 10 minutes.</span> <span data-start="299.75" data-end="306.25">There was a window that changed dramatically.</span> <span data-start="306.25" data-end="307.42">Something would be rephrased.</span> <span data-start="307.42" data-end="309.39">It didn't happen often.</span> <span data-start="309.39" data-end="310.9">They don't like to do it.</span> <span data-start="310.9" data-end="315.53">It did happen from time to time.</span> <span data-start="315.53" data-end="319.17">The worst thing you can do is have a deeplink to a paragraph.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="319.17" data-end="324.37">You are doing that with a purpose.</span> <span data-start="324.37" data-end="325.68">Something here important.</span> <span data-start="325.68" data-end="328.81">If you are landing somewhere else, that's a problem.</span> <span data-start="328.81" data-end="332">How do you do that without digging into Cms.</span> <span data-start="332" data-end="335.87">Track these keys.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="335.87" data-end="339.68">That map upto content that is changing.</span> <span data-start="339.68" data-end="341.68">It is a very hard thing to describe.</span> <span data-start="341.68" data-end="342.74">It leads to crazy situations.</span> <span data-start="342.74" data-end="343.74">You are trying to match them up.</span> <span data-start="343.74" data-end="344.74">Within Drupal or WordPress.</span> <span data-start="344.74" data-end="345.74">It is not something we would like to do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="345.74" data-end="346.74">So, you take JavaScript and reinvent what is solving the problem.</span> <span data-start="346.74" data-end="347.74">There are a few approaches.</span> <span data-start="347.74" data-end="350.04">The steps is, you need to be able to generate key off content.</span> <span data-start="350.04" data-end="351.04">To be tolerant.</span> <span data-start="351.04" data-end="354.72">If the context of the paragraph, I'm using it as example.</span> <span data-start="354.72" data-end="357.06">If that changes and the key changes.</span> <span data-start="357.06" data-end="359.01">Do you use that pairing.</span> <span data-start="359.01" data-end="360.01">In tollerance again.</span> <span data-start="360.01" data-end="361.01">It can be updated, corrected.</span> <span data-start="361.01" data-end="362.01">Sentences are rearranged.</span> <span data-start="362.01" data-end="365.22">You don't want a system, when it goes out of sync you have to giggle around to match</span> <span data-start="365.22" data-end="366.22">up again.</span> <span data-start="366.22" data-end="369.347">The other thing you have to accept, in the web.You need something that will cover 90%</span> <span data-start="369.347" data-end="370.347">of the cases.</span> <span data-start="370.347" data-end="371.347">There is an acceptable margin of error.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="371.347" data-end="372.347">When you fail, you fail back to the original Url.</span> <span data-start="372.347" data-end="373.99">You need to deliver the person at the correct location.</span> <span data-start="373.99" data-end="374.99">There are a couple of methods.</span> <span data-start="374.99" data-end="375.99">5-6 different pretty detailed methods that I'm going to dig into 2 of them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="375.99" data-end="376.99">The first one I recommend.</span> <span data-start="376.99" data-end="377.99">It is dynamic unique keys.</span> <span data-start="377.99" data-end="379.8">You take a piece of text, generate keys from it by the first 3 words, of the first and</span> <span data-start="379.8" data-end="380.8">last sentence.</span> <span data-start="380.8" data-end="383.02">Sometimes the same sentence, if the paragraph is 1.</span> <span data-start="383.02" data-end="385.04">You use that to identify the paragraph.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="385.04" data-end="386.04">It works very well.</span> <span data-start="386.04" data-end="394.38">If you are using that as identifier and you build in something like, you measure the distance</span> <span data-start="394.38" data-end="398.67">between keys, you can end up with something robust.</span> <span data-start="398.67" data-end="400.65">With that Url, you can throw in multiple different keys with different variations.</span> <span data-start="400.65" data-end="401.65">I cannot pronounce this word.</span> <span data-start="401.65" data-end="407.64">Do you have it where you read a book with a character that has a name, you say it inside</span> <span data-start="407.64" data-end="408.64">your head.</span> <span data-start="408.64" data-end="409.96">I have that going on here.</span> <span data-start="409.96" data-end="413.51">We use this function in Javascript to pretty much match keys.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="413.51" data-end="419.09">If you have a key off a paragraph and cut off one of the sentences.</span> <span data-start="419.09" data-end="422.83">If you change anything in the middle.</span> <span data-start="422.83" data-end="425.06">It will still pair against the correct key.</span> <span data-start="425.06" data-end="428.12">You don't have to do anything on the backend.</span> <span data-start="428.12" data-end="429.24">You don't add overhead to the page.</span> <span data-start="429.24" data-end="430.24">Unless it found something in the Url.</span> <span data-start="430.24" data-end="431.24">That's a recap.</span> <span data-start="431.24" data-end="435.79">The flow would be, if you hit the page you provide a link with this key in it.</span> <span data-start="435.79" data-end="439.27">At that point, it inspects the page, generates keys.</span> <span data-start="439.27" data-end="440.94">Looks for the match.</span> <span data-start="440.94" data-end="445.82">And do I match this or this and what is the level of difference.</span> <span data-start="445.82" data-end="448.13">We can this for several hundred articles.</span> <span data-start="448.13" data-end="449.14">With 10-20 paragraphs.</span> <span data-start="449.14" data-end="452.05">We found 2 cases where there was a false positive.</span> <span data-start="452.05" data-end="455.1">An all the cases the first key was the correct one.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="455.1" data-end="459.06">You could extend this to images for example, you want to restrict it to something.</span> <span data-start="459.06" data-end="460.48">This is the fun part.</span> <span data-start="460.48" data-end="463.21">I'm going to attempt a live demo.</span> <span data-start="463.21" data-end="464.21">And fall back to screenshots.</span> <span data-start="464.21" data-end="465.21">What we did to this.</span> <span data-start="465.21" data-end="466.4">There is a great article here.</span> <span data-start="466.4" data-end="468.1">The NY times did a wonderful redesign.</span> <span data-start="468.1" data-end="470.27">They cleared away everything and started from scratch.</span> <span data-start="470.27" data-end="471.78">This is functionality that did not make it back.</span> <span data-start="471.78" data-end="472.86">It was an oversight.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="472.86" data-end="476.19">Someone is going to do it.</span> <span data-start="476.19" data-end="477.67">Until something gets done.</span> <span data-start="477.67" data-end="479.84">They have published the pages through the redesign.</span> <span data-start="479.84" data-end="480.88">Technically it exists.</span> <span data-start="480.88" data-end="482.26">Let's see what happens.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="482.26" data-end="484.65">This is an old article from 2012.</span> <span data-start="484.65" data-end="487.79">The idea was that one of the things, a quick backstory.</span> <span data-start="487.79" data-end="490.56">My first job, I was doing customer service for email.</span> <span data-start="490.56" data-end="493.06">One day we got 200-300 emails about an article.</span> <span data-start="493.06" data-end="494.44">You are so pro Palestine.</span> <span data-start="494.44" data-end="497.21">The other half was saying, you are so pro Israel.</span> <span data-start="497.21" data-end="499.06">It was about the same article.</span> <span data-start="499.06" data-end="500.11">Context can matter.</span> <span data-start="500.11" data-end="504.24">If someone wants to tweet something, lies, lies, lies, and provide a Url.</span> <span data-start="504.24" data-end="505.77">You are not going to read it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="505.77" data-end="509.62">If the person says, actually, on this paragraph, this line, and here, these are the things</span> <span data-start="509.62" data-end="510.62">I'm disputing.</span> <span data-start="510.62" data-end="511.62">That are interesting.</span> <span data-start="511.62" data-end="512.62">That are interesting facts.</span> <span data-start="512.62" data-end="514.099">Whether it is a business based article.</span> <span data-start="514.099" data-end="521.3">You would share the link now and you wouldn't have to give this long copy and paste.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="521.3" data-end="522.81">You can use a keylike structure.</span> <span data-start="522.81" data-end="524.46">Not just for deep linking.</span> <span data-start="524.46" data-end="527.43">But in terms of highlighting or sharing or annotation.</span> <span data-start="527.43" data-end="529.13">We did it at the time.</span> <span data-start="529.13" data-end="530.13">It was successful.</span> <span data-start="530.13" data-end="531.31">A power user feature not many people knew about.</span> <span data-start="531.31" data-end="533.58">You have to double tap the shift key.</span> <span data-start="533.58" data-end="536.81">And even then, it was when it was used, used for something interesting.</span> <span data-start="536.81" data-end="538.56">We would track how this was shared.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="538.56" data-end="539.67">You can see people coming in.</span> <span data-start="539.67" data-end="540.67">We didn't set it up.</span> <span data-start="540.67" data-end="543.28">It is sad that it was gone.</span> <span data-start="543.28" data-end="544.28">Anyhow, back to.</span> <span data-start="544.28" data-end="545.301">The ability that you can link to a paragraph.</span> <span data-start="545.301" data-end="549.41">You could also highlight content as well.</span> <span data-start="549.41" data-end="551.64">As you can see, these keys are not necessarily readable.</span> <span data-start="551.64" data-end="552.64">That was one of the downsides.</span> <span data-start="552.64" data-end="553.64">Depending of the level of granularity.</span> <span data-start="553.64" data-end="554.64">You can change the rules.</span> <span data-start="554.64" data-end="555.64">The first word.</span> <span data-start="555.64" data-end="557.6">The first words of each sentence.</span> <span data-start="557.6" data-end="559.44">That would take you on.</span> <span data-start="559.44" data-end="560.88">The screenshot I talked about.</span> <span data-start="560.88" data-end="561.88">More readable urls.</span> </p>
