pressed or not</span> <span data-start="680.57" data-end="682.94">and is to figure out all of these you</span> <span data-start="682.94" data-end="685.16">have to read the midi document for this</span> <span data-start="685.16" data-end="686.69">thing and I was like oh I didn't know</span> <span data-start="686.69" data-end="690.529">that why why did I god well that just</span> <span data-start="690.529" data-end="695.149">takes like two weeks and then what you</span> <span data-start="695.149" data-end="696.769">have like you come up with like an idea</span> <span data-start="696.769" data-end="699.709">okay so for the first row I want to have</span> <span data-start="699.709" data-end="702.44">this video played this and then that</span> <span data-start="702.44" data-end="703.91">video played you come up with like an</span> <span data-start="703.91" data-end="707.6">idea it's kind of happy but the thing is</span> <span data-start="707.6" data-end="709.97">so you have a video and videos usually</span> <span data-start="709.97" data-end="712.16">have like a video feed and an audio feed</span> <span data-start="712.16" data-end="713.93">and you kind of want to have like the</span> <span data-start="713.93" data-end="715.94">audio desync with everything so you have</span> <span data-start="715.94" data-end="718.399">to kind of like split them up again to</span> <span data-start="718.399" data-end="720.019">make put like your text on it and</span> <span data-start="720.019" data-end="720.44">everything</span> <span data-start="720.44" data-end="722.899">and then you have to kind of make like</span> <span data-start="722.899" data-end="727.31">the video still be snappy because how do</span> <span data-start="727.31" data-end="730.37">you play a video without a delay in the</span> <span data-start="730.37" data-end="733.76">browser like using the video tag to you</span> <span data-start="733.76" data-end="737.36">a just to video element dot play do you</span> <span data-start="737.36" data-end="741.35">see preload and then play or do you see</span> <span

data-end="755.51">kind of hacky so you have to load the</span> <span data-start="755.51" data-end="758.959">video in an era buffer make a blog out</span> <span data-start="758.959" data-end="760.579">of it with the correct mind type</span> <span data-start="760.579" data-end="762.11">otherwise it doesn't know it's a video</span> <span data-start="762.11" data-end="765.56">and

<span data-start="950.589" data-end="954.85">but we felt we had to do that and this</span> <span data-start="954.85" data-end="956.62">time I really wanted to build a real</span> <span data-start="956.62" data-end="959.95">piece of software not this like six</span> <span data-start="959.95" data-end="962.44">weeks heck that lived on this obscure</span> <span data-start="962.44" data-end="964.42">video hack that is still in the</span> <span data-start="964.42" data-end="967.87">production software now so this time we</span> <span data-start="967.87" data-end="970.36">actually started a six months ago</span> <span data-start="970.36" data-end="972.55">already like as you can see in October</span> <span data-start="972.55" data-end="975.16">the first two commits and then we worked</span> <span data-start="975.16" data-end="978.64">along the way on that and so 2015 what</span> <span data-start="978.64" data-end="980.709">the thing did was push a button it it</span> <span data-start="980.709" data-end="984.61">did a thing and in 2017 you push a</span> <span data-start="984.61" data-end="989.589">button and it does 10x things so we kind</span> <span data-start="989.589" data-end="992.47">of thought who who does know like which</span> <span data-start="992.47" data-end="994.72">one is which there by the way this is</span> <span data-start="994.72" data-end="997.36">this is our Tech's take an order to</span> <span data-start="997.36" data-end="999.81">guess which one is redox react and</span> <span data-start="999.81" data-end="1003.6">electron so we thought like the one and</span> <span data-start="1003.6" data-end="1006.93">a half year that has like everybody was</span> <span data-start="1006.93" data-end="1009.779">talking about react Redux an extra ones</span> <span data-start="1009.779" data-end="1012.54">we don't we have to make a software to</span> <span data-start="1012.54" data-end="1014.43">make music with all of these tools so</span> <span data-start="1014.43" data-end="1016.589">that we can dog feed or industry</span> <span data-start="1016.589" data-end="1019.769">gullible so the app actually looks</span> <span data-start="1019.769" data-end="1021.89">amazing</span> <span data-start="1021.89" data-end="1023.66">you will see later on so you have like</span> <span data-start="1023.66" data-end="1026.06">this is like a representation of the</span> <span data-start="1026.06" data-end="1028.52">physical pad and then on the side you</span> <span data-start="1028.52" data-end="1030.89">can see like what kind of clip you want</span> <span data-start="1030.89" data-end="1032.78">to play and all these things whatever</span> <span data-start="1032.78" data-end="1036.65">you want to attach to it and so what was</span> <span data-start="1036.65" data-end="1038.69">really cool about this is you can import</span> <span data-start="1038.69" data-end="1040.91">export project set up so the thing</span> <span data-start="1040.91" data-end="1043.01">before was whenever Boris wanted to have</span> <span data-start="1043.01" data-end="1044.54">like a button on a different thing there</span> <span data-start="1044.54" data-end="1047.12">he is he was calling me and I was like</span> <span data-start="1047.12" data-end="1048.44">okay I'm going to do this</span> <span data-start="1048.44" data-end="1050.54">push that to github so that he can work</span> <span data-start="1050.54" data-end="1053.35">on it an hour later this was horrible so</span> <span data-start="1053.35" data-end="1056.51">now we can like exported zip and import</span> <span data-start="1056.51" data-end="1059.27">and all these things it has perfect</span> <span data-start="1059.27" data-end="1062.36">timing in there before that we had like</span> <span data-start="1062.36" data-end="1065.92">a lot of human errors mainly mine and</span> <span data-start="1065.92" data-end="1068.78">now there's a computer taking care of</span> <span data-start="1068.78" data-end="1071.66">the timing as in if you push the button</span> <span data-start="1071.66" data-end="1075.8">too early before the beat it can make</span> <span data-start="1075.8" data-end="1077.6">this wait a bit and I click like it will</span> <span data-start="1077.6" data-end="1080.66">be perfect to the beat so the problem is</span> <span data-start="1080.66" data-end="1082.73">if you're too late we cannot take that</span> <span data-start="1082.73" data-end="1084.2">because JavaScript doesn't have time</span> <span data-start="1084.2" data-end="1089.48">travel yet let's see see see 39 was</span> <span data-start="1089.48" data-end="1093.53">what's up this time we actually do have</span> <span data-start="1093.53" data-end="1096.44">live music I mean you didn't notice</span> <span data-start="1096.44" data-end="1098.81">before there was no like music but and</span> <span data-start="1098.81" data-end="1101.24">also the we had a life video shoulders</span> <span data-start="1101.24" data-end="1105.53">as you saw this morning but yeah this is</span> <span data-start="1105.53" data-end="1107.54">like technical stuff let's let's hear</span> <span data-start="1107.54" data-end="1115.19">how like a beat it's made so high so we</span> <span data-start="1115.19" data-end="1117.02">this time we wanted to make an original</span> <span data-start="1117.02" data-end="1121.43">beat or I want to do that and first up</span> <span data-start="1121.43" data-end="1124.31">the guys listen to all the talks and</span> <span data-start="1124.31" data-end="1127.79">they gathered snippets for me and then</span> </p>
