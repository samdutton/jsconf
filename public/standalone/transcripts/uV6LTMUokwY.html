<p><span data-start="192.9" data-end="196.4">API abstraction and I caught in a set of</span> <span data-start="196.4" data-end="199.38">built-in best practices say here here's</span> <span data-start="199.38" data-end="202.35">how you you you build a application with</span> <span data-start="202.35" data-end="205.92">our framework so so like if anybody uses</span> <span data-start="205.92" data-end="209.4">dojo dojos a great example of a</span> <span data-start="209.4" data-end="212.31">framework or Yui yeah where you they</span> <span data-start="212.31" data-end="213.78">have you know most everything you would</span> <span data-start="213.78" data-end="218.82">need built-in right so yep one of the</span> <span data-start="218.82" data-end="221.04">biggest peeves with it is though is</span> <span data-start="221.04" data-end="222.6">everything's Global's with frameworks</span> <span data-start="222.6" data-end="226.92">today so so this is wed libraries jquery</span> <span data-start="226.92" data-end="228.66">is an example what is what is the web</span> <span data-start="228.66" data-end="230.55">library it's kind of a you know small</span> <span data-start="230.55" data-end="232.5">and a framework still it's it's as</span> <span data-start="232.5" data-end="234.93">globally available set of tools for you</span> <span data-start="234.93" data-end="238.14">to use helps you get done you know</span> <span data-start="238.14" data-end="240.209">it's bigger than a module but not quite</span> <span data-start="240.209" data-end="242.67">as big as a framework then we have these</span> <span data-start="242.67" data-end="244.83">micro libraries these micro frameworks</span> <span data-start="244.83" data-end="246.81">and and you know it all gets kind of</span> <span data-start="246.81" data-end="248.58">kind of confusing you know when do I</span> <span data-start="248.58" data-end="251.76">pick one one do i pick another and it</span> <span data-start="251.76" data-end="253.14">all comes down to the same thing to me</span> <span data-start="253.14" data-end="257.76">is just how much of you know how much</span> <span data-start="257.76" data-end="259.769">functionality do you get and how much</span> <span data-start="259.769" data-end="263.76">are you you know you know kind of forced</span> <span data-start="263.76" data-end="267.54">into this this framework so which which</span> <span data-start="267.54" data-end="269.61">which is my biggest pet peeve here is</span> <span data-start="269.61" data-end="272.91">that you know going with a framework or</span> <span data-start="272.91" data-end="274.95">a library kind of locks you in because</span> <span data-start="274.95" data-end="276.51">you're coding to that library or</span> <span data-start="276.51" data-end="279.09">framework now and if you've wanted to</span> <span data-start="279.09" data-end="280.12">switch the</span> <span data-start="280.12" data-end="282.1">witching cost is is extremely high</span> <span data-start="282.1" data-end="284.83">because you've coded basically around</span> <span data-start="284.83" data-end="288.91">this framework and the code infiltration</span> <span data-start="288.91" data-end="295">is is extremely high so not just not</span> <span data-start="295" data-end="296.949">just how the modules work but just even</span> <span data-start="296.949" data-end="299.8">the names if you're using something like</span> <span data-start="299.8" data-end="302.65">dojo you do have dojo dot throughout all</span> <span data-start="302.65" data-end="304.479">of your code so if you wanted to change</span> <span data-start="304.479" data-end="308.169">any of that you know you have that name</span> <span data-start="308.169" data-end="309.639">litter through your code so you would</span> <span data-start="309.639" data-end="311.77">have to you have to refactor all of that</span> <span data-start="311.77" data-end="313.69">code to same same with you or any other</span> <span data-start="313.69" data-end="316.3">large framework their name spaces are</span> <span data-start="316.3" data-end="320.86">throughout your code right so to me this</span> <span data-start="320.86" data-end="322.57">is kind of like coding dysentery you</span> <span data-start="322.57" data-end="327.669">know it's just you know I I just want to</span> <span data-start="327.669" data-end="329.169">say get your out of my code you</span> <span data-start="329.169" data-end="331.51">know but but you know I saying that I</span> <span data-start="331.51" data-end="333.88">really do like the frameworks it's just</span> <span data-start="333.88" data-end="336.729">it's just when a client or or my company</span> <span data-start="336.729" data-end="338.83">says okay so why did you pick that</span> <span data-start="338.83" data-end="341.199">framework you know it sucks at this you</span> <span data-start="341.199" data-end="343.93">know and you know I'd like to be able to</span> <span data-start="343.93" data-end="345.13">say oh don't worry we're going to switch</span> <span data-start="345.13" data-end="347.139">that out for you it's harder than it</span> <span data-start="347.139" data-end="352.24">should be so and and then on top of that</span> <span data-start="352.24" data-end="353.71">you know you get the problem with the</span> <span data-start="353.71" data-end="355.84">fact that you know you want a code to</span> <span data-start="355.84" data-end="357.61">standards you know but you can't because</span> <span data-start="357.61" data-end="359.65">you're stuck supporting these sucky old</span> <span data-start="359.65" data-end="367.9">browsers so so here's an example of you</span> <span data-start="367.9" data-end="369.61">know some coding dysentery and i'm going</span> <span data-start="369.61" data-end="372.19">to pick on dojo because dojo is actually</span> <span data-start="372.19" data-end="375.16">my my number one library that I pick so</span> <span data-start="375.16" data-end="379.41">so of examples here you know I got dojo</span> <span data-start="379.41" data-end="382.36">sprinkled all throughout my code all</span> <span data-start="382.36" data-end="384.699">right and then and then to make it worse</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="384.699" data-end="388.33">I've got these non-standard calls to you</span> <span data-start="388.33" data-end="390.46">know basically this is this is a wrapper</span> <span data-start="390.46" data-end="392.32">around prevent default and stop</span> <span data-start="392.32" data-end="395.53">propagation right so if I were to if I</span> <span data-start="395.53" data-end="397.72">were to do some awesome new event based</span> <span data-start="397.72" data-end="400.9">library out there that that does event</span> <span data-start="400.9" data-end="403.66">handling way better than though Joe then</span> <span data-start="403.66" data-end="407.08">I know what you thinking so but if they</span> <span data-start="407.08" data-end="411.34">way maybe there is but I can't just swap</span> <span data-start="411.34" data-end="413.5">it in for dojo and expect</span> <span data-start="413.5" data-end="415.42">to work because my code is infiltrated</span> <span data-start="415.42" data-end="418.08">with all these calls to proprietary</span> <span data-start="418.08" data-end="420.13">differently on proprietary frameworks</span> <span data-start="420.13" data-end="422.05">and again I'm not picking on dojo here</span> <span data-start="422.05" data-end="425.2">because this is the same with every</span> <span data-start="425.2" data-end="426.58">library or framework that I've worked</span> <span data-start="426.58" data-end="431.38">with so far um and if anybody has any</span> <span data-start="431.38" data-end="433.09">questions or I've been going too fast I</span> <span data-start="433.09" data-end="434.98">like to be interrupted actually because</span> <span data-start="434.98" data-end="436.3">sometimes you remind me of something</span> <span data-start="436.3" data-end="438.31">that I'm forgetting about so if you have</span> <span data-start="438.31" data-end="440.38">an intelligent question to ask please</span> <span data-start="440.38" data-end="442.93">please ask it at any time all right yes</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="442.93" data-end="449.23">I said intelligent yes so what is what</span> <span data-start="449.23" data-end="451.18">is the Utopia you know what is at least</span> <span data-start="451.18" data-end="453.13">to me what is what is the coding utopia</span> <span data-start="453.13" data-end="458.02">I'll have in my my toolkit of dozens of</span> <span data-start="458.02" data-end="460.12">stand-alone single purpose modules all</span> <span data-start="460.12" data-end="463.06">right something I can take it I can grab</span> <span data-start="463.06" data-end="464.62">this the best of breed here grab this</span> <span data-start="464.62" data-end="466.99">best of breed here and and and and</span> <span data-start="466.99" data-end="470.35">assemble an application together again</span> <span data-start="470.35" data-end="472.15">as we saw with modules they give you the</span> <span data-start="472.15" data-end="475.27">opportunity to have small fast code they</span> <span data-start="475.27" data-end="478.51">load you know really quick I like to I</span> <span data-start="478.51" data-end="480.79">like to be in charge of my code you know</span> <span data-start="480.79" data-end="485.71">so my code is is my code and and and</span> <span data-start="485.71" data-end="488.59">then again no Global's at all you know I</span> <span data-start="488.59" data-end="490.24">don't need to tell you guys about why</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="490.24" data-end="493.15">Global's shouldn't be in your code but I</span> <span data-start="493.15" data-end="497.68">and share their name spaced and there's</span> <span data-start="497.68" data-end="502.69">all these no conflict type mechanisms so</span> <span data-start="502.69" data-end="504.7">that the frameworks don't don't fight</span> <span data-start="504.7" data-end="505.9">with each other anymore but you know</span> <span data-start="505.9" data-end="508.72">just it's time we get rid of Global's</span> <span data-start="508.72" data-end="511.479">altogether and in my coding utopia I'll</span> <span data-start="511.479" data-end="514.83">ignore it ignore IE six through eight so</span> <span data-start="514.83" data-end="518.74">so here's here's an example of you know</span> <span data-start="518.74" data-end="521.8">this coding utopia I'm using standard</span> <span data-start="521.8" data-end="524.86">methods here using preventdefault i'm</span> <span data-start="524.86" data-end="528.13">using query selector all using array</span> <span data-start="528.13" data-end="530.44">iterators that have been available at</span> <span data-start="530.44" data-end="533.26">least in some browsers since 1990 i</span> <span data-start="533.26" data-end="539.47">don't know so</span> <span data-start="539.48" data-end="542.76">and here's here's here's his a second</span> <span data-start="542.76" data-end="544.71">try you know here's here's maybe this is</span> <span data-start="544.71" data-end="548.73">good enough instead of going coding to</span> <span data-start="548.73" data-end="551.67">standards why don't we just agree on</span> <span data-start="551.67" data-end="554.19">that there is a standard but maybe we've</span> <span data-start="554.19" data-end="556.5">had to wrap it to help support the older</span> <span data-start="556.5" data-end="558.3">browsers right because because if we</span> <span data-start="558.3" data-end="560.07">were going to work this way this means</span> <span data-start="560.07" data-end="561.84">duck punching the older browsers</span> <span data-start="561.84" data-end="564.68">basically prototype augmentation which</span> <span data-start="564.68" data-end="568.4">arguably is good or bad if you're</span> <span data-start="568.4" data-end="571.02">augmenting the prototype to a standard I</span> <span data-start="571.02" data-end="572.52">think some people think that's</span> <span data-start="572.52" data-end="574.14">acceptable but I think we've been burned</span> <span data-start="574.14" data-end="575.64">so many times in the past so maybe this</span> <span data-start="575.64" data-end="578.46">is good enough you know if we just have</span> <span data-start="578.46" data-end="579.84">some wrapper function that looks and</span> <span data-start="579.84" data-end="581.82">behaves exactly like query selector all</span> <span data-start="581.82" data-end="586.2">or if we have this object with array</span> <span data-start="586.2" data-end="588.87">iterators and array mutators on it that</span> <span data-start="588.87" data-end="591.41">works in acts exactly like the standard</span> <span data-start="591.41" data-end="594.87">but instead takes takes an array as its</span> <span data-start="594.87" data-end="597.33">parameter so this kind of wrapper around</span> <span data-start="597.33" data-end="601.16">arrays maybe that's good enough and</span> <span data-start="601.16" data-end="603.24">here's another example we've got some</span> <span data-start="603.24" data-end="608.17">event

data-start="2108.73" data-end="2112.27">pattern external to the the code itself</span> <span data-start="2112.27" data-end="2114.94">to actually hook events together right</span> <span

data-start="2118.63" data-end="2120.67">end up with is just pure business logic</span> <span data-start="2120.67" data-end="2124.18">and that's that I think is as close to</span> <span

data-end="2143.57">file so here's the main HTML file</span> <span data-start="2143.58" data-end="2148.62">standard html5 let's see the first piece</span> <span data-start="2148.62" data-end="2151.41">we want to look at is this is the way to</span> <span data-start="2151.41" data-end="2154.05">get the AMD loader kick-started we're</span> <span data-start="2154.05"

data-end="2172.14">where our files are located we can</span> <span data-start="2172.14" data-end="2174.3">actually tell the loader where to look</span> <span data-start="2174.3" data-end="2176.88">for our files for instance wire is here</span> <span data-start="2176.88" data-end="2178.8">our Dom ready wherever we're referencing</span> <span data-start="2178.8" data-end="2180.99">this Dom ready

actually</span> <span data-start="2185.97" data-end="2187.77">looking for it here and we can see how</span> <span data-start="2187.77" data-end="2189.57">these are mapped over here so see us</span> <span data-start="2189.57" data-end="2191.64">it's actually looking for anything</span> <span data-start="2191.64" data-end="2193.71">that's called CSS is actually finding it</span> <span

data-start="2199.74" data-end="2201.6">to think of Dom ready is one of those</span> <span data-start="2201.6" data-end="2203.76">things that is integral to a framework</span> <span

data-start="2208.35" data-end="2212.37">actually the AMD loaders are also taking</span> <span data-start="2212.37" data-end="2214.89">this strategy that yet no Dom ready is</span> <span data-start="2214.89" data-end="2218.19">its own it's it's own module so it we're</span> <span data-start="2218.19" data-end="2220.02">actually pulling them out and allowing</span> <span

data-end="2229.77">anywhere where we see a reference to</span> <span data-start="2229.77" data-end="2231.21">query selector all it's actually pulling</span> <span data-start="2231.21" data-end="2233.76">in the sizzle engine right here right</span> <span data-start="2233.76" data-end="2235.8">there and again I could actually have</span> <span data-start="2235.8"

data-end="2317.12">are and then here's an example of us</span> <span data-start="2317.12" data-end="2320.27">using the wire plug in for AMD AMD</span> <span data-start="2320.27" data-end="2322.79">loaders to actually go and load our app</span> <span data-start="2322.79" data-end="2324.98">so let's take a look at app loader this</span> <span data-start="2324.98" data-end="2326.42">is actually this is this code that</span> <span data-start="2326.42" data-end="2332.43">actually bootstraps our app right here</span> <span data-start="2332.44" data-end="2338.48">this this is the language of of wire so</span> <span data-start="2338.48" data-end="2340.79">do you want to sure okay just a quick</span> <span data-start="2340.79" data-end="2345.65">rundown this is just a define a module</span> <span data-start="2345.65" data-end="2348.38">being fine using the free variable so a</span> <span data-start="2348.38" data-end="2350.81">wire so a wire spec is just a module</span> <span data-start="2350.81" data-end="2353.42">right yeah yeah so this spec is just a</span> <span data-start="2353.42" data-end="2356.51">module and this is basically an object</span> <span data-start="2356.51" data-end="2358.34">literal that just describes all the</span> <span data-start="2358.34" data-end="2360.32">components we want to bring into</span> <span data-start="2360.32" data-end="2363.7">existence to make our appt work we have</span> <span data-start="2363.7" data-end="2368.3">some data that we're loading from a</span> <span data-start="2368.3" data-end="2370.25">module we have a</span> <span data-start="2370.25" data-end="2371.96">codes view which you saw just a minute</span> <span data-start="2371.96" data-end="2374.72">ago and we specify the AMD module path</span> <span data-start="2374.72" data-end="2378.02">to it and some constructor arcs in this</span> <span data-start="2378.02" data-end="2379.34">case a dom node where we're going to</span> <span data-start="2379.34" data-end="2382.04">stick that view a heading view what you</span> <span data-start="2382.04" data-end="2383.63">saw has the picture of the two pirates</span> <span data-start="2383.63" data-end="2385.22">we're going to place that in the Dom</span> <span data-start="2385.22" data-end="2388.25">also in the heading view container the</span> <span data-start="2388.25" data-end="2389.98">score of you which was hidden and our</span> <span data-start="2389.98" data-end="2393.98">controller so we're just declaring what</span> <span data-start="2393.98" data-end="2398.12">components go into our app and what what</span> <span data-start="2398.12" data-end="2400.45">weather where the views needed placed</span> <span data-start="2400.45" data-end="2403.46">our controller we're injecting a</span> <span data-start="2403.46" data-end="2405.56">reference to the codes view so that the</span> <span data-start="2405.56" data-end="2409.52">controller can interact with it so this</span> <span data-start="2409.52" data-end="2412.36">is just a sort of a declarative way to</span> <span data-start="2412.36" data-end="2415.13">bootstrap all right and all the ten</span> <span data-start="2415.13" data-end="2416.78">ponies all right I think we're out of</span> <span data-start="2416.78" data-end="2419.03">time is that correct is this we out of</span> <span data-start="2419.03" data-end="2422.51">time now all right but anyways this is</span> <span data-start="2422.51" data-end="2425.33">just a teaser about how wire works in</span> <span data-start="2425.33" data-end="2427.25">the aversive version of control and how</span> <span data-start="2427.25" data-end="2430.25">we're injecting you know other modules</span> <span data-start="2430.25" data-end="2433.76">and and properties into our modules if</span> <span data-start="2433.76" data-end="2435.47">you want to see more about this two</span> <span data-start="2435.47" data-end="2439.76">o'clock today right 220 sorry 220 220</span> <span data-start="2439.76" data-end="2445.34">today here so any last questions all</span> <span data-start="2445.34"
