<p><span data-start="15.36" data-end="20.38">you</span> <span data-start="20.39" data-end="23.339">so hi everybody my name is john britton</span> <span data-start="23.339" data-end="25.289">and i'm going to be talking about how we</span> <span data-start="25.289" data-end="27.929">do operations at github and how you can</span> <span data-start="27.929" data-end="31.32">too so first just a little bit about me</span> <span data-start="31.32" data-end="34.32">I am homeless I used to live in New York</span> <span data-start="34.32" data-end="35.76">City but I've been on the road for about</span> <span data-start="35.76" data-end="37.589">a year and a half now right now I'm</span> <span data-start="37.589" data-end="40.559">living in Manila and i'll be heading out</span> <span data-start="40.559" data-end="42.12">you know at the end of the week for the</span> <span data-start="42.12" data-end="44.46">next place so that's just a little bit</span> <span data-start="44.46" data-end="46.079">about my background i started working at</span> <span data-start="46.079" data-end="47.55">github about a year and a half ago and</span> <span data-start="47.55" data-end="49.739">when i first started i thought that</span> <span data-start="49.739" data-end="51.93">operations was just for neck beards and</span> <span data-start="51.93" data-end="54.689">you know when you think about it it's</span> <span data-start="54.689" data-end="56.549">like you know many companies have a</span> <span data-start="56.549" data-end="59.699">dedicated operations team and the</span> <span data-start="59.699" data-end="61.11">developers write their code they build</span> <span data-start="61.11" data-end="62.64">their apps they say i want to use this</span> <span data-start="62.64" data-end="64.049">new thing called node and the ops team</span> <span data-start="64.049" data-end="65.579">says no way that's crazy i don't know</span> <span data-start="65.579" data-end="67.619">how to do how to do that and you go back</span> <span data-start="67.619" data-end="69.24">and forth and you throw the the problem</span> <span data-start="69.24" data-end="70.59">over there over the wall to somebody</span> <span data-start="70.59" data-end="72.409">else and they solve the problem for you</span> <span data-start="72.409" data-end="76.079">and you know a lot of companies operate</span> <span data-start="76.079" data-end="78.81">that way but you don't have to and this</span> <span data-start="78.81" data-end="80.939">is going to be the story about how we</span> <span data-start="80.939" data-end="83.43">kind of change that style within our</span> <span data-start="83.43" data-end="86.58">company so as with everything we do at</span> <span data-start="86.58" data-end="88.92">github we try and work from first</span> <span data-start="88.92" data-end="90.39">principles and i'll tell you a little</span> <span data-start="90.39" data-end="94.14">bit about why we we operate this way the</span> <span data-start="94.14" data-end="95.25">first value that we have is</span> <span data-start="95.25" data-end="97.83">collaboration everything that we do we</span> <span data-start="97.83" data-end="100.62">care about doing it with other people so</span> <span data-start="100.62" data-end="102.45">it's better to work together than to</span> <span data-start="102.45" data-end="106.26">work alone when you have a you know</span> <span data-start="106.26" data-end="107.43">terminal and you go to deploy your</span> <span data-start="107.43" data-end="110.1">application no one can see what you're</span> <span data-start="110.1" data-end="111.9">doing right you're just on your machine</span> <span data-start="111.9" data-end="114.69">running running like deploy to Heroku or</span> <span data-start="114.69" data-end="117.24">whatever your your stack is and there's</span> <span data-start="117.24" data-end="118.47">no way to kind of work with each other</span> <span data-start="118.47" data-end="121.89">so this is one one main value the next</span> <span data-start="121.89" data-end="124.86">is automation how many people can deploy</span> <span data-start="124.86" data-end="129.209">by running one command how many people</span> <span data-start="129.209" data-end="131.849">have a deploy process it takes more than</span> <span data-start="131.849" data-end="136.459">five minutes anybody yeah okay so</span> <span data-start="136.459" data-end="138.54">basically the point here is that you</span> <span data-start="138.54" data-end="142.319">should you should never have the same do</span> <span data-start="142.319" data-end="144.03">the same thing twice right if you can if</span> <span data-start="144.03" data-end="148.379">you can strip it you should so the next</span> <span data-start="148.379" data-end="150.48">is experimentation it shouldn't be</span> <span data-start="150.48" data-end="152.5">difficult to try new things</span> <span data-start="152.5" data-end="154.15">when we're talking about you know</span> <span data-start="154.15" data-end="156.76">launching a new application or testing</span> <span data-start="156.76" data-end="157.96">out a new feature it should be really</span> <span data-start="157.96" data-end="159.46">easy to just deploy a branch of your</span> <span data-start="159.46" data-end="161.92">application or just deploy a new thing</span> <span data-start="161.92" data-end="163.9">without having to go through lots of</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="163.9" data-end="166.87">Hoops if you can automate the process</span> <span data-start="166.87" data-end="168.64">for provisioning it's really easy to</span> <span data-start="168.64" data-end="171.61">experiment and create new apps and the</span> <span data-start="171.61" data-end="173.89">final value that I wanted to talk about</span> <span data-start="173.89" data-end="176.74">is distribution so we want knowledge</span> <span data-start="176.74" data-end="178.18">within the company to be distributed</span> <span data-start="178.18" data-end="179.68">among people so that if someone is</span> <span data-start="179.68" data-end="180.97">unavailable for vacation or if they</span> <span data-start="180.97" data-end="183.55">leave the company we don't have a single</span> <span data-start="183.55" data-end="185.44">point of failure so those are like the</span> <span data-start="185.44" data-end="188.739">four main reasons why we do the things</span> <span data-start="188.739" data-end="192.1">that I'm going to talk about but let's</span> <span data-start="192.1" data-end="194.459">talk about what we're actually doing so</span> <span data-start="194.459" data-end="196.57">there are two applications i'm going to</span> <span data-start="196.57" data-end="198.31">talk about they're both open source and</span> <span data-start="198.31" data-end="200.22">you can use them the first is boxing</span> <span data-start="200.22" data-end="203.02">it's a tool for managing developer</span> <span data-start="203.02" data-end="206.14">workstations so and the second is cubot</span> <span data-start="206.14" data-end="210.04">it's a node.js application for adding a</span> <span data-start="210.04" data-end="213.97">bot to your chat rooms so I'll start at</span> <span data-start="213.97" data-end="215.86">the beginning and kind of work through</span> <span data-start="215.86" data-end="218.019">you know what a new developer does it</span> <span data-start="218.019" data-end="220.239">github and then how how they get started</span> <span data-start="220.239" data-end="223.06">so boxing I get up most people are using</span> <span data-start="223.06" data-end="226.03">max for development there are some</span> <span data-start="226.03" data-end="227.29">people on Windows there are some people</span> <span data-start="227.29" data-end="230.47">on Linux but for the most part we use</span> <span data-start="230.47" data-end="232.78">macs and boxing is a tool specifically</span> <span data-start="232.78" data-end="234.97">for max to make it really easy to get</span> <span data-start="234.97" data-end="237.459">started and kind of keep all of our</span> <span data-start="237.459" data-end="240.34">machines in a good clean state the</span> <span data-start="240.34" data-end="241.84">overall goal is to eliminate friction</span> <span data-start="241.84" data-end="245.11">when you start a new job it's often that</span> <span data-start="245.11" data-end="247.12">you know you have to spend a ton of time</span> <span data-start="247.12" data-end="248.739">setting up the developed environment for</span> <span data-start="248.739" data-end="251.14">the first time I remember my first</span> <span data-start="251.14" data-end="252.549">programming job it took me a whole week</span> <span data-start="252.549" data-end="254.53">before I could actually get the whole</span> <span data-start="254.53" data-end="256.299">stack running on my machine that's a</span> <span data-start="256.299" data-end="258.16">terrible waste of time terrible waste of</span> <span data-start="258.16" data-end="260.079">money and every single time you add a</span> <span data-start="260.079" data-end="261.91">new developer team you have this new</span> <span data-start="261.91" data-end="263.2">develop to the team you have the same</span> <span data-start="263.2" data-end="266.35">problem so the goal of boxing is to make</span> <span data-start="266.35" data-end="267.97">it possible to build something new on</span> <span data-start="267.97" data-end="272.02">the first day of work so what does a</span> <span data-start="272.02" data-end="273.7">typical first day at github look like we</span> <span data-start="273.7" data-end="276.01">have about 215 people working in the</span> <span data-start="276.01" data-end="277.6">company now and every time somebody</span> <span data-start="277.6" data-end="280.63">joins often a few new people join on the</span> <span data-start="280.63" data-end="282.22">same day what do they do they get a</span> <span data-start="282.22" data-end="284.169">brand new mac laptop retina to</span> <span data-start="284.169" data-end="285.789">play they unwrapped it and they're</span> <span data-start="285.789" data-end="287.86">having a good ol time and they go and</span> <span data-start="287.86" data-end="289.33">they install xcode command line tools</span> <span data-start="289.33" data-end="292.349">right this is the first first step and</span> <span data-start="292.349" data-end="294.52">you might say oh this that doesn't sound</span> <span data-start="294.52" data-end="296.409">very automated but we can't automate</span> <span data-start="296.409" data-end="297.879">this part because you have to click the</span> <span data-start="297.879" data-end="299.979">terms of service and all the blah so</span> <span data-start="299.979" data-end="301.9">this is not automated but once you've</span> <span data-start="301.9" data-end="303.4">got command line tools you've got you</span> <span data-start="303.4" data-end="305.469">know a compiler and whatever you need</span> <span data-start="305.469" data-end="308.439">you just go to an internal application</span> <span data-start="308.439" data-end="311.62">just a behind an employee authorization</span> <span data-start="311.62" data-end="313.539">and there's a web page and the web page</span> <span data-start="313.539" data-end="315.699">has this command and this command you</span> <span data-start="315.699" data-end="317.08">just copy and paste it in your terminal</span> <span data-start="317.08" data-end="318.939">and you run it what it does is it goes</span> <span data-start="318.939" data-end="321.43">to it pulls down a script to a temporary</span> <span data-start="321.43" data-end="323.86">directory and then it executes the</span> <span data-start="323.86" data-end="326.08">script that downloaded and pretty much</span> <span data-start="326.08" data-end="328.779">it does everything you need it just asks</span> <span data-start="328.779" data-end="330.009">you for your github user name your</span> <span data-start="330.009" data-end="333.669">github password your machine username</span> <span data-start="333.669" data-end="336.039">and your machine password so trust me</span> <span data-start="336.039" data-end="338.05">it's fine we're not going to do anything</span> <span data-start="338.05" data-end="340.419">bad too but it is a big leap of faith</span> <span data-start="340.419" data-end="342.099">the first thing to do is give you ever</span> <span data-start="342.099" data-end="344.68">give the script root access and so we do</span> <span data-start="344.68" data-end="346.749">that and then you grab a beverage and</span> <span data-start="346.749" data-end="349.449">wait on a fast connection you could be</span> <span data-start="349.449" data-end="351.849">done in about an hour maybe a little bit</span> <span data-start="351.849" data-end="353.68">more on a slow connection it could be a</span> <span data-start="353.68" data-end="355.389">few hours you know downloading all of</span> <span data-start="355.389" data-end="358.479">the different tools but once once it</span> <span data-start="358.479" data-end="360.039">finishes you've got everything you need</span> <span data-start="360.039" data-end="362.979">for a development environment homebrew</span> <span data-start="362.979" data-end="366.759">get all this stuff node no damn much of</span> <span data-start="366.759" data-end="369.49">you know javascript stuff also all kinds</span> <span data-start="369.49" data-end="371.139">of other platforms to not everything is</span> <span data-start="371.139" data-end="373.599">listed here so now you've got a great</span> <span data-start="373.599" data-end="375.789">brand new mac laptop all set up for</span> <span data-start="375.789" data-end="376.899">development you don't have to worry</span> <span data-start="376.899" data-end="378.759">about do you have the Ruby versions you</span> <span data-start="378.759" data-end="380.199">need you have the node versions you need</span> <span data-start="380.199" data-end="382.81">everything is there but you probably</span> <span data-start="382.81" data-end="386.289">have some feature requests or some bugs</span> <span data-start="386.289" data-end="387.819">that you've noticed on github com that</span> <span data-start="387.819" data-end="389.08">you really really want to fix on your</span> <span data-start="389.08" data-end="391.599">first day right so how do we get github</span> <span data-start="391.599" data-end="393.159">installed on our machine we want to have</span> <span data-start="393.159" data-end="395.379">a local development environment for</span> <span data-start="395.379" data-end="397.509">github you just run one command box and</span> <span data-start="397.509" data-end="399.759">github and everything is set up for you</span> <span data-start="399.759" data-end="402.759">it creates databases it creates key</span> <span data-start="402.759" data-end="404.56">value stores if you need them it creates</span> <span data-start="404.56" data-end="408.219">everything and that's it you've got</span> <span data-start="408.219" data-end="410.879">github now you can go write some code so</span> <span data-start="410.879" data-end="413.44">how does the github port work how does</span> <span data-start="413.44" data-end="415.96">it how does box in know</span> <span data-start="415.96" data-end="417.86">going download this particular</span> <span data-start="417.86" data-end="420.95">repository and install these back-end</span> <span data-start="420.95" data-end="423.44">dependencies and databases and you know</span> <span data-start="423.44" data-end="425.15">all this stuff that we need it uses a</span> <span data-start="425.15" data-end="428.87">project manifest so let's take a look at</span> <span data-start="428.87" data-end="431.15">a project manifest for a project that i</span> <span data-start="431.15" data-end="433.13">created so i could help i work on the</span> <span data-start="433.13" data-end="434.87">education team and I handle all the kind</span> <span data-start="434.87" data-end="436.94">of inbound requests from students and</span> <span data-start="436.94" data-end="439.73">teachers who are you know wanting to use</span> <span data-start="439.73" data-end="441.05">github for free so i built an</span> <span data-start="441.05" data-end="442.34">application that can like automate all</span> <span data-start="442.34" data-end="444.98">that stuff for me and if i want other</span> <span data-start="444.98" data-end="446.27">people to collaborate with me in the</span> <span data-start="446.27" data-end="448.34">company it should be as easy as saying</span> <span data-start="448.34" data-end="450.53">box in education web and they should</span> <span data-start="450.53" data-end="452.63">have my application setup so here's what</span> <span data-start="452.63" data-end="454.49">the the project manifest looks like for</span> <span data-start="454.49" data-end="456.38">my application it's a pretty</span> <span data-start="456.38" data-end="457.7">straightforward it just has the name of</span> <span data-start="457.7" data-end="460.85">the application and by default this this</span> <span data-start="460.85" data-end="462.89">kind of module format also matches with</span> <span data-start="462.89" data-end="466.4">our github organizations so box and</span> <span data-start="466.4" data-end="468.41">knows to look at github com / github /</span> <span data-start="468.41" data-end="470.69">or education web to find my application</span> <span data-start="470.69" data-end="472.55">and then it has some dependencies dot</span> <span data-start="472.55" data-end="475.19">anvil astok surge Redis Ruby specific</span> <span data-start="475.19" data-end="477.62">version and also information about the</span> <span data-start="477.62" data-end="479.84">databases that I need for development so</span> <span data-start="479.84" data-end="480.98">that's it it's just a pretty</span> <span data-start="480.98" data-end="483.89">straightforward kind of declarative</span> <span data-start="483.89" data-end="486.53">thing if you're familiar this is</span> <span data-start="486.53" data-end="488.84">actually puppet under the hood so if you</span> <span data-start="488.84" data-end="491.36">use puppet this is you know exactly what</span> <span data-start="491.36" data-end="492.83">you're used to if not it's not that hard</span> <span data-start="492.83" data-end="495.62">to get going so this defines a project</span> <span data-start="495.62" data-end="500.12">for us so once we've got a project we</span> <span data-start="500.12" data-end="501.62">can say you know other developers can</span> <span data-start="501.62" data-end="503.81">come and help us out but maybe I have</span> <span data-start="503.81" data-end="505.25">multiple computers you know I have a</span> <span data-start="505.25" data-end="507.8">laptop I have a desktop when the newest</span> <span data-start="507.8" data-end="509.42">you know new macbook comes out I don't</span> <span data-start="509.42" data-end="512.06">want to get the new one and I don't know</span> <span data-start="512.06" data-end="513.02">about you guys but I have a lot of</span> <span data-start="513.02" data-end="515.33">tweaks a lot of individual things and</span> <span data-start="515.33" data-end="516.979">settings that i like about the way i</span> <span data-start="516.979" data-end="518.69">have my mac setup that i don't want to</span> <span data-start="518.69" data-end="521.06">have to repeat over and over again so we</span> <span data-start="521.06" data-end="522.56">have something called personal manifests</span> <span data-start="522.56" data-end="524.75">in boxing that'll let you achieve this</span> <span data-start="524.75" data-end="526.25">goal as well so you can you can actually</span> <span data-start="526.25" data-end="528.23">code every kind of configuration change</span> <span data-start="528.23" data-end="531.8">to your machine and save it on like a</span> <span data-start="531.8" data-end="534.32">per-user basis so let's take a look at</span> <span data-start="534.32" data-end="537.08">my personal manifest step by step I know</span> <span data-start="537.08" data-end="539.23">the text is kind of hard to see but I</span> <span data-start="539.23" data-end="542.18">think you'll be able to get the idea so</span> <span data-start="542.18" data-end="544.7">first it's a puppet class in the people</span> <span data-start="544.7" data-end="546.02">module so we have a module that</span> <span data-start="546.02" data-end="547.95">represents each person at the company</span> <span data-start="547.95" data-end="550.08">and mine is John Dee Britain that's my</span> <span data-start="550.08" data-end="553.17">username next you can see that I've</span> <span data-start="553.17" data-end="555.99">included a bunch of puppet modules or</span> <span data-start="555.99" data-end="558.87">boxing things there's a puppet module</span> <span data-start="558.87" data-end="561.63">called OSX made specifically for boxing</span> <span data-start="561.63" data-end="563.91">that includes a bunch of default</span> <span data-start="563.91" data-end="566.22">settings so things like enabling the</span> <span data-start="566.22" data-end="570.36">control zoom yeah things like that and</span> <span data-start="570.36" data-end="573.54">you know disabling the doc all that kind</span> <span data-start="573.54" data-end="574.83">of stuff is there and these are all</span> <span data-start="574.83" data-end="576.48">pre-written packages that anybody can</span> <span data-start="576.48" data-end="579.81">use next you can see that i'm including</span> <span data-start="579.81" data-end="581.16">a bunch of applications so i use</span> <span data-start="581.16" data-end="583.22">1password I've got Firefox and Chrome</span> <span data-start="583.22" data-end="585.81">dropbox so when I get a new machine I've</span> <span data-start="585.81" data-end="587.94">run this stuff it automatically installs</span> <span data-start="587.94" data-end="589.65">all these applications for me and you</span> <span data-start="589.65" data-end="590.64">might be curious you know what's this</span> <span data-start="590.64" data-end="593.58">include you know include chrome actually</span> <span data-start="593.58" data-end="595.29">doing well there's an organization on</span> <span data-start="595.29" data-end="598.44">github github.com / boxing and there's a</span> <span data-start="598.44" data-end="599.76">bunch of repositories under that</span> <span data-start="599.76" data-end="601.8">organization that contain all the box</span> <span data-start="601.8" data-end="604.98">and modules so we don't maintain all of</span> <span data-start="604.98" data-end="606.27">those it's actually a community effort</span> <span data-start="606.27" data-end="608.91">so if you create a new box in module you</span> <span data-start="608.91" data-end="610.5">can send a request to us and we'll fork</span> <span data-start="610.5" data-end="612.15">it into that organization and make it</span> <span data-start="612.15" data-end="613.89">available to other people so this is</span> <span data-start="613.89" data-end="615.3">kind of how it works to install</span> <span data-start="615.3" data-end="616.89">applications that do have existing</span> <span data-start="616.89" data-end="619.53">modules but not everything has a module</span> <span data-start="619.53" data-end="620.85">and it's not worth creating a module for</span> <span data-start="620.85" data-end="622.38">everything so i'll show you i have a</span> <span data-start="622.38" data-end="623.82">couple applications that i've installed</span> <span data-start="623.82" data-end="626.1">they don't have modules so you can see</span> <span data-start="626.1" data-end="627.84">that I've got bartender which is being</span> <span data-start="627.84" data-end="629.37">installed from a zip file over the</span> <span data-start="629.37" data-end="631.74">network and I have sublime text 3 which</span> <span data-start="631.74" data-end="634.17">is being still installed from a dmg so</span> <span data-start="634.17" data-end="635.58">you can install from you know pretty</span> <span data-start="635.58" data-end="638.94">much any format next I've got a few</span> <span data-start="638.94" data-end="640.59">command line tools that I like installed</span> <span data-start="640.59" data-end="642.96">so i'm using homebrew the default</span> <span data-start="642.96" data-end="646.23">package manager with boxing is homebrew</span> <span data-start="646.23" data-end="647.61">so you can see it's installing these</span> <span data-start="647.61" data-end="650.88">commands for me and then last it sets up</span> <span data-start="650.88" data-end="652.44">my shell and colognes a bunch of my</span> <span data-start="652.44" data-end="655.38">projects since we won't like to ought to</span> <span data-start="655.38" data-end="657.54">automate everything you know the first</span> <span data-start="657.54" data-end="659.43">step which was copy this script and run</span> <span data-start="659.43" data-end="661.71">it then box and github that's two steps</span> <span data-start="661.71" data-end="664.32">we want it to be one step so I can also</span> <span data-start="664.32" data-end="666.84">install projects using my personal</span> <span data-start="666.84" data-end="668.46">manifest so that's kind of an overview</span> <span data-start="668.46" data-end="672.57">of boxing and how we you know get people</span> <span data-start="672.57" data-end="673.92">productive building things on their</span> <span data-start="673.92" data-end="675.66">first day and make it easy for people to</span> <span data-start="675.66" data-end="677.04">jump into</span> <span data-start="677.04" data-end="678.64">collaborating on other people's</span> <span data-start="678.64" data-end="680.589">applications so in short it's just</span> <span data-start="680.589" data-end="684.49">puppet being used on your on your laptop</span> <span data-start="684.49" data-end="687.55">so that has nothing to do with</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="687.55" data-end="690.22">JavaScript at all but I think it's still</span> <span data-start="690.22" data-end="692.56">very relevant for people who are writing</span> <span data-start="692.56" data-end="694.33">web apps who are building any kind of</span> <span data-start="694.33" data-end="696.16">applications for that matter but the</span> <span data-start="696.16" data-end="697.27">next thing that I want to talk about is</span> <span data-start="697.27" data-end="699.43">Hugh bot and Hugh bot is a node.js</span> <span data-start="699.43" data-end="701.83">application it's also open source so you</span> <span data-start="701.83" data-end="705.43">can get it on github and the goal of</span> <span data-start="705.43" data-end="707.56">cubot is to make it possible to share</span> <span data-start="707.56" data-end="710.86">the terminal working in your command on</span> <span data-start="710.86" data-end="713.2">the command line has always been a kind</span> <span data-start="713.2" data-end="715.48">of private task you know unless you have</span> <span data-start="715.48" data-end="716.649">somebody sitting right next to you</span> <span data-start="716.649" data-end="718.06">looking at you when you're deploying</span> <span data-start="718.06" data-end="722.89">your application or you have some other</span> <span data-start="722.89" data-end="724.75">system there's no way to get an idea of</span> <span data-start="724.75" data-end="727.18">what someone's doing so if I'm working</span> <span data-start="727.18" data-end="728.589">with my like my colleague Donna she's</span> <span data-start="728.589" data-end="730.39">back there and I'm deploying my</span> <span data-start="730.39" data-end="731.86">application he has no idea that I'm</span> <span data-start="731.86" data-end="734.35">doing that for my terminal so the goal</span> <span data-start="734.35" data-end="737.529">of cubot is to make it possible to test</span> <span data-start="737.529" data-end="739.66">ship and measure everything and also to</span> <span data-start="739.66" data-end="741.31">make it possible for others to see when</span> <span data-start="741.31" data-end="742.54">you're doing that so we want to be able</span> <span data-start="742.54" data-end="744.94">to collaborate on that stuff just as we</span> <span data-start="744.94" data-end="750.459">would collaborate on code so we have a</span> <span data-start="750.459" data-end="752.47">term for this internally we call it chat</span> <span data-start="752.47" data-end="756.91">ops nobody can see what commands are run</span> <span data-start="756.91" data-end="758.32">on your terminal so let's bring them</span> <span data-start="758.32" data-end="760.69">into the chat room I could hope we use</span> <span data-start="760.69" data-end="762.88">campfire so you can you know we have a</span> <span data-start="762.88" data-end="764.11">bunch of campfire rooms I think there's</span> <span data-start="764.11" data-end="765.82">like 150 or something like that and</span> <span data-start="765.82" data-end="768.4">generally we have one room for each area</span> <span data-start="768.4" data-end="770.02">of interest so for example we have a</span> <span data-start="770.02" data-end="773.02">room for ops which is where people talk</span> <span data-start="773.02" data-end="774.85">about availability and you know those</span> <span data-start="774.85" data-end="776.86">kinds of issues also supporting new</span> <span data-start="776.86" data-end="778.33">hardware and things like that we have a</span> <span data-start="778.33" data-end="779.98">room for each application so there's a</span> <span data-start="779.98" data-end="783.1">room for github com there's a room for</span> <span data-start="783.1" data-end="785.13">all of our internal applications and</span> <span data-start="785.13" data-end="788.079">it's kind of separated out by topic that</span> <span data-start="788.079" data-end="789.279">way you can kind of parse out what you</span> <span data-start="789.279" data-end="791.32">want the thing that's really nice about</span> <span data-start="791.32" data-end="793.6">doing things inside of chat is that it's</span> <span data-start="793.6" data-end="795.04">possible for people who are new at the</span> <span data-start="795.04" data-end="798.73">company to see how things are done</span> <span data-start="798.73" data-end="801.52">without asking you know they're just if</span> <span data-start="801.52" data-end="803.14">they're in the chat room you know</span> <span data-start="803.14" data-end="804.73">hanging out seeing what people are up to</span> <span data-start="804.73" data-end="807.22">they'll die osmosis learn how to deploy</span> <span data-start="807.22" data-end="809.41">they'll learn how to do a branch deploy</span> <span data-start="809.41" data-end="810.27">how to do a</span> <span data-start="810.27" data-end="811.64">regular deploy how to deploy to staging</span> <span data-start="811.64" data-end="814.65">how to do all kinds of stuff so we like</span> <span data-start="814.65" data-end="816.09">to think of chat as a shared command</span> <span data-start="816.09" data-end="819.14">line and you know bring those things out</span> <span data-start="819.14" data-end="824.67">into the open so let's like take a look</span> <span data-start="824.67" data-end="827.91">into how we actually do this stuff some</span> <span data-start="827.91" data-end="830.55">some actual commands so first let's look</span> <span data-start="830.55" data-end="833.52">at some commands for testing most of our</span> <span data-start="833.52" data-end="836.13">apps have a fair amount of tests not</span> <span data-start="836.13" data-end="838.2">everything but you know we strive for</span> <span data-start="838.2" data-end="841.08">that the first command that will look at</span> <span data-start="841.08" data-end="844.17">is CI build so the slash in the front is</span> <span data-start="844.17" data-end="846.78">what indicates that this is a command</span> <span data-start="846.78" data-end="849.06">for Hugh bot as opposed to you know a</span> <span data-start="849.06" data-end="851.43">normal chat room message so here's what</span> <span data-start="851.43" data-end="854.19">it looks like in action so I'm in the</span> <span data-start="854.19" data-end="856.14">chat room and I say see I build</span> <span data-start="856.14" data-end="858.12">education web that specifies which</span> <span data-start="858.12" data-end="860.25">application I want to build cubot</span> <span data-start="860.25" data-end="861.9">responds with a message to say that he</span> <span data-start="861.9" data-end="865.5">has begun the build process and then you</span> <span data-start="865.5" data-end="869.55">can see when the build completed you can</span> <span data-start="869.55" data-end="871.44">also use see I build with a specific</span> <span data-start="871.44" data-end="873.27">branch of your repository so if you have</span> <span data-start="873.27" data-end="874.86">a project you know this is all based on</span> <span data-start="874.86" data-end="878.61">using get as your you know as your</span> <span data-start="878.61" data-end="881.94">deployment stack so you can build</span> <span data-start="881.94" data-end="883.17">actually a specific branch so in this</span> <span data-start="883.17" data-end="884.58">case I'm working on a new feature where</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="884.58" data-end="886.71">I'm using kind of Mechanical Turk</span> <span data-start="886.71" data-end="890.1">service to do some work and I wanted to</span> <span data-start="890.1" data-end="891.36">see if it worked and it turns out there</span> <span data-start="891.36" data-end="893.28">was a failure after 31 seconds so we can</span> <span data-start="893.28" data-end="896.37">run deploy run builds in the chat room</span> <span data-start="896.37" data-end="898.47">so once your build is passing and you</span> <span data-start="898.47" data-end="900.6">decide you want to go you just I'd you</span> <span data-start="900.6" data-end="902.31">want to ship your software you have to</span> <span data-start="902.31" data-end="903.48">make sure that your environments are set</span> <span data-start="903.48" data-end="906.09">up so by default you know everybody has</span> <span data-start="906.09" data-end="907.62">a production environment but some people</span> <span data-start="907.62" data-end="909.66">like to staging some people like to have</span> <span data-start="909.66" data-end="911.37">multiple staging areas so that you can</span> <span data-start="911.37" data-end="913.53">stage different changes at the same time</span> <span data-start="913.53" data-end="916.05">but so we have a command called config</span> <span data-start="916.05" data-end="918.48">which allows you to set up your</span> <span data-start="918.48" data-end="920.64">environments it allows you to set</span> <span data-start="920.64" data-end="923.57">environment variables for specific</span> <span data-start="923.57" data-end="926.43">specific environments so in this case</span> <span data-start="926.43" data-end="928.02">you can see that I'm locking the room</span> <span data-start="928.02" data-end="931.41">and then I run config education web</span> <span data-start="931.41" data-end="933.63">fubar and what that does it sets the</span> <span data-start="933.63" data-end="935.13">environment variable foo equal the bar</span> <span data-start="935.13" data-end="937.56">and Hugh bought response back to me that</span> <span data-start="937.56" data-end="939.18">that was successful it's important to</span> <span data-start="939.18" data-end="941.04">note that I locked the room manually</span> <span data-start="941.04" data-end="943.27">because i was typing in credential</span> <span data-start="943.27" data-end="944.77">or something secret that I don't want in</span> <span data-start="944.77" data-end="948.16">our chat room logs so that i can read</span> <span data-start="948.16" data-end="950.02">back you know the environment variables</span> <span data-start="950.02" data-end="952.48">and if I say config education web foo it</span> <span data-start="952.48" data-end="953.5">will tell me the value of that variable</span> <span data-start="953.5" data-end="955.9">if I say config education web it will</span> <span data-start="955.9" data-end="957.4">tell you the value tell me the value of</span> <span data-start="957.4" data-end="960.19">all of the environment if I save config</span> <span data-start="960.19" data-end="962.74">educated web in staging it will show me</span> <span data-start="962.74" data-end="964.87">the staging you know environment and I</span> <span data-start="964.87" data-end="965.62">can go through all the different</span> <span data-start="965.62" data-end="967.51">environments that we have it's also</span> <span data-start="967.51" data-end="968.59">worth noting that Hugh bought</span> <span data-start="968.59" data-end="970.06">automatically locks the room before he</span> <span data-start="970.06" data-end="972.67">regurgitates what could be potentially</span> <span data-start="972.67" data-end="974.23">private information so it's really</span> <span data-start="974.23" data-end="976.15">important to make sure that you don't</span> <span data-start="976.15" data-end="980.2">leak that stuff so we've got our</span> <span data-start="980.2" data-end="981.99">environment setup now let's actually</span> <span data-start="981.99" data-end="986.95">deploy some some stuff so here's how you</span> <span data-start="986.95" data-end="988.24">would do it if you want to deploy the</span> <span data-start="988.24" data-end="990.19">master branch just deploy in the name of</span> <span data-start="990.19" data-end="992.47">the application cubot responds back

data-end="1552.49">that version on all of our developer</span> <span data-start="1552.49" data-end="1556.36">machines do you know if there's been any</span> <span data-start="1556.36" data-end="1557.77">more progress I know that was talked</span> <span data-start="1557.77" data-end="1559.63">about of open sourcing any parts of</span> <span data-start="1559.63" data-end="1562.93">heaven open sourcing any parts of heaven</span> <span data-start="1562.93" data-end="1567.68">heaven okay so heaven is our deploy</span> <span data-start="1567.68" data-end="1569.84">infrastructure it's kind of it's not</span> <span data-start="1569.84" data-end="1572">open source right now there has been</span> <span data-start="1572" data-end="1574.19">talk internally of doing that it we're</span> <span data-start="1574.19" data-end="1575.42">just basically we need to find somebody</span> <span data-start="1575.42" data-end="1577.49">who wants to take the time to do it and</span> <span data-start="1577.49" data-end="1578.93">then once you publish something open</span> <span data-start="1578.93" data-end="1580.13">source you have to be you know kind of a</span> <span data-start="1580.13" data-end="1582.17">good steward and maintain it so we've</span> <span data-start="1582.17" data-end="1584.72">already got people who are pretty keen</span> <span data-start="1584.72" data-end="1587.33">on maintaining cubot and boxing but</span> <span data-start="1587.33" data-end="1590.56">heavens a kind of a bigger harder sell</span> <span data-start="1590.56" data-end="1594.74">so I would love to see that happen so</span> <span data-start="1594.74" data-end="1596.51">you run those commands and campfire or</span> <span data-start="1596.51" data-end="1598.58">right from the terminal happy being</span> <span data-start="1598.58" data-end="1601.55">synchronized or so the first command</span> <span data-start="1601.55" data-end="1602.72">when you get started you have to run on</span> <span data-start="1602.72" data-end="1605.15">the terminal to install boxing but all</span> <span data-start="1605.15" data-end="1606.8">of these commands that I'm that i was</span> <span data-start="1606.8" data-end="1609.14">showing here like animate me like this</span> <span data-start="1609.14" data-end="1612.38">is all in campfire right Oh actually you</span> <span data-start="1612.38" data-end="1614.9">can't see my stuff so those all those</span> <span data-start="1614.9" data-end="1616.82">messages it's like you know / new hire</span> <span data-start="1616.82" data-end="1620.15">me that's a campfire room okay</span> <span data-start="1620.15" data-end="1623.27">interesting and then some other boss</span> <span data-start="1623.27" data-end="1625.72">they pick up this information and like</span> <span data-start="1625.72" data-end="1628.34">propagate to other servers and things</span> <span data-start="1628.34" data-end="1630.77">like right so are you saying about how</span> <span data-start="1630.77" data-end="1633.71">how like puppet for example gets run yep</span> <span data-start="1633.71" data-end="1638.33">so when you do like the like this one</span> <span data-start="1638.33" data-end="1641.02">puppet run what happens is Hugh bot</span> <span data-start="1641.02" data-end="1643.34">here's the message and then Hugh bot</span> <span data-start="1643.34" data-end="1646.31">uses a an external API to fire off the</span> <span data-start="1646.31" data-end="1648.53">you know the build process or you know</span> <span data-start="1648.53" data-end="1651.11">in this case it tells puppet to execute</span> <span data-start="1651.11" data-end="1653.84">the the latest version on all the hosts</span> <span data-start="1653.84" data-end="1657.17">but that's actually not that's not part</span> <span data-start="1657.17" data-end="1659">of Hugh bot essentially every command</span> <span data-start="1659" data-end="1661.58">here is you do something in chat Hugh</span> <span data-start="1661.58" data-end="1662.99">bought hears about it and then he bought</span> <span data-start="1662.99" data-end="1664.73">goes and uses some API to do something</span> <span data-start="1664.73" data-end="1666.59">else and that part where Hugh bought</span> <span data-start="1666.59" data-end="1668.36">goes and uses an API is like user</span> <span data-start="1668.36" data-end="1670.28">serviceable so you can make it do</span> <span data-start="1670.28" data-end="1672.38">anything you want but the really nice</span> <span data-start="1672.38" data-end="1674.09">thing is keeping it in the chat room so</span> <span data-start="1674.09" data-end="1676.39">that everybody can see what's going on</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1676.39" data-end="1680.27">Thanks actually I have a question you</span> <span data-start="1680.27" data-end="1683.69">don't mind what is the rationale behind</span> <span data-start="1683.69" data-end="1686.9">you guys choosing puppet over say chef</span> <span data-start="1686.9" data-end="1689.49">or ansible or salt or anything</span> <span data-start="1689.49" data-end="1693.66">so um I don't know the the whole back</span> <span data-start="1693.66" data-end="1695.82">story but basically there's there are</span> <span data-start="1695.82" data-end="1698.76">the people who are doing like writing</span> <span data-start="1698.76" data-end="1701.309">the code for that stuff decided to use</span> <span data-start="1701.309" data-end="1703.59">puppet probably because it's you know</span> <span data-start="1703.59" data-end="1705.45">pretty well supported there's a lot of</span> <span data-start="1705.45" data-end="1707.58">existing stuff out there they have a lot</span> <span data-start="1707.58" data-end="1708.9">of experience in it already and we had a</span> <span data-start="1708.9" data-end="1710.67">lot of institutional like knowledge</span> <span data-start="1710.67" data-end="1712.2">people already knew how to use puppet I</span> <span data-start="1712.2" data-end="1714.72">think that anta belen sult probably</span> <span data-start="1714.72" data-end="1717.179">weren't very weren't even considered I</span> <span data-start="1717.179" data-end="1718.59">would say it was more of between like</span> <span data-start="1718.59" data-end="1720.54">probably puppet and chef because those</span> <span data-start="1720.54" data-end="1724.34">are two of the more heavily used tools</span> <span data-start="1724.34" data-end="1727.26">but it was already puppet when I started</span> <span data-start="1727.26" data-end="1731.22">working at github so this a question</span> <span data-start="1731.22" data-end="1733.5">about abuse are they automated or do you</span> <span data-start="1733.5" data-end="1735.03">have to send a command before I you</span> <span data-start="1735.03" data-end="1737.85">would be beautiful but the question is</span> <span data-start="1737.85" data-end="1740.85">do I have to run the build manually yes</span> <span data-start="1740.85" data-end="1742.92">sorry no you don't need to run the build</span> <span data-start="1742.92" data-end="1745.35">manually the way we have it set up is on</span> <span data-start="1745.35" data-end="1749.91">github com you go to your repository and</span> <span data-start="1749.91" data-end="1752.309">on each repository there's a settings</span> <span data-start="1752.309" data-end="1754.679">page and there's a service hooks feature</span> <span data-start="1754.679" data-end="1757.41">so if you actually if you're using Hugh</span> <span data-start="1757.41" data-end="1758.91">bot what you can do is you can set it up</span> <span data-start="1758.91" data-end="1762.26">so that Hugh bot is notified when</span> <span data-start="1762.26" data-end="1764.73">whenever I build or whenever a new</span> <span data-start="1764.73" data-end="1766.35">commit is pushed or a new branch or</span> <span data-start="1766.35" data-end="1767.58">anything like that and it will</span> <span data-start="1767.58" data-end="1768.9">automatically run the build and then</span> <span data-start="1768.9" data-end="1770.85">hubert will report the build information</span> <span data-start="1770.85" data-end="1772.86">into the chat room every time you make a</span> <span data-start="1772.86" data-end="1774.45">new push every time you something like</span> <span data-start="1774.45" data-end="1777.66">that so it's it's automated but for you</span> <span data-start="1777.66" data-end="1778.83">know if you want to run the build again</span> <span data-start="1778.83" data-end="1781.35">for some reason or if you want to run a</span> <span data-start="1781.35" data-end="1782.85">build on demand you can do it with you</span> <span data-start="1782.85" data-end="1785.85">bought that way do you specify like what</span> <span data-start="1785.85" data-end="1787.41">the steps you wish to be collected by</span> <span data-start="1787.41" data-end="1790.559">graphite do we specify something with</span> <span data-start="1790.559" data-end="1794.79">graphite then the dimensions the which</span> <span data-start="1794.79" data-end="1797.13">they thought to be collected which data</span> <span data-start="1797.13" data-end="1799.65">yes ok so the way graphites data is</span> <span data-start="1799.65" data-end="1803.07">stored is a nested nested keys so it's</span> <span data-start="1803.07" data-end="1805.5">essentially a tree we have a top-level</span> <span data-start="1805.5" data-end="1808.65">namespace for each application so github</span> <span data-start="1808.65" data-end="1811.35">com is github in my case the education</span> <span data-start="1811.35" data-end="1813.54">stuff is under education there's a bunch</span> <span data-start="1813.54" data-end="1816.27">of buckets for each of our apps and then</span> <span data-start="1816.27" data-end="1817.86">once you're in the bucket for the app</span> <span data-start="1817.86" data-end="1820.07">you just use a dot and then</span> <span data-start="1820.07" data-end="1822.26">of the metric so we'll do things like</span> <span data-start="1822.26" data-end="1825.77">you know task lists was github task list</span> <span data-start="1825.77" data-end="1828.59">dot activity so it was information about</span> <span data-start="1828.59" data-end="1832.28">clicks and and not clicks so once you</span> <span data-start="1832.28" data-end="1833.9">have the data stored in graphite you can</span> <span data-start="1833.9" data-end="1835.22">actually query it from the command line</span> <span data-start="1835.22" data-end="1837.77">or from the from chat ops by saying you</span> <span data-start="1837.77" data-end="1840.29">know graph me and then the name of the</span> <span data-start="1840.29" data-end="1843.08">key that you want to graph and what you</span> <span data-start="1843.08" data-end="1844.58">can do it's a matching pattern as well</span> <span data-start="1844.58" data-end="1846.92">so just like with the host command it's</span> <span data-start="1846.92" data-end="1848.63">a matching pattern you can say you know</span> <span data-start="1848.63" data-end="1851.33">graph meet github dot star and it will</span> <span data-start="1851.33" data-end="1853.34">graph you all the top level metrics in</span> <span data-start="1853.34" data-end="1856.22">the github bucket or you could say graph</span> <span data-start="1856.22" data-end="1859.55">me tas listo github task list at star</span> <span data-start="1859.55" data-end="1861.02">and we'll graph you all of the metrics</span> <span data-start="1861.02" data-end="1864.02">related to that topic does that answer</span> <span data-start="1864.02" data-end="1867.65">your question ok great all right all</span> <span data-start="1867.65" data-end="1869.63">right well thank you John yeah thank you</span> </p>
