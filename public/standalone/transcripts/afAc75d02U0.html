data-end="227.44">think this is awesome right because as</span> <span data-start="227.44" data-end="229.42">the industry grows and so do our</span> <span data-start="229.42" data-end="232.389">capabilities so do our roles and our</span> <span data-start="232.389" data-end="235.84">skills we can generalize or even</span> <span data-start="235.84"

this is really cool we talked a lot</span> <span data-start="244.78" data-end="247.329">about how we should work together how we</span> <span data-start="247.329" data-end="249.16">can make

yeah</span> <span data-start="256.269" data-end="259.03">we may not see this like outright of</span> <span data-start="259.03" data-end="263.229">course or maybe we do I've heard it but</span> <span data-start="263.229" data-end="264.91">the implication is always there it's</span> <span data-start="264.91" data-end="267.699">there when we ask what front end means</span> <span data-start="267.699" data-end="270.52">or doesn't mean it's there when we ask</span> <span data-start="270.52" data-end="272.77">you know which coding language should I</span> <span data-start="272.77"
