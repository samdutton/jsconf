<p><span data-start="0.16" data-end="1.16">CSS Algorithms</span> <span data-start="1.16" data-end="5.379">Lara Schenck KATIE: Hello. Hi. Oh, all right. How is everybody</span> <span data-start="5.379" data-end="7.319">doing? Yeah? Whoo! I know we're all hungry. But this is our last talk before lunch. And</span> <span data-start="7.319" data-end="8.42">I think it's gonna be an amazing one. We have Lara Schenck here to talk to us about CSS</span> <span data-start="8.42" data-end="9.44">algorithms. And so, Lara's fun fact that she gave me is that she grew up on a llama farm</span> <span data-start="9.44" data-end="10.44">in rural Pennsylvania, very small town. And I asked her, well, can you tell me some cool</span> <span data-start="10.44" data-end="11.44">things about llamas that people wouldn't necessarily know about in their everyday life that's llama</span> <span data-start="11.44" data-end="12.44">free. At 4H competitions, there's a bunch of llama categories that you can enter. So,</span> <span data-start="12.44" data-end="13.53">llamas can do agility runs. Kind of like, you know, you've seen the dogs that jump over</span> <span data-start="13.53" data-end="14.53">hurdles and they go in between poles. That was not her specialty, though. Her specialty</span> <span data-start="14.53" data-end="15.53">was the llama costume category. Where you dress up yourself and you dress up your llama.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="15.53" data-end="16.53">And she won a blue ribbon for her rendition of she was the tinman and the llama was the</span> <span data-start="16.53" data-end="17.53">cowardly lion. And she said there's probably a picture of this somewhere so I'm going to</span> <span data-start="17.53" data-end="18.53">really encourage her to have her parents take a picture and send it to us so we can go and</span> <span data-start="18.53" data-end="19.53">find it later and see a picture of her prize winning llama costume. All right. So, let's</span> <span data-start="19.53" data-end="20.53">give it up for Lara Schenck. Take care. [ Applause ]</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="20.53" data-end="21.53"><span class="speaker">Lara</span>: Hey, everybody. Wouldn't it be great if I want in a tinman costume? Yeah, I don't</span> <span data-start="21.53" data-end="22.53">know how I'm gonna follow that story with my talk. I wasn't really prepared. Yeah. Welcome</span> <span data-start="22.53" data-end="23.53">to my talk. CSS algorithms. I'm really excited to be giving this to a room full of people</span> <span data-start="23.53" data-end="27.27">at a JavaScript conference. And the best thing is I have met so many great people that, oh,</span> <span data-start="27.27" data-end="36.44">I'm giving a talk to my new friends. Isn't that nice? Nasty, friends, before we get started</span> <span data-start="36.44" data-end="43.41">talking about CSS algorithms, we have to answer a very important question. Is CSS a programming</span> <span data-start="43.41" data-end="46.35">language? Fire emoji. [ Laughter ]</span> <span data-start="46.35" data-end="54.61">How many of you have seen this question where there's related drama about this topic on</span> <span data-start="54.61" data-end="61.1">Twitter over the last year or so? Yeah? Okay. Depends how many people use Twitter, I guess.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="61.1" data-end="66.211">I do have a question. Like, does this drama come up in real life also, or is it mostly</span> <span data-start="66.211" data-end="70.8">contained to Twitter? Anyways, we have to answer this question before we talk about</span> <span data-start="70.8" data-end="78.12">algorithms. So, I asked this question on Twitter. First in March of 2018 before I gave version</span> <span data-start="78.12" data-end="84.33">1 of this talk. This is on 3.5.1 now I believe. Is CSS a programming language? What did Twitter</span> <span data-start="84.33" data-end="94.46">think in 2018? Any guesses? No. So\h but it's pretty split. 42% yes, 50% no, 8% I'm not</span> <span data-start="94.46" data-end="102.52">sure. Not a huge dataset, 129 votes. But the answers to kind of the responses in the comments</span> <span data-start="102.52" data-end="106.65">are very varied. So, it was either like, yes, absolutely. Or, of course it's a programming</span> <span data-start="106.65" data-end="112.36">language. Or, I don't really consider CSS programming. Or you can't call styling a web</span> <span data-start="112.36" data-end="117.09">page programming. It's not really a programming language. And things like that. So, after</span> <span data-start="117.09" data-end="123.36">I gave this talk a little bit, before I started giving it again this year, May of 2019 I asked</span> <span data-start="123.36" data-end="127.17">this question again. And I was like, nobody is going to answer. Okay, Lara, we see what</span> <span data-start="127.17" data-end="132.41">you're doing. We saw your talk. Okay. No. This time\h</span> <span data-start="132.41" data-end="138.61">[ Laughter ] This time the poll had 5324 votes, which is</span> <span data-start="138.61" data-end="143.52">definitely the most activity I've had on a Tweet before. And the noes increased. I was</span> <span data-start="143.52" data-end="148.28">like, what's happening? What's going on? And not only were the same kind of varied responses</span> <span data-start="148.28" data-end="152.69">in the comments, but there were also people that kind of specialize in HTML and CSS that</span> <span data-start="152.69" data-end="157.84">were saying that I never call myself a programmer. And things like, why are we concerned about</span> <span data-start="157.84" data-end="162.36">what CSS is? We should be concerned about what it's doing, et cetera. And things like</span> <span data-start="162.36" data-end="171.72">stop asking this question. Don't wake the beast. So, stop. Like, everybody, stop. We</span> <span data-start="171.72" data-end="174.86">have to answer a different question before we talk about is CSS a programming language.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="174.86" data-end="178.72">What is a programming language? Before we decide whether or not CSS is one of these</span> <span data-start="178.72" data-end="184.51">things so, not surprisingly, there are many fields of research and people have dedicated</span> <span data-start="184.51" data-end="190.68">their entire careers to answering this question. And we can't be really specific about what</span> <span data-start="190.68" data-end="195.35">a programming language is because there are so many types of programming languages. So,</span> <span data-start="195.35" data-end="198.67">the definition kind of boils down to there are lots of different ones. But could boil</span> <span data-start="198.67" data-end="204.38">down to a formal language for instructing computer to perform tasks. This is Wikipedia</span> <span data-start="204.38" data-end="208.31">and several others. Some good articles out there. The important part here is language.</span> <span data-start="208.31" data-end="213.81">It's a language. And there are different types of programming languages. And these kind of</span> <span data-start="213.81" data-end="218.84">fall under the categories of programming paradigms. And we use programming paradigms to both describe</span> <span data-start="218.84" data-end="225.02">languages themselves as well as the style of code that we write. So, the two main paradigms</span> <span data-start="225.02" data-end="231.22">are imperative which is code that describes\h code that tells a computer how to accomplish</span> <span data-start="231.22" data-end="237.599">a task. And declarative. Where you tell a computer what to do. So, the language\h the</span> <span data-start="237.599" data-end="242.1">expressions in the language are saying what, not how. And the main difference is the presence</span> <span data-start="242.1" data-end="246.52">and absence of control flow. And so, control flow is the ability to manipulate the order</span> <span data-start="246.52" data-end="250.74">of executions of statements in a program. So, control structures like if statements,</span> <span data-start="250.74" data-end="256.601">for loops, imperative languages have these, declarative do not. Any logic is baked into</span> <span data-start="256.601" data-end="263.2">the statement itself. What are some examples of these programming languages? Hmm m.. imperative</span> <span data-start="263.2" data-end="269.15">languages. JavaScript, of course. Ruby, C + +, Python. These are what we usually think</span> <span data-start="269.15" data-end="273.63">of when we think of programming languages. Often times general purpose languages. Declarative</span> <span data-start="273.63" data-end="280.47">languages are often, not always, domain specific. They are built to function within a certain</span> <span data-start="280.47" data-end="292.52">context. What are some domain specific declarative programming languages? SQL. It is a declarative</span> <span data-start="292.52" data-end="297.05">for data bastes. HTML, adding meaning around content on a web page, CSS for styling the</span> <span data-start="297.05" data-end="304.03">content on that web page. Loud and clear. CSS is a domain specific declarative programming</span> <span data-start="304.03" data-end="314.78">language. 100%. CSS developers program the layout of web pages. boxes. Let's be honest.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="314.78" data-end="324.669">Everything is a box. CSS programmers are box programmers. Also 100%. Okay. So, cool. Like,</span> <span data-start="324.669" data-end="332.639">great. Like, maybe I can win a Twitter argument at some point. Good job. Why do we care about</span> <span data-start="332.639" data-end="337.07">this? Why do we care if CSS is a programming language or not? So, I want to talk about</span> <span data-start="337.07" data-end="348.91">something called Turd\hdriven development. Of course this is a rift on test driven development,</span> <span data-start="348.91" data-end="357.6">one simple in both is all code is crap the first time you write if. It is not possible</span> <span data-start="357.6" data-end="362.79">for a human being to write perfect code the first time you write it. So, in test driven</span> <span data-start="362.79" data-end="368.49">development, you kind of counter this by starting, instead of writing in production code, write</span> <span data-start="368.49" data-end="375.02">a failing test first. In CSS, we don't really have this kind of testing. You can kind of</span> <span data-start="375.02" data-end="381.08">say the test is the design. It's like, okay. This is why am I failing tests? Yes, I see</span> <span data-start="381.08" data-end="385.88">it. It doesn't exist yet. So, yes, the test is failing. Run the test with our eyes. What</span> <span data-start="385.88" data-end="392.46">do we do? We write code to make the test pass. So, all code is crap at first. We write some</span> <span data-start="392.46" data-end="400.41">crap CSS. And then what happens? We stop. Okay? The CSS, it's done. I don't have to</span> <span data-start="400.41" data-end="406.889">write anymore. Oh, wait, the test is failing. There was a change to the UI. Some new feature.</span> <span data-start="406.889" data-end="412.759">The test is failing now. What do we do? We write more CSS. The test is passing. Oh, wait,</span> <span data-start="412.759" data-end="418.03">maybe there was a regression. So, now our test is failing again. So, we write more CSS.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="418.03" data-end="427.95">Okay, whew, don't touch it, erg is working. And then we wait. And, oh, wait, new feature.</span> <span data-start="427.95" data-end="436.14">More CSS. Test is passing, oh, no, another regression. More CSS. And so on. Wait\h here</span> <span data-start="436.14" data-end="443.71">we go. Oh, wow, what's happening. Our tests no longer completely passes. And this is what</span> <span data-start="443.71" data-end="448.1">happens. But the problem is this is the web. This is the frontend of our web applications.</span> <span data-start="448.1" data-end="452.601">This is what People use. And this doesn't just apply to CSS as a language. But also</span> <span data-start="452.601" data-end="458.2">HTML and also JavaScript. It's kind of this culture of how we program. So, what do we</span> <span data-start="458.2" data-end="468.02">do? Ah! Oooo! This is so bad! It's so bad! All this crap everywhere. What do we do? Stop</span> <span data-start="468.02" data-end="476.76">writing CSS. Start programming. Okay. So, the thing is, programming does not equal logic,</span> <span data-start="476.76" data-end="481.52">math, science, engineering. These things can be part of programming. But programming in</span> <span data-start="481.52" data-end="487.67">its essence as an art, as a craft, is writing instructions for computers that other developers</span> <span data-start="487.67" data-end="493.55">are able to read and maintain. And I think if anything shows that CSS is a programming</span> <span data-start="493.55" data-end="498.77">language, it's that naming is really hard and extremely important. Naming is one of</span> <span data-start="498.77" data-end="504.259">the hardest problems in computer science CSS is part of that story. Unless you're writing</span> <span data-start="504.259" data-end="512.74">CSS in JavaScript. Okay. Okay. So, cool, we got if. We've covered a lot of ground so far.</span> <span data-start="512.74" data-end="517.12">Now let's talk about algorithms. Now that CSS is a programming language, how do we write</span> <span data-start="517.12" data-end="524.8">algorithms in this programming language? Hm. Algorithms 1013 let's have another definition.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="524.8" data-end="528.889">An algorithm, a well Defined computational procedure that takes</span> <span data-start="528.889" data-end="535.769">input and produces output. This is from Thomas Cormen who wrote the book, the introduction</span> <span data-start="535.769" data-end="540.459">to algorithms that is assigned in many the computer science course. I read the introduction.</span> <span data-start="540.459" data-end="546.85">[ Laughter ] Might revisit. Okay. So, a well defined computational</span> <span data-start="546.85" data-end="553.019">procedure. Input and output. Let's use this little board to help us visualize. Common</span> <span data-start="553.019" data-end="560.779">use for an algorithm, sorting. We have a list of unsorted numbers. Our algorithm, the output,</span> <span data-start="560.779" data-end="566.779">our algorithm should transform that input into sorted output. Hm. What are some sorting</span> <span data-start="566.779" data-end="573.38">algorithms? I know this crowd probably knows some sorting algorithms. Bubble sort. Selection</span> <span data-start="573.38" data-end="585.05">sort. MergeSort, quickSort. And could go on, but we'll keep it at that. Okay. What does</span> <span data-start="585.05" data-end="593.94">an implementation of a sorting algorithm look like? Name that sorting algorithm. Bubblesort.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="593.94" data-end="601.79">This is imperative JavaScript. Cool. That's fine. If this was declarative code, it would</span> <span data-start="601.79" data-end="606.839">be\hsecured behind the source. We're telling not, not telling the computer how to do it.</span> <span data-start="606.839" data-end="617.279">What about another kind of algorithm? So, how could this possibly apply to boxes? Okay.</span> <span data-start="617.279" data-end="623.689">So, our input is a stack of unsorted, unstyled boxes. And our output, we want this to be</span> <span data-start="623.689" data-end="631.24">a row of boxes. What kind of algorithm happens in between? Well, display: Flex, absolutely.</span> <span data-start="631.24" data-end="634.36">float: Left. Gasp! [ Laughter ]</span> <span data-start="634.36" data-end="646.42">How dare we? Yes. Floats still have their place in this day and age. Okay. What is an</span> <span data-start="646.42" data-end="652.04">implementation of these algorithms look like? Well, this is what we see. This is declarative</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="652.04" data-end="659.72">CSS. There's a big huge algorithm under the surface, but display: Flex is all we have</span> <span data-start="659.72" data-end="669.439">to write. If we expand on this, this is what declarative logic looks like, what, not how.</span> <span data-start="669.439" data-end="675.67">And under the surface, this is what's happening. This is a little snippet of Rust code from</span> <span data-start="675.67" data-end="685.05">the experimental rendering engine called servo being pulled into gecko in Firefox. And this</span> <span data-start="685.05" data-end="692.85">is where the wrap is happening. There's an imperative backbone to any code in CSS. Let's</span> <span data-start="692.85" data-end="699.999">have a iceberg metaphor. Love a good iceberg metaphor. We have CSS on the top and imperative</span> <span data-start="699.999" data-end="705.259">code on the bottom. Oh, my god, so many browsers in here. They are complicated.</span> <span data-start="705.259" data-end="718.949">can we call the CSS algorithms? Hm? Algorithm? Why not? So, let's go on the premise of all</span> <span data-start="718.949" data-end="724.98">the work I have been doing. What happens when we call that an algorithm? How far can we</span> <span data-start="724.98" data-end="733.06">take this? Let's update algorithms 101 to CSS algorithms 101. Domain specific, declarative.</span> <span data-start="733.06" data-end="741.91">These are magic words for CSS. And in term little of a word like algorithm or any kind</span> <span data-start="741.91" data-end="748.111">of analogy to general programming, it's by definition going to be different in CSS, domain</span> <span data-start="748.111" data-end="755.07">specific, declarative, you have to understand the domain to use these. A definition, a CSS</span> <span data-start="755.07" data-end="759.459">algorithm is a well defined declaration or set of declarations that produces a specific</span> <span data-start="759.459" data-end="770.529">styling output. Me. So, key points here. Well defined and specific. An algorithm is not</span> <span data-start="770.529" data-end="778.3">a block of however long a set of declarations can get. But you're solving a specific problem.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="778.3" data-end="784.449">And I also think an algorithm is when CSS goes from being this mundane styling language</span> <span data-start="784.449" data-end="791.389">like font size, color, whatever, to something where you're like, whoa! CSS! Like, what's</span> <span data-start="791.389" data-end="796.149">happening? This is so cool. And you kind of appreciate the fact that you don't need to</span> <span data-start="796.149" data-end="801.139">write so much code because the language is doing it. We can understand the language and</span> <span data-start="801.139" data-end="806.259">understand how to communicate with the browser. So, you know what this notion is. This well</span> <span data-start="806.259" data-end="810.3">defined set of declarations. So, as I was thinking, I was like, okay. I'm going to pick</span> <span data-start="810.3" data-end="814.519">out some common algorithms that people would recognize. And the first one I thought of</span> <span data-start="814.519" data-end="824.309">was this. Clearfix. So, oh, god, sad face. Like, that's a hack. Clearfix is not a fun</span> <span data-start="824.309" data-end="835.23">algorithm. Could be an algorithm. Okay. What about this?</span> <span data-start="835.23" data-end="840.769">[ Laughter ] So, this is a very long class name and not</span> <span data-start="840.769" data-end="845.67">actually the name of the class. But you get the idea. And this is very amazing and elegant</span> <span data-start="845.67" data-end="850.689">that you can do this. Let's say you have an element way out here. Positioned relatively.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="850.689" data-end="856.239">You can\h no matter how far it's nested in\h nested into that, that child you can kind</span> <span data-start="856.239" data-end="861.66">of pop out of that whole DOM structure and stick it to the top right, bottom right, whatever.</span> <span data-start="861.66" data-end="866.17">That's cool. Positioning. It's cool. Spaced content. Has anybody used this before? It's</span> <span data-start="866.17" data-end="872.41">kind of a selector pattern. Lobotomized owl. Someone named Heydon Pickering came up with</span> <span data-start="872.41" data-end="881.889">this. This is a way of spacing content with another content without adding to the top</span> <span data-start="881.889" data-end="888.48">and bottom. This one I like. It's kind of a fluid typography. So, we use a viewport</span> <span data-start="888.48" data-end="895.009">unit to make the size of the text element more fluid. And this is a linear interpolation.</span> <span data-start="895.009" data-end="903.67">Math. Cool. So, yes, that's grid. Oh, my god. These two lines of code, we can make so many</span> <span data-start="903.67" data-end="907.559">grids. Add a couple of spans in there and this is the most robust grid framework you'll</span> <span data-start="907.559" data-end="915.889">ever need. It's not a framework. It's just code. Oh, my god, so great. So, CSS algorithm,</span> <span data-start="915.889" data-end="924.279">a well defined declaration or set of declarations. Specific styling pattern. I haven't updated</span> <span data-start="924.279" data-end="933.16">it. A CSS algorithm is a utility pattern that lets the browser algorithms do the work. And</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="933.16" data-end="939.089">I think a CSS algorithm also follows some programming best practices. So, a single responsibility</span> <span data-start="939.089" data-end="945.19">principle. Let's say we have a set of kitchen tools. So, the wooden spoon is so good at</span> <span data-start="945.19" data-end="950.609">being a spoon. The whisk is great at being a whisk. Spatula is great at being a spatula,</span> <span data-start="950.609" data-end="957.949">knife, knife, et cetera. What happens when a tool tries to do too much?</span> <span data-start="957.949" data-end="961.759">[ Laughter ] Sad. This is a spork. A spork. I'm sorry,</span> <span data-start="961.759" data-end="967.029">spork, but you're just trying to do too much. It's not that useful. People aren't that excited</span> <span data-start="967.029" data-end="973.529">about sporks. Although there is a restaurant in Pittsburgh named Spork. Why did you do</span> <span data-start="973.529" data-end="979.92">that? Anyways. Small, well named functions. This was a good programming practice. How</span> <span data-start="979.92" data-end="987.699">small should your function be? Small. And then smaller than that. So, these are the</span> <span data-start="987.699" data-end="994.009">words of Robert C. Martin in a book called Clean Code. He's kind of one of the inventors</span> <span data-start="994.009" data-end="998.929">of a lot of agile software development practices. Okay. This is all well and good. What about</span> <span data-start="998.929" data-end="1005.559">in the real world? You're probably not writing the next Clearfix. So, I work as a design</span> <span data-start="1005.559" data-end="1010.279">engineer at a company called Penske Media Corporation, PMC. We're a big publisher with</span> <span data-start="1010.279" data-end="1017.959">24, I think, different very large brands all on WordPress sites which is exciting. This</span> <span data-start="1017.959" data-end="1023.769">enterprise WordPress environment. Sometimes I call myself a design Ops engineer. I love</span> <span data-start="1023.769" data-end="1032.579">my job. So, give it some hearts. These words also equate to UI engineer. Also, the design</span> <span data-start="1032.579" data-end="1042.04">systems at PMC. Also, the first and only frontend developer in team of many backend developers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1042.04" data-end="1047.85">However, not anymore. We hired another frontend developer recently and I see that as a major</span> <span data-start="1047.85" data-end="1052.46">sign of success. Yes, a company that went so long without frontend developers now has</span> <span data-start="1052.46" data-end="1058.92">two. This is cool. This is like, yes. PMC cares about frontend. So, my work has revolved</span> <span data-start="1058.92" data-end="1067.97">around the development of a design system called Larva. Yes, it is called\h our design</span> <span data-start="1067.97" data-end="1074.01">system is called Larva. And it is an embryonic design system. It's a good name for it. It's</span> <span data-start="1074.01" data-end="1079.85">a little baby. It's not this beautiful UI library of components. But it's tools and</span> <span data-start="1079.85" data-end="1085.96">best practices to build modules and comments. Embryonic. This is a laboratory to try out</span> <span data-start="1085.96" data-end="1092.13">all these ideas, what is an algorithm? How does this work? So, Larva was built inside</span> <span data-start="1092.13" data-end="1100.83">of a project from a site called deadline. And this is a WordPress theme. Kind of the</span> <span data-start="1100.83" data-end="1109.86">base file structure here. And then drilling into a source directory. This is an IT CSS</span> <span data-start="1109.86" data-end="1115.26">architecture. Triangle CSS. I added at the beginning of the project a directory for algorithms.</span> <span data-start="1115.26" data-end="1122.411">I was like, will this be useful? Would this\h will we actually add anything to this? And</span> <span data-start="1122.411" data-end="1126.69">yes, there were like 20 something algorithms in here afterwards. So, kind of proved to</span> <span data-start="1126.69" data-end="1131.7">be this useful naming convention and useful way to think about styles. And since this</span> <span data-start="1131.7" data-end="1137.51">project completed, the process has been like moving all of this code into a shared repo.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1137.51" data-end="1142.41">So, project structure that might be familiar to some is the monorepo structures. This is</span> <span data-start="1142.41" data-end="1151.111">like Laravel 1.0 and these are npm packages. We have kind of the CSS npm package. Inside</span> <span data-start="1151.111" data-end="1155.481">one of these algorithms, a glue, which is a pretty weird name for a style. There's a</span> <span data-start="1155.481" data-end="1163.16">SaaS file, or a CSS file. And an HTML file to give an example of what the markup is.</span> <span data-start="1163.16" data-end="1170.57">And a glue is this algorithm. But we've kind of turned it like design systemed it to be</span> <span data-start="1170.57" data-end="1174.61">more reusable and a little more robust. So, it has different namespacing and we use the</span> <span data-start="1174.61" data-end="1182">term glue because it's a nice mental model for what it does. Glue a UI element within</span> <span data-start="1182" data-end="1190.32">another UI element. And this was used like 15 times in the deadline project. Not only</span> <span data-start="1190.32" data-end="1195.72">by me. Mostly not by me, in fact. So, there was another contractor who was like a little</span> <span data-start="1195.72" data-end="1201.01">more junior and they understand what this did. Whoa, this is a cool way to communicate</span> <span data-start="1201.01" data-end="1206.71">the CSS concepts that might be a little hard to understand at first. Another algorithm,</span> <span data-start="1206.71" data-end="1216.37">space children. Whoo\h space children. So, this is the lobotomized owl. And design systemed,</span> <span data-start="1216.37" data-end="1221.61">this looks like this. So, I could have some progressive enhancement inside this algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1221.61" data-end="1226.43">It's kind of pulling this functionality into its own little node. Into its own little section.</span> <span data-start="1226.43" data-end="1231.27">We can do really interesting things. So, column gap is a new property in some browsers and</span> <span data-start="1231.27" data-end="1238.36">we can add this feature query inside the algorithm. In markup, this is what it look like. So,</span> <span data-start="1238.36" data-end="1244.41">pretty heavy use of utility classes. And the algorithms are kind of layered in among the</span> <span data-start="1244.41" data-end="1253.95">other class names. Like an onion. But algorithms can also be useful for stuff like this. So,</span> <span data-start="1253.95" data-end="1260.97">if you've ever got an design and you're like, god damn it. This is a really pretty border.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1260.97" data-end="1267.47">But this is a very annoying thing. Why do I have to develop this? So, you can be like,</span> <span data-start="1267.47" data-end="1271.851">I'm gonna pull this out and I'm just gonna write this border. This border code. And if</span> <span data-start="1271.851" data-end="1281.96">it shows up in one design, it's probably going to show up in another one. So, an algorithm</span> <span data-start="1281.96" data-end="1288.47">can be a nice way of handling that. Okay. How to write a CSS algorithm or realize you</span> <span data-start="1288.47" data-end="1294.52">don't need to. How to write algorithms? How you write an algorithm in an algorithm interview?</span> <span data-start="1294.52" data-end="1302.14">Has anybody done a whiteboarding interview or an algorithms interview? A few? Yeah. No</span> <span data-start="1302.14" data-end="1304.11">more comments. [ Laughter ]</span> <span data-start="1304.11" data-end="1308.63">Okay. So, the steps. These are kind of taken straight out of cracking the coding interview.</span> <span data-start="1308.63" data-end="1314.09">Plan your algorithm. Then you run a brute force solution. A not optimized version that</span> <span data-start="1314.09" data-end="1319.75">steps through piece by piece. Slow, but maybe it works. And then you do a walkthrough in</span> <span data-start="1319.75" data-end="1325.28">the interview to make sure the algorithm is functioning and then optimize it. Layer different</span> <span data-start="1325.28" data-end="1330.5">optimization techniques. What about writing CSS algorithms? Well, you start by planning.</span> <span data-start="1330.5" data-end="1337.61">Planning out the algorithm. Then you write brute force solution that's not quite optimized</span> <span data-start="1337.61" data-end="1343.39">and walkthrough. Same thing. Except there's some pre work when you're writing a CSS algorithm</span> <span data-start="1343.39" data-end="1352.7">which is doing a turd check. So, you'd stop before you write any CSS and say to yourself,</span> <span data-start="1352.7" data-end="1357.01">should I actually be writing new CSS? Like, what is going on? Have I solved this problem</span> <span data-start="1357.01" data-end="1362.65">before somewhere in this codebase and why can I not use that again? So, just a quick</span> <span data-start="1362.65" data-end="1367.46">moment to be like, wait, is this really the problem I should be solve something and then</span> <span data-start="1367.46" data-end="1374.31">you plan. Pseudo code and boxes. Pseudo coding CSS and defining your problem. What is this</span> <span data-start="1374.31" data-end="1379.47">thing you're having a hard time with that you need to solve? On paper, I love drawing</span> <span data-start="1379.47" data-end="1386.001">boxes on paper. I love to do other things too. But sometimes this is really fun. Also</span> <span data-start="1386.001" data-end="1390.96">because writing things on paper and like whiteboarding, there's research that shows we have better\h</span> <span data-start="1390.96" data-end="1395.22">human beings have better retention when you're doing things in physical space like that versus</span> <span data-start="1395.22" data-end="1400.22">drawing boxes in Illustrator, et cetera. Also, printing out the design and marking it up</span> <span data-start="1400.22" data-end="1403.82">in that way could be really useful. Figure out what\h if you're working with an existing</span> <span data-start="1403.82" data-end="1408.63">system, what patterns are already provided. What do you need to write new? And a brute</span> <span data-start="1408.63" data-end="1415.3">force solution. Spaghetti, write gross code, that's fine. And remember the assumption,</span> <span data-start="1415.3" data-end="1420.68">all code is crap at first. Don't write it in the actual stylesheet. Write it somewhere</span> <span data-start="1420.68" data-end="1429.3">else. Instead of inside the main application, you could have a separate file. This recent</span> <span data-start="1429.3" data-end="1435.94">project I was having a file called scratch pat.scss that was added to a test environment,</span> <span data-start="1435.94" data-end="1441.46">not to an actual application. It was a safe space to try out the CSS. This is what it</span> <span data-start="1441.46" data-end="1447.46">ends up looking like. Working with boxes. CodePen is like a product for this specific</span> <span data-start="1447.46" data-end="1454.07">use case. For writing frontend code outside of a regular environment. And this is a\h</span> <span data-start="1454.07" data-end="1460.84">the little border arc. Our story border arc from before. So, do a walkthrough. We love</span> <span data-start="1460.84" data-end="1466.31">resizing our browsers. Web developers are like, yes. Not going to test it in a different</span> <span data-start="1466.31" data-end="1472.69">browser, but I'm gonna resize it a lot in this one. So, that's a walkthrough. But test</span> <span data-start="1472.69" data-end="1476.12">it in other browsers. And it's a lot easier to do that when it's a small piece. So, it's</span> <span data-start="1476.12" data-end="1483.24">easier to do it now. Ask yourself, is every declaration essential? Are there any dependencies?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1483.24" data-end="1488.43">Does this algorithm need to be applied with another class and why? And this you can have</span> <span data-start="1488.43" data-end="1494.94">a Robert C. Martin in the back of your head that's like smaller, smaller codes. And then</span> <span data-start="1494.94" data-end="1500.61">you can optimize and refactor and document. This is when the magic happens. When our poopy</span> <span data-start="1500.61" data-end="1509.9">code becomes a flower. Of course. This is how programming works, right? And this is</span> <span data-start="1509.9" data-end="1515.85">when you're moving that crap code, the fact that you need to move it into the actual codebase,</span> <span data-start="1515.85" data-end="1520.75">that refactoring will happen naturally. So, moving from this set of boxes to an actual</span> <span data-start="1520.75" data-end="1528.3">layout will improve your code. Document. So, inside our deadline program library we had</span> <span data-start="1528.3" data-end="1535.01">documents, a paragraph about what it's doing, how to use it. And then boxes. Show what it's</span> <span data-start="1535.01" data-end="1540.88">doing. So, I feel like this\h with this process\h turd driven development can kind of become</span> <span data-start="1540.88" data-end="1546.87">more like test driven development. With CSS? What? So, what if we had thought about it</span> <span data-start="1546.87" data-end="1552.08">like, oh, our test, instead of being the entire design, is a smaller piece of the design or</span> <span data-start="1552.08" data-end="1558.19">a specific piece. We run the test with our eyes still and write our crap code. But the</span> <span data-start="1558.19" data-end="1567.65">refactoring, putting it in the code, can give us that additional step of refactoring. Again,</span> <span data-start="1567.65" data-end="1578.88">a beautiful flower. Refactor the missing piece. Let's be real. But less looking poop is greater</span> <span data-start="1578.88" data-end="1585.95">than regular poop. But what if, so, this is a little experiment that's coming up here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1585.95" data-end="1590.11">What if\h so, test driven development. I have been writing tests for other parts of our</span> <span data-start="1590.11" data-end="1595.23">design system in JavaScript and I'm like, I love writing tests. There's some magic,</span> <span data-start="1595.23" data-end="1599.891">like straight up magic when you write good tests. And I want to do this with CSS. How</span> <span data-start="1599.891" data-end="1607.6">can we write unit tests for CSS? Domain specific declarative tests? I had an idea and wrote</span> <span data-start="1607.6" data-end="1616.54">enthusiastic blog posts about it. Testing algorithms. So, warning, this is a big code</span> <span data-start="1616.54" data-end="1621.01">slide and kind of a prototype of something I'm trying out with a little bit of client</span> <span data-start="1621.01" data-end="1636.02">side JavaScript. For one of the CSS unit tests, what it could look like. So, this is essentially</span> <span data-start="1636.02" data-end="1642.13">a couple of test methods that log to the console. And the crux is you're testing boxes against</span> <span data-start="1642.13" data-end="1647.66">boxes. So, you're figure out relative values of certain positions and boxes and comparing</span> <span data-start="1647.66" data-end="1653.48">them. And what this looks like in practice. The unit test might be with the minimum amount</span> <span data-start="1653.48" data-end="1660.3">of HTML. And we're logging into the console. But this could also be an integration test</span> <span data-start="1660.3" data-end="1666.32">on an actual application. I ordered this to the deadline staging environment and actually</span> <span data-start="1666.32" data-end="1671.23">found a problem with this. So, this showed me that there should not be space below the</span> <span data-start="1671.23" data-end="1675.12">last item. But there was a different set of styles that was adding that space, which is</span> <span data-start="1675.12" data-end="1679.38">incorrect. That will cause problems later because if someone adds another widget to</span> <span data-start="1679.38" data-end="1684.95">the side bar, it's gonna be too spaced out. And that's what cause this is like turd driven</span> <span data-start="1684.95" data-end="1689.07">development. Especially with CSS, oh, you override it instead of going back to change</span> <span data-start="1689.07" data-end="1696.71">the actual issue. Ah! This could be cool. So, my inner critic is like, overengineering</span> <span data-start="1696.71" data-end="1703.38">much, Lara? Like, why are you\h it's just CSS, jeez. My god. But then I'm like, no.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1703.38" data-end="1709.76">That's the kind of thinking that causes turd driven development. Say no to that. It's okay</span> <span data-start="1709.76" data-end="1714.48">to think about CSS like this. And in fact like the rest of software has come up with</span> <span data-start="1714.48" data-end="1720.12">many an antidote to turds. So, general software on this end is kind of like, whoa, look at</span> <span data-start="1720.12" data-end="1725.5">all these things we do to control our code. To create better environments and develop</span> <span data-start="1725.5" data-end="1730.76">better programming practices. And then on the other side we have frontend and UI that</span> <span data-start="1730.76" data-end="1736.48">has a lot of these things as well. So, design systems, atomic design, progressive enhancement.</span> <span data-start="1736.48" data-end="1742.75">Many a CSS architecture and naming convention. And maybe these things are not that different.</span> <span data-start="1742.75" data-end="1750.8">So, there's a lot of the same concepts that bridge these\h these two kind of areas that</span> <span data-start="1750.8" data-end="1760.74">could seem separate. But testing. I think we could do more of this. Okay. Conclusion.</span> <span data-start="1760.74" data-end="1770.66">I'll tell a small story time. Okay. How the math hater became a programmer. This is me.</span> <span data-start="1770.66" data-end="1780.43">14 year old Lara in 2003. I hate math. Okay? I was a staunch math hater throughout my childhood.</span> <span data-start="1780.43" data-end="1786.39">I loved art class and horses and llamas. But at the age of 14 I was starting to become</span> <span data-start="1786.39" data-end="1791.77">a little bit anti llama and just kind of embarrassed about that. But I loved art class and horses</span> <span data-start="1791.77" data-end="1800.09">and Green Day. Which I didn't put up there. 2009. A little bit larger Lara. I had some</span> <span data-start="1800.09" data-end="1805.52">blond in my hair and glasses. I was in college. 20 years old? Art school and I had a weird</span> <span data-start="1805.52" data-end="1810.27">idea for a video game and learned how to code. I had a lot of freedom in school and very</span> <span data-start="1810.27" data-end="1818.18">supportive parents. And then fast forward to 2015. I had been working as a freelance</span> <span data-start="1818.18" data-end="1823.48">developer for a while and I wrote this article for CSS Tricks. Tales of a non unicorn: A</span> <span data-start="1823.48" data-end="1829.7">story about the trouble with job titles and descriptions. This was about a role, the UI</span> <span data-start="1829.7" data-end="1837.52">engineer/interaction designer. And I was like, yes, this is totally my thing. CSS, maybe</span> <span data-start="1837.52" data-end="1842.62">some design, some like UI oriented JavaScript. And in the interview they asked me FizzBuzz.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1842.62" data-end="1849.91">And FizzBuzz, for anybody unfamiliar, is sort of this beginner's algorithms question. And</span> <span data-start="1849.91" data-end="1855.51">in the interview I was like, what? Why would anybody do this? I had been so far removed</span> <span data-start="1855.51" data-end="1862.559">from what this algorithm in computer as someone self taught from an art background. And after</span> <span data-start="1862.559" data-end="1869.621">I wrote this article, which became a little bit viral, there was a post on Reddit. Designer</span> <span data-start="1869.621" data-end="1877.309">applies for JS job, fails at FizzBuzz, then proceeds to write 5 page rant about job descriptions.</span> <span data-start="1877.309" data-end="1883.75">I was like, whoa. This was on the front page. There were all these horrible comments coming</span> <span data-start="1883.75" data-end="1890.8">into the article. Like, awful stuff. And sob, after this experience from like 2015 to 2017,</span> <span data-start="1890.8" data-end="1896.36">I was like, oh, hell no. Like, I am not a programmer. Computer science is not what I</span> <span data-start="1896.36" data-end="1901.41">do. I do HTML and CSS. Computer science, not for me. Programming, not what I do. Who are</span> <span data-start="1901.41" data-end="1908.54">these people? No thanks. I had like these two years of rebellion against that kind of</span> <span data-start="1908.54" data-end="1914.17">identity. And late 2017 I ended up getting an interview for a job I was super excited</span> <span data-start="1914.17" data-end="1920.55">about that was going to be an algorithms interview. No question about it. Okay. I have to learn</span> <span data-start="1920.55" data-end="1924.46">this. Swallow my pride, FizzBuzz, let's do it. I wrote all these blog posts and put myself</span> <span data-start="1924.46" data-end="1930.721">through computer science boot camp. And I was like, wait a second, this is for me. This</span> <span data-start="1930.721" data-end="1938.91">is cool. I love this stuff. And it's not so different than the concepts in HTML and CSS.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1938.91" data-end="1948.05">And in 2018 I proposed this original talk of algorithms of CSS for CSS ConfEU to bridge</span> <span data-start="1948.05" data-end="1953.81">the gap between CSS and computer science. And throughout that talk, CSS\h something</span> <span data-start="1953.81" data-end="1959.22">I knew well before\h kind of went from like CSS to like, wow. I understand what CSS is</span> <span data-start="1959.22" data-end="1965.96">doing. Like, this is freaking amazing. I love CSS. And I realized that this is kind of the</span> <span data-start="1965.96" data-end="1971.91">wrong metaphor. It's not like this. It's like this. So, computer science is like the big</span> <span data-start="1971.91" data-end="1976.51">like, you know, mom giving everyone a hug. All these nice things in here. So, CSS, they're</span> <span data-start="1976.51" data-end="1985.01">all together. So, to put a button on this. Here is FizzBuzz in CSS.</span> <span data-start="1985.01" data-end="1996.23">[ Applause ] Okay. Okay. 2019. Is blank a blank? Is CSS</span> <span data-start="1996.23" data-end="2003.309">a programming language? This is like a fucked up question structure. Because you can sub</span> <span data-start="2003.309" data-end="2011.09">out the terms and have like is depression a treatable illness? Is non binary a gender?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2011.09" data-end="2017.4">When you ask a question like this, it's opening up the option for people to say no, when as</span> <span data-start="2017.4" data-end="2022.08">soon as you start excluding something from something else, that's a sign of much darker</span> <span data-start="2022.08" data-end="2029.01">stuff. So, this is a smelly question. This is a culture smell. The answer is, of course.</span> <span data-start="2029.01" data-end="2037.19">So, I'm like, what is going on? Why is this happen something why are there designers designing</span> <span data-start="2037.19" data-end="2041.86">systems at companies, but they can't have anybody from the engineering team implement</span> <span data-start="2041.86" data-end="2049.19">them because HTML and CSS are not considered part of engineering? Or why are there developers</span> <span data-start="2049.19" data-end="2054.23">coming from full stack bootcamps or presenting themselves as full stack developers who don't</span> <span data-start="2054.23" data-end="2059.7">understand fundamental characteristics of CSS? Is CSS not part of the stack anymore?</span> <span data-start="2059.7" data-end="2065.72">What's going on? I was describing this to someone at my coworking space, kind of an</span> <span data-start="2065.72" data-end="2074.19">old school computer science guide. His name is Dick. And why are there so many people</span> <span data-start="2074.19" data-end="2078.859">that don't think CSS is a programming language? What's going on? He said, well, Lara, when</span> <span data-start="2078.859" data-end="2083.839">it comes to computer science, and in computer science, there's an 800 pound gorilla in the</span> <span data-start="2083.839" data-end="2093.19">room and it's called a testosterone. And I was like, okay. Wow. Okay. So, maybe this</span> <span data-start="2093.19" data-end="2099.15">is the truth. Is this what\h like, okay. But I don't think the answer is to not talk about</span> <span data-start="2099.15" data-end="2104.099">it. So, when I see responses to this question, it's like, stop asking this question. Don't</span> <span data-start="2104.099" data-end="2107.859">talk about it. Questions like that can be good because it brings out what we need to</span> <span data-start="2107.859" data-end="2115.71">address. So, what if instead of, you know, people who know other types of programming</span> <span data-start="2115.71" data-end="2119.789">not learning HTML and CSS because they're not programming. I know programming. I don't</span> <span data-start="2119.789" data-end="2123.91">want to learn that, it's not my thing. And web applications suffering because of that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2123.91" data-end="2128.619">That's on one side. And we have people like me and I'm sure some people in this room who</span> <span data-start="2128.619" data-end="2134.519">were focused in HTML and CSS and told you're not a real programmer. And therefore you develop</span> <span data-start="2134.519" data-end="2142.859">this kind of oppositional identity, I'm not learning that. That was me. What if we do</span> <span data-start="2142.859" data-end="2151.44">this, CSS and HTML are this little golden springboard. You have little people like me,</span> <span data-start="2151.44" data-end="2157.63">little baby Lara, or people with non traditional backgrounds who don't necessarily have the</span> <span data-start="2157.63" data-end="2162.039">ability to go into computer science programs, et cetera. HTML and CSS can be this kind of</span> <span data-start="2162.039" data-end="2167.859">springboard into technology. And not just people that look like me. Of course, like</span> <span data-start="2167.859" data-end="2174.829">anybody can do this. And it's also kind of a metaphor for creativity. Because I'm not</span> <span data-start="2174.829" data-end="2179.539">that good at drawing people. I put a monster in it. It has to represent something. Creativity.</span> <span data-start="2179.539" data-end="2186.53">Let's have more creativity and honor technology teams. HTML and CSS, this golden springboard.</span> <span data-start="2186.53" data-end="2191.591">My question is, why aren't we valuing these skills more and embracing this technology?</span> <span data-start="2191.591" data-end="2192.591">Instead of this is not for you, saying, yes, you are a programmer. Come, learn more. Thank</span> <span data-start="2192.591" data-end="2193.591">you. [ Applause ]</span> </p>

All right. So, why is a seagull called a seagull?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2206.869" data-end="2207.869">Cause if it flew over a bay, it would be called a beagle.</span> <span data-start="2207.869" data-end="2208.869">[ Applause ] All right.
