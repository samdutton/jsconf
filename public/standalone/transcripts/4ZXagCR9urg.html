demo of auto sync let's talk</span> <span data-start="1281.769" data-end="1286.459">about translator and programmer workflow</span> <span data-start="1286.469" data-end="1289.269">try to always store the English</span> <span data-start="1289.269" data-end="1292.139">translation when you do your development</span> <span data-start="1292.139" data-end="1295.299">because then the translator can relate</span> <span data-start="1295.299" data-end="1297.779">to the English translation all the time</span> <span data-start="1297.779" data-end="1300.94">and let the translator learn about ICUs</span> <span data-start="1300.94" data-end="1303.519">message format because they will use in</span> <span data-start="1303.519" data-end="1306.969">any future product project and it's very</span> <span data-start="1306.969" data-end="1309.69">easy to learn eyes use message form and</span> <span data-start="1309.69" data-end="1312.82">have a web translation interface</span> <span data-start="1312.82" data-end="1317.769">available for them at all time to ease</span> <span data-start="1317.769" data-end="1320.619">your workflow let's talk about</span> <span data-start="1320.619" data-end="1325.149">translation key naming don't use English</span> <span data-start="1325.149" data-end="1328.749">text as translation keys because you</span> <span data-start="1328.749" data-end="1331.389">will have namespace issues and not it's</span> <span data-start="1331.389" data-end="1336.159">not future proof but I recommend instead</span> <span data-start="1336.159" data-end="1340.229">is defining a sort of content structure</span> <span data-start="1340.229" data-end="1343.509">you can see we have a facebook as an</span> <span data-start="1343.509" data-end="1346.929">example I just put the feed is in the</span> <span data-start="1346.929" data-end="1349.809">center and then we have a side menu here</span> <span data-start="1349.809" data-end="1354.219">and we namespace it with double</span> <span data-start="1354.219" data-end="1357.279">underscore we need space feed and then</span> <span data-start="1357.279" data-end="1360.969">the label name for side menu it's sign</span> <span data-start="1360.969" data-end="1363.779">menu underscore and then the label name</span> <span data-start="1363.779" data-end="1369.129">this makes it more scalable status</span> <span data-start="1369.129" data-end="1373.869">translation workflow so let's move on to</span> <span data-start="1373.869" data-end="1384.56">the launch I'll just CD into the project</span> <span data-start="1384.57" data-end="1397.21">and of type NPM publish and it will take</span> <span data-start="1397.21"
