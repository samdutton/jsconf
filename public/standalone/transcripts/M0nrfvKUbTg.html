data-end="163.81">knowledge will be transmitted so I'm</span> <span data-start="163.81" data-end="165.82">going to go over kind of myths and</span> <span data-start="165.82" data-end="168.07">truths of frameworks and specifically</span> <span data-start="168.07" data-end="170.26">client-side web frameworks and what that</span> <span data-start="170.26" data-end="175.08">means so there are a couple minutes that</span> <span data-start="175.08" data-end="176.83">that come up when you talk about</span> <span data-start="176.83" data-end="178.6">client-side frameworks and they mainly</span> <span data-start="178.6" data-end="181.21">revolve around like creation myths and</span> <span data-start="181.21" data-end="183.73">then like propagation myths like</span> <span data-start="183.73" data-end="186.1">creation myths as in how these things</span> <span data-start="186.1" data-end="188.02">sprain works came about and came into</span> <span data-start="188.02" data-end="190">being and propagation myths like how</span> <span data-start="190" data-end="191.47">they became popular and how why they</span> <span data-start="191.47" data-end="194.2">should be popular so probably the</span> <span data-start="194.2" data-end="197.67">biggest one is emitted extraction and</span> <span data-start="197.67" data-end="200.17">you know it's it's a real myth because</span> <span data-start="200.17" data-end="202.06">frameworks aren't like these immaculate</span> <span data-start="202.06" data-end="203.739">conceptions they're not like all of a</span> <span data-start="203.739" data-end="205.81">sudden there was an act and then out of</span> <span data-start="205.81" data-end="207.85">this app sprung this framework the</span> <span data-start="207.85" data-end="209.47">greatest framework that ever that was</span> <span data-start="209.47" data-end="214.75">ever created and the the you know the</span> <span data-start="214.75" data-end="217.47">most popular myth is probably rails and</span> <span data-start="217.47" data-end="221.98">or so Molina gave a talk at i think it</span> <span data-start="221.98" data-end="223.84">was scottish Ruby come two years ago</span> <span data-start="223.84" data-end="225.88">where he talked about kind of actually</span> <span data-start="225.88" data-end="229.39">went through all the in a very very</span> <span data-start="229.39" data-end="231.76">nerdy in like comic book guy way went</span> <span data-start="231.76" data-end="234.459">through all the the mailing list</span> <span data-start="234.459" data-end="237.55">archives of Ruby laying around the time</span> <span data-start="237.55" data-end="239.5">that rails was released and it was</span> <span data-start="239.5" data-end="241.66">really really obvious that base camp was</span> <span data-start="241.66" data-end="243.05">happening and rails</span> <span data-start="243.05" data-end="245.63">happening but it wasn't like base camp</span> <span data-start="245.63" data-end="247.52">and then pull the rails at a base camp</span> <span data-start="247.52" data-end="250.85">that just didn't happen they frameworks</span> <span data-start="250.85" data-end="252.41">grow they don't just spring out of</span> <span data-start="252.41" data-end="254.9">nothing and frameworks what they really</span> <span data-start="254.9" data-end="257.39">are like combinations of a couple things</span> <span data-start="257.39" data-end="261.59">abstractions like trying to pull common</span> <span data-start="261.59" data-end="264.98">things into abstract patterns that can</span> <span data-start="264.98" data-end="268.85">be reused tools like generators and</span> <span data-start="268.85" data-end="272.78">stuff like that patterns actual not not</span> <span data-start="272.78" data-end="276.59">forcing you into a pattern or or not the</span> <span data-start="276.59" data-end="277.79">abstractions of the patterns themselves</span> <span data-start="277.79" data-end="282.5">but just patterns like MVC and M vvvvvv</span> <span data-start="282.5" data-end="286.76">c and stuff like that also frameworks</span> <span data-start="286.76" data-end="288.17">can also be combinations of existing</span> <span data-start="288.17" data-end="291.14">frameworks and a lot of JavaScript</span> <span data-start="291.14" data-end="292.88">frameworks these days the bigger ones</span> <span data-start="292.88" data-end="295.31">are built on top of jQuery or combined</span> <span data-start="295.31" data-end="298.37">jquery and something else to make the</span> <span data-start="298.37" data-end="300.53">new framework what they also are</span> <span data-start="300.53" data-end="304.87">experiments in the framework that I</span> <span data-start="304.87" data-end="308.39">created in what really brings me here</span> <span data-start="308.39" data-end="311.06">today is Sammy J guess and Sammy jess</span> <span data-start="311.06" data-end="313.1">was really I'm not going to lie I didn't</span> <span data-start="313.1" data-end="315.8">extract it out of some awesome app that</span> <span data-start="315.8" data-end="317.36">i wrote it really was just an experiment</span> <span data-start="317.36" data-end="321.35">it was can we take something like</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="321.35" data-end="323.6">Sinatra which is a ruby framework that I</span> <span data-start="323.6" data-end="325.43">really loved and was super simple and</span> <span data-start="325.43" data-end="327.38">translated to the web and translated</span> <span data-start="327.38" data-end="331.52">into JavaScript so this is what a</span> <span data-start="331.52" data-end="332.84">Sinatra application looks like you don't</span> <span data-start="332.84" data-end="334.82">need to know Ruby to read this but</span> <span data-start="334.82" data-end="336.77">basically you define an app that's just</span> <span data-start="336.77" data-end="339.05">a you know a class that descends from</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="339.05" data-end="340.94">Sinatra application and you define a</span> <span data-start="340.94" data-end="343.52">route which is a path and then what</span> <span data-start="343.52" data-end="345.41">happens in that route where you render</span> <span data-start="345.41" data-end="347.78">the index temper it's really really</span> <span data-start="347.78" data-end="350.24">simple so this is what it looks like</span> <span data-start="350.24" data-end="352.49">insanity I mean the original original</span> <span data-start="352.49" data-end="354.62">sketches for Sammy were literally just a</span> <span data-start="354.62" data-end="356.21">gist I could probably point people that</span> <span data-start="356.21" data-end="359.78">just but it was like you know since ruby</span> <span data-start="359.78" data-end="362.51">has blocks and JavaScript has these this</span> <span data-start="362.51" data-end="364.669">call back or you know first class</span> <span data-start="364.669" data-end="366.98">function pattern we can do some similar</span> <span data-start="366.98" data-end="368.63">things and hey maybe this could be</span> <span data-start="368.63" data-end="370.52">interesting maybe this could have use</span> <span data-start="370.52" data-end="373.49">cases beyond just an experiment and</span> <span data-start="373.49" data-end="375.93">actually it was Alex over</span> <span data-start="375.93" data-end="378.03">standing next to me who realized that</span> <span data-start="378.03" data-end="380.66">hey this pattern of having a controller</span> <span data-start="380.66" data-end="383.4">is really useful for things like couchdb</span> <span data-start="383.4" data-end="385.44">where you don't have necessarily have a</span> <span data-start="385.44" data-end="387.9">middle tier and you can just have Sammy</span> <span data-start="387.9" data-end="389.94">and this controller pattern living</span> <span data-start="389.94" data-end="392.31">completely in the browser and living</span> <span data-start="392.31" data-end="394.59">just in the database itself and I talked</span> <span data-start="394.59" data-end="397.259">about that last year but it's a really</span> <span data-start="397.259" data-end="398.85">interesting pattern in it's not</span> <span data-start="398.85" data-end="400.35">something that I initially thought of as</span> <span data-start="400.35" data-end="402.419">a use case for Sammy but it ended up</span> <span data-start="402.419" data-end="406.259">being the best use case so another myth</span> <span data-start="406.259" data-end="409.68">is smaller is better and this is kind of</span> <span data-start="409.68" data-end="412.44">a recent one and I'll have to like fist</span> <span data-start="412.44" data-end="415.08">fight with Jed about this but basically</span> <span data-start="415.08" data-end="419.789">the myth is that you know it doesn't I</span> <span data-start="419.789" data-end="421.59">mean obviously obviously there are</span> <span data-start="421.59" data-end="424.56">reasons to have small code especially on</span> <span data-start="424.56" data-end="427.02">the on the client side it does actually</span> <span data-start="427.02" data-end="431.19">matter but the myth that it matters for</span> <span data-start="431.19" data-end="434.88">most is is kind of ridiculous most</span> <span data-start="434.88" data-end="436.5">people cite the need for speed you know</span> <span data-start="436.5" data-end="440.34">that that you know were you know</span> <span data-start="440.34" data-end="441.72">obviously we're downloading all the code</span> <span data-start="441.72" data-end="443.58">in the browser so the smaller your code</span> <span data-start="443.58" data-end="446.37">is the faster it'll be are the faster</span> <span data-start="446.37" data-end="449.01">download but really were most people are</span> <span data-start="449.01" data-end="451.08">running I mean most developers at least</span> <span data-start="451.08" data-end="452.01">are probably running on high-speed</span> <span data-start="452.01" data-end="454.349">connections and the difference between a</span> <span data-start="454.349" data-end="457.53">kilobyte or two really really once its</span> <span data-start="457.53" data-end="459.3">cache is not really going to make that</span> <span data-start="459.3" data-end="461.43">big a difference and what ends up</span> <span data-start="461.43" data-end="464.22">happening is people extract so much of</span> <span data-start="464.22" data-end="465.93">the coro that they really end up with</span> <span data-start="465.93" data-end="467.639">less when you're going to take stuff</span> <span data-start="467.639" data-end="469.5">away you take stuff away obviously</span> <span data-start="469.5" data-end="470.52">there's a point where you can actually</span> <span data-start="470.52" data-end="472.409">refactor stuff and make stuff smaller</span> <span data-start="472.409" data-end="473.61">and make it faster and make it better</span> <span data-start="473.61" data-end="475.289">when you're actually taking a whole</span> <span data-start="475.289" data-end="477.18">chunks out of a framework or whole</span> <span data-start="477.18" data-end="479.729">chunks out of out of an existing tool</span> <span data-start="479.729" data-end="482.669">you're probably losing some stuff and</span> <span data-start="482.669" data-end="485.009">that stuff you might end up having to</span> <span data-start="485.009" data-end="488.34">recreate and create your own version of</span> <span data-start="488.34" data-end="489.84">it which might not be as good as the</span> <span data-start="489.84" data-end="492.87">original version so less actually means</span> <span data-start="492.87" data-end="494.52">lessons smaller doesn't always mean</span> <span data-start="494.52" data-end="498.08">better really it's about balance and</span> <span data-start="498.08" data-end="501.03">balance is a couple things but here I'm</span> <span data-start="501.03" data-end="502.05">talking about readability and</span> <span data-start="502.05" data-end="504.24">maintainability versus the lines of code</span> <span data-start="504.24" data-end="505.889">so you know you can</span> <span data-start="505.889" data-end="508.469">right everything in 140 bites you can</span> <span data-start="508.469" data-end="510.93">write your entire web framework in the</span> <span data-start="510.93" data-end="513.81">length of a in the length of a quick an</span> <span data-start="513.81" data-end="515.55">endlave within the length of a tweet but</span> <span data-start="515.55" data-end="518.459">really that's not gonna you know if you</span> <span data-start="518.459" data-end="521.07">actually oh now we want to add support</span> <span data-start="521.07" data-end="525.42">for you know actual hash hash matching</span> <span data-start="525.42" data-end="528.149">or or some other kind of patterns like</span> <span data-start="528.149" data-end="530.459">oh how am I actually going to go in and</span> <span data-start="530.459" data-end="535.14">do that so you know there is has to be</span> <span data-start="535.14" data-end="536.49">some kind of ballast and i'm not talking</span> <span data-start="536.49" data-end="540.149">about like naming all your methods you</span> <span data-start="540.149" data-end="543.93">know does connect to device so that it</span> <span data-start="543.93" data-end="545.79">can you know there's there's a balance</span> <span data-start="545.79" data-end="548.73">there's a balance and the readability is</span> <span data-start="548.73" data-end="550.29">truly important especially if you're</span> <span data-start="550.29"
