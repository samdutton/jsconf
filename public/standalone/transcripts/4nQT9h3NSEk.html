<p><span data-start="18.16" data-end="19.16">So let's all give it up for Suzie.</span> <span data-start="19.16" data-end="20.16"Audience member: Thank you.</span> <span data-start="20.16" data-end="21.16">All right, hi, everybody, Day 3, JSConf, we made it.</span> <span data-start="21.16" data-end="22.16">Thank you for coming to my talk.</span> <span data-start="22.16" data-end="23.16">So this is actually my first talk so please excuse my verbal typos.</span> <span data-start="23.16" data-end="24.189">So I want to kick things off with a quick show of hands.</span> <span data-start="24.189" data-end="29.39">I say this but I can't really see y'all because it's kind of bright up here.</span> <span data-start="29.39" data-end="32.94">So here was once a junior engineer.</span> <span data-start="32.94" data-end="37">Trick question, friends.</span> <span data-start="37" data-end="40.19">And who considers themselves still to be a junior engineer right now.</span> <span data-start="40.19" data-end="47.899">Cool, well, you're in the right place and who considers themselves to be a senior engineer?</span> <span data-start="47.899" data-end="49.899">Cool.</span> <span data-start="49.899" data-end="54.31">And who considers themselves someone who knows everything there is to know about software</span> <span data-start="54.31" data-end="55.31">development?</span> <span data-start="55.31" data-end="57.579">[laughter] Oh, I saw one hand.</span> <span data-start="57.579" data-end="63.26">! Well, yeah, junior folks, as you can see from that, if you feel like you don't know</span> <span data-start="63.26" data-end="71.23">enough right now, rest assured that you probably never will, so yay for that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="71.23" data-end="75.87">So and what unites us all is that we all have to start somewhere, but that can be different</span> <span data-start="75.87" data-end="77.19">places.</span> <span data-start="77.19" data-end="83.251">Maybe you knew from the minute that you had a family PC that you knew you wanted to code.</span> <span data-start="83.251" data-end="88.01">You knew you wanted to manipulate this machine or maybe inspired by customizing your my space</span> <span data-start="88.01" data-end="94.37">profile or maybe you did computer science as a degree.</span> <span data-start="94.37" data-end="99.52">Wherever we came from, we all ended up in this crazy journey.</span> <span data-start="99.52" data-end="104.65">So last summer my friend James decided to join us and he took the brave decision to</span> <span data-start="104.65" data-end="107.06">career change to become an engineer.</span> <span data-start="107.06" data-end="112.59">So me being a mostly decent human being, I offered to help, I mean how hard can it be</span> <span data-start="112.59" data-end="117.63">in 2019 with the finest Google search results and videos and courses online?</span> <span data-start="117.63" data-end="121.48">Well, spoiler, it was hard.</span> <span data-start="121.48" data-end="125.57">Way harder than I thought or I think he even thought, to be honest.</span> <span data-start="125.57" data-end="132.38">So today I want to share ten things that I learned as I followed James on his coding</span> <span data-start="132.38" data-end="134.98">adventure.</span> <span data-start="134.98" data-end="135.98">My name is Suzie.</span> <span data-start="135.98" data-end="141.731">My pronouns are she/her, I am British, not Australian, so congrats for those of you who</span> <span data-start="141.731" data-end="147.1">guessed that in the guess the accent sweep stakes and I work on the front-end tech lead</span> <span data-start="147.1" data-end="150.98">at Maven clinic in New York City.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="150.98" data-end="163.96">We partner with employers to support their employees through pregnancy, surrogacy, adoption</span> <span data-start="163.96" data-end="165.78">and return to work programs.</span> <span data-start="165.78" data-end="167.69">So that's my shameless plug for now.</span> <span data-start="167.69" data-end="172.03">Also we're hiring, so if you're interested in either of those things, please come to</span> <span data-start="172.03" data-end="173.2">talk to me later.</span> <span data-start="173.2" data-end="180.65">So my path into this is that I was self-taught or I like to call myself an accidental engineer.</span> <span data-start="180.65" data-end="183.7">See, music was always my thing.</span> <span data-start="183.7" data-end="187.54">When I picked up guitar at age 12, I kind of knew that was it for me, that was what</span> <span data-start="187.54" data-end="193.66">I wanted to do, so for the rest of my teens and early 20s, I spent most of my time playing</span> <span data-start="193.66" data-end="199">shows in dodgy dive bars and venues across the UK, but after playing my first show, I</span> <span data-start="199" data-end="213.9">think I was 14 or something, I was backing in the glory of success, I thought that the</span> <span data-start="213.9" data-end="219.02">this is the late '90s and early 20000, and I had no shortage of I inspiration.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="219.02" data-end="227.32">The web was full of fonts, and let's face it questionable design choice, they were great</span> <span data-start="227.32" data-end="228.32">times.</span> <span data-start="228.32" data-end="234.32">So armed with cutting edge tools and zero experience I drag and dropped my way to creating</span> <span data-start="234.32" data-end="236.77">my first website.</span> <span data-start="236.77" data-end="237.77">But then what?</span> <span data-start="237.77" data-end="242.65">I had this thing on my computer and I knew I had to somehow get that onto the interwebs.</span> <span data-start="242.65" data-end="247.74">I heard that hosting was a thing, so I got some low-cost hosting, I think and I emailed</span> <span data-start="247.74" data-end="257.29">my band's email list and I asked if anyone knew any FTP sites.</span> <span data-start="257.29" data-end="262.63">With no skills, I had become a freaking webmaster.</span> <span data-start="262.63" data-end="267.11">It was good times.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="267.11" data-end="275.22">So sadly, archive.org didn't start until 2001, so my 1999 handiwork is lost to the ether,</span> <span data-start="275.22" data-end="280.03">but rest assured it looked pretty great.</span> <span data-start="280.03" data-end="286.65">This is all that remains of it.</span> <span data-start="286.65" data-end="292.25">Eventually I graduated from publisher to front page and then definitely very illegally obtained</span> <span data-start="292.25" data-end="295.05">of DreamWeaver.</span> <span data-start="295.05" data-end="300.97">Tables and frames came and went and CSS came along and allowed me to look pretty.</span> <span data-start="300.97" data-end="302.69">But still for me coding was a hobby.</span> <span data-start="302.69" data-end="308.03">It wasn't a career if you had to do a career in computer science, you had to go and do</span> <span data-start="308.03" data-end="311.27">a degree in computer science, right, that's how it works?</span> <span data-start="311.27" data-end="317.31">So fast forward, I did a degree in music technology, I worked in retouching for a bit, I worked</span> <span data-start="317.31" data-end="319.03">in IT support for a bit.</span> <span data-start="319.03" data-end="323.34">I had something of a mid-20s crisis trying to figure out what I was doing with my life</span> <span data-start="323.34" data-end="328.02">in which I considered everything from being a lawyer to a teacher to a social worker and</span> <span data-start="328.02" data-end="333.09">then I heard about this startup scene thing that was happening in the US and that kind</span> <span data-start="333.09" data-end="335.57">of sounded like being in a band to me.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="335.57" data-end="338.75">You know, it's you and a bunch of people and you're creating this product that you're trying</span> <span data-start="338.75" data-end="345.36">to put out into the world in order to be successful and famous and happy or something so I figured</span> <span data-start="345.36" data-end="346.93">maybe I don't need a degree to do this.</span> <span data-start="346.93" data-end="350.07">So I decided to learn to code properly.</span> <span data-start="350.07" data-end="356.05">So I read some books, I built some bad PHP apps and I badgered some people on Twitter</span> <span data-start="356.05" data-end="367.25">until thankfully someone gave me a chance and gave me a code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="367.25" data-end="373.62">So I taught myself Ruby, discovered SVN and git and I taught myself JavaScript and here</span> <span data-start="373.62" data-end="380.86">I am today, giving my first talk at the biggest conference in our industry, so that's weird.</span> <span data-start="380.86" data-end="381.86">[applause]</span> <span data-start="381.86" data-end="383.85">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="383.85" data-end="390.12">So just to recap, the things that I needed to do in order to become an accidental junior</span> <span data-start="390.12" data-end="396.28">developer, I pretty much needed to know HTML, some dodgy inline styles, I needed to know</span> <span data-start="396.28" data-end="401.46">how to use an FTP client and a generous smattering of GIFs, obviously.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="401.46" data-end="405.889">So accidentally becoming a developer wasn't really that uncommon back then.</span> <span data-start="405.889" data-end="422.139">Maybe as I said earlier, people started tinkering on MySpace profiles or maybe.</span> <span data-start="422.139" data-end="429.47">Interactivity was pretty much copy and pasting a Java applet or maybe a Marquee if you were</span> <span data-start="429.47" data-end="434.23">particularly creative.</span> <span data-start="434.23" data-end="437.37">So here we are in 2019, meet my friend James.</span> <span data-start="437.37" data-end="438.57">We actually made music together.</span> <span data-start="438.57" data-end="440.86">But that's a story for another time.</span> <span data-start="440.86" data-end="446.52">But he had a real job in construction so he was basically building skyscrapers and swinging</span> <span data-start="446.52" data-end="452.52">off bridges and doing you know, real work but he also produced videos and animations</span> <span data-start="452.52" data-end="454.83">and sound design video games, so a talented guy in general.</span> <span data-start="454.83" data-end="459.68">So last summer he decided he wanted to learn to code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="459.68" data-end="465.419">So me being self-taught and having mostly learned through a baptism of fire was OK,</span> <span data-start="465.419" data-end="466.419">how hard can it be?</span> <span data-start="466.419" data-end="470.01">What do you need to know.</span> <span data-start="470.01" data-end="478.979">And to recap I got my first job knowing HTML, CSS, really bad PHP and that was kind of it.</span> <span data-start="478.979" data-end="481.1">Source control?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="481.1" data-end="484.4">I probably thought that was a foodstuff.</span> <span data-start="484.4" data-end="489.14">So this is what it turns out James had to learn.</span> <span data-start="489.14" data-end="494.49">So he got the classics of HTML and CSS but in addition to that you have to know about</span> <span data-start="494.49" data-end="505.66">Sass and Less and CSS in JS and how to fight in Twitter about CSS in JS, JavaScript, obviously,</span> <span data-start="505.66" data-end="510.99">React and Angular and Vue and whatever the cool kids are using right now and let's face</span> <span data-start="510.99" data-end="515.209">it there have probably been 3 JavaScript frames come out in the time that it's got me to this</span> <span data-start="515.209" data-end="517.5">time in my talk.</span> <span data-start="517.5" data-end="523.259">Git, and databases and APIs and be a good citizen of the web and accessibility.</span> <span data-start="523.259" data-end="531.67">If you want to get an interview, you into need to know about algorithm data structures,</span> <span data-start="531.67" data-end="537.19">cross-browser testing and whatever everyone is talking about in Hacker News this week,</span> <span data-start="537.19" data-end="538.22">too.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="538.22" data-end="543.17">So that brings me to thing No. 1 on my list and that that is is that the barrier for entry</span> <span data-start="543.17" data-end="547.1">is way higher now, like, damn.</span> <span data-start="547.1" data-end="550.69">So what are some ways folks get into engineering these days?</span> <span data-start="550.69" data-end="557.329">Well, seeing that you know Matrix star downloading information into your brain is not an option</span> <span data-start="557.329" data-end="561.459">yet, CS degree.</span> <span data-start="561.459" data-end="569.73">Fantastic, cost you many bags of money and take you four years but you'll be able to</span> <span data-start="569.73" data-end="574.939">contribute as a junior engineer pretty early on, or you can do the boot camp path which</span> <span data-start="574.939" data-end="581.269">will cost you some bags of money and take you 12, 14 weeks and you'll be out being able</span> <span data-start="581.269" data-end="587.3">to contribute again or you can do my path which was the self taught path, which could</span> <span data-start="587.3" data-end="594.129">cost you nothing to some amount depending on how much you put into it and it could take</span> <span data-start="594.129" data-end="596.61">you any amount of time.</span> <span data-start="596.61" data-end="602.3">Which thinking about these things brought me to thing No. 2 is that coding isn't that</span> <span data-start="602.3" data-end="604.1">open to all when you think about it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="604.1" data-end="610.29">I'm not sure if you remember the code year initiative that happened I think it was around</span> <span data-start="610.29" data-end="614.72">2012 by things like then-mayor of New York, Bloomberg touted that he was going to learn</span> <span data-start="614.72" data-end="620.18">coding and if he could learn it anybody could do it.</span> <span data-start="620.18" data-end="622.399">It's open to all.</span> <span data-start="622.399" data-end="624.389">Why would you not want to do this.</span> <span data-start="624.389" data-end="630.16">That's all well and good, but you need to remember that not everyone grows up access</span> <span data-start="630.16" data-end="631.66">to a computer.</span> <span data-start="631.66" data-end="640.009">Not everyone can spend 12 to 20K on tuition fees plus living expenses and loss of earnings.</span> <span data-start="640.009" data-end="645.519">Not everyone is able to work a job or two or three and spend their time outside of work</span> <span data-start="645.519" data-end="646.519">learning to code.</span> <span data-start="646.519" data-end="656.019">There are some great initiatives out there, there are loans out there, but it's still</span> <span data-start="656.019" data-end="660.73">a huge commitment and there's no guarantee of how soon, if at all, you'll get a job.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="660.73" data-end="667.329">So nevertheless, James chose the boot camp path and why would you not?</span> <span data-start="667.329" data-end="669.779">It promises a pretty amazing return on investment.</span> <span data-start="669.779" data-end="675.78">It if you go from zero to being a developer in 12 weeks, you can according to some of</span> <span data-start="675.78" data-end="678.05">these boot campsites have a 70X salary increase.</span> <span data-start="678.05" data-end="681.79">Sox of them even have money-back guarantees.</span> <span data-start="681.79" data-end="688.3">But again to get into top-tier boot camps a lot of them require you to have a lot of</span> <span data-start="688.3" data-end="695.12">knowledge in order to get into a camp that teaches you to learn code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="695.12" data-end="697.62">So that was weird.</span> <span data-start="697.62" data-end="701.889">So his school gave a few resources there but he decided he wanted to do a thorough job</span> <span data-start="701.889" data-end="707.04">and figure out how he could best learn with the resources available to him.</span> <span data-start="707.04" data-end="711.339">Which brings me to thing 3 is there are so many resources out there.</span> <span data-start="711.339" data-end="718.6">When I started there was books and trying things and failing and that was kind of it.</span> <span data-start="718.6" data-end="720.949">But now there's so many things out there, which is great, right?</span> <span data-start="720.949" data-end="724.69">There are so many choices but how do you know which one is best for you?</span> <span data-start="724.69" data-end="728.269">How do you know which learning style is best for you?</span> <span data-start="728.269" data-end="729.269">Where should you start?</span> <span data-start="729.269" data-end="730.269">Should you pay for one?</span> <span data-start="730.269" data-end="736.66">Trying to figure out where these things start and which one works for you.</span> <span data-start="736.66" data-end="739.869">Nevertheless, James started with Code Academy.</span> <span data-start="739.869" data-end="745.86">It's a great browser-based IDE which gives you hints.</span> <span data-start="745.86" data-end="749.079">It's really cool.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="749.079" data-end="751.91">So his boot camp was going to involve Ruby.</span> <span data-start="751.91" data-end="762.55">So he did some code academy resources, eventually he could write methods and he could do simple</span> <span data-start="762.55" data-end="764.579">algorithms in his browser.</span> <span data-start="764.579" data-end="770.199">He could Fibonacci, he could do Fizzbuzz, awesome, so I was feeling like a mental bad</span> <span data-start="770.199" data-end="771.199">JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="771.199" data-end="777.24">So I decided it would be a good idea for him to install Ruby locally.</span> <span data-start="777.24" data-end="784.779">He went on this site and it had a bunch of commands with a dollar sign in front.</span> <span data-start="784.779" data-end="785.779">What even is that?</span> <span data-start="785.779" data-end="791.44">So I replied oh, yeah, that just means you have to run those in your terminal, simple.</span> <span data-start="791.44" data-end="794.129">So he was like, yeah, but what does that even mean?</span> <span data-start="794.129" data-end="796.989">What even is run?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="796.989" data-end="801.61">So for some reason that question hit me, not because I couldn't tell him to open up the</span> <span data-start="801.61" data-end="807.269">terminal app to copy and paste that website and hit return and that would do what he wanted</span> <span data-start="807.269" data-end="812.67">but I guess at that point I realized how much learning to code involved.</span> <span data-start="812.67" data-end="818.079">Short of run something you were just telling but even then, what does the dollar sign mean</span> <span data-start="818.079" data-end="824.129">and how do I explain those two fairly simple seeming things without explaining kind of</span> <span data-start="824.129" data-end="828.399">everything in computer science so at that point it dawned on me that this journey he</span> <span data-start="828.399" data-end="831.829">was about to take was huge.</span> <span data-start="831.829" data-end="841.47">He conquered Fizzbuzz and algorithms but he didn't know how that runs on a server or even</span> <span data-start="841.47" data-end="846.079">what a server was, all of these things that I, as I turns out kind of had forgotten were</span> <span data-start="846.079" data-end="850.949">not part of the common vernacular for nondevelopers.</span> <span data-start="850.949" data-end="852.92">Which brings me to point 4.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="852.92" data-end="858.29">Coding is kind of this giant game of joining the dots, but you don't know what the dots</span> <span data-start="858.29" data-end="866.749">are, and as soon as you join one dot, another 1 or 3 or 12 more start coming into view.</span> <span data-start="866.749" data-end="876.439">Now, computer folks, this is not, you've got those fundamentals kind of down, but for boot</span> <span data-start="876.439" data-end="880.879">stamp and self taught folks, sometimes we skim over those things in order to get productive</span> <span data-start="880.879" data-end="884.24">fast and then we catch up later.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="884.24" data-end="891.279">So for James he understood about running code in the computer versus server, he knew what</span> <span data-start="891.279" data-end="896.63">HTML was, we noticed some other ones, like what's an API, what's a database, all things</span> <span data-start="896.63" data-end="900.94">that I had taken for granted as things everyone would have some knowledge of which it turns</span> <span data-start="900.94" data-end="902.16">out they don't.</span> <span data-start="902.16" data-end="908.429">He learned a bunch of Ruby and he passed the entrance exam for his boot camp of choice.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="908.429" data-end="913.279">Complete, awesome, but as it turns out, more knowledge means more questions.</span> <span data-start="913.279" data-end="919.199">He went through the bootcamp and we continued to meet up when he wanted help with something.</span> <span data-start="919.199" data-end="924.569">He built some Ruby apps and moved to JavaScript and eventually build full-stack Rails and</span> <span data-start="924.569" data-end="925.799">React.</span> <span data-start="925.799" data-end="930.149">But the more you learn, the more questions arise.</span> <span data-start="930.149" data-end="933.569">Ah, console errors.</span> <span data-start="933.569" data-end="941.749">These can be useful for 70% of the time but for a new developer this seemingly never-ending</span> <span data-start="941.749" data-end="948.48">stream of scary red text can feel meaningless.</span> <span data-start="948.48" data-end="954.759">I'm pretty sure everyone in this room has Googled that at some point.</span> <span data-start="954.759" data-end="956.42">So what next?</span> <span data-start="956.42" data-end="959.529">Over to Google, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="959.529" data-end="965.319">And then you get met with a casual 15 million results and within those results, a plethora</span> <span data-start="965.319" data-end="969.709">of probably passive-aggressive StackOverflow answers to sift through.</span> <span data-start="969.709" data-end="971.35">Always fun.</span> <span data-start="971.35" data-end="976.029">And that's if you know what the issue is and if you don't know what the issue is, how do</span> <span data-start="976.029" data-end="977.23">you know what to Google?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="977.23" data-end="981.579">And even if you do, how to you phrase the question in order to get the search results</span> <span data-start="981.579" data-end="982.579">you need?</span> <span data-start="982.579" data-end="988.549">Early on, James had been prepending his searches with JScript thinking it was short for JavaScript</span> <span data-start="988.549" data-end="991.959">which returned some pretty short results.</span> <span data-start="991.959" data-end="1000.359">And in the interest of googling: React class, it's pretty huge in terms of the relevancy</span> <span data-start="1000.359" data-end="1008.069">of your results and that's if you have a stack trace to begin with.</span> <span data-start="1008.069" data-end="1011.809">I guess I'd kind of taken for granted how second nature it had become for me to just</span> <span data-start="1011.809" data-end="1016.439">search things and usually get the right answer and how to debug things when issues arose,</span> <span data-start="1016.439" data-end="1021.999">learning to code is as much about learning to debug as it is about writing code in the</span> <span data-start="1021.999" data-end="1025.31">first place, as it turns out.</span> <span data-start="1025.31" data-end="1031.01">So James learned about debugging and built some frankly impressive apps for someone who</span> <span data-start="1031.01" data-end="1044.02">only to code a few weeks ago.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1044.02" data-end="1047.26">So his school set out some guidelines as to what to do, to begin with the good chance</span> <span data-start="1047.26" data-end="1049">of getting a new job.</span> <span data-start="1049" data-end="1052.63">One of those guidelines was to apply to 50 jobs a week.</span> <span data-start="1052.63" data-end="1055.43">Five-zero jobs a week, that's kind of a lot.</span> <span data-start="1055.43" data-end="1062.14">In addition to that he had to study algorithm, create new projects, work on technical interview</span> <span data-start="1062.14" data-end="1069.16">skills, work on general interview skills, things like a life had to factor in there,</span> <span data-start="1069.16" data-end="1074.35">work on his resume, and practice whiteboarding.</span> <span data-start="1074.35" data-end="1077.69">If you're lucky, you get to do code challenges and prep for interviews.</span> <span data-start="1077.69" data-end="1079.86">But still it's a lot of stuff.</span> <span data-start="1079.86" data-end="1084.17">And all of that is exactly because competition is so fierce right now.</span> <span data-start="1084.17" data-end="1090.28">There was 20,000 boot camp grads in 2018 and no doubt more than that in 2019, something</span> <span data-start="1090.28" data-end="1095.37">like 65,000 computer science grads and how many self-taught folks common to the market</span> <span data-start="1095.37" data-end="1100.7">each year, which is great because in the USA there are plenty of software jobs out there</span> <span data-start="1100.7" data-end="1105.791">but the problem is there are very few junior ones, and the one that is do hire aren't always</span> <span data-start="1105.791" data-end="1110.02">that great at supporting their junior developers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1110.02" data-end="1122.18">I have a friend who ended up quitting because she got so little support, they just didn't</span> <span data-start="1122.18" data-end="1127.6">give her any training, they kind of metaphorically threw her into a swimming pool and told her</span> <span data-start="1127.6" data-end="1129.7">to learn how to swim.</span> <span data-start="1129.7" data-end="1134.9">So unsurprisingly she left that place and now is spending a bunch of money to getting</span> <span data-start="1134.9" data-end="1138.92">a computer science masters because she didn't get the support that should have given it</span> <span data-start="1138.92" data-end="1139.92">to her.</span> <span data-start="1139.92" data-end="1149.15">So sadly No. 7, the potential for burnout starts early.</span> <span data-start="1149.15" data-end="1152.26">So I've definitely experienced burn outmyself.</span> <span data-start="1152.26" data-end="1156.45">I guess it's a combination of working in a high-pressure startup environment, working</span> <span data-start="1156.45" data-end="1160.98">fast, always shipping and making sure that the company stayed together, it was kind of</span> <span data-start="1160.98" data-end="1165.53">inevitable and as someone who thrives on being hyperproductive all the time, I really hated</span> <span data-start="1165.53" data-end="1169.75">feeling that way and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.</span> <span data-start="1169.75" data-end="1178.01">Quick recap: Burnout is defined by the WHO as feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion,</span> <span data-start="1178.01" data-end="1182.24">increased mental distance from one's job or feelings of negativism or sin nix related</span> <span data-start="1182.24" data-end="1186.72">to one's job, and reduced professional efficacy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1186.72" data-end="1192.85">So James towards the end of his bootcamp was definitely walking on a tightrope but he definitely</span> <span data-start="1192.85" data-end="1199.49">came close and that was really sad for me to see and I guess that's not surprising.</span> <span data-start="1199.49" data-end="1203.35">Boot camps require something like 80-plus hours a week of study.</span> <span data-start="1203.35" data-end="1208.46">Plus the pressure if you failed the exam, you could leave with debt and no job to show</span> <span data-start="1208.46" data-end="1215.09">for it and if you're someone like James who didn't go to University and never sat for</span> <span data-start="1215.09" data-end="1223.83">exams, doing an exam and having to go into intensive study in order to not get kicked</span> <span data-start="1223.83" data-end="1232.65">out of boot that was intense.</span> <span data-start="1232.65" data-end="1235.67">Thankfully he came through it, but plenty of people don't.</span> <span data-start="1235.67" data-end="1240.81">Even once he gets a job, the prospects on that job weren't great.</span> <span data-start="1240.81" data-end="1246.07">A 2018 survey asked close to 11.5 thousand tech employees if they felt burned out and</span> <span data-start="1246.07" data-end="1247.35">60% of them did.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1247.35" data-end="1251.9">The best company on that list, Netflix, had 40%.</span> <span data-start="1251.9" data-end="1257.73">So the pressure of this environment and keeping up with the fast-moving field of engineering</span> <span data-start="1257.73" data-end="1260.99">takes his toll.</span> <span data-start="1260.99" data-end="1265.63">Which brings me to thing 8, resiliency is so important.</span> <span data-start="1265.63" data-end="1267.95">James survived his boot camp brush with burnout.</span> <span data-start="1267.95" data-end="1282.53">And now he has to make but the  reality is pretty far from that and that can</span> <span data-start="1282.53" data-end="1287.82">be a pretty demoralizing wakeup call, but it's not just the job hunt that needs strength.</span> <span data-start="1287.82" data-end="1292.72">Being an engineer means keeping up with this constant sea of changes and that can be pretty</span> <span data-start="1292.72" data-end="1297.48">exhausting and James got his first taste of this very early on.</span> <span data-start="1297.48" data-end="1306.73">He'd learned about object oriented programming and then React.</span> <span data-start="1306.73" data-end="1311.68">And then along came React 16.8 and sorry, kids, now hooks is the thing, forget about</span> <span data-start="1311.68" data-end="1313.99">classes, you don't need them anymore.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1313.99" data-end="1317.93">So before he'd even graduated, the thing that he'd learned was the right way of doing things</span> <span data-start="1317.93" data-end="1324.53">was no longer the right way of doing things, which kind of sucks, coding is really this</span> <span data-start="1324.53" data-end="1329.7">career-long marathon and boy had you better be ready to change your route, running shoes</span> <span data-start="1329.7" data-end="1334.75">and technique continually for the rest of your race and the rest of your career.</span> <span data-start="1334.75" data-end="1340.98">So OK, that all sounds kind of doom and gloom, but I guess thing No. 9 was the thing that</span> <span data-start="1340.98" data-end="1345.911">surprised me the most and that's helping someone learn to code is really great with helping</span> <span data-start="1345.911" data-end="1347.81">with Imposter Syndrome.</span> <span data-start="1347.81" data-end="1353.54">Now because of that constant struggle to keep up with what was going on in our industry</span> <span data-start="1353.54" data-end="1365.61">or perhaps because I'm self-taught or because I'm a naturally anxious person.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1365.61" data-end="1372.93">In fact when I first suggested to James that I help him to code I was secretly terrified.</span> <span data-start="1372.93" data-end="1376.75">What if this exposed me as not knowing anything?</span> <span data-start="1376.75" data-end="1379.69">So a quick refresher on Imposter Syndrome.</span> <span data-start="1379.69" data-end="1383.96">David did a great talk on this yesterday so if you didn't see that, I would definitely</span> <span data-start="1383.96" data-end="1385.8">recommend watching it on YouTube.</span> <span data-start="1385.8" data-end="1392.36">So good job, David, but Imposter Syndrome is referred to as a psychological pattern</span> <span data-start="1392.36" data-end="1396.59">in which an individual doubts their accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of</span> <span data-start="1396.59" data-end="1400.98">being exposed as a fraud.</span> <span data-start="1400.98" data-end="1404.82">I constantly feel like someday I'm going to be handed a challenge that I can't solve and</span> <span data-start="1404.82" data-end="1407.77">I'll be exposed as this fraud that I think I am.</span> <span data-start="1407.77" data-end="1413.75">In spite of the fact that 10 years professionally and many years as a hobby that's not actually</span> <span data-start="1413.75" data-end="1415.22">happened.</span> <span data-start="1415.22" data-end="1417.49">Throughout my career I've definitely downplayed my achievements.</span> <span data-start="1417.49" data-end="1423.36">For fear if I was going to say I'm really good at this, someone would say, prove it.</span> <span data-start="1423.36" data-end="1429.74">And I know it sounds ridiculous but it's kind of a pattern that I've been in for a while</span> <span data-start="1429.74" data-end="1433.46">and I know I'm not alone in that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1433.46" data-end="1437.55">So I knew if I was going to be any use to James at all I was going to have to confront</span> <span data-start="1437.55" data-end="1441.64">some demons about what I did know and what I didn't.</span> <span data-start="1441.64" data-end="1444.82">So that was pretty scary.</span> <span data-start="1444.82" data-end="1450.4">When teaching myself code I felt I had to move past some basics to prove that I was</span> <span data-start="1450.4" data-end="1454.57">employable and productive and basically to get hired.</span> <span data-start="1454.57" data-end="1460.12">So being a pretty methodical person I decided to make a list of all the things that I knew</span> <span data-start="1460.12" data-end="1468.02">or thought I knew or felt I needed to know a bit more about.</span> <span data-start="1468.02" data-end="1476.13">If I came across something that I wanted to dive in on more, I did.</span> <span data-start="1476.13" data-end="1480.82">It turns out, for the most part, I knew way more than I thought I did.</span> <span data-start="1480.82" data-end="1484.53">As I went through my list studying things and figuring out what I was maybe a bit fuzzy</span> <span data-start="1484.53" data-end="1490.01">on and checking things off that I actually found out I was good at, I started to feel</span> <span data-start="1490.01" data-end="1491.01">better.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1491.01" data-end="1497.73">Some of that gnawing feeling started to subside and it occurred to me that I maybe wasn't</span> <span data-start="1497.73" data-end="1501.6">entirely a fraud.</span> <span data-start="1501.6" data-end="1506.35">Being at a startup I kind of had to prioritize shipping things rather than learning things</span> <span data-start="1506.35" data-end="1508.48">that weren't definitely related to my job.</span> <span data-start="1508.48" data-end="1512.18">So that was a bonus, too.</span> </p>
