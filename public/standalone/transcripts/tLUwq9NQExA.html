<p><span data-start="65.159" data-end="66.159">IE6.</span> <span data-start="66.159" data-end="67.22">That was not great.</span> <span data-start="67.22" data-end="72.77">So, in the last several years, all of this changed.</span> <span data-start="72.77" data-end="78.13">Now everybody is using a mobile phone pretty much all the time.</span> <span data-start="78.13" data-end="83.54">And maybe you feel more comfortable booking a flight ticket on a desk desktop or a laptop,</span> <span data-start="83.54" data-end="84.77">that's what I do.</span> <span data-start="84.77" data-end="90.619">In China, they do everything except work, maybe, the majority does everything on the</span> <span data-start="90.619" data-end="91.619">mobile phone.</span> <span data-start="91.619" data-end="95.92">So, they're highly mobile optimized.</span> <span data-start="95.92" data-end="99.6">How does this happen that people actually skipped computers?</span> <span data-start="99.6" data-end="101.96">It's the leapfrog effect.</span> <span data-start="101.96" data-end="105.43">The majority of people had cell phones.</span> <span data-start="105.43" data-end="112.009">And a generation skipped from a cell phone over the desktop to having a computer in their</span> <span data-start="112.009" data-end="113.009">hand.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="113.009" data-end="114.009">Having a smartphone.</span> <span data-start="114.009" data-end="117.96">So, a lot of people, the majority of people, actually, never had a desktop at home.</span> <span data-start="117.96" data-end="119.11">They just had the smartphone.</span> <span data-start="119.11" data-end="123.9">This is why most people always use the smartphone by now.</span> <span data-start="123.9" data-end="127.689">Before going to the talk, an overview of what to talk about.</span> <span data-start="127.689" data-end="128.84">The three topics.</span> <span data-start="128.84" data-end="131.22">The mandatory part.</span> <span data-start="131.22" data-end="136.56">If you do projects for people in China, what you need to take care of.</span> <span data-start="136.56" data-end="141.91">I talk about the important part, WeChat, the number one social media app in China.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="141.91" data-end="145.67">And I talk about the development ecosystem, the community part in China.</span> <span data-start="145.67" data-end="151">I think this is the most interesting part.</span> <span data-start="151" data-end="155.04">I would like to know here in the audience, who has been to China?</span> <span data-start="155.04" data-end="156.37">Okay.</span> <span data-start="156.37" data-end="157.71">Not too many people, actually.</span> <span data-start="157.71" data-end="162.32">So, for the people who have not been to China, I'm going to pick you up there.</span> <span data-start="162.32" data-end="165.14">So, you've heard that stuff is blocked in China, right?</span> <span data-start="165.14" data-end="167.53">Facebook, Tweeter, Google stuff is blocked.</span> <span data-start="167.53" data-end="168.6">But you don't know what that means.</span> <span data-start="168.6" data-end="175.24">Usually on a new country, you flip out your phone and ask Google how to get to the hotel.</span> <span data-start="175.24" data-end="178.17">If you do that in China, this is how it looks.</span> <span data-start="178.17" data-end="182.15">You get the familiar blue spot, but nothing else.</span> <span data-start="182.15" data-end="184.44">Google won't talk to you.</span> <span data-start="184.44" data-end="186.73">And even though you thought you would be prepared.</span> <span data-start="186.73" data-end="190.59">You might figure out, okay, maybe not that prepared anymore.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="190.59" data-end="195.01">Other people come to China a little bit more prepared, like Mark Zuckerberg.</span> <span data-start="195.01" data-end="201.1">He runs over Tiananmen Square in Beijing and was able to post it on Facebook so other people</span> <span data-start="201.1" data-end="204.51">come to China better prepared.</span> <span data-start="204.51" data-end="207.64">And now that you have an idea of how it feels to be a tourist in China, I would like to</span> <span data-start="207.64" data-end="214.42">talk about the first project in China, the project for people or users in China.</span> <span data-start="214.42" data-end="221.01">If your client tells you, hey, whack we do soc that people in China can use our web page?</span> <span data-start="221.01" data-end="224.72">First of all, you might add translations.</span> <span data-start="224.72" data-end="227.07">Maybe webfonts on that page.</span> <span data-start="227.07" data-end="233.62">I have a client, they have print products and we have a special one for Chinese characters.</span> <span data-start="233.62" data-end="235.68">Sending over here.</span> <span data-start="235.68" data-end="239.25">Having fonts for special Chinese characters that we use for printing products.</span> <span data-start="239.25" data-end="243.61">Maybe we can transform that file and you can use it on the Internet.</span> <span data-start="243.61" data-end="245.84">And I said, yes, that's a great idea.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="245.84" data-end="246.92">Send it over.</span> <span data-start="246.92" data-end="250.72">They sent over a file and it was 50 megabyte.</span> <span data-start="250.72" data-end="252.26">Maybe not a good idea.</span> <span data-start="252.26" data-end="253.89">Chinese has a lot of characters, obviously.</span> <span data-start="253.89" data-end="257.29">So, they said, put it in anyway.</span> <span data-start="257.29" data-end="258.88">And I was like, maybe not.</span> <span data-start="258.88" data-end="263.51">So, the idea is, just use system fonts with Chinese on your web page.</span> <span data-start="263.51" data-end="268.48">If you want to use a web font, make sure that it's highly optimized.</span> <span data-start="268.48" data-end="273.86">Another thing is people like to have maps on the page to show fancy things.</span> <span data-start="273.86" data-end="276.59">Usually they use Google Maps to implement that.</span> <span data-start="276.59" data-end="280.16">And this is the company, we have branches all over the world.</span> <span data-start="280.16" data-end="281.38">This is how it looks.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="281.38" data-end="282.59">In China, it looks like this.</span> <span data-start="282.59" data-end="284.87">You don't see anything.</span> <span data-start="284.87" data-end="290.06">If you want to make sure that you have a map and the Chinese audience can see it, you might</span> <span data-start="290.06" data-end="291.83">want to use alternatives to Google Maps.</span> <span data-start="291.83" data-end="294.47">For example, Mapbox still works.</span> <span data-start="294.47" data-end="297.18">Anyone from Mapbox in here?</span> <span data-start="297.18" data-end="298.88">Okay.</span> <span data-start="298.88" data-end="302.24">And maybe the better alternative is using the Chinese provider.</span> <span data-start="302.24" data-end="304.09">In this case, Baidu maps.</span> <span data-start="304.09" data-end="306.05">This is reliable within China.</span> <span data-start="306.05" data-end="314.38">You have to have the Chinese translation, but you can copy and paste code.</span> <span data-start="314.38" data-end="315.85">You sell stuff on your web page.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="315.85" data-end="322">And why are none of the Chinese users now that we translated stuff are buying stuff?</span> <span data-start="322" data-end="328.29">That's because you ask for western payment that are not popular in China pretty much</span> <span data-start="328.29" data-end="329.29">at all.</span> <span data-start="329.29" data-end="330.29">Nobody is using these.</span> <span data-start="330.29" data-end="333.01">Maybe some, but obviously not the majority.</span> <span data-start="333.01" data-end="334.29">What do they use?</span> <span data-start="334.29" data-end="339.82">In real life, you see lines in shops and restaurants, online, everywhere.</span> <span data-start="339.82" data-end="342.07">These three payment methods here.</span> <span data-start="342.07" data-end="348.81">If you want people from China not to be hesitant to buy stuff on your page, implement at least</span> <span data-start="348.81" data-end="351.1">one of these on your page.</span> <span data-start="351.1" data-end="357.47">It's not that bad if you already use a payment integration service like Stripe or Wirecard,</span> <span data-start="357.47" data-end="362.64">they offer one of these payment methods that you can easily integrate.</span> <span data-start="362.64" data-end="367.1">And generally there is something hm.</span> <span data-start="367.1" data-end="368.1">Okay.</span> <span data-start="368.1" data-end="371.23">In general, it's always like a good idea to hold stuff yourself.</span> <span data-start="371.23" data-end="376.55">If you use CDNs, content delivery networks or web providers, make sure they're not blocked</span> <span data-start="376.55" data-end="377.55">in China.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="377.55" data-end="380.49">And make that sure on a regular basis.</span> <span data-start="380.49" data-end="382.92">You never know when things are changing.</span> <span data-start="382.92" data-end="387.53">Maybe it's a better idea to host stuff in general on your own server.</span> <span data-start="387.53" data-end="392.84">Then how to improve performance?</span> <span data-start="392.84" data-end="393.94">You can host in China.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="393.94" data-end="397.389">It's going to be faster to load for the Chinese users.</span> <span data-start="397.389" data-end="402.033">Well, in China, hosting is a little bit different.</span> <span data-start="402.033" data-end="404.94">Maybe you have seen the web page that has the small numbers down here.</span> <span data-start="404.94" data-end="406.05">Zoom this in a little bit.</span> <span data-start="406.05" data-end="407.78">It says ICP.</span> <span data-start="407.78" data-end="408.78">Maybe you can't read it.</span> <span data-start="408.78" data-end="410.6">It says ICP, & there's a number.</span> <span data-start="410.6" data-end="417.74">It's Internet content provider and there's basically somehow a number plate of your web</span> <span data-start="417.74" data-end="418.74">page.</span> <span data-start="418.74" data-end="422.35">So, it indicates who is responsible for the content of your web page.</span> <span data-start="422.35" data-end="428.35">And, yes, if there's any issue, for example, that happened to other people that I know,</span> <span data-start="428.35" data-end="432.32">you have a country selector and you list all the countries in the world, including Hong</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="432.32" data-end="436.93">Kong and Taiwan, someone is going to call you and say, please change that.</span> <span data-start="436.93" data-end="439.7">Otherwise we're going to block your page.</span> <span data-start="439.7" data-end="442.67">How to get this Internet content providing number?</span> <span data-start="442.67" data-end="444.51">Well, you need a company in China.</span> <span data-start="444.51" data-end="449.75">You need an entity of a company in China or a corporation partner that helps you with</span> <span data-start="449.75" data-end="454.13">applying to this doing this process of applying for an ICP number.</span> <span data-start="454.13" data-end="456.35">And once you have done that, it takes a longer time.</span> <span data-start="456.35" data-end="458.33">Maybe up to six, eight weeks.</span> <span data-start="458.33" data-end="462.11">Then you can legally host in China.</span> <span data-start="462.11" data-end="463.419">And that was my first topic already.</span> <span data-start="463.419" data-end="469.05">It was to talk about don't use web fonts for Chinese, unless they're optimized, no Google</span> <span data-start="469.05" data-end="473.58">Maps, offer Chinese payment methods, host for yourself and be if you want to host in</span> <span data-start="473.58" data-end="475.91">China, get a license.</span> <span data-start="475.91" data-end="481.61">And the next topic is WeChat.</span> <span data-start="481.61" data-end="483.05">Maybe you have heard of WeChat.</span> <span data-start="483.05" data-end="487.02">Maybe people told you it's like the WhatsApp of China.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="487.02" data-end="491.43">Maybe that was the case, but now it's changed.</span> <span data-start="491.43" data-end="499.139">And you use the different apps to do all kinds of things on our mobile devices.</span> <span data-start="499.139" data-end="504.86">By now you could say that the majority of these things or all these things can be done</span> <span data-start="504.86" data-end="507.56">in China by only using WeChat.</span> <span data-start="507.56" data-end="514.52">WeChat is created by a company called Tencent and integrated into Chinese society.</span> <span data-start="514.52" data-end="516.32">How it's integrated into daily life.</span> <span data-start="516.32" data-end="519.44">I would like to show in real life examples.</span> <span data-start="519.44" data-end="523.05">Here is a QR code in the restaurant.</span> <span data-start="523.05" data-end="529.589">I open the WeChat, scan the QR code and I can order food and pay, and it gets delivered</span> <span data-start="529.589" data-end="532.82">to my table.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="532.82" data-end="535.32">I order coffee here with WeChat.</span> <span data-start="535.32" data-end="540.6">Here, these are like QR codes that you see everywhere in restaurants that you use for</span> <span data-start="540.6" data-end="541.82">scanning and payment.</span> <span data-start="541.82" data-end="544.43">This is me doing this.</span> <span data-start="544.43" data-end="548.33">Scanning one of these QR codes and then paying with WeChat.</span> <span data-start="548.33" data-end="552.12">You can also use that for street venders selling foods or things on the street.</span> <span data-start="552.12" data-end="556.08">They're going to show a QR code and you can pay with WeChat.</span> <span data-start="556.08" data-end="559.96">Basically, most of the Chinese people, or maybe just, yeah.</span> <span data-start="559.96" data-end="563.42">Most of the Chinese people, they don't take cash anymore.</span> <span data-start="563.42" data-end="569.35">They just need their phone and you go out and you can do everything with your phone.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="569.35" data-end="572.24">You can also rent bikes with it.</span> <span data-start="572.24" data-end="574.83">Maybe you have seen these bikes also in Berlin.</span> <span data-start="574.83" data-end="580.3">And you know that you have they already have their own native apps to rent a bike here,</span> <span data-start="580.3" data-end="581.3">right?</span> <span data-start="581.3" data-end="585.79">But these are also, these functionalities, are also integrated into WeChat.</span> <span data-start="585.79" data-end="592.04">Once you have WeChat and you can rent all these bikes, you don't need the native app</span> <span data-start="592.04" data-end="593.47">anymore.</span> <span data-start="593.47" data-end="597.62">You can also do hospital appointments with WeChat.</span> <span data-start="597.62" data-end="601.54">And the last thing that I figured out, apparently you can get a divorce with WeChat.</span> <span data-start="601.54" data-end="603.22">[ Laughter ] So, yeah.</span> <span data-start="603.22" data-end="608.21">You can do a lot of things with WeChat.</span> <span data-start="608.21" data-end="609.93">And yeah.</span> <span data-start="609.93" data-end="611.67">To give you an idea of how this works.</span> <span data-start="611.67" data-end="617.12">Inside of WeChat, apart from the chat application, I want to introduce how it looks like.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="617.12" data-end="619.37">For example, here you have the mobile top up thingy.</span> <span data-start="619.37" data-end="623.07">If you run out of data, you can top up your data plan there.</span> <span data-start="623.07" data-end="625.27">There's something called utilities.</span> <span data-start="625.27" data-end="626.63">You get an overview.</span> <span data-start="626.63" data-end="627.63">It's Chinese here.</span> </p>
