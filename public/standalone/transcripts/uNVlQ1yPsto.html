so my my name is Marco I'm</span> <span data-start="29.64" data-end="32.04">amazed that my surname got pronounced</span> <span data-start="32.04" data-end="33.21">right</span> <span data-start="33.21" data-end="37.14">anyways I work for sack overflow I'm</span> <span data-start="37.14" data-end="38.73">going to talk a bit about the</span> <span data-start="38.73" data-end="41.73">architecture so how do we build stuff</span> <span data-start="41.73" data-end="47.219">and first thing so there is this</span> <span data-start="47.219" data-end="49.86">fantastic QR code if you scan it you'll</span> <span data-start="49.86" data-end="53.879">be able to follow along the slides okay</span> <span data-start="53.879" data-end="57.059">is I don't know if it works but you can</span> <span data-start="57.059" data-end="60.329">try anyways so we are by the way we are</span> <span data-start="60.329" data-end="64.379">a c-sharp company so we use C sharp</span> <span data-start="64.379" data-end="68.04">we are not no js' and before anybody of</span> <span data-start="68.04" data-end="69.63">you ask me the question that asks me</span> <span data-start="69.63" data-end="71.49">every time why don't use nodejs or</span> <span data-start="71.49" data-end="73.5">whatever okay if you do that I'm gonna</span> <span data-start="73.5" data-end="77.369">make fun of you because of left ok so be</span> <span data-start="77.369" data-end="81.33">careful anyway so architecture so I</span> <span data-start="81.33" data-end="83.43">looked up the definition of architecture</span> <span data-start="83.43" data-end="85.86">and it says the art of science of</span> <span data-start="85.86" data-end="88.77">building specifically your practice of</span> <span data-start="88.77" data-end="90.36">designing and building structures</span> <span data-start="90.36" data-end="93.42">especially habitable ones of course in</span> <span data-start="93.42" data-end="95.07">our case you know a software</span> <span data-start="95.07" data-end="96.299">architecture is not about building</span> <span data-start="96.299" data-end="98.79">houses is about building software where</span> <span data-start="98.79" data-end="101.82">is the same concept and architecture is</span> <span data-start="101.82" data-end="103.439">actually something that existed for a</span> <span data-start="103.439" data-end="106.29">long time it was studied since we have</span> <span data-start="106.29" data-end="109.02">texts talking about architecture there</span> <span data-start="109.02" data-end="111.689">are more than 2,000 years years old and</span> <span data-start="111.689" data-end="114.149">one thing that was notable even at the</span> <span data-start="114.149" data-end="117.03">time is three characteristics that make</span> <span data-start="117.03" data-end="118.92">the concept of architecture so three</span> <span data-start="118.92" data-end="121.229">things that architected things must have</span> <span data-start="121.229" data-end="123.96">so the first thing is durability right</span> <span data-start="123.96" data-end="125.7">so you building a house you're building</span> <span data-start="125.7" data-end="127.89">a temple you don't want the temple to</span> <span data-start="127.89" data-end="131.18">meltdown when it's raining for example</span> <span data-start="131.18" data-end="132.39">the</span> <span data-start="132.39" data-end="135">thing is utility right you you created</span> <span data-start="135" data-end="136.74">your fantastic temple you forgot to put</span> <span data-start="136.74" data-end="140.16">in the doors and you know you can't go</span> <span data-start="140.16" data-end="142.86">into it so it doesn't really work so so</span> <span data-start="142.86" data-end="144.27">you need to have something that doesn't</span> <span data-start="144.27" data-end="146.37">fall down and something that you can</span> <span data-start="146.37" data-end="148.92">actually use but it's more interesting</span> <span data-start="148.92" data-end="151.17">the third characteristic that a good</span> <span data-start="151.17" data-end="156.02">architecture must have and is beauty and</span> <span data-start="156.02" data-end="158.73">you can see how for example for a church</span> <span data-start="158.73" data-end="161.28">or for a temple or for even for a house</span> <span data-start="161.28" data-end="164.31">or a villa it may be something obvious</span> <span data-start="164.31" data-end="166.86">right you want it to be beautiful but</span> <span data-start="166.86" data-end="170.15">how does it work with code right and</span> <span data-start="170.15" data-end="173.519">this is open to interpretation and but</span> <span data-start="173.519" data-end="178.28">in our case we certainly have</span> <span data-start="178.28" data-end="182.9">interpreted this as to mean performance</span> <span data-start="182.9" data-end="185.85">so for us it's important that the code</span> <span data-start="185.85" data-end="187.769">that we that we build is very efficient</span> <span data-start="187.769" data-end="190.86">and efficiency is the ability to do</span> <span data-start="190.86" data-end="194.76">something without without waste so there</span> <span data-start="194.76" data-end="200.37">is one good way that we a method that we</span> <span data-start="200.37" data-end="203.61">know all about that is very very</span> <span data-start="203.61" data-end="205.799">efficient and allows us to get to</span> <span data-start="205.799" data-end="211.019">solutions which perform that maximize</span> <span data-start="211.019" data-end="214.769">the performance very easily and that</span> <span data-start="214.769" data-end="218.04">method is the scientific method so if</span> <span data-start="218.04" data-end="219.66">you think about it</span> <span data-start="219.66" data-end="221.489">when when people when you have</span> <span data-start="221.489" data-end="225.769">scientists doing science what they do is</span> <span data-start="225.769" data-end="231.94">they have some observations and they</span> <span data-start="231.95" data-end="235.38">think of a theory or some model that</span> <span data-start="235.38" data-end="237.329">will explain the observed observations</span> <span data-start="237.329" data-end="238.65">and use that model to make predictions</span> <span data-start="238.65" data-end="243.09">and then they make experiments and then</span> <span data-start="243.09" data-end="245.04">they verify whether these experiments</span> <span data-start="245.04" data-end="248.7">are actually are actually confirming or</span> <span data-start="248.7" data-end="250.709">disproving their policies so the most</span> <span data-start="250.709" data-end="252.29">important meeting here are these three</span> <span data-start="252.29" data-end="256.68">the small 3-step cycle here you know</span> <span data-start="256.68" data-end="259.95">where you gather we gather data you</span> <span data-start="259.95" data-end="263.099">refine and alter expand so you analyze</span> <span data-start="263.099" data-end="263.669">your day</span> <span data-start="263.669" data-end="266.28">and you build new theories all the time</span> <span data-start="266.28" data-end="269.729">and we basically did something very</span> <span data-start="269.729" data-end="273.779">similar so when we when we do code we</span> <span data-start="273.779" data-end="277.68">build build code we build the product we</span> <span data-start="277.68" data-end="280.71">measure performance and then we analyze</span> <span data-start="280.71" data-end="283.56">the measurements and this allows us to</span> <span data-start="283.56" data-end="287.969">define how to build the rest the rest of</span> <span data-start="287.969" data-end="291.3">the product so the first thing that</span> <span data-start="291.3" data-end="295.34">anybody is going to ask you if you are a</span> <span data-start="295.34" data-end="298.74">customer and you want someone to design</span> <span data-start="298.74" data-end="300.9">a church for you they're going to ask</span> <span data-start="300.9" data-end="302.939">you okay so you want like something</span> <span data-start="302.939" data-end="305.46">small what's your budget you know or</span> <span data-start="305.46" data-end="309.419">something big so knowing the</span> <span data-start="309.419" data-end="312">characteristics of what you're building</span> <span data-start="312" data-end="317.219">is very important and therefore this</span> <span data-start="317.219" data-end="318.659">this whole talk would be meaningless</span> <span data-start="318.659" data-end="320.669">unless I told you a little bit about</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="320.669" data-end="323.669">Stack Overflow and the kind of scale</span> <span data-start="323.669" data-end="326.58">that we have so you can sort of relate</span> <span data-start="326.58" data-end="329.909">or or see why we go to such lengths to</span> <span data-start="329.909" data-end="334.4">do to do these things so first of all</span> <span data-start="334.4" data-end="337.349">this is the top sites according to</span> <span data-start="337.349" data-end="340.229">contest which is one of the two top</span> <span data-start="340.229" data-end="343.319">measurement agencies that tell you how</span> <span data-start="343.319" data-end="345.509">many unique visitors you have every</span> <span data-start="345.509" data-end="349.86">month that were Flo would be between 17</span> <span data-start="349.86" data-end="352.71">or 18 it's not there for a couple of</span> <span data-start="352.71" data-end="354.719">reasons and but the most important one</span> <span data-start="354.719" data-end="357.389">is that we have our traffic is actually</span> <span data-start="357.389" data-end="360.689">split around all our network of sites so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="360.689" data-end="362.31">Stack Overflow is part of a larger</span> <span data-start="362.31" data-end="367.8">network of 160 different sites with</span> <span data-start="367.8" data-end="369.539">different topics that go from cooking to</span> <span data-start="369.539" data-end="373.589">English to Japanese to philosophy or</span> <span data-start="373.589" data-end="378.81">physics so Quantcast doesn't really work</span> <span data-start="378.81" data-end="381.379">very well for this kind of setup and</span> <span data-start="381.379" data-end="384.33">therefore it is split all the traffic in</span> <span data-start="384.33" data-end="386.789">different blocks but putting them</span> <span data-start="386.789" data-end="388.979">together we would be somewhere between</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="388.979" data-end="393.92">Wikipedia and people which is pretty big</span> <span data-start="393.93" data-end="396.06">by the way I was telling you is not very</span> <span data-start="396.06" data-end="398.13">you know podcast is not very reliable I</span> <span data-start="398.13" data-end="400.8">can tell you why so does anybody</span> <span data-start="400.8" data-end="403.23">remember this coming out maybe in</span> <span data-start="403.23" data-end="403.97">September</span> <span data-start="403.97" data-end="406.59">so basically North Korea screwed up</span> <span data-start="406.59" data-end="408.57">there there both the router</span> <span data-start="408.57" data-end="411">configuration and turns out they have 28</span> <span data-start="411" data-end="414.81">websites in the whole country so you can</span> <span data-start="414.81" data-end="418.77">imagine them you know or like there and</span> <span data-start="418.77" data-end="421.5">according to Qantas what are they</span> <span data-start="421.5" data-end="427.659">looking at Stack Overflow</span> <span data-start="427.669" data-end="430.29">so apparently we are very popular in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="430.29" data-end="431.79">North Korea so now you can trust this</span> <span data-start="431.79" data-end="437.66">numbers clearly but okay it's just funny</span> <span data-start="437.66" data-end="440.79">so I think in some version of this talk</span> <span data-start="440.79" data-end="446.97">since 2013 when I when I started giving</span> <span data-start="446.97" data-end="451.38">this talk we had somewhere around 100</span> <span data-start="451.38" data-end="453.33">websites in our network that was talking</span> <span data-start="453.33" data-end="457.74">about nowadays we have 160 and we are</span> <span data-start="457.74" data-end="462.75">still growing of course and these are</span> <span data-start="462.75" data-end="463.47">pageviews</span> <span data-start="463.47" data-end="466.35">so again Quantcast so believe it you</span> <span data-start="466.35" data-end="467.58">know take it or leave it</span> <span data-start="467.58" data-end="470.94">but we were around 400 million pageviews</span> <span data-start="470.94" data-end="472.95">per month when I joined and we're</span> <span data-start="472.95" data-end="475.89">talking about this and nowadays we are</span> <span data-start="475.89" data-end="479.1">actually over 1 1 billion 1.2 billion</span> <span data-start="479.1" data-end="481.289">per month and this is not really up to</span> <span data-start="481.289" data-end="486.51">date on the other hand the number of web</span> <span data-start="486.51" data-end="491.16">servers was one in 2008 when the when</span> <span data-start="491.16" data-end="494.13">the site started then he grew a bit to</span> <span data-start="494.13" data-end="495.66">five in two thousand nine thousand ten</span> <span data-start="495.66" data-end="498.51">and then 2011 we went to nine web</span> <span data-start="498.51" data-end="501.53">servers and ever since then I started</span> <span data-start="501.53" data-end="504.9">talking and we grew like we doubled up</span> <span data-start="504.9" data-end="506.639">our traffic tripled our traffic and we</span> <span data-start="506.639" data-end="511.08">still online web servers so to give you</span> <span data-start="511.08" data-end="515.49">an idea I was looking today at some</span> <span data-start="515.49" data-end="518.279">stats for some other sites which are</span> <span data-start="518.279" data-end="522.599">there in the in that list so Pinterest</span> <span data-start="522.599" data-end="524.85">which is two steps of on top of us</span> <span data-start="524.85" data-end="526.85">in 2012 the what</span> <span data-start="526.85" data-end="532.44">150 servers Wikipedia which is I think</span> <span data-start="532.44" data-end="536.19">below us or just above us I have more or</span> <span data-start="536.19" data-end="537.96">less 10 times the amount of hardware</span> <span data-start="537.96" data-end="543.72">that we have so how do we do this we do</span> <span data-start="543.72" data-end="547.58">this with this small poor man's</span> <span data-start="547.58" data-end="549.95">scientific method build measure analyze</span> <span data-start="549.95" data-end="551.61">so I'm going to give you a few examples</span> <span data-start="551.61" data-end="556.64">very quickly because time runs out so</span> <span data-start="556.64" data-end="559.35">first of all with the hardware so this</span> <span data-start="559.35" data-end="562.86">is an actual picture of our own server</span> <span data-start="562.86" data-end="566.91">farm server farm three racks and as you</span> <span data-start="566.91" data-end="569.16">can see there is not much there and</span> <span data-start="569.16" data-end="572.43">they're mostly databases all the stuff</span> <span data-start="572.43" data-end="575.55">that you see up here all these numerous</span> <span data-start="575.55" data-end="577.7">things here they're all these drives</span> <span data-start="577.7" data-end="580.56">because we have a lot of content right</span> <span data-start="580.56" data-end="583.5">so our main concern is actually running</span> <span data-start="583.5" data-end="586.94">out of space is not running out of power</span> <span data-start="586.94" data-end="591.57">so what do we do we serve the site and</span> <span data-start="591.57" data-end="593.04">then we have this fantastic dashboard</span> <span data-start="593.04" data-end="594.45">which is an open source project called</span> <span data-start="594.45" data-end="599.1">observer which allows you to measure the</span> <span data-start="599.1" data-end="601.44">performance of all the servers in it and</span> <span data-start="601.44" data-end="604.589">as you can see in this screenshot can</span> <span data-start="604.589"

data-start="1408.559" data-end="1411.77">actually use see you couldn't just</span> <span data-start="1411.77" data-end="1414.679">create something out of nowhere the way</span> <span data-start="1414.679" data-end="1416.87">to do to do it of course is you know to</span> <span data-start="1416.87" data-end="1419.21">ask the runtime okay give me a chunk of</span> <span data-start="1419.21" data-end="1421.4">memory then you use it and then you give</span> <span data-start="1421.4" data-end="1422.69">it back and say okay I don't need it</span> <span data-start="1422.69" data-end="1424.73">anymore if you forget to give it back</span> <span data-start="1424.73" data-end="1426.59">then you keep on using more and more</span> <span data-start="1426.59" data-end="1428.299">memory and then at the end you run out</span> <span data-start="1428.299" data-end="1431.24">of memory but in a managed language like</span> <span data-start="1431.24" data-end="1433.429">like JavaScript or C sharp you don't</span> <span data-start="1433.429" data-end="1434.809">actually need to give that memory</span> <span data-start="1434.809" data-end="1437.03">because the system is so smart that he</span> <span data-start="1437.03" data-end="1438.47">figures out okay you don't need this</span> <span data-start="1438.47" data-end="1440.69">stuff anymore so I'll just reclaim the</span> <span data-start="1440.69" data-end="1443.3">memory for you and this is done by a</span> <span data-start="1443.3" data-end="1444.06">thread</span> <span data-start="1444.06" data-end="1445.86">and bacon thread called the garbage</span> <span data-start="1445.86" data-end="1447.78">collector and what it does it takes all</span> <span data-start="1447.78" data-end="1450.87">your objects all your functions all your</span> <span data-start="1450.87" data-end="1454.23">contexts and goes through and see which</span> <span data-start="1454.23" data-end="1456.21">one depends on which and which one is</span> <span data-start="1456.21" data-end="1458.7">still alive which one is otoscope and</span> <span data-start="1458.7" data-end="1461.97">then it clears up all the space this is</span> <span data-start="1461.97" data-end="1463.62">great because it allows your code to be</span> <span data-start="1463.62" data-end="1465.96">very simple but it sucks</span> <span data-start="1465.96" data-end="1469.68">because in order to do this the garbage</span> <span data-start="1469.68" data-end="1472.16">collector needs to actually freeze all</span> <span data-start="1472.16" data-end="1474.84">all your code from prevent your home</span> <span data-start="1474.84" data-end="1476.55">from running at some point and just</span> <span data-start="1476.55" data-end="1479.1">clear up everything so if you got if you</span> <span data-start="1479.1" data-end="1481.08">create a lot of instances or if you get</span> <span data-start="1481.08" data-end="1485.18">create very complicated instances then</span> <span data-start="1485.18" data-end="1488.61">this becomes this becomes complicated</span> <span data-start="1488.61" data-end="1490.77">and it takes a long time so you don't</span> <span data-start="1490.77" data-end="1492.63">want to do that one example is</span> <span data-start="1492.63" data-end="1494.55">dependency injection so it is something</span> <span data-start="1494.55" data-end="1496.71">that you do a lot with with testing</span> <span data-start="1496.71" data-end="1499.44">right so instead of creating objects</span> <span data-start="1499.44" data-end="1501.99">instead of getting them from the DB what</span> <span data-start="1501.99" data-end="1505.41">do you do you create a container and</span> <span data-start="1505.41" data-end="1508.08">that container is a magic object and</span> <span data-start="1508.08" data-end="1510.03">knows how to build stuff and it knows</span> <span data-start="1510.03" data-end="1511.65">whether you're testing or not testing</span> <span data-start="1511.65" data-end="1513.36">and if you're testing use your test</span> <span data-start="1513.36" data-end="1515.49">object and if you're not testing it's</span> <span data-start="1515.49" data-end="1517.77">going to give you the real object so you</span> <span data-start="1517.77" data-end="1519.84">can like the couple stuff you can do</span> <span data-start="1519.84" data-end="1522.36">stuff without going to the database and</span> <span data-start="1522.36" data-end="1524.25">so on all right you can do fantastic</span> <span data-start="1524.25" data-end="1527.1">stuff like this right so you go to the</span> <span data-start="1527.1" data-end="1529.8">repository say I want to get this thing</span> <span data-start="1529.8" data-end="1533.43">and then and you don't know what it does</span> <span data-start="1533.43" data-end="1535.56">right it could be if we go into a mock</span> <span data-start="1535.56" data-end="1537.72">object but in this case it particularly</span> <span data-start="1537.72" data-end="1540.27">is doing a lot of things like it's the</span> <span data-start="1540.27" data-end="1541.95">invalidation security login and so on</span> <span data-start="1541.95" data-end="1545.79">and you can't do this again because in</span> <span data-start="1545.79" data-end="1547.23">reality what you're doing behind the</span> <span data-start="1547.23" data-end="1549.93">scenes in the in the in the repositories</span> <span data-start="1549.93" data-end="1551.46">you're creating a bunch of objects with</span> <span data-start="1551.46" data-end="1554.4">all this stuff and we can't do that in</span> <span data-start="1554.4" data-end="1557.31">fact we can't do that and therefore</span> <span data-start="1557.31" data-end="1559.85">testing gets really really hard and</span> <span data-start="1559.85" data-end="1563.82">therefore there you go we have very very</span> <span data-start="1563.82" data-end="1566.58">few tests in the code basically we don't</span> <span data-start="1566.58" data-end="1572.62">unit us at all so</span> <span data-start="1572.62" data-end="1577.18">build measure analyze more stuff right</span> <span data-start="1577.18" data-end="1580.09">so I was telling you about about unit</span> <span data-start="1580.09" data-end="1585.88">tests right yeah that's the most</span> <span data-start="1585.88" data-end="1588.4">interesting man in the world so that's</span> <span data-start="1588.4" data-end="1593.86">pretty much a testing strategy so what</span> <span data-start="1593.86" data-end="1595.54">happens when you when you do this right</span> <span data-start="1595.54" data-end="1598.78">so what happens is okay if you do it in</span> <span data-start="1598.78" data-end="1600.25">your likes or during a financial</span> <span data-start="1600.25" data-end="1604">institution it's really bad if you're a</span> <span data-start="1604" data-end="1605.62">site like Stack Overflow with your main</span> <span data-start="1605.62" data-end="1609.37">customers are developers you get bug</span> <span data-start="1609.37" data-end="1614.35">reports right so we have automated</span> <span data-start="1614.35" data-end="1620.14">testers actually a lot of them do</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1620.14" data-end="1624.01">JavaScript and what happens is we</span> <span data-start="1624.01" data-end="1629.26">actually get the solution so there you</span> <span data-start="1629.26" data-end="1631.78">go see this is how you approximate stuff</span> <span data-start="1631.78" data-end="1633.49">so you know you do the best of your</span> <span data-start="1633.49" data-end="1642.81">condition anyway so</span> <span data-start="1642.82" data-end="1645.17">anyways if you think you have pressure</span> <span data-start="1645.17" data-end="1647.3">we do our pressure okay so we go down</span> <span data-start="1647.3" data-end="1650.36">and we go we go on TechCrunch okay this</span> <span data-start="1650.36" data-end="1655.44">is not it's not a fake</span> <span data-start="1655.45" data-end="1657.92">okay build measure analyze and it's</span> <span data-start="1657.92" data-end="1659.93">another cycle that we have okay it's not</span> <span data-start="1659.93" data-end="1664.55">exactly that in practice is you know you</span> <span data-start="1664.55" data-end="1668.03">hire great programmers or programmers</span> <span data-start="1668.03" data-end="1669.95">that really have a lot of passion for</span> <span data-start="1669.95" data-end="1670.69">what they do</span> <span data-start="1670.69" data-end="1675.86">hackers and then you give them the right</span> <span data-start="1675.86" data-end="1677.36">tools for the job</span> <span data-start="1677.36" data-end="1679.88">right so you empower them you give them</span> <span data-start="1679.88" data-end="1682.07">you know the harder the one the softer</span> <span data-start="1682.07" data-end="1686.15">they want the trust they want and what</span> <span data-start="1686.15" data-end="1687.77">they do is create great code or</span> <span data-start="1687.77" data-end="1691.7">performant code and having a great code</span> <span data-start="1691.7" data-end="1693.41">base I mean if successful product is</span> <span data-start="1693.41" data-end="1696.14">what gets you again there are kind of</span> <span data-start="1696.14" data-end="1697.67">people that you want to have in your</span> <span data-start="1697.67" data-end="1700.22">company so isn't there a kind of cycle</span> <span data-start="1700.22" data-end="1701.75">that we have but we are very conscious</span> <span data-start="1701.75" data-end="1703.61">about it and it's very much</span> <span data-start="1703.61" data-end="1705.94">part of what we do on a day to day basis</span> <span data-start="1705.94" data-end="1710.15">and so I was just going to talk about</span> <span data-start="1710.15" data-end="1712.22">hackers and this what came out like a</span> <span data-start="1712.22" data-end="1715.34">90s movie so no real hackers look like</span> <span data-start="1715.34" data-end="1719.69">this okay not really in the seventies</span> <span data-start="1719.69" data-end="1722.45">though can anybody guess what company</span> <span data-start="1722.45" data-end="1731.3">disease yeah so yes so we have a policy</span> <span data-start="1731.3" data-end="1732.86">where you can get all all the all the</span> <span data-start="1732.86" data-end="1734.81">tools that you want and if having three</span> <span data-start="1734.81" data-end="1738.32">monitors is absolutely normal and you</span> <span data-start="1738.32" data-end="1741.23">know having your favorite like clicky</span> <span data-start="1741.23" data-end="1743.54">keyboard or you know visual studio if</span> <span data-start="1743.54" data-end="1745.46">you need it or whatever so it's</span> <span data-start="1745.46" data-end="1748.85">important to have all this thing coding</span> <span data-start="1748.85" data-end="1752.96">wise we do stuff that okay people are</span> <span data-start="1752.96" data-end="1755.03">actually I've been discouraged from</span> <span data-start="1755.03" data-end="1758.45">doing in all the other jobs I had like</span> <span data-start="1758.45" data-end="1762.1">for example they compiling your</span> <span data-start="1762.1" data-end="1765.17">intermediate code that gets rendered is</span> <span data-start="1765.17" data-end="1767.06">something maybe you don't do we no js'</span> <span data-start="1767.06" data-end="1768.89">but we do it all the time to in order to</span> <span data-start="1768.89" data-end="1771.59">to improve performance or if you look at</span> <span data-start="1771.59" data-end="1771.99">it</span> <span data-start="1771.99" data-end="1773.88">with queries look at the query plans of</span> <span data-start="1773.88" data-end="1776.16">the my security plans and look at all</span> <span data-start="1776.16" data-end="1778.17">the little bits and tweaks you can put</span> <span data-start="1778.17" data-end="1782.01">into to make it's just likely faster all</span> <span data-start="1782.01" data-end="1784.1">right so it's a cycle again you know</span> <span data-start="1784.1" data-end="1788.84">hackers tools and and results are code</span> <span data-start="1788.84" data-end="1793.1">so in conclusion I have 15 seconds</span> <span data-start="1793.1" data-end="1796.05">okay so performance is a feature and not</span> <span data-start="1796.05" data-end="1798.51">a luxury at least for us as I was</span> <span data-start="1798.51" data-end="1801.24">telling you you know you want this site</span> <span data-start="1801.24" data-end="1803.91">it doesn't fall down and you want a site</span> <span data-start="1803.91" data-end="1806.25">that is usable and but it's you want to</span> <span data-start="1806.25"
