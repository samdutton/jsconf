</p>
<p><span data-start="240.15" data-end="246.93">Web OS as well and basically it</span> <span data-start="246.93" data-end="249.45">developed like RSS readers and like</span> <span data-start="249.45" data-end="254.04">music box and video players as well or</span> <span data-start="254.04" data-end="261.69">in 10 e 1 Y browser I'm sorry</span> <span data-start="261.7" data-end="264.67">and recently it uses all the latest like</span> <span data-start="264.67" data-end="270.37">html5 technologies for instance it used</span> <span data-start="270.37" data-end="272.83">the notification API for its chat system</span> <span data-start="272.83" data-end="277.93">and it also uses the the geolocation API</span> <span data-start="277.93" data-end="283.42">for its map and the Audio API for is</span> <span data-start="283.42" data-end="287.23">music player and for this core chat</span> <span data-start="287.23" data-end="290.77">application online it uses a WebSocket</span> <span data-start="290.77" data-end="293.89">by default for browsers that support</span> <span data-start="293.89" data-end="299.23">html5 and it uses flash enabled flesh</span> <span data-start="299.23" data-end="301.12">sockets for browsers that doesn't</span> <span data-start="301.12" data-end="304.18">support html5 browsers and it uses like</span> <span data-start="304.18" data-end="308.52">long polling for like no flash browsers</span> <span data-start="308.52" data-end="312.82">and of course it is asleep is uses like</span> <span data-start="312.82" data-end="317.05">css3 video API canvas API in WebGL 48</span> <span data-start="317.05" data-end="323.38">games and other applications but that is</span> <span data-start="323.38" data-end="325.81">quite common as we all seen those things</span> <span data-start="325.81" data-end="328.09">in the in other parts of the world as</span> <span data-start="328.09" data-end="330.85">well but what is more exciting is about</span> <span data-start="330.85" data-end="333.88">how startups come up with more creative</span> <span data-start="333.88" data-end="337.66">solutions for problem solving and one</span> <span data-start="337.66" data-end="341.07">problem we know that when we are doing a</span> <span data-start="341.07" data-end="344.05">smartphone application is that if you're</span> <span data-start="344.05" data-end="345.97">running it in the browser itself on a</span> <span data-start="345.97" data-end="348.79">smartphone the performance can be a</span> <span data-start="348.79" data-end="351.88">problem especially in like Asian</span> <span data-start="351.88" data-end="353.68">countries like people are kind of like</span> <span data-start="353.68" data-end="356.59">more pragmatic you know like they care</span> <span data-start="356.59" data-end="359.65">about the development course edited the</span> <span data-start="359.65" data-end="363.64">development costs and as well as how can</span> <span data-start="363.64" data-end="366.58">you find such good developers who can</span> <span data-start="366.58" data-end="369.43">make it like work smoothly and no</span> <span data-start="369.43" data-end="373.42">flickering problems and so this startup</span> <span data-start="373.42" data-end="375.22">called app can come up with a quite</span> <span data-start="375.22" data-end="377.23">interesting solution it's basically a</span> <span data-start="377.23" data-end="379.63">hybrid smartphone solution and it works</span> <span data-start="379.63" data-end="385.12">for iOS Android and Windows 8 and it is</span> <span data-start="385.12" data-end="388.33">bit similar to a phonegap but is but it</span> <span data-start="388.33" data-end="391.54">also has some kind of difference so with</span> <span data-start="391.54" data-end="394.06">these kind of solutions like this has</span> <span data-start="394.06" data-end="395.59">become like cliche like</span> <span data-start="395.59" data-end="398.74">web versus native because this app can</span> <span data-start="398.74" data-end="402.31">has basically a App Engine so basically</span> <span data-start="402.31" data-end="404.29">you're right you're called in html5 and</span> <span data-start="404.29" data-end="409.48">css3 and can compile it into a app using</span> <span data-start="409.48" data-end="411.46">the app engine and it comes with the</span> <span data-start="411.46" data-end="415.33">developer SDK as well and as well as app</span> <span data-start="415.33" data-end="418.99">analytics and it has also its own push</span> <span data-start="418.99" data-end="422.5">notification but we all know that</span> <span data-start="422.5" data-end="424.69">phonegap can pretty much do the same</span> <span data-start="424.69" data-end="426.88">thing so what is like the difference</span> <span data-start="426.88" data-end="430.27">like if you're using phonegap most</span> <span data-start="430.27" data-end="432.25">probably you are building a what all in</span> <span data-start="432.25" data-end="435.01">one page application so basically is in</span> </p>
