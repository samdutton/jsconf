data-start="893.12" data-end="895.91">and especially as you move down through</span> <span data-start="895.91" data-end="898.16">the tower the audio environment of each</span> <span data-start="898.16" data-end="901.339">room shifts and fades in and out and all</span> <span data-start="901.339" data-end="903.29">of that is done by amplifying and</span> <span data-start="903.29" data-end="905.089">attenuating very and fading in and</span> <span data-start="905.089" data-end="907.04">fading out various tracks as it's about</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="907.04" data-end="909.62">I think is that there's about 50 tiny</span> <span data-start="909.62" data-end="911.329">audio tracks involved in that whole</span> <span data-start="911.329" data-end="914.779">thing so it's this concert of audio</span> <span data-start="914.779" data-end="916.699">tracks that is all controlled by buzz</span> <span data-start="916.699" data-end="918.41">Jay yes and a great thing is that</span> <span data-start="918.41" data-end="921.68">because it's not one long audio track it</span> <span data-start="921.68" data-end="926.68">can really respond to the to the viewers</span> <span data-start="926.68" data-end="928.79">actions and button presses hang on a</span> <span data-start="928.79" data-end="930.86">second I've lost it I've lost a cursor</span> <span data-start="930.86" data-end="937.01">there it is so that was Dark Tower and</span> <span data-start="937.01" data-end="938.6">as I said like usually when you produce</span> <span data-start="938.6" data-end="940.85">audio it's it's you have all of these</span> <span data-start="940.85" data-end="942.199">different discrete tracks and you mix</span> <span data-start="942.199" data-end="944.089">them all down to one track whereas with</span> <span data-start="944.089" data-end="946.76">buzz Jay s what we did was we had all of</span> <span data-start="946.76" data-end="948.35">these different tracks going on at once</span> <span data-start="948.35" data-end="950.089">and depending on the events that happen</span> <span data-start="950.089" data-end="952.19">through the viewer you they turn on and</span> <span data-start="952.19" data-end="954.709">off they fade in and out so this was</span> <span data-start="954.709" data-end="955.85">great to create like a really</span> <span data-start="955.85" data-end="957.949">atmospheric and rich audio environment</span> <span data-start="957.949" data-end="959.93">and it's also the best part it's really</span> <span data-start="959.93" data-end="963.68">easy to edit if you have one mix down</span> <span data-start="963.68" data-end="965.06">track if you need to make a change</span> <span data-start="965.06" data-end="966.98">you've got to like go back into the da W</span> <span data-start="966.98" data-end="968.6">inline-6 a little bit and then mix it</span> <span data-start="968.6" data-end="970.31">all down again and export it whereas</span> <span data-start="970.31" data-end="973.1">this you can change just a little bit if</span> <span data-start="973.1" data-end="975.26">like the beginning part there that I was</span> <span data-start="975.26" data-end="976.85">showing you I think there were seven</span> <span data-start="976.85" data-end="979.13">audio tracks playing at that point but</span> <span data-start="979.13" data-end="980.63">you know there's a wind there's a</span> <span data-start="980.63" data-end="983.6">mechanical roar there's the rain there's</span> <span data-start="983.6" data-end="984.92">the vocal there's like all this stuff</span> <span data-start="984.92" data-end="987.529">going on and if you want to change or</span> <span data-start="987.529" data-end="989.779">adjust any of that environment you only</span> <span data-start="989.779" data-end="991.13">have to change you only have to edit one</span> <span data-start="991.13" data-end="993.44">little track put it back into the put it</span> <span data-start="993.44" data-end="995.87">back into the app and then it accepts</span> <span data-start="995.87" data-end="998.72">that change so that was what Dark Tower</span> <span data-start="998.72" data-end="1000.1">and that was something that I was really</span> <span data-start="1000.1" data-end="1003.01">inspired by audio wise was this idea of</span> <span data-start="1003.01" data-end="1006.24">being able to respond to audience events</span> <span data-start="1006.24" data-end="1008.26">the last thing I'm going to talk about</span> <span data-start="1008.26" data-end="1012.11">is what purpose we what purpose there is</span> <span data-start="1012.11" data-end="1016.43">with stories and stories were have</span> <span data-start="1016.43"

data-end="1021.38">are economical is that they want to sell</span> <span data-start="1021.38" data-end="1022.91">tickets so there was this idea of using</span> <span data-start="1022.91" data-end="1025.459">a story as an emotional experience that</span> <span data-start="1025.459" data-end="1026.959">you need to experience in a specific</span> <span data-start="1026.959" data-end="1029.15">place in a specific way and the reason</span> <span data-start="1029.15" data-end="1030.44">you did that is because want people to</span> <span data-start="1030.44" data-end="1032.42">sell tickets to buy tickets to have that</span> <span data-start="1032.42" data-end="1034.37">experience there's a lot of economical</span> <span data-start="1034.37"
