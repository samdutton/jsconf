<p><span data-start="6.95" data-end="11.88">hello all right thanks everybody for</span> <span data-start="11.88" data-end="14.269">coming out the title of my talk is</span> <span data-start="14.269" data-end="18">atomic components managing dynamic react</span> <span data-start="18" data-end="21.81">components using atomic design so just</span> <span data-start="21.81" data-end="23.55">quick show of hands who here is hurt</span> <span data-start="23.55" data-end="26.279">atomic atomic design previously great</span> <span data-start="26.279" data-end="30.75">awesome um who's heard of react okay all</span> <span data-start="30.75" data-end="33.329">right you're sort of redox and data</span> <span data-start="33.329" data-end="36.6">management flux okay okay great all</span> <span data-start="36.6" data-end="38.969">right so um this is going to assume some</span> <span data-start="38.969" data-end="42.629">prior knowledge of how data is managed</span> <span data-start="42.629" data-end="45">outside of just specific react</span> <span data-start="45" data-end="48.12">parent-child type stuff um going to</span> <span data-start="48.12" data-end="50.64">assume a little bit of prepare knowledge</span> <span data-start="50.64" data-end="54.51">about redox or flux just data cross</span> <span data-start="54.51" data-end="56.579">component communication via some sort of</span> <span data-start="56.579" data-end="59.129">you know third party however atomic</span> <span data-start="59.129" data-end="61.649">design you know will be will be getting</span> <span data-start="61.649" data-end="67.17">into um so my name is Joey I'm a</span> <span data-start="67.17" data-end="69.75">front-end developer at balderdash we are</span> <span data-start="69.75" data-end="72.09">no Jas consultants and maintain errs of</span> <span data-start="72.09" data-end="75.81">sales um that's that's my website find</span> <span data-start="75.81" data-end="78.81">me on the interwebs at yeah Jody doe</span> <span data-start="78.81" data-end="82.549">it's just my name mixed up all right</span> <span data-start="82.549" data-end="88.02">atomic design so what is atomic design</span> <span data-start="88.02" data-end="91.71">it is a methodology for creating design</span> <span data-start="91.71" data-end="94.77">systems and the way this works is that</span> <span data-start="94.77" data-end="98.72">it's broken up into five discrete levels</span> <span data-start="98.72" data-end="102.72">you have atoms molecules organisms</span> <span data-start="102.72" data-end="107.189">templates and pages um this was designed</span> <span data-start="107.189" data-end="110.22">by Brad frost and dave olson they um</span> <span data-start="110.22" data-end="112.829">have a little library to help you</span> <span data-start="112.829" data-end="116.93">organize your project in atomic design</span> <span data-start="116.93" data-end="120.18">called pattern lab pattern labs at i/o</span> <span data-start="120.18" data-end="124.619">and atomic design it lends a context</span> <span data-start="124.619" data-end="128.129">interfaces it's very client-facing it</span> <span data-start="128.129" data-end="132.88">helps I take some sort of</span> <span data-start="132.88" data-end="136.03">static mock up on these components are</span> <span data-start="136.03" data-end="139.48">these are these small pieces and allows</span> <span data-start="139.48" data-end="141.94">you to put an additional layer on top of</span> <span data-start="141.94" data-end="144.55">it which might sound like bloat but um</span> <span data-start="144.55" data-end="147.91">it it provides a sort of focus that</span> <span data-start="147.91" data-end="151.17">allows you to with these descriptions</span> <span data-start="151.17" data-end="154.81">communicate more easily across across a</span> <span data-start="154.81" data-end="157.93">team or explain to your client exactly</span> <span data-start="157.93" data-end="159.37">how this is going to work in a greater</span> <span data-start="159.37" data-end="163.92">flow of things why do we need it so</span> <span data-start="163.92" data-end="167.92">anytime we come across some sort of some</span> <span data-start="167.92" data-end="170.86">abstraction or conceptual blue we we</span> <span data-start="170.86" data-end="173.56">have to ask ourselves is the return</span> <span data-start="173.56" data-end="177.01">worth the investment right so long in</span> <span data-start="177.01" data-end="180.28">our case I know as developers we like to</span> <span data-start="180.28" data-end="182.53">maybe sometimes over design our</span> <span data-start="182.53" data-end="186.61">structures and our systems um just</span> <span data-start="186.61" data-end="188.56">because we feel like that's thorough but</span> <span data-start="188.56" data-end="190.54">when we already have something that's</span> <span data-start="190.54" data-end="193.81">you know on a pretty flat simple level</span> <span data-start="193.81" data-end="195.85">adding this canned a lot of times</span> <span data-start="195.85" data-end="198.52">bringing a focus to it an organization</span> <span data-start="198.52" data-end="202.24">that doesn't quite um exist well it</span> <span data-start="202.24" data-end="206.17">doesn't exist without it right so um the</span> <span data-start="206.17" data-end="208.77">atomic design in this case helps chunk</span> <span data-start="208.77" data-end="211.33">with these five components helps create</span> <span data-start="211.33" data-end="214.08">this artificial hierarchy of the</span> <span data-start="214.08" data-end="219.01">components in a mental way so how does</span> <span data-start="219.01" data-end="222.76">it do this well it breaks it down into</span> <span data-start="222.76" data-end="225.43">five atomic levels so on the Left we</span> <span data-start="225.43" data-end="231.01">have a small atom arm which I'm get</span> <span data-start="231.01" data-end="233.62">composed into molecules which then into</span> <span data-start="233.62" data-end="236.2">organisms int and then into templates</span> <span data-start="236.2" data-end="240.61">and then into actual pages so with atoms</span> <span data-start="240.61" data-end="242.2">and molecules and organisms what is an</span> <span data-start="242.2" data-end="244.98">atom right well an atom in our domain is</span> <span data-start="244.98" data-end="247.24">something like an input element or</span> <span data-start="247.24" data-end="250.23">button element just small very low level</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="250.23" data-end="254.95">HTML elements molecules would be a group</span> <span data-start="254.95" data-end="258.85">of these together let's say a search bar</span> <span data-start="258.85" data-end="261.549">right we have an input field and we have</span> <span data-start="261.549" data-end="263.47">a button that works with that input</span> <span data-start="263.47" data-end="266.27">field those together form some sort of</span> <span data-start="266.27" data-end="269.36">you I togetherness a concept in the UI</span> <span data-start="269.36" data-end="271.879">that is on we wouldn't think of them</span> <span data-start="271.879" data-end="273.62">separately so we can think of those as</span> <span data-start="273.62" data-end="277.039">an organ as a molecule then we take it a</span> <span data-start="277.039" data-end="279.47">step further and we say well that on</span> <span data-start="279.47" data-end="282.199">that search that search bar has a</span> <span data-start="282.199" data-end="284.509">further contacts usually in UI patterns</span> <span data-start="284.509" data-end="286.46">some and some sort of maybe a header</span> <span data-start="286.46" data-end="289.43">element or something like that it can be</span> <span data-start="289.43" data-end="293.999">anywhere I can um you know be in a</span> <span data-start="294.009" data-end="296.599">anywhere on the page but it still is</span> <span data-start="296.599" data-end="299.75">usually grouped into something that has</span> <span data-start="299.75" data-end="300.979">a greater context and that's where our</span> <span data-start="300.979" data-end="303.139">organisms come in at least an atomic</span> <span data-start="303.139" data-end="305.78">design so these are repeatable elements</span> <span data-start="305.78" data-end="308.63">or groups of molecules that tell a story</span> <span data-start="308.63" data-end="311.3">in the UI and so here's an example of</span> <span data-start="311.3" data-end="313.19">them right so at the top we obviously</span> <span data-start="313.19" data-end="316.49">have an atom underneath that we have</span> <span data-start="316.49" data-end="319.669">molecules we just have some sort of some</span> <span data-start="319.669" data-end="321.409">sort of text along with an input and the</span> <span data-start="321.409" data-end="323.21">button together those three atoms form a</span> <span data-start="323.21" data-end="325.28">molecule might be over explaining this I</span> <span data-start="325.28" data-end="327.039">think is pretty pretty intuitive</span> <span data-start="327.039" data-end="329.15">underneath that we have an organism we</span> <span data-start="329.15" data-end="331.28">have a logo we have some some navigation</span> <span data-start="331.28" data-end="333.469">links and then we have the search bar</span> <span data-start="333.469" data-end="335.569">together and that's in traditional</span> <span data-start="335.569" data-end="337.58">atomic design what's what's considered</span> <span data-start="337.58" data-end="342.11">an organism so outside of that Brad</span> <span data-start="342.11" data-end="343.94">frost recommends that we break our</span> <span data-start="343.94" data-end="346.13">chemistry analogy and we just completely</span> <span data-start="346.13" data-end="349.729">pivot into templates um because it quote</span> <span data-start="349.729" data-end="352.039">makes more sense to our clients in a lot</span> <span data-start="352.039" data-end="354.71">of way um these are the templates are</span> <span data-start="354.71" data-end="356.719">just groups of organisms that are</span> <span data-start="356.719" data-end="358.61">dedicated to a page level abstraction</span> <span data-start="358.61" data-end="361.55">and can moved around wireframe style the</span> <span data-start="361.55" data-end="365.029">the pages would be the actual instances</span> <span data-start="365.029" data-end="367.61">of those templates that are designed to</span> <span data-start="367.61" data-end="371.389">be deliverables so yeah okay that's</span> <span data-start="371.389" data-end="374.75">fantastic um it's great for documents</span> <span data-start="374.75" data-end="378.65">great for print but you know we don't</span> <span data-start="378.65" data-end="379.969">deal with that stuff anymore we're in a</span> <span data-start="379.969" data-end="383.15">post document arrow um we as react are</span> <span data-start="383.15" data-end="385.759">building user interfaces not necessarily</span> <span data-start="385.759" data-end="389.12">pages and style sheets and you know we</span> <span data-start="389.12" data-end="391.19">have one HTML document we're serving not</span> <span data-start="391.19" data-end="393.77">pages that match up one to one with the</span> <span data-start="393.77" data-end="396.86">styles or just views tied to specific</span> <span data-start="396.86" data-end="399.47">models we have things that we have</span> <span data-start="399.47" data-end="401.36">small components and groups of them that</span> <span data-start="401.36" data-end="404.66">need to have their own information it's</span> <span data-start="404.66" data-end="408.83">a very very pre spy idea so react does</span> <span data-start="408.83" data-end="410.3">have these very specific concerns as I</span> <span data-start="410.3" data-end="414.2">mentioned we we have these living</span> <span data-start="414.2" data-end="416.72">breathing life cycle driven components</span> <span data-start="416.72" data-end="419.48">with these contextual stores that model</span> <span data-start="419.48" data-end="421.37">are you I state anymore it's not like</span> <span data-start="421.37" data-end="423.23">we're just pulling anything out of a</span> <span data-start="423.23" data-end="426.95">database anymore the organism relates</span> <span data-start="426.95" data-end="430.46">only to other organisms in the atomic</span> <span data-start="430.46" data-end="432.86">metaphor and that they coexist in visual</span> <span data-start="432.86" data-end="436.16">space right along when along one one</span> <span data-start="436.16" data-end="438.47">another on the template or page this</span> <span data-start="438.47" data-end="439.73">says nothing about how they're going to</span> <span data-start="439.73" data-end="441.65">talk to each other it simply means a</span> <span data-start="441.65" data-end="444.02">visual organization and grouping and we</span> <span data-start="444.02" data-end="445.85">have concerns about how we can actually</span> <span data-start="445.85" data-end="447.65">make these things talk to one another</span> <span data-start="447.65" data-end="450.59">when when it comes to implementation we</span> <span data-start="450.59" data-end="453.65">lack that atomic principle so can we</span> <span data-start="453.65" data-end="459.02">solve that doesn't AMA caprent.com we as</span> <span data-start="459.02" data-end="461.99">react developers use the same metaphors</span> <span data-start="461.99" data-end="463.25">because they seem very useful right I</span> <span data-start="463.25" data-end="465.05">mean we start with you I we start with a</span> <span data-start="465.05" data-end="466.58">mock-up and then we chop it up and break</span> <span data-start="466.58" data-end="469.22">it down and organize them try to find</span> <span data-start="469.22" data-end="470.63">something cool with our directory and</span> <span data-start="470.63" data-end="472.4">good way to good way to put them</span> <span data-start="472.4" data-end="473.96">together so we can get this like actual</span> <span data-start="473.96" data-end="476.15">tangible feel with it so this is great</span> <span data-start="476.15" data-end="479.89">for that how can we use it arm luckily</span> <span data-start="479.89" data-end="483.29">pattern on pattern lab is designed a</span> <span data-start="483.29" data-end="485.65">very and very you know Foss manner it's</span> <span data-start="485.65" data-end="487.85">very flexible with naming a structure</span> <span data-start="487.85" data-end="489.74">it's brand new right a lot of stuff</span> <span data-start="489.74" data-end="491.419">we're seeing in the space is new and</span> <span data-start="491.419" data-end="494.09">open to change there's no one right way</span> <span data-start="494.09" data-end="496.04">to do it and we think that's just fine</span> <span data-start="496.04" data-end="498.229">main things as you please and we'll</span> <span data-start="498.229" data-end="500.56">leave the hair splitting out of things</span> <span data-start="500.56" data-end="502.61">fantastic all right so let's let's</span> <span data-start="502.61" data-end="504.169">rethink this how are we going to do this</span> <span data-start="504.169" data-end="508.16">well so what I've done is on we're gonna</span> <span data-start="508.16" data-end="511.01">we're going to not break after organisms</span> <span data-start="511.01" data-end="512.27">we're not going to pivot the templates</span> <span data-start="512.27" data-end="514.28">in pages we're instead going to extend</span> <span data-start="514.28" data-end="516.88">keep keep with this economic this</span> <span data-start="516.88" data-end="520.58">ecological metaphor and add to new</span> <span data-start="520.58" data-end="524.02">levels the ecosystem and the environment</span> <span data-start="524.02" data-end="526.13">so we'll go from atoms to molecules</span> <span data-start="526.13" data-end="528.32">organisms ecosystems and then into a</span> <span data-start="528.32" data-end="530.769">sort of larger environment</span> <span data-start="530.769" data-end="533.439">and what these do so we're also going to</span> <span data-start="533.439" data-end="536.319">slightly modify the organism arm there's</span> <span data-start="536.319" data-end="538.36">a problem with the organism I feel where</span> <span data-start="538.36" data-end="540.429">the organism is a top level minute</span> <span data-start="540.429" data-end="543.249">pivots anatomic design they say okay</span> <span data-start="543.249" data-end="546.1">yeah an organism can be either you know</span> <span data-start="546.1" data-end="548.199">the header the footer these groups of</span> <span data-start="548.199" data-end="549.939">molecules I get that we group these</span> <span data-start="549.939" data-end="551.889">molecules or let's say we have a product</span> <span data-start="551.889" data-end="553.179">grid we are right we have these</span> <span data-start="553.179" data-end="555.1">repeating products something it's a</span> <span data-start="555.1" data-end="556.929">repeatable container that's also an</span> <span data-start="556.929" data-end="559.689">organism and it's like okay so we we</span> <span data-start="559.689" data-end="563.019">have something that I understand the</span> <span data-start="563.019" data-end="564.999">grouping inside the header but we're</span> <span data-start="564.999" data-end="566.47">also just going to leverage this</span> <span data-start="566.47" data-end="568.749">organism because we want to pivot to</span> <span data-start="568.749" data-end="571.66">templates to describe product grids also</span> <span data-start="571.66" data-end="573.67">which are fundamentally different as</span> <span data-start="573.67" data-end="576.67">repeatable containers are not a big fan</span> <span data-start="576.67" data-end="580.299">so I say let's let's keep the organism</span> <span data-start="580.299" data-end="582.299">is repeatable container that's fine um</span> <span data-start="582.299" data-end="585.459">but now that we have these these new</span> <span data-start="585.459" data-end="588.1">concepts to leverage the ecosystem and</span> <span data-start="588.1" data-end="589.689">environment let's figure out if we can</span> <span data-start="589.689" data-end="592.629">we can take the context of what would</span> <span data-start="592.629" data-end="594.519">encompass some sort of header or footer</span> <span
