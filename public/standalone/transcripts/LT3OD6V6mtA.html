<p><span data-start="9.8" data-end="12.72">Hi, and thank you for coming to my talk.</span> <span data-start="12.72" data-end="15.96">Let's get started.</span> <span data-start="15.96" data-end="22.779">As you can tell from my outfit, I really, really like to build fun things with LEDs,</span> <span data-start="22.779" data-end="29.2">but I didn't know that I like to build fun things with LEDs until recently.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="29.2" data-end="32.79">I've built like this — this is one of my dogs.</span> <span data-start="32.79" data-end="38.14">Despite his cool demeanour, he is actually, like, very pumped when he gets his Rainbow</span> <span data-start="38.14" data-end="40.41">collar on because he gets a the lot of attention.</span> <span data-start="40.41" data-end="49.95">So, like I said, I haven't been working with Harbour that long, only — I didn't get into</span> <span data-start="49.95" data-end="56.65">Harvard because I had a practical problem to solve, I — for my free time, that doesn't</span> <span data-start="56.65" data-end="57.65">really appeal to me.</span> <span data-start="57.65" data-end="62.86">I like impractical things, and just doing things for fun.</span> <span data-start="62.86" data-end="69.859">I got inspired when I visited an art museum in Amsterdam, so this is the contemporary</span> <span data-start="69.859" data-end="78.84">art museum in Amsterdam, and I went to see an art exhibit by an artist called John Tingly.</span> <span data-start="78.84" data-end="84.94">He's a Swiss artist from the 1960s and 1970s, and, for him, art is not about standing in</span> <span data-start="84.94" data-end="88.749">a sterile, white space and distantly gazing as a silent painting.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="88.749" data-end="90.21">Art is meant to be playful.</span> <span data-start="90.21" data-end="95.46">He created these installations meant to be triggered by a viewer.</span> <span data-start="95.46" data-end="102.14">It was meant to incorporate the viewer's experience into the overall effects of the work of art,</span> <span data-start="102.14" data-end="108.259">and it was meant to intentionally blur the line between artists and viewer, so, he made</span> <span data-start="108.259" data-end="115.53">several art installations like this where you could pick a rotting utensil, or a pen,</span> <span data-start="115.53" data-end="121.81">put it into the art piece, and you trigger it, and it would create a new work of art</span> <span data-start="121.81" data-end="122.81">itself.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="122.81" data-end="129.319">It was no longer about just watching a process, by choosing a drawing tool, the viewer plays</span> <span data-start="129.319" data-end="134.48">a crucial role in the creation of an entirely new piece of art.</span> <span data-start="134.48" data-end="140.14">When I was at the exhibit, this quote by him stood out to me.</span> <span data-start="140.14" data-end="144.51">It said, "I wanted something ephemeral that would pass like a falling star.</span> <span data-start="144.51" data-end="151.06">It had to transpire, make people dream and talk, and this would be all."</span> <span data-start="151.06" data-end="156.459">I really liked this idea of art as this temporary experience that connects artist and viewer,</span> <span data-start="156.459" data-end="159.799">and it creates this intimate moment between strangers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="159.799" data-end="161.709">It is just spontaneous.</span> <span data-start="161.709" data-end="168.67">It is only meant to bring joy and inspire, and it only lasts a short amount of time.</span> <span data-start="168.67" data-end="169.9">That got me thinking.</span> <span data-start="169.9" data-end="175.069">I was very excited by all these ideas and things I had seen at the art museum, and I</span> <span data-start="175.069" data-end="182.349">wanted to figure out how I could use my skill set as a developer and make my own interactive</span> <span data-start="182.349" data-end="184.269">art experience.</span> <span data-start="184.269" data-end="189.769">But unlike John, I'm not an established artist.</span> <span data-start="189.769" data-end="196.239">I didn't have access to a studio space, I live in a really tiny studio apartment in</span> <span data-start="196.239" data-end="198.58">Amsterdam, so space is very limited.</span> <span data-start="198.58" data-end="202.209">I don't have a place to create and exhibit something.</span> <span data-start="202.209" data-end="210.099">So, I started thinking about how I could apply this idea to something that is really accessible,</span> <span data-start="210.099" data-end="214.939">and for me, that was my clothing.</span> <span data-start="214.939" data-end="216.43">As you can see, this is my outfit.</span> <span data-start="216.43" data-end="220.09">This is me out in Amsterdam.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="220.09" data-end="225.159">And then, I wanted to make — what was really important to me was to make a cohesive look.</span> <span data-start="225.159" data-end="230.769">I didn't want to throw some LEDs on a shirt, I wanted to create something co-ordinated,</span> <span data-start="230.769" data-end="235.84">and looked like a complete outfit.</span> <span data-start="235.84" data-end="241.73">So, as I started out, I was a web developer, first thought about the web app, would I wanted</span> <span data-start="241.73" data-end="247.879">to create a web app where users could pick colours and programmes and send it to my clothes.</span> <span data-start="247.879" data-end="255.63">The next step which was the stuff that had the most anxiety for me was actually building</span> <span data-start="255.63" data-end="256.63">the hard wear into clothing.</span> <span data-start="256.63" data-end="263.58">I had done some projects by — I had never done anything like this before.</span> <span data-start="263.58" data-end="268.65">And picking out the different pieces of hardware, orchestrating everything together.</span> <span data-start="268.65" data-end="273.12">Then the last piece of the puzzle would be sending the negligence from the web app to</span> <span data-start="273.12" data-end="275.36">the LEDs in my clothing.</span> <span data-start="275.36" data-end="281.56">For that, I used a library that I'm a huge fan of called socket IO, used it in my front-end</span> <span data-start="281.56" data-end="285.55">web development careers.</span> <span data-start="285.55" data-end="287.02">It is event-based messaging.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="287.02" data-end="290.59">It works in every browser on every device.</span> <span data-start="290.59" data-end="298.199">And it's pretty simple to set up, so I was confident that my ability to set this up.</span> <span data-start="298.199" data-end="301.03">So, I had this great plan.</span> <span data-start="301.03" data-end="302.03">I was super organised.</span> <span data-start="302.03" data-end="306.22">I thought everything was going to be really, really easy, but, as you can probably guess,</span> <span data-start="306.22" data-end="307.22">it wasn't.</span> <span data-start="307.22" data-end="310.5">Otherwise, I wouldn't have put that slide in!</span> <span data-start="310.5" data-end="314.71">I faced a lot of challenges.</span> <span data-start="314.71" data-end="320.31">At first, I thought most would come from wiring and soldering because it was just, like, the</span> <span data-start="320.31" data-end="325.37">most ambitious project I had taken on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="325.37" data-end="331.44">Even though I had setbacks during the project that frustrated my abilities, I thought I</span> <span data-start="331.44" data-end="339.02">would never get good at soldering, like figuring this stuff out, I tried not to let the setbacks</span> <span data-start="339.02" data-end="344.56">keep me down, and really building stuff, whether it is hardware or software is about building</span> <span data-start="344.56" data-end="349.349">iteration, improving on what you built.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="349.349" data-end="351.19">Let's start from the beginning.</span> <span data-start="351.19" data-end="357.68">Like I showed in an earlier slide, this is my road map for my project.</span> <span data-start="357.68" data-end="365.56">I would just have a web app, and a socket IO server, and just deploy that using Node</span> <span data-start="365.56" data-end="372.3">and Express on Heroku, and then my three pieces of clothing, buy umbrella, necklace, and skirt,</span> <span data-start="372.3" data-end="374.67">and those would be socket IO clients.</span> <span data-start="374.67" data-end="381.289">My main focus, I wasn't concentrating too much on the software, so I won't speak about</span> <span data-start="381.289" data-end="386.33">that now but focus on the hardware because that was my biggest obstacle.</span> <span data-start="386.33" data-end="393.289">Hardware: I needed to figure out how I was going to control the LEDs in my clothing.</span> <span data-start="393.289" data-end="395.31">I had a couple of requirements.</span> <span data-start="395.31" data-end="400.92">So it needed to be small.</span> <span data-start="400.92" data-end="404.139">It needed to be discreet, not be bulky.</span> <span data-start="404.139" data-end="411.09">I needed it to be durable.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="411.09" data-end="413.17">Since this is clothing, I'm going to take it on and off.</span> <span data-start="413.17" data-end="418.15">I wanted it to last so I could wear it many, many times.</span> <span data-start="418.15" data-end="423.64">And my last criteria was I needed Wi-Fi connectivity because this is how I envisioned that I would</span> <span data-start="423.64" data-end="431.69">be able to connect the hardware to receive messages, so I was tethering off my phone's</span> <span data-start="431.69" data-end="435.879">Wi-Fi hot spot.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="435.879" data-end="448.22">So in my case, I chose an Adrino because microcontrollers are really great for projects like this.</span> <span data-start="448.22" data-end="453.08">If you're not familiar, the difference between Adrino and Raspberry Pi, Adrino just runs</span> <span data-start="453.08" data-end="458.61">a loop, and it's really great when you want a programme to run, and it can be intermittently</span> <span data-start="458.61" data-end="464.77">interrupted and update its states, and do that, but it is just continually running a</span> <span data-start="464.77" data-end="469.15">loop and listening.</span> <span data-start="469.15" data-end="475.599">So I chose the Adrino.</span> <span data-start="475.599" data-end="484.889">It is small, it has Wi-Fi built in, and a big reason was people love this microprocessor</span> <span data-start="484.889" data-end="491.349">that uses the ESP8266, so there are lots of tutorials and information.</span> <span data-start="491.349" data-end="494.86">So I just felt pretty confident there was a lot of information where I could figure</span> <span data-start="494.86" data-end="497.069">things out on it.</span> <span data-start="497.069" data-end="499.229">I started on the building phase.</span> <span data-start="499.229" data-end="505.949">If you've never worked on the hardware, you might be curious what that looks like.</span> <span data-start="505.949" data-end="507.03">This is what it looks like.</span> <span data-start="507.03" data-end="509.919">It is not very glamorous in my case.</span> <span data-start="509.919" data-end="515.31">Like I said, I have a tiny apartment in Amsterdam, so I don't really have a work space.</span> <span data-start="515.31" data-end="523.01">It was mainly me sitting on a yoga mat on the floor just soldering and testing and repeating</span> <span data-start="523.01" data-end="528.62">the process for just each of these pieces.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="528.62" data-end="533.709">When I was ready to go out in public with this, I tried to think things through.</span> <span data-start="533.709" data-end="541.149">I didn't want to give people I was interacting with too much context, so I made up these</span> <span data-start="541.149" data-end="546.649">cards that I could hand without giving context to speak a lot to them where they could go</span> <span data-start="546.649" data-end="552.48">to the web app and interact with it themselves.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="552.48" data-end="554.709">So I took it out.</span> <span data-start="554.709" data-end="556.089">I took it out.</span> <span data-start="556.089" data-end="562.66">In Amsterdam, we have a lighted bike ride, people slap Christmas lights and things on</span> <span data-start="562.66" data-end="564.94">their bikes, so it is a lot of fun.</span> <span data-start="564.94" data-end="568.45">I decided to take it out.</span> <span data-start="568.45" data-end="573.41">I want to show you a video clip of what happened when I took it out.</span> <span data-start="573.41" data-end="578.06">As you can see, everything's running really good, and then my skirt goes green, and it's</span> <span data-start="578.06" data-end="582.75">going green, and it rebooted itself, you can see it's on a different programme to the rest</span> <span data-start="582.75" data-end="585.14">of my outfit.</span> <span data-start="585.14" data-end="589.29">My skirt kept crashing.</span> <span data-start="589.29" data-end="590.8">[Laughter].</span> <span data-start="590.8" data-end="596.68">For the people that are around me that weren't in tech, they were just mesmerised that this</span> <span data-start="596.68" data-end="598.54">was happening and I could control it.</span> <span data-start="598.54" data-end="606.27">All I could see was oh, crap, my skirt or umbrella kept crashing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="606.27" data-end="609.69">It was really embarrassing.</span> <span data-start="609.69" data-end="617.41">I thought I had built this really durable thing but it was actually pretty fragile.</span> <span data-start="617.41" data-end="621.55">I was embarrassed and disappointed.</span> <span data-start="621.55" data-end="631.03">I went on to iteration 2, or, how I tried to make it crash less.</span> <span data-start="631.03" data-end="636.76">With this particular Adrino that I'm using, when you plug it into your computer, you get</span> <span data-start="636.76" data-end="642.99">a monitor, so you can do statements like you do in JavaScript, like console.log statements,</span> <span data-start="642.99" data-end="650.92">and, as a JavaScript developer, that's how a lot of times I can quickly debug things.</span> <span data-start="650.92" data-end="657.67">As you can see from this sample of the log statements is that it kept disconnecting,</span> <span data-start="657.67" data-end="659.94">and reconnecting over and over again.</span> <span data-start="659.94" data-end="666.829">So, the Adrino was having trouble keeping a steady connection with my socket eye you</span> <span data-start="666.829" data-end="668.19">server.</span> <span data-start="668.19" data-end="675.22">I took a step back, and even though I'm a huge fan of socket IO, it is made for web</span> <span data-start="675.22" data-end="681.82">applications communicating over HTTP, and it's geared for browsers, so maybe I didn't</span> <span data-start="681.82" data-end="687.92">need that for an IoT project.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="687.92" data-end="691.99">Just because the library is available, even if it is a library that you really enjoy,</span> <span data-start="691.99" data-end="697">even if someone has created another version of that for your tech that you are using,</span> <span data-start="697" data-end="700.47">it might not be the best solution.</span> <span data-start="700.47" data-end="705.49">So I really just took a step back here, and thought about, again, what I was up against</span> <span data-start="705.49" data-end="707.96">when I'm quoting coding for hardware.</span> <span data-start="707.96" data-end="712.34">When you're coding for hardware, your resources are really at a premium.</span> <span data-start="712.34" data-end="720.44">There's just only so much memory and ram that you're allocated on these tiny, tiny microcontrollers,</span> <span data-start="720.44" data-end="726.05">and, since I wasn't communicating between a browser and a server for my hardware, maybe</span> <span data-start="726.05" data-end="731.089">I didn't need that extra overhead for HTTP, and I really just needed to find the bare</span> <span data-start="731.089" data-end="736.57">minimum but still easy to implement and understand messaging library possible.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="736.57" data-end="740.76">That's when I found out about MQTT.</span> <span data-start="740.76" data-end="744.88">MQTT is a machine-to-machine IoT protocol.</span> <span data-start="744.88" data-end="753.88">It is what Facebook uses for Facebook messenger to deliver in-sink messages.</span> <span data-start="753.88" data-end="758.49">It has been around for a while, invented in 1999 when engineers needed a solution that</span> <span data-start="758.49" data-end="764.13">would allow for minimal battery loss, and minimal bandwidth when connect ing sensors</span> <span data-start="764.13" data-end="770.44">from remote areas in Africa over a shoddy satellite connection.</span> <span data-start="770.44" data-end="777.88">I really could give a whole talk about how amazing MQTT is, but I just want to highlight</span> <span data-start="777.88" data-end="782.8">some of the things that really appealed to me and made we want to do the switch.</span> <span data-start="782.8" data-end="789.13">So, it's based on a published subscribe architecture, so there are clients that you can integrate</span> <span data-start="789.13" data-end="794.32">like in my web app, and the clothing, and there's a broker.</span> <span data-start="794.32" data-end="796.36">Client connect to the broker.</span> <span data-start="796.36" data-end="798.36">That mediates the communication.</span> <span data-start="798.36" data-end="808.73">What is a key parking of this architecture is that, when a device connects, it can subscribe</span> <span data-start="808.73" data-end="811.23">to topics.</span> <span data-start="811.23" data-end="817.329">When another another client puts in a message that was that topic, that has that topic,</span> <span data-start="817.329" data-end="820.889">it subscribes to it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="820.889" data-end="826.55">I like this architecture because the publisher and the subscribers don't need to know about</span> <span data-start="826.55" data-end="828.389">each other.</span> <span data-start="828.389" data-end="833.26">They don't have to run at the same time, and operations on both components are not halted</span> <span data-start="833.26" data-end="837.04">during the publishing or receiving of messages.</span> <span data-start="837.04" data-end="844.62">It's super, super lightweight, so it's transported over TCP/IP, it only has a two-byte overhead,</span> <span data-start="844.62" data-end="851.55">and they meant to keep it this way, keep these package headers really small, and every bit</span> <span data-start="851.55" data-end="857.19">in that packet is just carefully crafted to reduce the amount of data transmitted over</span> <span data-start="857.19" data-end="858.19">the networks.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="858.19" data-end="865.06">It means that in comparison to other protocols like HTTP, it doesn't load the network with</span> <span data-start="865.06" data-end="871.279">transfer of information, that's just necessary to allow the protocol to run.</span> <span data-start="871.279" data-end="876.77">And then, having this small overhead, it's really ideal for IoT because it lowers the</span> <span data-start="876.77" data-end="880.639">amount of data that might be transmitted over really constrained networks.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="880.639" data-end="888.44">And another thing I really like is the MQTT has a really short and readable spec, and</span> <span data-start="888.44" data-end="891.21">it uses simple verbs to describe actions.</span> <span data-start="891.21" data-end="900.86">Basically, there are five verbs in MQTT: connect, disconnect, publish, subscribe, and ping.</span> <span data-start="900.86" data-end="909.029">So I was really jazzed up about MQTT and I couldn't wait to switch out my socket IO client</span> <span data-start="909.029" data-end="913.04">and server and mews MQTT instead.</span> <span data-start="913.04" data-end="917.44">I started with the web app.</span> <span data-start="917.44" data-end="924.95">There is mqtt.js library, and you can Lewis it in the line ry.</span> <span data-start="924.95" data-end="932.17">It is written in the JavaScript, and you can use it in Node and in the browser.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="932.17" data-end="937.04">I think the code is pretty easy to follow, and that's one reason I really liked implementing</span> <span data-start="937.04" data-end="939.72">this because it is only really a few lines.</span> <span data-start="939.72" data-end="947.1">I require the library, and then I create a client that connects to the URL wherever in</span> <span data-start="947.1" data-end="953.85">the internet I have my broker created, and then, in this example, if I have a Rainbow</span> <span data-start="953.85" data-end="960.85">button to change my clothes, so I just create a function, so, whenever that button is clicked,</span> <span data-start="960.85" data-end="966.06">it sends a message to the broker with the topic lights, so that is what I have my outfit</span> <span data-start="966.06" data-end="973.44">clients subscribe to, and it can send a payload string of Rainbow.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="973.44" data-end="980.51">Next set up a client on Adrino.</span> <span data-start="980.51" data-end="986.38">Even if you're not familiar with Adrino C++ code, it's pretty much the same as the other</span> <span data-start="986.38" data-end="987.38">client.</span> <span data-start="987.38" data-end="994.089">Just include the library, I tell it where the broker is located, which on the web, where</span> <span data-start="994.089" data-end="1001.14">to find it, and it subscribes to the topic lights, and then, whenever a message is received,</span> <span data-start="1001.14" data-end="1007.63">just this message method is called, and then it can just interpret the messages sent, and</span> <span data-start="1007.63" data-end="1012.45">then figure out what programme it needs to switch to.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1012.45" data-end="1014.85">So I had my clients set up.</span> <span data-start="1014.85" data-end="1019.6">It was all going like pretty smoothly, and the next, I needed to set up the broker so</span> <span data-start="1019.6" data-end="1022.37">everything could talk to each other.</span> <span data-start="1022.37" data-end="1025.42">And I just want to show this slide again.</span> <span data-start="1025.42" data-end="1031.42">Like I said before, I deployed everything just on one express server on Heroku.</span> <span data-start="1031.42" data-end="1040.08">When I went to set up my brother, even though I love Heroku, I found out you don't have</span> <span data-start="1040.08" data-end="1041.08">port access.</span> <span data-start="1041.08" data-end="1048.91">You can't specify specific ports, and for this MQTT protocol, the port that specified</span> <span data-start="1048.91" data-end="1055.72">you need to use for communication is 1883, so that was a slight hiccup because I couldn't</span> <span data-start="1055.72" data-end="1061.13">build my own MQTT broker.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1061.13" data-end="1066.58">I didn't have access to the port, I couldn't set this up but I was not ready to leave Heroku.</span> <span data-start="1066.58" data-end="1072.48">I wanted to see if all this stuff was going to actually work together well before I actually</span> <span data-start="1072.48" data-end="1074.59">moved to a different service.</span> <span data-start="1074.59" data-end="1079.53">So I went looking for an external MQTT broker service, and it turns out there is a bunch</span> <span data-start="1079.53" data-end="1081.37">of them.</span> <span data-start="1081.37" data-end="1087.16">The one I ended up choosing is called Shifter IO, an IoT prototyping platform, I chose it</span> <span data-start="1087.16" data-end="1088.8">because it is free.</span> <span data-start="1088.8" data-end="1093.92">You just give your email and you get a key and a token.</span> <span data-start="1093.92" data-end="1101.19">Compared to other broker services, it doesn't seem to limit the number of messages that</span> <span data-start="1101.19" data-end="1103.49">you can receive per minute.</span> <span data-start="1103.49" data-end="1109.7">Some do, and you have to peel pay if you receive more than a few messages a minute.</span> <span data-start="1109.7" data-end="1112.35">I tried it out, and it worked.</span> <span data-start="1112.35" data-end="1117.09">It worked really, really well compared to my first attempt.</span> <span data-start="1117.09" data-end="1120.16">I was happy but I wasn't ecstatic.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1120.16" data-end="1126.09">Here I was, relying on this small external broker service which wasn't optimal for me</span> <span data-start="1126.09" data-end="1128.3">because there are a lot of unknowns.</span> <span data-start="1128.3" data-end="1132.31">I didn't know that much about this company and I wanted to make something really reliable,</span> <span data-start="1132.31" data-end="1138.69">and I really felt to make it really reliable, I needed to have control over it.</span> <span data-start="1138.69" data-end="1144.98">As you can probably guess, the next thing I decided to do was create my own broker.</span> <span data-start="1144.98" data-end="1149.77">To do that, I had to move from Heroku to Digital Ocean which gave me a little bit of anxiety</span> <span data-start="1149.77" data-end="1158.97">because I've not that comfortable or skilled yet in doing like DevOps-y kind of stuff,</span> <span data-start="1158.97" data-end="1161.37">but it worked out.</span> <span data-start="1161.37" data-end="1166.57">You should not be scared of that if you're thinking about moving to a service like that.</span> <span data-start="1166.57" data-end="1171.33">So, to build this, I used this broker library called Yates.</span> <span data-start="1171.33" data-end="1173.24">What I really — 80s.</span> <span data-start="1173.24" data-end="1181.13">What I liked this, was using streams, and just, it's a really new modern library, is</span> <span data-start="1181.13" data-end="1183.81">that the broker is embeddable.</span> <span data-start="1183.81" data-end="1191.35">It would be embeddable in my current express server that I was using to serve my website,</span> <span data-start="1191.35" data-end="1193.78">so I would really have minimal configuration change.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1193.78" data-end="1199.09">I was happy I wouldn't have to build a second server just for handling this messaging.</span> <span data-start="1199.09" data-end="1210.78">So, so implement the MQTT broker, I include the library and create the MQTT server and</span> <span data-start="1210.78" data-end="1216.22">the HTTP server, because as I said, this was also serving my web app.</span> <span data-start="1216.22" data-end="1222.75">I specified the ports they needed to listen on to.</span> <span data-start="1222.75" data-end="1227.88">Then, at the bottom, you can see that, with , and I think this is really cool as well,</span> <span data-start="1227.88" data-end="1236.041">I can add on so that the HTTP serve er that is serving my website, it can have MQTT over</span> <span data-start="1236.041" data-end="1243.79">WebSocket capabilities, so, those messages coming from my web app, they are served using</span> <span data-start="1243.79" data-end="1248.78">WebSockets from the HTTP server.</span> <span data-start="1248.78" data-end="1255.17">I was pretty excited because this was working really good, and I had figured out a lot of</span> <span data-start="1255.17" data-end="1261.8">things, and I conquered DevOps' fears, so I was pretty excited.</span> <span data-start="1261.8" data-end="1267.91">The last thing I did, because I wanted to make this rock solid, which, I hope in a you</span> <span data-start="1267.91" data-end="1275.03">phenomena minutes that I show that it is rock solid, is that I upgraded the microcontroller.</span> <span data-start="1275.03" data-end="1282.53">So I decided to change to the Feather M0 Wi-Fi, and there are a couple of of reasons for that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1282.53" data-end="1286.87">It has low power management, so I wanted to stretch out as much out of my battery life</span> <span data-start="1286.87" data-end="1294.5">as I could, and the main reason was that it has a separate Wi-Fi module, so what that</span> <span data-start="1294.5" data-end="1300.64">means is that it doesn't have to yield all the time to the Wi-Fi core since it is a separate</span> <span data-start="1300.64" data-end="1307.26">chip, so you get full rein of the processor in timing, and it just means you have high-speed</span> <span data-start="1307.26" data-end="1309.75">reliable Wi-Fi that doesn't crash.</span> <span data-start="1309.75" data-end="1315.26">There is a downside, and that is that it is twice the cost of the other microcontroller</span> <span data-start="1315.26" data-end="1320.15">I was using, so the Feather is around 18 euros, and this cost 35.</span> <span data-start="1320.15" data-end="1330.49">That was downside that wasn't — it was worth the extra cost to get the reliability.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1330.49" data-end="1334.84">It is demo time.</span> <span data-start="1334.84" data-end="1338.34">This is probably the biggest audience I have had who can interact with this.</span> <span data-start="1338.34" data-end="1352.91">I invite you to go to flashylights.nl and you can change what it looks like.</span> <span data-start="1352.91" data-end="1357.4">This is meant to be a one-on-one experience so it might get glitchy with so many people</span> <span data-start="1357.4" data-end="1360.91">sending to it at the same time.</span> <span data-start="1360.91" data-end="1365.99">Let's go for it!</span> <span data-start="1365.99" data-end="1372.59">While you're playing around, I want to leave you with my closing thoughts that you might</span> <span data-start="1372.59" data-end="1379.86">not be aware that I'm a super introvert, and this was a really experiment to do as an introvert.</span> <span data-start="1379.86" data-end="1386.92">I'm not one that attracting attention and actively seeking people to interact with me,</span> <span data-start="1386.92" data-end="1392.34">it's completely out of my comfort zone.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1392.34" data-end="1395.56">Sorry!</span> <span data-start="1395.56" data-end="1400.08">But it was also an experiment that really pushed me to deal with my own reactions to</span> <span data-start="1400.08" data-end="1406.71">those inter action, and I wanted to see if I could bring a momentary joy and whimsy to</span> <span data-start="1406.71" data-end="1411.92">strangers by giving them free rein over my appearance.</span> <span data-start="1411.92" data-end="1417.59">Outside of our tech bubble, this is not an application, this is an application, like</span> <span data-start="1417.59" data-end="1424.73">this is not one that most people have seen and experienced, so it is really — I also</span> <span data-start="1424.73" data-end="1430.95">found that I was breaking stereotypes about tech with strangers, like they were kind of</span> <span data-start="1430.95" data-end="1437.03">taken aback when they realised that I had built this, and you could do these kind of</span> <span data-start="1437.03" data-end="1442.87">weird experiments with tech, and kind of questioned what you could build, and who was capable</span> <span data-start="1442.87" data-end="1445.42">of billing those things in tech.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1445.42" data-end="1447.17">That's it.</span> <span data-start="1447.17" data-end="1449.7">Thank you for listening!</span> <span data-start="1449.7" data-end="1451.92">[Applause].</span> <span data-start="1451.92" data-end="1454.14">[Cheering].</span> <span data-start="1454.14" data-end="1464.68">I also build other fun things with LEDs, so, if you're interested in seeing those, I'm</span> <span data-start="1464.68" data-end="1468.501">terrible at blogging at things, but I post pictures on Twitter, and later tonight, I</span> <span data-start="1468.501" data-end="1474.33">made another that is not interactive but still really, really cool that I want to wear tonight</span> <span data-start="1474.33" data-end="1478.12">at the party, so, if you see me, say hi, don't be shy.</span> <span data-start="1478.12" data-end="1479.12">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="1479.12" data-end="1480.12">[Cheering].</span> </p>
