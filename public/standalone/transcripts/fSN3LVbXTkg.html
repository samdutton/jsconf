<p><span data-start="36.34" data-end="37.71">I think we've all felt that.</span> <span data-start="37.71" data-end="40.16">You know, it's great technical content, of course.</span> <span data-start="40.16" data-end="42.26">Some of the leading technical content.</span> <span data-start="42.26" data-end="45.19">But really, we're a community, more than that.</span> <span data-start="45.19" data-end="51.4">And so, like, as you can probably guess, especially if you have read my Twitter bio, I'm bisexual,</span> <span data-start="51.4" data-end="54.45">polyamorous, and you can read it there.</span> <span data-start="54.45" data-end="56.89">Some things that aren't in my bio.</span> <span data-start="56.89" data-end="61.67">I was born in Texas in the United States which is one of the most conservative parts of the</span> <span data-start="61.67" data-end="62.67">country.</span> <span data-start="62.67" data-end="65.17">I grew up there in the '80s and '90s.</span> <span data-start="65.17" data-end="67.59">A little older than I look.</span> <span data-start="67.59" data-end="69.039">Things were a little bit different back then.</span> <span data-start="69.039" data-end="75.929">I'm going to talk about queerness and tech and how these things intersect in all kinds</span> <span data-start="75.929" data-end="77.06">of different ways.</span> <span data-start="77.06" data-end="78.97">The truth is it's complicated.</span> <span data-start="78.97" data-end="84.259">There's no binary tech is good, tech is bad or any of that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="84.259" data-end="86.09">It's just all over the map.</span> <span data-start="86.09" data-end="90.759">I really want to dig into what these things are, really.</span> <span data-start="90.759" data-end="94.06">How tech helps, how tech hurts and how tech can be better.</span> <span data-start="94.06" data-end="96.26">I'm just one person.</span> <span data-start="96.26" data-end="98.83">We talk about the queer community a lot.</span> <span data-start="98.83" data-end="100.43">But it's not just one community.</span> <span data-start="100.43" data-end="102.06">Not just one type of person in it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="102.06" data-end="105.889">The queer community is a federation, really.</span> <span data-start="105.889" data-end="109.469">There are lots and lots of different communities with a lot of different people and a lot of</span> <span data-start="109.469" data-end="110.469">different experiences.</span> <span data-start="110.469" data-end="113.63">Of course, disclaimer, I speak for myself.</span> <span data-start="113.63" data-end="117.729">I did reach out to a number of queer folks that I know, friends of friends, things like</span> <span data-start="117.729" data-end="120.72">that, to try to get a lot of different perspectives.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="120.72" data-end="122.939">You'll see quotes from other folks.</span> <span data-start="122.939" data-end="126.799">Hopefully not just speaking for myself.</span> <span data-start="126.799" data-end="132.43">Before we get into it, this talk comes with content warnings as I'm sure you can imagine.</span> <span data-start="132.43" data-end="138">So, if any of these parts of the talk are difficult or uncomfortable, take care of yourself.</span> <span data-start="138" data-end="140.48">Feel free to step outside, anything like that.</span> <span data-start="140.48" data-end="144.57">I want to start by setting the stage a little bit.</span> <span data-start="144.57" data-end="146.849">Go back in time a little bit.</span> <span data-start="146.849" data-end="149.94">Talk about one of the fathers of computer science, Alan Turing.</span> <span data-start="149.94" data-end="155.68">Made contributions to computer science as well as art official intelligence.</span> <span data-start="155.68" data-end="161.09">The renaissance in tech, artificial intelligence, the big new thing.</span> <span data-start="161.09" data-end="164.62">Alan Turing was talking about it in the first part of the 20th century.</span> <span data-start="164.62" data-end="166.59">And Alan Turing was also gay.</span> <span data-start="166.59" data-end="173.189">And he was persecuted for it.</span> <span data-start="173.189" data-end="177.87">It.</span> <span data-start="177.87" data-end="199.89">I think in a way it's fitting that we start by talking about tech and queer employees</span> <span data-start="199.89" data-end="204.19">given in the way that Alan Turing was the first queer tech employee.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="204.19" data-end="206.939">At least that we know of.</span> <span data-start="206.939" data-end="212.239">When we talk about being a queer employee, tech is very complicated, you know?</span> <span data-start="212.239" data-end="214.15">I'm queer and I'm a tech employee.</span> <span data-start="214.15" data-end="217.98">I think a lot of folks in this audience here are.</span> <span data-start="217.98" data-end="220.14">And so, it's really complicated.</span> <span data-start="220.14" data-end="225">Like the first thing I want to talk about one of the best things is that tech offers</span> <span data-start="225" data-end="227.709">us stable employment.</span> <span data-start="227.709" data-end="232.09">And as queer folks, this is really important because a lot of queer folks are just not</span> <span data-start="232.09" data-end="233.849">financially stable.</span> <span data-start="233.849" data-end="237.879">Regardless of the family we come from, so many were, you know, kicked out of their homes</span> <span data-start="237.879" data-end="238.879">when they were young.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="238.879" data-end="242.54">So, even if there was wealth in the family, that often didn't translate to the queer kids</span> <span data-start="242.54" data-end="244.209">themselves.</span> <span data-start="244.209" data-end="245.78">Having financial stability is important.</span> <span data-start="245.78" data-end="251.27">And in tech, compared to other professions that pay about the same and offer the stability,</span> <span data-start="251.27" data-end="253.7">tech tends to be one of the most accepting.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="253.7" data-end="257.78">At least in that strata of professions.</span> <span data-start="257.78" data-end="264.62">As a queer tech worker, I have a job that is intellectually challenging and offers economic</span> <span data-start="264.62" data-end="266.15">stability.</span> <span data-start="266.15" data-end="271.17">I do my best to pay it forward and pass that money along to people who need it.</span> <span data-start="271.17" data-end="279.38">One of the first issues that we tend to run into, and this is kind of a meta one, is corporate</span> <span data-start="279.38" data-end="281.25">pride is rainbow capitalism.</span> <span data-start="281.25" data-end="283.3">All right.</span> <span data-start="283.3" data-end="287.199">Throughout I think about three different definitions to use to break this down a little bit.</span> <span data-start="287.199" data-end="290.04">First, the concept of pride in the queer community.</span> <span data-start="290.04" data-end="293.05">That's really, really important to us.</span> <span data-start="293.05" data-end="297.78">Because for centuries and millennia, we were told that who we are is something to be ashamed</span> <span data-start="297.78" data-end="299.139">of.</span> <span data-start="299.139" data-end="300.139">It's not.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="300.139" data-end="304.49">And it's taken a lot of work for us to become proud of who we are.</span> <span data-start="304.49" data-end="307.94">And so, pride is very, very important us to.</span> <span data-start="307.94" data-end="314.53">And we're starting to see a lot of companies expressing queer pride in various different</span> <span data-start="314.53" data-end="315.53">ways.</span> <span data-start="315.53" data-end="319.03">So, this corporate pride is kind of it's a new thing, of course.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="319.03" data-end="323.97">But we really look at it, though, it's what we call rainbow capitalism.</span> <span data-start="323.97" data-end="330.88">And so, rainbow capitalism is whenever companies, institutions, whoever, engages with the queer</span> <span data-start="330.88" data-end="331.88">community.</span> <span data-start="331.88" data-end="333.12">Not to help the queer community.</span> <span data-start="333.12" data-end="335.07">But in order to further their own interests.</span> <span data-start="335.07" data-end="337.81">Usually to sell more products, make more money.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="337.81" data-end="341.949">And what we end up seeing is that corporate pride end up just being another reflection</span> <span data-start="341.949" data-end="346.78">and lens of rainbow capitalism.</span> <span data-start="346.78" data-end="351.24">The tech industry is engaging in a queer specific version of diversity theater by sponsoring</span> <span data-start="351.24" data-end="353.56">events like the pride parade.</span> <span data-start="353.56" data-end="361.11">They market to sell more products, and most are not doing anything to make the life better</span> <span data-start="361.11" data-end="365.35">for queer people.</span> <span data-start="365.35" data-end="368.3">Queer ERGs, employee resource groups, should be run by queer employees.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="368.3" data-end="374.65">However, it's also important that you value the work people are putting into this.</span> <span data-start="374.65" data-end="377.45">I was the head of the queer employee resource group for a while.</span> <span data-start="377.45" data-end="384.06">And that work was seen as completely extracurricular and I missed out on a promotion as a result.</span> <span data-start="384.06" data-end="387.81">See, companies want to take the work they do in order to further their own interests</span> <span data-start="387.81" data-end="389.18">and they don't actually give back.</span> <span data-start="389.18" data-end="390.509">They don't support us in that.</span> <span data-start="390.509" data-end="396.08">They only take it from us.</span> <span data-start="396.08" data-end="397.96">And our other intersections are compounded.</span> <span data-start="397.96" data-end="399.879">You know, we talk about social justice.</span> <span data-start="399.879" data-end="402.25">We talk a lot about intersectionality.</span> <span data-start="402.25" data-end="406.22">And that absolutely applies to queerness as well.</span> <span data-start="406.22" data-end="410.31">And one of the things that I think is important to note about this is, you know, we tend to</span> <span data-start="410.31" data-end="416.1">think about diversity, inclusivity as like different axes.</span> <span data-start="416.1" data-end="419.3">This is not necessarily wrong, but they are not independent.</span> <span data-start="419.3" data-end="421.139">And this is something we have to remember.</span> <span data-start="421.139" data-end="425.44">When people have more than one marginalization they're dealing, this is not an additive,</span> <span data-start="425.44" data-end="427.91">it's a multiplicative one.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="427.91" data-end="434.06">They inform each other and makes things more complicated.</span> <span data-start="434.06" data-end="439.699">When my disability became ongoing, it was hard to tell if I was put on small projects</span> <span data-start="439.699" data-end="447.729">because of my disability, gender, or actual job performance.</span> <span data-start="447.729" data-end="452.169">I'm definitely more marginalized for my Judaism and ADHD, but that's only because I have been</span> <span data-start="452.169" data-end="457.169">working in queer friendly cities.</span> <span data-start="457.169" data-end="460.229">I'm marginalized for both my queerness and my race.</span> <span data-start="460.229" data-end="462.949">Queer rights isn't an equal playing field.</span> <span data-start="462.949" data-end="471.58">Race always had something to do with it.</span> <span data-start="471.58" data-end="502.069">Our pain is ignored and dismissed.</span> <span data-start="502.069" data-end="505.86">Just after the Pulse nightclub shootings, I mentioned to a co worker that I was going</span> <span data-start="505.86" data-end="509.99">hold a moment of silence at an upcoming all hands.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="509.99" data-end="514.01">My co worker said, I don't think tech companies should take a stance on that kind of thing.</span> <span data-start="514.01" data-end="518.039">I like the idea of being neutral.</span> <span data-start="518.039" data-end="519.779">What the fuck?</span> <span data-start="519.779" data-end="523.329">I didn't say anything because I didn't feel safe to speak up to this person that thinks</span> <span data-start="523.329" data-end="530.3">companies shouldn't condemn gun violence against queer people of color.</span> <span data-start="530.3" data-end="531.779">Tech is never neutral.</span> <span data-start="531.779" data-end="536.27">And the only way you can think that tech is neutral is if you love in a place of extreme</span> <span data-start="536.27" data-end="537.779">privilege.</span> <span data-start="537.779" data-end="539.12">Tech is a part of this world.</span> <span data-start="539.12" data-end="542.55">It always has been.</span> <span data-start="542.55" data-end="546.76">[ Applause ] And it shape this is world in a way that no</span> <span data-start="546.76" data-end="552.12">industry does in this day and age.</span> <span data-start="552.12" data-end="554.31">And, you know, actually, I should say something else on this.</span> <span data-start="554.31" data-end="558.709">I actually have my own story with Pulse as well.</span> <span data-start="558.709" data-end="561.04">I had been working at Microsoft for three, four months.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="561.04" data-end="565.58">I was working on a product team before I got into my current role now.</span> <span data-start="565.58" data-end="569.5">And Pulse nightclub shooting happened on a weekend.</span> <span data-start="569.5" data-end="572.85">And I think every queer person remembers that weekend pretty clearly.</span> <span data-start="572.85" data-end="576.7">At least if you were connected to the queer community at that time.</span> <span data-start="576.7" data-end="580.89">I was working on a remote team, something I was grateful for in retrospect.</span> <span data-start="580.89" data-end="583.51">And we had a stand up Monday morning.</span> <span data-start="583.51" data-end="586.32">I'm devastated.</span> <span data-start="586.32" data-end="592.35">Every queer person I know and talked to was a complete and utter wreck.</span> <span data-start="592.35" data-end="595.99">I hop on the call, a virtual call, thankfully no video.</span> <span data-start="595.99" data-end="603.56">I'm barely able to speak, and all the people on the team, all cis straight men, they were</span> <span data-start="603.56" data-end="609.75">asking about weekends, laughing and joking as if nothing had happened.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="609.75" data-end="614.89">And like I'm struggling so much already.</span> <span data-start="614.89" data-end="617.93">And that made me feel so much more alone in that moment.</span> <span data-start="617.93" data-end="622.67">Because it was a reminder that, you know, most people aren't queer.</span> <span data-start="622.67" data-end="626.68">Most people don't have to deal with that.</span> <span data-start="626.68" data-end="629.67">And most people don't care.</span> <span data-start="629.67" data-end="632.209">So, what can tech employers do?</span> <span data-start="632.209" data-end="635.04">First, let's talk about hiring.</span> <span data-start="635.04" data-end="636.14">And this is just a few things.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="636.14" data-end="638.829">Like we could spend an entire talk on this alone.</span> <span data-start="638.829" data-end="641.1">I'll just give you a couple of things.</span> <span data-start="641.1" data-end="642.78">First of all is ignore social media.</span> <span data-start="642.78" data-end="647.12">Like, if you're higher, just don't even look at a person's social media account.</span> <span data-start="647.12" data-end="649.93">Because the truth is, if we're going to talk about our daily lives, that means talking</span> <span data-start="649.93" data-end="652.51">about some things that people find controversial.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="652.51" data-end="656.76">If we're not going to talk about our daily lives like privileged, straight, cis white</span> <span data-start="656.76" data-end="663.389">folks do, we get punished in ways they don't or we have to hide it, which is effectively</span> <span data-start="663.389" data-end="664.55">going back in the closet.</span> <span data-start="664.55" data-end="669.18">If we talk about other marginalizations on top of it, it's even worse.</span> <span data-start="669.18" data-end="675.01">On my bio on Twitter, I mention that I'm bi and poly.</span> <span data-start="675.01" data-end="676.01">I try to be out about that.</span> <span data-start="676.01" data-end="677.17">But you know what with?</span> <span data-start="677.17" data-end="682.13">If a bi queer woman, especially of color said the same thing, that would probably disqualify</span> <span data-start="682.13" data-end="686.01">them from being hired, but not me.</span> <span data-start="686.01" data-end="689.49">The other thing is to understand variances in employment history.</span> <span data-start="689.49" data-end="692.329">This is especially true for trans folks.</span> <span data-start="692.329" data-end="697.98">Because the truth of the matter is queer folks in general have a tougher time finding employment.</span> <span data-start="697.98" data-end="700.079">There are more issues we have to deal with.</span> </p>
