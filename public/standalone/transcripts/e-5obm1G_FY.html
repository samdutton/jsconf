<p><span data-start="69.1" data-end="72.6">So why am I standing here</span> <span data-start="72.6" data-end="75.5">Share with you about JavaScript functional programming?</span> <span data-start="75.65" data-end="78.45">About six months ago, in the fall of 2015</span> <span data-start="78.45" data-end="81.44">I went to a programming group in New York</span> <span data-start="81.44" data-end="83">Called The Recurse Centre</span> <span data-start="83.2" data-end="84.4">Its quick promotion</span> <span data-start="84.4" data-end="88.12">It should be one of the best programming group experiences I have participated in</span> <span data-start="88.12" data-end="89.82">Is a programming retreat</span> <span data-start="89.82" data-end="91.2">You can go there to study</span> <span data-start="91.2" data-end="94.3">Things that are interesting to you in computer science</span> <span data-start="94.95" data-end="95.9">So i got there</span> <span data-start="95.9" data-end="98.1">Many people are talking about functional programming</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="98.1" data-end="101.5">Functional programming, Haskell, Clojure, all these great things</span> <span data-start="101.5" data-end="104.16">Many people who are using JavaScript are starting to enter nodes</span> <span data-start="104.3" data-end="106.3">These are some very interesting topics</span> <span data-start="106.3" data-end="107.9">So I started talking to the people there</span> <span data-start="107.9" data-end="110.2">Want to know what these things are</span> <span data-start="110.45" data-end="113.08">So what is functional programming?</span> <span data-start="113.48" data-end="115.8">This question can be answered in several different ways</span> <span data-start="116.2" data-end="118.88">First, this is a programming paradigm</span> <span data-start="119.58" data-end="122.76">Other examples include imperative programming</span> <span data-start="122.76" data-end="124.56">Like always saying do this and then do that</span> <span data-start="124.56" data-end="126.35">Object-oriented programming</span> <span data-start="126.35" data-end="129.45">Maybe many of you have written object-oriented JavaScript</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="129.45" data-end="132.48">You have objects and they have ways</span> <span data-start="132.48" data-end="134.78">Then you change them and so on</span> <span data-start="135.1" data-end="137.52">Functional programming is also a paradigm</span> <span data-start="137.52" data-end="139.48">Function is king</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="139.48" data-end="141.48">We will discuss later what this means</span> <span data-start="142.28" data-end="144.58">This is also a coding style</span> <span data-start="144.58" data-end="146.1">Organization code</span> <span data-start="146.1" data-end="147.5">Write code</span> <span data-start="148.35" data-end="150">Project-like style</span> <span data-start="150.4" data-end="154">Not only that, it ’s an accessible mentality</span> <span data-start="154" data-end="155.48">A way of thinking</span> <span data-start="155.48" data-end="157.48">A way to approach the task</span> <span data-start="158.18" data-end="160.32">This is also a very interesting trend</span> <span data-start="160.32" data-end="163.36">There are many popular words</span> <span data-start="163.36" data-end="167.4">Talking to someone at a pre-meeting or other occasion will make you super popular</span> <span data-start="167.7" data-end="168.4">I'm just kidding</span> <span data-start="168.4" data-end="170.4">But this caused a lot of attention</span> <span data-start="170.4" data-end="173">So I think this is very important</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="173" data-end="175.2">To find out why everyone is so excited about it</span> <span data-start="176.5" data-end="180.64">Why use JavaScript exclusively for functional programming?</span> <span data-start="180.94" data-end="183.44">I don't know if you have similar experience</span> <span data-start="183.7" data-end="186">Maybe for more experienced JavaScript developers</span> <span data-start="186" data-end="188">But when I started learning JavaScript</span> <span data-start="188" data-end="192.65">Some object-oriented programming experience in Java, C-Sharp</span> <span data-start="192.65" data-end="193.56">Those things</span> <span data-start="193.86" data-end="198.48">I find object-oriented JavaScript very confusing</span> <span data-start="199.3" data-end="202.4">How does prototype inheritance work?</span> <span data-start="203.8" data-end="205.7">A few of you, raise your hands to see</span> <span data-start="205.7" data-end="209.6">Who has encountered an error, problem or accident</span> <span data-start="209.9" data-end="210.6">Do something ..</span> <span data-start="210.6" data-end="212.6">Yeah, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="212.75" data-end="215.2">I found it really tricky and confusing</span> <span data-start="215.2" data-end="217.95">So I thought, well, I know I want to learn more about JavaScript</span> <span data-start="217.95" data-end="219.95">But let me let go of the object</span> <span data-start="219.95" data-end="223.1">Try to think functionally</span> <span data-start="223.1" data-end="225.45">May be simpler in some ways</span> <span data-start="225.45" data-end="227.25">And avoid some of them</span> <span data-start="227.55" data-end="231.4">Caused an error by binding this to the wrong thing</span> <span data-start="231.9" data-end="235.76">So at least functional JavaScript is more secure for me</span> <span data-start="236.2" data-end="237.16">Not so tricky</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="237.16" data-end="238.6">Easier to debug</span> <span data-start="238.6" data-end="241.5">But easier to maintain when building projects</span> <span data-start="242.1" data-end="243.7">We will look at some features later</span> <span data-start="243.7" data-end="245.7">Will become easy</span> <span data-start="246.9" data-end="250.4">Moreover, there is already a large developer community</span> <span data-start="250.4" data-end="252.7">They write JavaScript in a functional style</span> <span data-start="252.7" data-end="255.1">Many libraries outside</span> <span data-start="255.1" data-end="258.68">Help you write functional JavaScript</span> <span data-start="258.78" data-end="261.48">Many people are experts</span> <span data-start="261.48" data-end="265.8">For example, there is a talk about Ramda in the next room</span> <span data-start="266" data-end="267.45">Someone here can talk to you too</span> <span data-start="267.45" data-end="270.36">And they probably know more about functional JavaScript than I do</span> <span data-start="270.46" data-end="272.16">But the point is that there is already a group</span> <span data-start="272.16" data-end="276.36">So this doesn't necessarily need to be done by yourself</span> <span data-start="276.36" data-end="278.16">Fighting JavaScript</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="278.16" data-end="279.76">There are others who support you</span> <span data-start="279.76" data-end="281.46">And I found it really helpful</span> <span data-start="283.1" data-end="283.46">Ok</span> <span data-start="283.46" data-end="285.46">Hope by now i have convinced you</span> <span data-start="285.46" data-end="287.88">Functional programming is at least fun</span> <span data-start="287.88" data-end="291.36">And we can use JavaScript to compile</span> <span data-start="292.76" data-end="294.36">What shall we do?</span> <span data-start="294.36" data-end="295.66">What does it mean?</span> <span data-start="296.4" data-end="297.86">This is the question i am asking myself</span> <span data-start="298.46" data-end="299.46">Most important</span> <span data-start="299.46" data-end="302.96">Maybe it sounds tautological or obvious</span> <span data-start="302.96" data-end="304.04">In functional programming</span> <span data-start="304.04" data-end="305.84">You will want to do everything with functions</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="305.84" data-end="310.44">So we use functions to express everything in the program</span> <span data-start="311.2" data-end="312.8">Of course, the function is just a</span> <span data-start="312.8" data-end="315.88">Something that accepts input and gives output</span> <span data-start="316.1" data-end="317.78">So what we have to think about is</span> <span data-start="317.78" data-end="321.48">Types of data flow for program input and output</span> <span data-start="321.48" data-end="324.28">Rather than thinking about objects and their interactions</span> <span data-start="324.28" data-end="325.15">And how they work</span> <span data-start="325.15" data-end="330">Or compare the imperative steps to the steps on the recipe</span> <span data-start="330.2" data-end="332.6">Here we are thinking about how to express it all</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="332.6" data-end="334.05">In terms of functions</span> <span data-start="334.05" data-end="336.05">Accept input, provide output</span> <span data-start="337.75" data-end="339.16">for example</span> <span data-start="339.16" data-end="342.16">This would be a non-functional way to get the text</span> <span data-start="342.16" data-end="344.4">"Hi, I'm Anjana" appears on the screen</span> <span data-start="344.4" data-end="349.8">I can assign a variable I call "name"</span> <span data-start="349.8" data-end="351.4">And store the text "Anjana"</span> <span data-start="351.55" data-end="355.52">I can say hello, such as "Hi, I am" or "Hello, I am", or something</span> <span data-start="355.52" data-end="357.52">Then log it to the console</span> <span data-start="357.52" data-end="360.4">It's an imperative style</span> <span data-start="360.4" data-end="363">Do this first, then do that, then do this other</span> <span data-start="363.2" data-end="364.2">No function here</span> <span data-start="364.2" data-end="368.08">We are not expressing this in terms of how inputs are converted to outputs</span> <span data-start="368.98" data-end="371.7">Maybe a more practical way to do the same</span> <span data-start="371.9" data-end="374.52">This is a very simple example</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="374.8" data-end="377">Is to define a function called greet</span> <span data-start="377" data-end="379.4">With parameter name</span> <span data-start="379.65" data-end="382.84">And return a string with "Hi, I am"</span> <span data-start="383" data-end="384.84">To the beginning of the name</span> <span data-start="384.84" data-end="386.44">For example, if I enter greet</span> <span data-start="386.44" data-end="387.64">String Anjana</span> <span data-start="388.3" data-end="389.36">As input</span> <span data-start="389.36" data-end="391.36">Then I get the output "Hi, I'm Anjana"</span> <span data-start="391.8" data-end="394.72">This is a way to express this function from a function</span> <span data-start="397.12" data-end="399">OK, so ..</span> <span data-start="399" data-end="401.6">Maybe the main question about functional programming</span> <span data-start="401.6" data-end="403.8">Is to avoid side effects</span> <span data-start="404.1" data-end="406.1">Instead, use pure functions</span> <span data-start="406.1" data-end="407.44">What does that mean?</span> <span data-start="407.44" data-end="410.76">Side effects are anything a function might do</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="410.76" data-end="415.56">Not using your input to calculate its output</span> <span data-start="415.8" data-end="417.56">And return that output</span> <span data-start="418.16" data-end="419.56">E.g</span> <span data-start="420.3" data-end="423.5">Printing something on the console is not returning output</span> <span data-start="423.5" data-end="425">It is doing other things</span> <span data-start="425" data-end="427.3">Something on the side of a function</span> <span data-start="427.7" data-end="434.16">Or if your function uses some globally defined variables</span> <span data-start="434.16" data-end="436">To calculate its output</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="436" data-end="439.8">It doesn't just depend on the input of the function</span> <span data-start="439.8" data-end="441">So that ’s not pure</span> <span data-start="441" data-end="443.35">It gets something from outside the function</span> <span data-start="443.35" data-end="446">And somehow include it in the function's function</span> <span data-start="446.95" data-end="451">That's just a quick explanation of what a pure function is</span> <span data-start="451" data-end="453">Can avoid side effects</span> <span data-start="454.5" data-end="456">For more information</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="456" data-end="459">There are many articles on Wikipedia about such things</span> <span data-start="459.2" data-end="460.24">But basically</span> <span data-start="460.24" data-end="462.1">You want your function to do nothing</span> <span data-start="462.1" data-end="464.95">Except accepting input, use only that input to</span> <span data-start="464.95" data-end="466">Calculation output</span> <span data-start="466" data-end="467">Then return</span> <span data-start="467" data-end="468">That is pure</span> <span data-start="468.7" data-end="472.04">For example, this function</span> <span data-start="472.74" data-end="476.36">We have a globally defined variable name</span> <span data-start="476.7" data-end="478.55">Will be used in the function</span> <span data-start="478.55" data-end="481.44">What you see in this last line</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="481.44" data-end="483.5">It is used so there is no input</span> <span data-start="483.5" data-end="486.1">We do not have a name as a parameter to this function</span> <span data-start="486.1" data-end="488.5">It just reads some information from the global state</span> <span data-start="488.7" data-end="489.6">That is not pure</span> <span data-start="489.9" data-end="491.3">The reason it is impure is because</span> <span data-start="491.45" data-end="494.45">And the return value of this function is not what we care about</span> <span data-start="494.45" data-end="496.16">We care about doing something</span> <span data-start="496.16" data-end="498">Change the world in some way</span> <span data-start="498" data-end="499.1">Except return value</span> <span data-start="499.1" data-end="501">In this case, print to the console</span> <span data-start="501.5" data-end="504.12">This is not a pure function</span> <span data-start="504.32" data-end="506.32">A pure function might look like this</span> <span data-start="507.9" data-end="509.16">it's here</span> <span data-start="509.16" data-end="510.66">The only thing that matters for this output</span> <span data-start="510.66" data-end="512.9">Is its input</span> <span data-start="512.9" data-end="516.2">The arguments we pass to it</span> </p>
