<p><span data-start="24.25" data-end="25.56">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="25.56" data-end="30">Hello everyone I am Peter, I am hoping that you are still awake, this is the post lunch</span> <span data-start="30" data-end="32">crowd I am aware of that.</span> <span data-start="32" data-end="38.89">This guy on Twitter, even though my nickname is actually 23 years old I was very late to</span> <span data-start="38.89" data-end="42.29">Twitter so I have the underscores.</span> <span data-start="42.29" data-end="48.37">I work at a company called Citryx Copenhagen on a produced called Podio, where I am the</span> <span data-start="48.37" data-end="56.17">front-end lead very short for the history buffs amongst you Podio is a hyper card for</span> <span data-start="56.17" data-end="62.76">the web, software service thing plus a bit of collaboration on top of that.</span> <span data-start="62.76" data-end="69.36">I have also been an organiser of Copenhagen.js for a couple of years, some of you might recognise</span> <span data-start="69.36" data-end="77.95">yourself on this image, if you want to leave it there for a minute.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="77.95" data-end="82.82">If you have ever heard about me from the open source circle you might have heard of my project</span> <span data-start="82.82" data-end="89.77">called Assetgraph which is yet another build tool with a different approach and I can't</span> <span data-start="89.77" data-end="93.92">stop talking about it so if you want to learn about this poke me in one of the breaks and</span> <span data-start="93.92" data-end="96.67">find me.</span> <span data-start="96.67" data-end="101.82">This is yet another build tooling talk but this one is specific to transpiler so in case</span> <span data-start="101.82" data-end="107.83">you don't no what a transpiler is it's a compiler instead of compiling source code into machine</span> <span data-start="107.83" data-end="111.8">code it compiles it into a different type of source code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="111.8" data-end="122.04">In this case on your right hand side which is over here for you yes, is the machine code</span> <span data-start="122.04" data-end="126.799">which in our case is CSS HTML JavaScript and things like that.</span> <span data-start="126.799" data-end="132.56">On the left hand which is really confusing when it's opposite, you have the source code</span> <span data-start="132.56" data-end="138.299">that you would like to write, this is your ES6, Sass, stuff like that.</span> <span data-start="138.299" data-end="144.18">Any time in this talk when I mention transpiler or transpiling you can substitue for any of</span> <span data-start="144.18" data-end="153.06">these in your mind, Saas, CoffeeScript, Babel, TypeScript, Markdown or whatever.</span> <span data-start="153.06" data-end="157.53">Odds are some of you have used one of these.</span> <span data-start="157.53" data-end="160.12">So these are all transpilers.</span> <span data-start="160.12" data-end="163.73">This talk is about why transpiling is a problem.</span> <span data-start="163.73" data-end="169.09">I don't have a problem with transpilers there was, transpilers are really awesome unix type</span> <span data-start="169.09" data-end="174.38">tools which take 1 or more inputs and give you one output and that is actually really</span> <span data-start="174.38" data-end="176.269">simple and really good.</span> <span data-start="176.269" data-end="181.9">The problem I have is with one of the side affects that come with some of the build systems</span> <span data-start="181.9" data-end="188.48">that people use when they integrate transpilers into their work.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="188.48" data-end="193.98">The primary culprit here is the build artefact.</span> <span data-start="193.98" data-end="196.43">The build artefact is the thing that your browser</span> <span data-start="196.43" data-end="204.6">consumes or that other tools consume it's again your CSS, JavaScript, your HTML.</span> <span data-start="204.6" data-end="209.709">Build artefacts have a transient nature, they are not the thing we're actually interested</span> <span data-start="209.709" data-end="214.01">in, but they are the thing that we need to produce in order for the machine to understand</span> <span data-start="214.01" data-end="215.99">what we're doing.</span> <span data-start="215.99" data-end="221.02">So this means that we want build the artefacts but primarily for consumption we're not really</span> <span data-start="221.02" data-end="227.79">interested in storing them until we actually want to deploy our websites.</span> <span data-start="227.79" data-end="233.79">This gives us a weird duality and gives us some problems with work field setups, let</span> <span data-start="233.79" data-end="240.71">do a workflow set up of a project right now so I can show you why this complex.</span> <span data-start="240.71" data-end="245.84">So first of all, the simplest possible way you can do transpiling is you transpile your</span> <span data-start="245.84" data-end="250.269">source code into the target code in the same directory.</span> <span data-start="250.269" data-end="254.879">They are sibling files, in this case you have your main Sass final which gets compiled into</span> <span data-start="254.879" data-end="261.19">your main CSS file it's a sibling it's easy to understand you know where to find your</span> <span data-start="261.19" data-end="262.19">code.</span> <span data-start="262.19" data-end="268.8">So we're not interested in the build artefacts so let's add and ignore for CSS files in our</span> <span data-start="268.8" data-end="272.44">source directory so we don't version control them anymore.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="272.44" data-end="277.12">This is what most people do it's easiest to main then.</span> <span data-start="277.12" data-end="283.06">Now the first problem arrives because eventually because the code that we produce as build</span> <span data-start="283.06" data-end="288.88">art facts is the same code we might also write in other cases, you might have other CSS files</span> <span data-start="288.88" data-end="291.77">in your directory your source directory.</span> <span data-start="291.77" data-end="296.5">These might also be JavaScript files it's completely valid to have files of the extension</span> <span data-start="296.5" data-end="298.93">that the browser consumes in your source directory.</span> <span data-start="298.93" data-end="303">So if you start ignoring them you are in a world of pain.</span> <span data-start="303" data-end="304">So we don't do this.</span> <span data-start="304" data-end="305.52">This is a bad idea.</span> <span data-start="305.52" data-end="311">What most people have come up with is a set up where you have your app and your main Sass</span> <span data-start="311" data-end="313.96">file you compile into a directory called artefact.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="313.96" data-end="320.31">Or temp I think most people use underscore temp in yeoman set up at least your main CCSS</span> <span data-start="320.31" data-end="321.68">resides here.</span> <span data-start="321.68" data-end="326.741">You can very easily ignore from version control all your build artefacts you simple ignore</span> <span data-start="326.741" data-end="329.71">the folder where they exist.</span> <span data-start="329.71" data-end="335.78">This is pretty nice, but now you URL are sort of broken because the source code is not actually</span> <span data-start="335.78" data-end="340.19">where you expect to it be it's in a different directory it might even be in a directory</span> <span data-start="340.19" data-end="342.169">outside of your web route.</span> <span data-start="342.169" data-end="347.94">So, in order to deal with this, people have come up with this nice set up where you can</span> <span data-start="347.94" data-end="353.99">add a piece of middleware to your web server this will know about the existence of a build</span> <span data-start="353.99" data-end="356.58">artefacts in a different directory.</span> <span data-start="356.58" data-end="363.51">In the first we get we see that the web server is looking for main.CSS in the directory,</span> <span data-start="363.51" data-end="371.21">then looking for index.HTML in the artefacts directory, it might not actually be a transpiled</span> <span data-start="371.21" data-end="373.07">build artefact.</span> <span data-start="373.07" data-end="378.57">So when it guess 404 it falls back to original source directory then gets a correct hit on</span> <span data-start="378.57" data-end="379.57">index.HTML.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="379.57" data-end="383.3">Then we have a piece of middleware that needs to know something about your workflow set</span> <span data-start="383.3" data-end="385.889">up.</span> <span data-start="385.889" data-end="390.91">So next of all you probably want to somehow trigger your builds get it tedious to manually</span> <span data-start="390.91" data-end="395.58">run these tasks just as you don't like refreshing your browser you probably don't like running</span> <span data-start="395.58" data-end="399.2">mate or Grunt whatever you use.</span> <span data-start="399.2" data-end="405.41">Usually people set up file watching they watch all the CSS files all the Sass files it should</span> <span data-start="405.41" data-end="410.56">have been in the source directory, and whenever you have a</span> <span data-start="410.56" data-end="416.11">source file increment whenever you make a change, you trigger the transpiled task we</span> <span data-start="416.11" data-end="420.38">set up before then you get your updated build artefact.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="420.38" data-end="426.28">While we're added usually people set up library loading so whenever build artefact gets updated</span> <span data-start="426.28" data-end="430.34">the browser will also update so you can see your changes.</span> <span data-start="430.34" data-end="435.341">This is pretty nice but in order to orchestrate this now you have a task, now you have a web</span> <span data-start="435.341" data-end="439.319">server that needs to know about things, now you have a file watcher you have a library</span> <span data-start="439.319" data-end="443.521">loader, this is a lot to do manually so you probably want to have some sort of task runner</span> <span data-start="443.521" data-end="446.87">to orchestrate all of these things at the same time.</span> <span data-start="446.87" data-end="455.33">So people in here probably used at some point in time Grunt, Gulp, Broccoli, Make even you</span> <span data-start="455.33" data-end="458.02">can do that.</span> <span data-start="458.02" data-end="459.44">That's about it.</span> <span data-start="459.44" data-end="465.63">For workflow set up for CSS, but these days we're not only transpiling CSS, we're also</span> <span data-start="465.63" data-end="467.19">transpiling JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="467.19" data-end="472.71">JavaScript is consumed by more consumers than just the browser or your build system.</span> <span data-start="472.71" data-end="478.66">So suddenly we need to also think about how does this build artefact integrate or how</span> <span data-start="478.66" data-end="484.36">does my workflow tooling integrate with all the other consumers of my build artefact.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="484.36" data-end="492.96">How does the task runner understand ES6, how does my production bundler understand ES6</span> <span data-start="492.96" data-end="495.56">how does my test framework understand it.</span> <span data-start="495.56" data-end="501.16">The solution for these are usually oh you just have each of these tool implement a plug-in</span> <span data-start="501.16" data-end="506.72">framework so you can use Babel plug-in for you linter and you middleware and task runner</span> <span data-start="506.72" data-end="513.21">and production bundler and test framework and your module loader and for anything else</span> <span data-start="513.21" data-end="516.229">that might be touching your source code.</span> <span data-start="516.229" data-end="520.74">You need a plug-in for each of these for each of the types of languages you want to transpile,</span> <span data-start="520.74" data-end="525.61">just start multiplying the amount of plug-ins you need.</span> <span data-start="525.61" data-end="531.819">So some people think this is okay, the word I use for it is "complex."</span> <span data-start="531.819" data-end="540.14">I think this is way too complex but don't worry there's a solution for this complexity,</span> <span data-start="540.14" data-end="544.01">obviously you don't want to set up a system like this by hand every time you create anew</span> <span data-start="544.01" data-end="550.16">project, so we simply say oh we can order generate it then it's easy.</span> <span data-start="550.16" data-end="555.73">Because I only need to run one command, but this is easy it's not simple.</span> <span data-start="555.73" data-end="558.94">It's easy but creates a lot of complexity.</span> <span data-start="558.94" data-end="565.05">The problem is when anything goes wrong, in this set up, imagine you're a newbie, you</span> <span data-start="565.05" data-end="569.95">are sitting in a code dojo and somebody tells you to run a webapp and something goes wrong</span> <span data-start="569.95" data-end="573.79">and all you see is this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="573.79" data-end="580.14">Your first question is, how does it work?</span> <span data-start="580.14" data-end="582.58">Why is it even set up in that way?</span> <span data-start="582.58" data-end="586.57">You might have been able to follow me right here, because you have all done this before,</span> <span data-start="586.57" data-end="591.31">you have all felt the pain, the kind of understand which moving parts are here, but a new newbie</span> <span data-start="591.31" data-end="596.7">doesn't a this a big problem.</span> <span data-start="596.7" data-end="601.29">Whenever I say workflow tool is complex there's always at least one person in the room that</span> <span data-start="601.29" data-end="609.76">says "oh you know Peter my set up is special, my set up has legacy.</span> <span data-start="609.76" data-end="615.82">My set up has complexity" so we need this complexity.</span> <span data-start="615.82" data-end="619.56">We need it.</span> <span data-start="619.56" data-end="626.35">I promised Peter Fantazi(?) to say people who say this are doing it wrong, you're doing</span> <span data-start="626.35" data-end="629.06">it wrong if you ever said this you need complexity.</span> <span data-start="629.06" data-end="633.37">You don't need complexity you need ability.</span> <span data-start="633.37" data-end="637.61">The ability is what your tools are supposed to give you, they are not supposed to give</span> <span data-start="637.61" data-end="639.07">you complexity.</span> <span data-start="639.07" data-end="646.2">The ideal tool gives you maximum ability and minimum complexity, also called simplicity.</span> <span data-start="646.2" data-end="652.94">So what we should strive for is to build tools that are simple.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="652.94" data-end="659.11">So let's figure out what these moving parts are, what are the important attributes of</span> <span data-start="659.11" data-end="664.11">transpiling that we actually want in, in order to gain this ability, then recompose them</span> <span data-start="664.11" data-end="669.68">in a way so we can actually gain this ability with minimum complex overhead so that a new</span> <span data-start="669.68" data-end="676.33">person is able to say I want to use transpiler but don't want to buy into a massive ecosystem,</span> <span data-start="676.33" data-end="680.67">I want this one ability to transpile and nothing else.</span> <span data-start="680.67" data-end="683.959">Maybe I don't even want a web server.</span> <span data-start="683.959" data-end="689.68">So the things I have come up with, this might not be a complete list, some of these might</span> <span data-start="689.68" data-end="693.47">also and not necessarily have to be there but it's a good guideline right?</span> <span data-start="693.47" data-end="702.3">I think in order to avoid this idiocy of having a million transpiled plug-ins for everything,</span> <span data-start="702.3" data-end="706.17">we should figure out a way to have a tool that can actually just handle all types of</span> <span data-start="706.17" data-end="711.649">transpilers, let's figure out how to unify that a single transpiler can transpile more</span> <span data-start="711.649" data-end="720.38">than one thing, we can clean up MPM, we don't need all the plug-ins we don't need that any</span> <span data-start="720.38" data-end="724.089">more, let's figure out how to do this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="724.089" data-end="732.44">Needs a good API, integrate with other tools, the best APII can come up with is a file system,</span> <span data-start="732.44" data-end="736.43">because any tool can interact with a file system.</span> <span data-start="736.43" data-end="742.51">It should be stand alone and shouldn't impose a big, nasty ecosystem on you, it should be</span> <span data-start="742.51" data-end="747.82">doing on-demand transpilation, so some task runners are actually not doing that right</span> <span data-start="747.82" data-end="750.05">now, going to come back to that.</span> <span data-start="750.05" data-end="757.13">Should keep URLs valid, if you can trace a URL from your browser down directly to your</span> <span data-start="757.13" data-end="762.149">source code and find your files on disk that makes everything more simple.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="762.149" data-end="766.029">I think it should be nice, it should have all the nice things that everybody wants to</span> <span data-start="766.029" data-end="775.62">have, sources maps, auto prefixes, caching, it should simply understand what needs to</span> <span data-start="775.62" data-end="779.74">be done at the time you need it to be done.</span> <span data-start="779.74" data-end="784.61">With that also comes, there should be a simple mental model if you can't explain how this</span> <span data-start="784.61" data-end="790.16">tool works within one or two sentences, then it's probably too much.</span> <span data-start="790.16" data-end="797.389">So, let's see how the current set up stacks up, I'm a bit critical here so maybe more</span> <span data-start="797.389" data-end="799.86">check marks over here.</span> <span data-start="799.86" data-end="804.83">Task runners, they definitely handle all types of transpilers with a lot of plug-ins which</span> <span data-start="804.83" data-end="813.769">I don't like, give us source maps, auto prefixing caching things like that, some of them have</span> <span data-start="813.769" data-end="817.31">a really, really horrible API, most of them actually.</span> <span data-start="817.31" data-end="823.44">They are definitely not stand alone, they do by definition impose an ecosystem that</span> <span data-start="823.44" data-end="830.85">we have to work within, you cannot, like my — that runs on file systems cannot consume</span> <span data-start="830.85" data-end="839.88">a Gulf stream, transpilers transpile on file change, they also transpile things that you</span> <span data-start="839.88" data-end="843.9">might not actually be using at the moment, that's a lot of waste of resource cycles fright</span> <span data-start="843.9" data-end="850.329">there, don't keep URLs valid, at least if you have a set up where you have your built</span> <span data-start="850.329" data-end="856.269">artefacts outside of your web route, they definitely have a lot of configuration, that's</span> <span data-start="856.269" data-end="861.67">the primary things that these task runners have and I don't think they're simple.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="861.67" data-end="869.32">Now, I don't want to hate on task runners, I think that task runners are actually instrumental</span> <span data-start="869.32" data-end="871.49">to getting us to where we are.</span> <span data-start="871.49" data-end="877.13">I think they have created a very stable foundation to develop tools on and I think we should</span> <span data-start="877.13" data-end="881.73">thank them for that, but I also think that they have been an incremental</span> <span data-start="881.73" data-end="888.91">optimisation towards a local optimum, I think we can maybe do a leap and figure out if there</span> <span data-start="888.91" data-end="893.73">is a more optimal way to do this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="893.73" data-end="898.73">One of the concepts that I've been thinking about is control flow with this, most of these</span> <span data-start="898.73" data-end="903.17">task runners are based on a control flow that says, whenever you change your source code</span> <span data-start="903.17" data-end="907.769">I'm doing some work and then I might tell you about it.</span> <span data-start="907.769" data-end="912.779">It's actually possible to reverse these there are a few points in this set up where you</span> <span data-start="912.779" data-end="918.329">can actually hook in and do the opposite, you can figure out whenever somebody wants</span> <span data-start="918.329" data-end="924.14">to consume an asset and then you can intercept that and then you can do something about it.</span> <span data-start="924.14" data-end="928.94">So one of the things that I've been using instead of using a task runner for transpiling</span> <span data-start="928.94" data-end="936.279">is a piece of middleware, this sits in my express server and by having this ability</span> <span data-start="936.279" data-end="946.76">to intercept requests you can integrate all types of transpilers, you can figure out the</span> <span data-start="946.76" data-end="952.6">browser wants this, I'll just go and fetch, it also reduces the configuration, because</span> <span data-start="952.6" data-end="957.5">I don't need to configure a path, the browser will tell me the path it wants and I can read</span> <span data-start="957.5" data-end="965.22">it from the file system here, do the changes, map it, or prefix it and keep the URLs valid,</span> <span data-start="965.22" data-end="968.69">it's kind of simple to understand, it's a pipeline and on the way through some work</span> <span data-start="968.69" data-end="973.77">is done, right, but it's missing some check points.</span> <span data-start="973.77" data-end="980.38">Not all my tools are consuming HTTP, that's a problem, so I still need to have all these</span> <span data-start="980.38" data-end="986.949">plug-ins for command line tools and I still get all the complexity of having these plug-ins.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="986.949" data-end="994.149">So, I've thought a lot about this idea and last year on, on this very stage actually,</span> <span data-start="994.149" data-end="1003">on this spot, Mattheus was demoing Wiki streamed and stuff, he was using a technology that</span> <span data-start="1003" data-end="1008.66">was really cool, instead of explaining a lot about that, I'd like to jump into a demo and</span> <span data-start="1008.66" data-end="1014.88">show you what I'm able to do by using this idea that he gave me.</span> <span data-start="1014.88" data-end="1020.69">So I'll jump into my console, this is big enough text, looks good.</span> <span data-start="1020.69" data-end="1026.26">New be developer, just at out of the coding dojo.</span> <span data-start="1026.26" data-end="1038.699">I have a sources folder with my awesome website, it's really down-to-earth, hello world, index</span> <span data-start="1038.699" data-end="1040.159">HTML, stuff like that.</span> <span data-start="1040.159" data-end="1047.98">I can show you here, it looks like this, hello JSConf.eu, it has a Cat image, every good</span> <span data-start="1047.98" data-end="1053.27">website should have a Cat image, I can open this thing and you can see it.</span> <span data-start="1053.27" data-end="1059.69">It's a good example of a starter website I have, a heading, "Hello world", I've given</span> <span data-start="1059.69" data-end="1065.01">it a colour so I can interact with things, a Cat image, it's always good for learning</span> <span data-start="1065.01" data-end="1071">and I wrote it a bit, so again I can interact with things.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1071" data-end="1077.97">So one year later I'm slightly more experienced webpage developer and now I'm ready to take</span> <span data-start="1077.97" data-end="1080.91">on the concept of an abstraction.</span> <span data-start="1080.91" data-end="1088.86">So, what I would like to do, is I would like to be able to abstract my colour into a variable.</span> <span data-start="1088.86" data-end="1097.26">So I ask someone and everybody in the room here would probably say I need SASS.</span> <span data-start="1097.26" data-end="1108.51">So my sources file, my main file, I thought I would open it, I've already prepared a bit,</span> <span data-start="1108.51" data-end="1116.76">I'm really, really bad at live coding, I create the colour, no longer purple, but hot pink,</span> <span data-start="1116.76" data-end="1123.69">a bit closer to the JSConf.eu colour, now the heading should be hot pink, right.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1123.69" data-end="1131.02">There is one more thing I need to do in order to make this SASS, I need to move my file</span> <span data-start="1131.02" data-end="1143.76">from sources main dot CSS, to main dot — it means when I reload my page, in this case</span> <span data-start="1143.76" data-end="1148.25">it doesn't work, it doesn't work because I've moved the file and it doesn't see the file</span> <span data-start="1148.25" data-end="1150.14">at all.</span> <span data-start="1150.14" data-end="1154.66">Now I'm ready to integrate my transpiler, right.</span> <span data-start="1154.66" data-end="1159.82">So this is where I have a tool that I'd like to demonstration for you, the tool is called</span> <span data-start="1159.82" data-end="1171.69">fusile, a command line tool, I would tell it, can you create a directory call, "DEV",</span> <span data-start="1171.69" data-end="1179.7">before you do this you can see there isn't one, when I run the command it tells me I've</span> <span data-start="1179.7" data-end="1189.37">run some transpilers, babel, the done then I have those in my node modules, you will</span> <span data-start="1189.37" data-end="1196.69">see there is a directory here, with kind of a weird, file size, summary, that doesn't</span> <span data-start="1196.69" data-end="1203.25">quite make sense, but it's called 'DEV', if you see the tree of the sources files compared</span> <span data-start="1203.25" data-end="1207.61">to the tree of the DEV files, they look kind of similar, right, they contain pretty much</span> <span data-start="1207.61" data-end="1215.54">the same files, except for one difference, in my sources directory, main CSS, target</span> <span data-start="1215.54" data-end="1219.07">directory, DEV directory it's called main.</span> <span data-start="1219.07" data-end="1226.28">CSS, what did it do, I can show you what it did.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1226.28" data-end="1231.22">It actually compiled the SASS for me, immediately.</span> <span data-start="1231.22" data-end="1243.88">What I just did here I consumed the — on command it compiled the SASS for me, using the colour</span> <span data-start="1243.88" data-end="1252.33">variable, applied auto brief fixing and sources mapping, if I open this awesome webpage again,</span> <span data-start="1252.33" data-end="1258.28">it's hot pink and has the rotation and everything, it's pretty awesome.</span> <span data-start="1258.28" data-end="1266.54">This does not only work for, for SASS, it also works for, probably, hello world file,</span> <span data-start="1266.54" data-end="1276.24">an ES 6 syntax file, I can show you the output of that, when I read it from the DEV directory</span> <span data-start="1276.24" data-end="1278.9">and it's compiled it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1278.9" data-end="1285.71">It's pretty cool, I ran this one command line tool, this configuration and it does the right</span> <span data-start="1285.71" data-end="1295.15">thing for me.</span> <span data-start="1295.15" data-end="1301.19">So the project is called fusile, it has the same properties of the express middleware</span> <span data-start="1301.19" data-end="1307.95">that I went through before, but it also checks the two other boxes I think, good API, file</span> <span data-start="1307.95" data-end="1314.96">system API, any other tool can consumer there is, Linter, tester, you don't need a web server</span> <span data-start="1314.96" data-end="1325.79">that's clever any more, Python Apache it doesn't need to be spare for your application, it</span> <span data-start="1325.79" data-end="1332.12">stands alone, I only know how to programme node, if you know how to write this in C,</span> <span data-start="1332.12" data-end="1334.57">come poke me and we can do that.</span> <span data-start="1334.57" data-end="1341.22">Behind the scenes it's using library called Fuse, file system in user space, it's actually</span> <span data-start="1341.22" data-end="1347.13">just mounting this virtual directory and when I read the files I can intercept the things</span> <span data-start="1347.13" data-end="1354.21">just like the middleware and do work to them, inside it's a basic streaming pipeline like</span> <span data-start="1354.21" data-end="1358.309">in gulp if you do transpiling.</span> <span data-start="1358.309" data-end="1365.25">So it's an open sources project, it is publicly available and it is on MPM, on version 103</span> <span data-start="1365.25" data-end="1367.35">or something.</span> <span data-start="1367.35" data-end="1372.34">It's not entirely well tested, but it is definitely development-ready, I would love for you to</span> <span data-start="1372.34" data-end="1377.84">go in and try this out and see if you can make it work for your set up, I'm definitely</span> <span data-start="1377.84" data-end="1384.16">going to make this work on my work set up, I want these tools to succeed or at least</span> <span data-start="1384.16" data-end="1386.97">the idea to succeed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1386.97" data-end="1393.89">So, look this up, give me some feedback and chat me up in the break and I can tell you</span> <span data-start="1393.89" data-end="1398.51">more about it, but I want to leave you with this, this is not only about the single tool,</span> <span data-start="1398.51" data-end="1401.6">it's about the concept of tools.</span> <span data-start="1401.6" data-end="1406.87">I want you to remember that tools are there to provide ability and you should reject any</span> <span data-start="1406.87" data-end="1411.39">complexity that they add, or at least question it all the time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1411.39" data-end="1413.9">You should demand simplicity.</span> <span data-start="1413.9" data-end="1420.39">This is what tooling is all about, so I think you should look through your text, see what</span> <span data-start="1420.39" data-end="1425.49">things do you have that actually don't give you any benefits, figure out how they can</span> <span data-start="1425.49" data-end="1427.01">be improved.</span> <span data-start="1427.01" data-end="1431.96">If you can't do-it-yourself, ask on Twitter, I have this problem, how can we improve it.</span> <span data-start="1431.96" data-end="1436.659">I think this is the way to move tooling forward, I would really like to give the next generation</span> <span data-start="1436.659" data-end="1437.659">of</span> <span data-start="1437.659" data-end="1442.539">web developers an easier starting point than we have, I don't want anybody mess we that</span> <span data-start="1442.539" data-end="1448.279">the amount of configuration it takes to set this up manually.</span> <span data-start="1448.279" data-end="1454.49">My slides are here, you can follow me here and occasionally blog on this URL, I want</span> <span data-start="1454.49" data-end="1455.89">to thank you for listening to me.</span> </p>
