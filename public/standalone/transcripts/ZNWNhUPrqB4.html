<p><span data-start="7.129" data-end="13.07">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="13.07" data-end="14.07">Good morning.</span> <span data-start="14.07" data-end="15.33">My name is Ella.</span> <span data-start="15.33" data-end="19.21">I would like to talk to you about publishing on the web.</span> <span data-start="19.21" data-end="22.359">Imagine publishing on the web, right, when the web was born.</span> <span data-start="22.359" data-end="25.67">A web page would look something like this.</span> <span data-start="25.67" data-end="34.29">You could you would have a title, some links, a side bar with functionality, breadcrumbs,</span> <span data-start="34.29" data-end="41.4">but you would have to rewrite this all the time.</span> <span data-start="41.4" data-end="49.98">All of this would you like to put on every page and write it all the time.</span> <span data-start="49.98" data-end="54.41">What if you liked to change something on every page of the site?</span> <span data-start="54.41" data-end="57.95">This is why we have content management systems, right?</span> <span data-start="57.95" data-end="58.97">Thanks.</span> <span data-start="58.97" data-end="66.189">So a web page would look something like this: titles, links, side bar, a search functionality,</span> <span data-start="66.189" data-end="69.86">and all of this you would like to have on every page.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="69.86" data-end="71.63">And it's quite easy to rewrite it all the time.</span> <span data-start="71.63" data-end="75.33">This is why we have content management systems, right?</span> <span data-start="75.33" data-end="82.31">They simplify web publishing quite a lot.</span> <span data-start="82.31" data-end="87.17">So, title of, breadcrumbs, they are generated for you.</span> <span data-start="87.17" data-end="93.24">When WordPress was born 16 years ago, out of this satire to simplify publishing on the</span> <span data-start="93.24" data-end="104.64">web, they also had a function called .. because I tried to rewrite every single paragraph</span> <span data-start="104.64" data-end="111.119">deck in this content, but I just — sorry.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="111.119" data-end="120.139">So, I would automatic ly wrap every line of text separated by two line breaks with paragraph</span> <span data-start="120.139" data-end="121.499">text.</span> <span data-start="121.499" data-end="125.729">This was before any visual editors exist odd the web.</span> <span data-start="125.729" data-end="128.63">It was even before markdown was born.</span> <span data-start="128.63" data-end="132.98">And I see this a bit as the first step towards visual editing.</span> <span data-start="132.98" data-end="138.2">So this simplified web publishing a little bit, but you would still have to write other</span> <span data-start="138.2" data-end="144.68">HTML, like links, images, auto formatting.</span> <span data-start="144.68" data-end="152.58">So it is not easy to read this text, and it still looks a bit like code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="152.58" data-end="161.7">A year later, style MC was born and WordPress including it into the CMS, and it would look</span> <span data-start="161.7" data-end="163.57">like this.</span> <span data-start="163.57" data-end="168.09">Everything was well, at least for a while.</span> <span data-start="168.09" data-end="169.95">So how did this visual editor work?</span> <span data-start="169.95" data-end="171.452">It used the browser API calls.</span> <span data-start="171.452" data-end="175.16">It is really cool.</span> <span data-start="175.16" data-end="182.42">You can just add attributes to any HTML deck and it would make everything editable inside</span> <span data-start="182.42" data-end="183.42">it.</span> <span data-start="183.42" data-end="189.95">You could put it on the body elements and your whole page becomes editable.</span> <span data-start="189.95" data-end="191.511">You can literally put anything inside it.</span> <span data-start="191.511" data-end="194.76">It's really magic.</span> <span data-start="194.76" data-end="205.03">But the API had no specification, and it was later taken over by other browsers.</span> <span data-start="205.03" data-end="210.18">Every browser implemented it differently, so everyone had their own opinions about how</span> <span data-start="210.18" data-end="211.83">it should work.</span> <span data-start="211.83" data-end="215.93">Should enter create a line break or a paragraph tag?</span> <span data-start="215.93" data-end="217.01">A gif tag?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="217.01" data-end="219.85">Should it depend on the context string?</span> <span data-start="219.85" data-end="226.4">Should backspace delete a second image or delete an entire figure deck?</span> <span data-start="226.4" data-end="229.76">What should happen with the caption?</span> <span data-start="229.76" data-end="236.07">What happens if you press the ..? Should it insert inline styles, create a B tag or</span> <span data-start="236.07" data-end="241.19">strong tag?</span> <span data-start="241.19" data-end="246.65">Any visual representation of your content has an infinite all the of DOM forms, so there</span> <span data-start="246.65" data-end="252.74">will be invisible spin tags, invisible characters, like non-breaking spaces, method elements.</span> <span data-start="252.74" data-end="258.34">You can even split a tag into multiple pieces and you wouldn't see it.</span> <span data-start="258.34" data-end="264.03">So you literally don't see what you're doing, and this DOM content becomes your source of</span> <span data-start="264.03" data-end="267.62">truth.</span> <span data-start="267.62" data-end="270.79">So selection has the same problem.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="270.79" data-end="271.79">Let me quickly show you.</span> <span data-start="271.79" data-end="280.06">So if I selected text, did I select a paragraph contents, or did I select a whole paragraph,</span> <span data-start="280.06" data-end="282.8">or did I select the entire blog post?</span> <span data-start="282.8" data-end="288.82">The visual representation is very ambiguous.</span> <span data-start="288.82" data-end="291.639">And here we have a link.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="291.639" data-end="295.99">If you have an insertion point, you cannot really tell if the insertion point is inside</span> <span data-start="295.99" data-end="297.76">or outside the link.</span> <span data-start="297.76" data-end="303.25">You have no choice where to insert.</span> <span data-start="303.25" data-end="311.431">And finally, when you have non-editable areas inside editable areas, it's buggy across the</span> <span data-start="311.431" data-end="316">browser as well, and this is complex for more building stones.</span> <span data-start="316" data-end="322.37">I think we can agree that content is like black magic.</span> <span data-start="322.37" data-end="326.47">You can put anything inside it, and you don't know what will happen.</span> <span data-start="326.47" data-end="328.06">It's a bit of a black box.</span> <span data-start="328.06" data-end="335.48">And what will come out is HTML soup.</span> <span data-start="335.48" data-end="341.61">So we don't want to build an editor on to such complex foundations.</span> <span data-start="341.61" data-end="349.33">Slowly writing on the web more chaotic, and content was not the only thing to blame.</span> <span data-start="349.33" data-end="354.83">The WordPress editor also have some design problems.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="354.83" data-end="362.36">Brief plugins would try to build things .. autoplugins were creating shortfalls more and more complex</span> <span data-start="362.36" data-end="369.37">things, creating for more calls and even more problems.</span> <span data-start="369.37" data-end="375.31">Some plugins would give up on the visual editor entirely and put custom boxes outside the</span> <span data-start="375.31" data-end="376.68">editor.</span> <span data-start="376.68" data-end="383.29">They would do it all differently, so different coloured buttons, different types of models.</span> <span data-start="383.29" data-end="389.26">Each more bigger and bigger to grab your attention.</span> <span data-start="389.26" data-end="396.81">So I would call it spaghetti UI.</span> <span data-start="396.81" data-end="399.51">In comes Gutenberg.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="399.51" data-end="408.71">It took us quite a while to build it because we had to take all these plugins into consideration.</span> <span data-start="408.71" data-end="412.5">With Gutenberg, we wanted to create an editor from the ground up.</span> <span data-start="412.5" data-end="417.43">We wanted publishing on the web to become effortless, and we wanted to end the constant</span> <span data-start="417.43" data-end="419.76">editable mess.</span> <span data-start="419.76" data-end="423.92">We wanted to create consistency in the UI.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="423.92" data-end="429.699">This was also an opportunity for WordPress to introduce JavaScript more seriously into</span> <span data-start="429.699" data-end="431.729">the community.</span> <span data-start="431.729" data-end="434.58">So how did we do this?</span> <span data-start="434.58" data-end="441.389">Everything becomes a block, so paragraphs, images, headings embed, and this might sound</span> <span data-start="441.389" data-end="447.42">a bit simple, but it's important to think about a writing experience as something fluid,</span> <span data-start="447.42" data-end="456.81">so it's not immediately obvious in terms of UI and in terms of an extension mechanism.</span> <span data-start="456.81" data-end="465.64">HTML has block-level elements and we would like this underlying structure to shine through.</span> <span data-start="465.64" data-end="469.729">So first let's have a look at how we save this content.</span> <span data-start="469.729" data-end="475.18">Even though the editor state is an object tree, a tree of blocks we don't want to save</span> <span data-start="475.18" data-end="481.56">it as JSON or short calls or custom markup, we want to save it as HTML.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="481.56" data-end="485.28">Saving at HTML ensures that the data is portable.</span> <span data-start="485.28" data-end="487.18">It works everywhere.</span> <span data-start="487.18" data-end="491.89">And we don't want to the user to be locked into our system.</span> <span data-start="491.89" data-end="497.28">Also HTML is a bit of the — also, it doesn't need any logic to render the page, so if a</span> <span data-start="497.28" data-end="500.199">plugin disappears, the content will still be there.</span> <span data-start="500.199" data-end="501.57">The page can still render.</span> <span data-start="501.57" data-end="508.74">HTML is quite a pit of a lower language of the web but we need the markup to carry more</span> <span data-start="508.74" data-end="510.69">meaning.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="510.69" data-end="513.05">Think about a table, for example,.</span> <span data-start="513.05" data-end="520.71">It can be used for a plain table, and a plain table block or a calendar block.</span> <span data-start="520.71" data-end="526.35">So we decided to use HTML comments to describe and to separate these blocks.</span> <span data-start="526.35" data-end="532.29">They are syntactically very different from HTML, so our blog parser doesn't need to know</span> <span data-start="532.29" data-end="535.44">HTML.</span> <span data-start="535.44" data-end="541.05">And our side of this block added to context, these comments will just disappear.</span> <span data-start="541.05" data-end="549.96">It also makes it possible to have — here is an example of a block.</span> <span data-start="549.96" data-end="554.69">It makes it possible to create dynamic blocks, so blocks that rely on external data to render,</span> <span data-start="554.69" data-end="559.42">like advertisement, or photo album.</span> <span data-start="559.42" data-end="567.37">WordPress really values backwards compatibility, and we want to respect existing content.</span> <span data-start="567.37" data-end="573.41">So content outside of these blocks delimiters are put in a fall back block, and a fallback</span> <span data-start="573.41" data-end="578.29">block is the old editor inside the block.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="578.29" data-end="583.01">If you do not wish to use the new editor, or you just want to keep on writing in HTML,</span> <span data-start="583.01" data-end="584.01">it's possible.</span> <span data-start="584.01" data-end="586.5">You can just use this one block.</span> <span data-start="586.5" data-end="589.4">This shows how robust the block system is.</span> <span data-start="589.4" data-end="594.2">Each block is an isolated container.</span> <span data-start="594.2" data-end="599.49">The block parser can recover from any invalid HTML because it doesn't need to parse it.</span> <span data-start="599.49" data-end="604.76">HTML parsing errors are added on the block level.</span> <span data-start="604.76" data-end="610.74">The theme for JavaScript errors, so we use React error boundaries to catch the errors,</span> <span data-start="610.74" data-end="616.32">and to display them inside the blocks, so, if any plugin creates an error, it's no problem</span> <span data-start="616.32" data-end="618.08">for the entire editor.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="618.08" data-end="626.33">And finally, since we don't use the entire block lift, we don't have to worry about the</span> <span data-start="626.33" data-end="631.3">browser messing the markup up.</span> <span data-start="631.3" data-end="633.46">So now, some new things about the editor.</span> <span data-start="633.46" data-end="639.74">We have placeholders, be so, if you're writing a text, you can just insert the image placeholder</span> <span data-start="639.74" data-end="643.02">and keep on writing and fill in the blanks later.</span> <span data-start="643.02" data-end="649.85">Also, together, these placeholders can form templates, so, if a user doesn't really know</span> <span data-start="649.85" data-end="655.95">how to create the more complex layout, they can rely on templates created by themes or</span> <span data-start="655.95" data-end="660.48">plugins to insert on, and then fill in the blanks.</span> <span data-start="660.48" data-end="667">For example, here, that's from Amnesty International.</span> <span data-start="667" data-end="673.5">If you would like to reuse a piece of content, you can make a block reusable and use it on</span> <span data-start="673.5" data-end="676.76">every other page.</span> <span data-start="676.76" data-end="680.99">So any update to this block will reflect on all the other pages.</span> <span data-start="680.99" data-end="685.81">So, in the background, this is actually a dynamic block.</span> <span data-start="685.81" data-end="693.35">So, the editor is quite simple to extend people have created drawing blocks, form blogs.</span> <span data-start="693.35" data-end="698.85">You can even put a editor inside the editor, and here you can see it's a blog that someone</span> <span data-start="698.85" data-end="702.86">created in 17 lines of JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="702.86" data-end="714.31">Finally, it is much easier to discover features.</span> <span data-start="714.31" data-end="720.73">Before people would know how to paste a YouTube URL, that pasting would embed the video.</span> <span data-start="720.73" data-end="727">Now this is part of the block list, so it is easier to discover and also searchable.</span> <span data-start="727" data-end="734.67">In the future, we would like to have a plugin directory, and so if you search for a block</span> <span data-start="734.67" data-end="741.5">and it's not installed locally, you will get some suggestions to install plugins, and you</span> <span data-start="741.5" data-end="744.27">can install it right in the editor.</span> <span data-start="744.27" data-end="750.029">This is to eliminate some end-user experience.</span> <span data-start="750.029" data-end="752.23">Now what about rich text?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="752.23" data-end="755.5">We still want to write inside these blocks, right?</span> <span data-start="755.5" data-end="764.18">So quickly to kick-start development, we put tiny MC inside components side React but we</span> <span data-start="764.18" data-end="769.76">knew that eventually we wanted something lighter and something more integrated.</span> <span data-start="769.76" data-end="777.529">So, because we had, like, React UI and it needs to handle things like paste and block-level</span> <span data-start="777.529" data-end="784.779">interactions, on top of that, we also wanted some custom features, for example, format</span> <span data-start="784.779" data-end="792.14">boundaries, so here you can see that you have a link, and with a left and right arrow keys,</span> <span data-start="792.14" data-end="796.11">you can navigate inside and outside of a link.</span> <span data-start="796.11" data-end="799.95">This makes it easier if you want to search on the inside or the outside, and you can</span> <span data-start="799.95" data-end="801.43">try this on the other editor.</span> <span data-start="801.43" data-end="804.45">It's not really possible.</span> <span data-start="804.45" data-end="814.01">So, we decided to build our own rich text component, and guess what you use for that?.</span> <span data-start="814.01" data-end="820.48">It gives you a lot of stuff for free.</span> <span data-start="820.48" data-end="825.269">It just works in other languages like Arabic, Japanese out of the box.</span> <span data-start="825.269" data-end="830.079">It's accessible, it resizes, and native UI just works.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="830.079" data-end="836.48">For example, if you shake your phone to undo what you've written, or if you want to use</span> <span data-start="836.48" data-end="842.029">the formatting button on a touch bar of a Mac book.</span> <span data-start="842.029" data-end="847.92">So it is quite good at text-level editing, just not at anything else.</span> <span data-start="847.92" data-end="854.399">So, our components — so, in our components, we want to control the state, and we separated</span> <span data-start="854.399" data-end="857.7">text and format.</span> <span data-start="857.7" data-end="861.47">This makes it much easier to manipulate the data instead of having a three or four formatting</span> <span data-start="861.47" data-end="864.56">- a tree of formatting elements.</span> <span data-start="864.56" data-end="871.22">You have the string methods that you can use, and you have some extra formatting really</span> <span data-start="871.22" data-end="875.959">that functions.</span> <span data-start="875.959" data-end="877.21">So how does this work?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="877.21" data-end="883.99">For example, if you have an editor, you have a universal keys like enter, delete, arrows</span> <span data-start="883.99" data-end="889.61">keys, so we create a new object from the previous old objects with the helper functions, and</span> <span data-start="889.61" data-end="895.71">then update it with the algorithm, pretty much like React works, but for inputs, we</span> <span data-start="895.71" data-end="900.86">have to look at the DOM, create an object, take the concern out of there that we need</span> <span data-start="900.86" data-end="907.2">and update the DOM and if the browser does anything strange in there.</span> <span data-start="907.2" data-end="912.649">Checks components are also extensible so it is possible to run transformations through</span> <span data-start="912.649" data-end="914.39">on input.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="914.39" data-end="922.75">Here, if you type .. it can transform to a port tech.</span> <span data-start="922.75" data-end="929.43">It is possible to add custom formats, things like autocomplete, annotations.</span> <span data-start="929.43" data-end="935.49">You can even do checking like analysis, or spell checking.</span> <span data-start="935.49" data-end="942.68">It is easy to implement.</span> <span data-start="942.68" data-end="947.709">The blocks are tied together, the rechecks are tied together.</span> <span data-start="947.709" data-end="949.889">This is to ensure a good writing flow.</span> <span data-start="949.889" data-end="954.97">If you want to split the blocks, you can use enter, you can use lead, because it should</span> <span data-start="954.97" data-end="957.899">not feel too blocky, right?</span> <span data-start="957.899" data-end="964.77">The differences is that these block interactions are done by us, not by the browser.</span> <span data-start="964.77" data-end="971.48">To this editor rebuild is super versatile.</span> <span data-start="971.48" data-end="973.87">You can use it for documentation.</span> <span data-start="973.87" data-end="985.161">Even people who get the editor — like Drupal, and I've made this whole slide show in Gutenberg</span> <span data-start="985.161" data-end="986.161">as well.</span> <span data-start="986.161" data-end="995.68">I will quickly show you and exit the page.</span> <span data-start="995.68" data-end="1001.399">So here you can see that every slide is a block, and there are blocks not entitled slide,</span> <span data-start="1001.399" data-end="1011.95">so adding paragraphs, how you can also add things like images.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1011.95" data-end="1015.44">Upload an image.</span> <span data-start="1015.44" data-end="1017.07">You can resize it.</span> <span data-start="1017.07" data-end="1018.47">You can move it.</span> <span data-start="1018.47" data-end="1019.47">You can easily move around.</span> <span data-start="1019.47" data-end="1022.75">You don't have to copy and paste.</span> <span data-start="1022.75" data-end="1027.459">And you can also, we have some rich text and extensions work, for example.</span> <span data-start="1027.459" data-end="1032.9">If I want to make something appear on the next key stroke for my slides, I can create</span> <span data-start="1032.9" data-end="1034.589">the slide fragments.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1034.589" data-end="1042.26">Then go back to the presentation.</span> <span data-start="1042.26" data-end="1049.04">So you can make slides with it, and we're actually also using this editor now to edit</span> <span data-start="1049.04" data-end="1053.26">the full site.</span> <span data-start="1053.26" data-end="1059.891">So editing themes is actually how I got involved, how I got involved into WordPress and how</span> <span data-start="1059.891" data-end="1062.97">I learned PHP and JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1062.97" data-end="1070.71">But not everyone has the time or the patience, or interest to do that, right?</span> <span data-start="1070.71" data-end="1076.61">This is a very simplified but a themed template, a WordPress template would look something</span> <span data-start="1076.61" data-end="1077.61">like this.</span> <span data-start="1077.61" data-end="1083.47">You have some PHP and HTML detection.</span> <span data-start="1083.47" data-end="1090.9">But why not let the user directly manipulate those blocks with a graphic user interface?</span> <span data-start="1090.9" data-end="1093.28">Why not let the user add it to the whole site?</span> <span data-start="1093.28" data-end="1099.67">Why should it be reserved for people who know HTML or for people who want to port?</span> <span data-start="1099.67" data-end="1104.77">This gives more power if the to the user, and the theme is reduced to a style sheet.</span> <span data-start="1104.77" data-end="1109.44">In fact, it gets rid of PHP entirely for the templates.</span> <span data-start="1109.44" data-end="1119.19">So there is a reason we call it Gutenberg, and the Gutenberg's printing press changed</span> <span data-start="1119.19" data-end="1126.24">how book-publishing works, we are hoping that this editor changes how web publishing works.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1126.24" data-end="1131.24">We want publishing on the web to become accessible to everyone.</span> <span data-start="1131.24" data-end="1135.74">We want you to be able to break out the walled garden of the internet.</span> <span data-start="1135.74" data-end="1141.151">We want you to be able to publish on your own server and to only your data, and I hope</span> <span data-start="1141.151" data-end="1144.36">this project can help centralise that again.</span> <span data-start="1144.36" data-end="1150.74">WordPress is also translated into over 100 languages, and you can add your own.</span> <span data-start="1150.74" data-end="1158.52">It has 38 million active installs, and these 38 million active installs are separate servers,</span> <span data-start="1158.52" data-end="1163.51">so they're not owned by one company.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1163.51" data-end="1171.67">If you have questions, I will be around later, and I'm on Twitter.</span> <span data-start="1171.67" data-end="1176.21">If you're interested in all these things, feel free to apply and work with us.</span> <span data-start="1176.21" data-end="1180.79">Yes, thanks for coming, and thanks JSConf for having me.</span> </p>
