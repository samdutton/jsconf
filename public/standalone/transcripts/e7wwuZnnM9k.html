<span data-start="362.93" data-end="365.33">knitting is code so let's take a look at</span> <span data-start="365.33" data-end="368.6">this pattern for the first line says co5</span> <span data-start="368.6" data-end="371.24">and let's just do it in JavaScript socio</span> <span data-start="371.24" data-end="374.15">means cast on and that means that just</span> <span data-start="374.15" data-end="377.18">create a space so that you can start</span> <span data-start="377.18" data-end="379.669">it's not a stitch yet so it's kind of</span> <span data-start="379.669" data-end="381.56">like you're cleaning empty LA but like</span> <span data-start="381.56" data-end="386.03">links of five and casting on so next</span> <span data-start="386.03" data-end="389.69">line is k 5 and k stands for knit stitch</span> <span data-start="389.69" data-end="391.88">and 5 means how many times you need to</span> <span data-start="391.88" data-end="393.95">do it so that means this line is saying</span> <span data-start="393.95" data-end="395.709">like knit five stitches</span> <span data-start="395.709" data-end="398.989">so I cleated the value of okay who is</span> <span

data-start="411.889" data-end="413.479">line gets a little tricky so the thing</span> <span data-start="413.479" data-end="415.61">about knitting is that it's Oh episode</span> <span data-start="415.61" data-end="419.599">on the needle so the previous la the</span> <span data-start="419.599" data-end="421.939">links of the previous la always inherit</span> <span

data-start="425.329" data-end="427.849">100 stitches well technically there is a</span> <span data-start="427.849" data-end="428.959">way to do it but like a little more</span> <span data-start="428.959" data-end="433.189">complicated so you inherit the links</span> <span data-start="433.189" data-end="435.529">from the previous low could a new la and</span> <span data-start="435.529" data-end="437.209">then from there you count how many</span> <span data-start="437.209" data-end="439.579">stitches and what to do so the first one</span> <span data-start="439.579" data-end="441.949">we already know k 2 means knit two</span> <span data-start="441.949" data-end="444.889">stitches so I put knit stitches count up</span> <span data-start="444.889" data-end="446.839">the index so now you have a two stitches</span> <span data-start="446.839" data-end="449.869">in your La next one is a new concept m1</span> <span data-start="449.869" data-end="452.779">which is make one stitches and it's a</span> <span data-start="452.779" data-end="454.819">lot like operating the splice method on</span> <span data-start="454.819" data-end="456.469">yo la and putting in like another</span> <span data-start="456.469" data-end="458.749">element into your la so like you know</span> <span data-start="458.749" data-end="461.239">past the index where you are put the new</span> <span data-start="461.239" data-end="464.509">stitches now the LA is length of 6 and</span> <span data-start="464.509" data-end="467.749">then here you have a loop and it's</span> <span data-start="467.749" data-end="470.689">saying that how many ever you have on</span> <span data-start="470.689" data-end="472.729">your needles just knit until last</span> <span data-start="472.729" data-end="475.999">remaining two stitches so in this case</span> <span data-start="475.999" data-end="479.899">you only put one stitches but you do the</span> <span data-start="479.899" data-end="481.489">while loop until the remaining stitches</span> <span data-start="481.489" data-end="485.689">or two and next one we already did that</span> <span data-start="485.689" data-end="488.059">like same thing like eating make one now</span> <span data-start="488.059" data-end="490.399">your legs it's seven and then you two</span> <span data-start="490.399" data-end="493.339">now your second law is complete push it</span> <span data-start="493.339" data-end="495.319">through the my parent my scarf away and</span> <span data-start="495.319" data-end="498.979">now you have to erase or to lowes of</span> <span data-start="498.979" data-end="501.559">knitted fabric there so continue in</span> <span data-start="501.559" data-end="504.079">doing that it looks like this to create</span> <span data-start="504.079" data-end="508.279">a triangle-shaped scarf and what I</span> <span data-start="508.279" data-end="510.679">always thought was that the meaning is</span> <span data-start="510.679"
