a little bit</span> <span data-start="240.03" data-end="241.769">later and we have a really good mocking</span> <span data-start="241.769" data-end="244.23">system here's a couple of more big</span> <span data-start="244.23" data-end="246.48">impact stories with graph QL what I want</span> <span data-start="246.48" data-end="248.16">to highlight here really is monitoring</span> <span

why would you mock</span> <span data-start="270.06" data-end="273.6">stuff it seems like you know obvious why</span> <span data-start="273.6" data-end="274.83">we'd mock but it's really good to kind</span> <span data-start="274.83" data-end="276.48">of steady text back take step back and</span> <span data-start="276.48" data-end="279.06">really think about it so when you mock</span> <span data-start="279.06" data-end="280.23">self you have faster more resilient</span> <span data-start="280.23" data-end="281.639">chest you don't have to wait on an API</span> <span data-start="281.639" data-end="283.95">you have immediately test results you</span> <span data-start="283.95" data-end="286.05">can avoid the waterfall flow by actually</span> <span data-start="286.05"

really easy</span> <span data-start="297.33" data-end="299.79">because we have a schema and the schema</span> <span data-start="299.79" data-end="301.74">has types in it we already know what</span>
