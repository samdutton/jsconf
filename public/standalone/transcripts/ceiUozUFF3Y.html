<p><span data-start="12.7" data-end="17.89">You may have opinion at JSConf Europe last year.</span> <span data-start="17.89" data-end="22.38">And this morning, there was a great introduction to workers.</span> <span data-start="22.38" data-end="29.97">It is exciting times again for animations in serverside JavaScript run times.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="29.97" data-end="38.1">So, here I am to talk about our recent effort to bring a new set of APIs into Node Core.</span> <span data-start="38.1" data-end="44.39">This may be an opportunity for us to really think about the JavaScript API service in</span> <span data-start="44.39" data-end="50.94">the ecosystem and create a more universal developer experience across the different</span> <span data-start="50.94" data-end="51.94">platforms.</span> <span data-start="51.94" data-end="60.36">So, let's finish this that is right, I'm Joyee, I live in Hangzhou.</span> <span data-start="60.36" data-end="68.68">I worked on Gaia, and I'm a member of the Node steering committee.</span> <span data-start="68.68" data-end="73.18">On Twitter or GitHub, Joyee Cheung handle.</span> <span data-start="73.18" data-end="81.22">Some of you may be aware of this effort of bringing more web APIs into Node Core.</span> <span data-start="81.22" data-end="87.56">But maybe some folks are just curious because they hear things that are interesting.</span> <span data-start="87.56" data-end="94.43">So, in case I am using some lingoes that only a very few people understood.</span> <span data-start="94.43" data-end="102.66">So, what does it mean when we talk about bringing web APIs into Node Core? of well, we are basically</span> <span data-start="102.66" data-end="108.4">talking about adding browser APIs to the Node.js runtime as buildings.</span> <span data-start="108.4" data-end="112.99">So, you can run them on the server side without using npm install.</span> <span data-start="112.99" data-end="120.409">So, in this talk I will try to be objective and summarize how far we have come in this</span> <span data-start="120.409" data-end="124.74">journey, where we are, and where we are going.</span> <span data-start="124.74" data-end="130.999">On a teeny tiny side note, Node.js is silent.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="130.999" data-end="137.299">So, like many others, I will try to use the correct pronunciation in this talk.</span> <span data-start="137.299" data-end="144.37">Here is a mental picture of how JavaScript in the wild came to be.</span> <span data-start="144.37" data-end="149.7">In the beginning before Node came along there were two kinds of APIs that came with the</span> <span data-start="149.7" data-end="152.73">runtime for JavaScript developers.</span> <span data-start="152.73" data-end="159.319">There were some JavaScript builtins like date, regular submissions, errors that were part</span> <span data-start="159.319" data-end="160.319">of the language.</span> <span data-start="160.319" data-end="166.5">It was created by system 9 and implemented by engines.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="166.5" data-end="168.09">There was a host API.</span> <span data-start="168.09" data-end="172.019">And at that time hosts were basically just browsers.</span> <span data-start="172.019" data-end="177.989">These APIs were implemented by the browsers and are more or less run by organizations</span> <span data-start="177.989" data-end="181.879">like W3C.</span> <span data-start="181.879" data-end="187.15">And then Node was created a started to take off on the server side.</span> <span data-start="187.15" data-end="192.769">Initially it included some of the web APIs that were already present in the browsers.</span> <span data-start="192.769" data-end="197.449">Or like at least some APIs that look like what you'll find in browsers.</span> <span data-start="197.449" data-end="202.37">But Node also introduced several different APIs for doing certain things on the server</span> <span data-start="202.37" data-end="208.389">side like instead of even target in the browsers.</span> <span data-start="208.389" data-end="213.599">Because the semantics of the equivalent APIs on the browser side may not make sense for</span> <span data-start="213.599" data-end="214.599">servers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="214.599" data-end="221.449">Like, for example, there isn't one DOM tree in this execution context for events to bubble</span> <span data-start="221.449" data-end="222.449">through on the server side.</span> <span data-start="222.449" data-end="227.7">So, it does not really make sense to implement part of the event target specification in</span> <span data-start="227.7" data-end="229.029">Node.</span> <span data-start="229.029" data-end="237.18">So, as time goes by, browsers have developed and synthesized more APIs in the browser to</span> <span data-start="237.18" data-end="238.98">empower web developers.</span> <span data-start="238.98" data-end="245.769">While Node also developed several equivalent APIs on the server side with a didn't design.</span> <span data-start="245.769" data-end="252.099">Because of the popularity of the Node.js runtime, these home-grown APIs gradually became the</span> <span data-start="252.099" data-end="258.079">defacto factors for the server side run times.</span> <span data-start="258.079" data-end="263.65">But obviously no one likes to remember two sets of APIs for doing basically the same</span> <span data-start="263.65" data-end="264.65">thing.</span> <span data-start="264.65" data-end="269.45">So, over the past few years people have been sending feature requests to Node to bring</span> <span data-start="269.45" data-end="272.34">the two platforms closer together.</span> <span data-start="272.34" data-end="277.27">For now, it usually means making the runtime more compatible with browsers.</span> <span data-start="277.27" data-end="284.6">So, Node did evaluate and implement some of the requests and it is looking into more APIs</span> <span data-start="284.6" data-end="285.699">from the web.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="285.699" data-end="292.259">So, we currently have different types of web APIs implemented in Node Core.</span> <span data-start="292.259" data-end="296.4">So, some of them are more localize the with the browsers.</span> <span data-start="296.4" data-end="303.229">And, for instance, we have methods in the browsers, and this is the living standard</span> <span data-start="303.229" data-end="309.02">of the timers in the HTML specification.</span> <span data-start="309.02" data-end="314.59">In Node we also have a set of timer APIs, that's similar, but the implementation does</span> <span data-start="314.59" data-end="317.77">not strictly follow what the browsers do.</span> <span data-start="317.77" data-end="325.919">For example, it returns an object while browsers usually return a number instead.</span> <span data-start="325.919" data-end="332.659">The other type of web APIs we have in Node Core are the ones implemented with an existing</span> <span data-start="332.659" data-end="339.74">specification in mind and behave mostly the same as the APIs that you will find in browsers.</span> <span data-start="339.74" data-end="346.75">For instance, the new URL implementation in Node Core was developed specifically according</span> <span data-start="346.75" data-end="349.41">to the URL standard.</span> <span data-start="349.41" data-end="355.099">This means we did look at the spec test when we implemented them.</span> <span data-start="355.099" data-end="356.889">And we also have tests.</span> <span data-start="356.889" data-end="363.199">So, how do we know how close our implementations are to the ones in the browser?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="363.199" data-end="370.159">We run a subset of the web platform tests which are tests which are on browsers and</span> <span data-start="370.159" data-end="372.219">other implementations.</span> <span data-start="372.219" data-end="378.81">So, to see the current status of the performance in Node, you can look at the status files</span> <span data-start="378.81" data-end="384.379">under tests, the status folder of the Node project.</span> <span data-start="384.379" data-end="390.99">There are a few pretty selfexplanatory JSON files documenting the web standards implemented</span> <span data-start="390.99" data-end="392.05">in Node.</span> <span data-start="392.05" data-end="398.789">So, this one is not technically a web API addition, but I wanted to mention that there</span> <span data-start="398.789" data-end="402.889">is now another type of web standards implemented in the core.</span> <span data-start="402.889" data-end="409.4">We have collaborated with the what is the HTML specification and the first implementation</span> <span data-start="409.4" data-end="416.889">of JSON modules has landed in the master branch as part of our experimental ECMAScript module.</span> <span data-start="416.889" data-end="419.939">So, Node implemented first.</span> <span data-start="419.939" data-end="429.34">So, here we have the web APIs implemented in Node Core that can be alternatives to certain</span> <span data-start="429.34" data-end="432.199">home-grown Node build teams.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="432.199" data-end="439.38">Legacy methods under the URL and the string built in module can be replaced by the new</span> <span data-start="439.38" data-end="443.62">URL and the URL search params classes.</span> <span data-start="443.62" data-end="449.449">And searching and coding and decoding methods of buffer and string decoder can be replaced</span> <span data-start="449.449" data-end="453.629">by text decoder and text decoder as well.</span> <span data-start="453.629" data-end="459.75">And there is the performance API which, for example, can be used to replace certain timing</span> <span data-start="459.75" data-end="463.349">methods in the process object.</span> <span data-start="463.349" data-end="469.949">In addition, we also have some APIs that are not exactly replacements for existing Node</span> <span data-start="469.949" data-end="470.949">APIs.</span> <span data-start="470.949" data-end="476.59">But are similar enough in many use cases that it is reasonable to consider them as alternatives.</span> <span data-start="476.59" data-end="482.159">Be sure to read the documentation if you want to rewrite your code with these APIs.</span> <span data-start="482.159" data-end="488.379">For example, cue microtask can be used to cue a microtask which will be run asynchronously</span> <span data-start="488.379" data-end="496.309">which will be used to replace the process if you do not have strict requirements about</span> <span data-start="496.309" data-end="499.569">the timing you want your task to be run.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="499.569" data-end="504.889">There is also web worker which spawns threads in Node.</span> <span data-start="504.889" data-end="513.44">And it may be used to replace child processes if you are only looking for a way to upload</span> <span data-start="513.44" data-end="516.159">and you don't necessarily need processes.</span> <span data-start="516.159" data-end="523.31">So, as of Node 12, we have several web API implementations that are now stable and can</span> <span data-start="523.31" data-end="524.38">be used in production.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="524.38" data-end="527.42">Those are listed on the left here.</span> <span data-start="527.42" data-end="529.86">And these are available as globals.</span> <span data-start="529.86" data-end="534.589">So, you don't have to require a builtin to get hold of them.</span> <span data-start="534.589" data-end="539.11">These are also covered by the web platform task in Node Core.</span> <span data-start="539.11" data-end="541.97">There may be some additional extensions in these APIs.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="541.97" data-end="545.85">There's some minor unspecified behavior differences.</span> <span data-start="545.85" data-end="551.31">But at least those are fairly limited, and we are aware of them.</span> <span data-start="551.31" data-end="558.04">We also have a few APIs that are still experimental which means there may still be breaking changes</span> <span data-start="558.04" data-end="559.82">in the future.</span> <span data-start="559.82" data-end="565.339">These are currently placed under builtin modules and not on the global object yet.</span> <span data-start="565.339" data-end="573.73">The current experimental web APIs that we have are workers and performance time being</span> <span data-start="573.73" data-end="574.73">API.</span> <span data-start="574.73" data-end="578.62">But they also differ significantly from what you would get from the browsers.</span> <span data-start="578.62" data-end="582.73">And we do not run web platform tests for them yet.</span> <span data-start="582.73" data-end="584.17">So, watch out.</span> <span data-start="584.17" data-end="592.79">So, there is also an implementation of WebAssembly, the JavaScript API of WebAssembly that we</span> <span data-start="592.79" data-end="595.44">get for free from V8.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="595.44" data-end="601.88">But the web API of it has not been implemented yet.</span> <span data-start="601.88" data-end="608.94">Other than existing APIs, there are a bunch of others that are hunting the issue tracker.</span> <span data-start="608.94" data-end="609.94">Oops.</span> <span data-start="609.94" data-end="614.23">There are still under active discussion.</span> <span data-start="614.23" data-end="621.18">They're web strings which are the foundation of web specifications.</span> <span data-start="621.18" data-end="626.579">But then we already have Node strings in Core which are also the foundation of many existing</span> <span data-start="626.579" data-end="629.07">Node Core APIs.</span> <span data-start="629.07" data-end="633.97">In case you didn't know, there are many different types of strings in Node.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="633.97" data-end="635.389">There's string number one.</span> <span data-start="635.389" data-end="637.139">Which has several issues.</span> <span data-start="637.139" data-end="641.18">So, they now introduce string number two.</span> <span data-start="641.18" data-end="643.7">But then they also had some issues.</span> <span data-start="643.7" data-end="647.78">And then actually introduce string number three which still had issues.</span> <span data-start="647.78" data-end="654.07">So, there's now a new implementation of strings called Bob which is under development for</span> <span data-start="654.07" data-end="655.62">some time.</span> <span data-start="655.62" data-end="658.699">And will hopefully solve all our problems.</span> <span data-start="658.699" data-end="661.18">Anyway, this is not a string talk.</span> <span data-start="661.18" data-end="663.76">You can read the documentation if you want to learn more about them.</span> <span data-start="663.76" data-end="668.94">So, with all the strings, you can imagine how complicated it would be to bring yet another</span> <span data-start="668.94" data-end="672.709">string into Node Core.</span> <span data-start="672.709" data-end="674.51">And there is also Fetch.</span> <span data-start="674.51" data-end="679.74">Which is probably the most requested web API in Node Core.</span> <span data-start="679.74" data-end="686.33">We just had a session about it this week at the Open JS Coverage Summit in Berlin and</span> <span data-start="686.33" data-end="693.87">there is now a new work in progress pull request to bring it fresh into Node Core.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="693.87" data-end="695.27">Yay!</span> <span data-start="695.27" data-end="704.279">[ Applause ] So, we have to talk about the history of these</span> <span data-start="704.279" data-end="708.269">web APIs in Node and what may be coming next.</span> <span data-start="708.269" data-end="712.61">So, why exactly are we doing this?</span> <span data-start="712.61" data-end="720.139">One obvious run is with a common API surface, there is less cognitive burden for developers.</span> <span data-start="720.139" data-end="724.149">We could their documentation, tutorials, tooling.</span> <span data-start="724.149" data-end="730.6">Instead of developing and maintaining a separate set of educational resources.</span> <span data-start="730.6" data-end="734.04">This is especially important for just beginners.</span> <span data-start="734.04" data-end="741.17">At the moment they have to choose between Web APIs and Node APIs when they are just</span> <span data-start="741.17" data-end="743.13">getting started.</span> <span data-start="743.13" data-end="749.38">With a common API service, beginners can be less distracted learning about basics.</span> <span data-start="749.38" data-end="751.91">There are still differences between the two platforms.</span> <span data-start="751.91" data-end="758.63">But it will be less intimidating when they already learned a bit more about these APIs.</span> <span data-start="758.63" data-end="767.49">So, another reason for web APIs into Node core, we have more containers compared to</span> <span data-start="767.49" data-end="769.589">more npm modules.</span> <span data-start="769.589" data-end="775.17">This is open source and it's natural that contributors come and go.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="775.17" data-end="782.959">In Node, even when the existing maintainers of a specific builtin module shop less often,</span> <span data-start="782.959" data-end="789.59">we have an open governance and an effective nomination and onboarding process to bring</span> <span data-start="789.59" data-end="793.14">new contributors into the team.</span> <span data-start="793.14" data-end="799.75">Compared to regular npm modules, this kind of maintenance story fits better with the</span> <span data-start="799.75" data-end="804.24">Web APIs that are designed as builtins for the host environment.</span> <span data-start="804.24" data-end="811.139">So, if you have been paying some attention to this topic, you may be aware that it takes</span> <span data-start="811.139" data-end="817.79">an extraordinary amount of time for this API additions to be accepted into Node Core.</span> <span data-start="817.79" data-end="823.48">Here I will lay out some of the reasons why there are several requests that keep showing</span> <span data-start="823.48" data-end="828.589">up in the issue checker but have never really gone anywhere.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="828.589" data-end="834.91">So, everything I'm going to talk about later are in the context of the consensusseeking</span> <span data-start="834.91" data-end="836.6">model of Node Core.</span> <span data-start="836.6" data-end="844.47">So, Node Core is operated under the consensus from over 100 core collaborators.</span> <span data-start="844.47" data-end="848.58">These are contributors who have write access to the repository.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="848.58" data-end="854.42">For every technical decision, any one of these 100 more than 100 Node Core collaborators</span> <span data-start="854.42" data-end="857.089">creates an objection.</span> <span data-start="857.089" data-end="862.74">If consensus cannot be reached within the collaborators, it may come down to a vote</span> <span data-start="862.74" data-end="868.279">among the members of the tech committee who are a subset of the collaborators.</span> <span data-start="868.279" data-end="870.79">But we usually try to avoid voting.</span> <span data-start="870.79" data-end="877.22">We also take community feedback into account even if it's not from someone who has committed</span> <span data-start="877.22" data-end="879.55">into Node before.</span> <span data-start="879.55" data-end="887.36">So, here are the common arguments against adding Web APIs into Node Core.</span> <span data-start="887.36" data-end="893.44">There is still, to some extent, a small core philosophy within Node Core.</span> <span data-start="893.44" data-end="900.99">It's about providing only the basics functionalities in Core and empower users to implement user</span> <span data-start="900.99" data-end="907.279">modules instead of building our own opinionated APIs that may become a compatibility or maintenance</span> <span data-start="907.279" data-end="908.279">burden.</span> <span data-start="908.279" data-end="912.35">This philosophy has been broken several times in the past.</span> <span data-start="912.35" data-end="920.879">But at least as far as Web API goes, we are still mostly just trying to expose the existing</span> <span data-start="920.879" data-end="925.92">functionalities through a different API services.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="925.92" data-end="931.18">This is not exactly an idea that's welcomed by everybody either.</span> <span data-start="931.18" data-end="937.92">Especially when the web API may also lack features that do not make sense for browsers.</span> <span data-start="937.92" data-end="939.36">Oh, yeah.</span> <span data-start="939.36" data-end="944.519">And like sometimes they may be necessary for servers.</span> <span data-start="944.519" data-end="953.67">So, one alternative to adding these APIs in Node is to release them as official modules.</span> <span data-start="953.67" data-end="959.13">Theoretically for modules that are maintained under the Node organization, it will be possible</span> <span data-start="959.13" data-end="964.62">to have a maintenance story similar to the one that Node query has.</span> <span data-start="964.62" data-end="971.08">But some may also argue that it is easier to optimize if it's done in Core because it</span> <span data-start="971.08" data-end="973.6">can use certain internal APIs.</span> <span data-start="973.6" data-end="978.959">Or sometimes it may just not be technically possible to implement something without access</span> <span data-start="978.959" data-end="980.089">to internals.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="980.089" data-end="986.98">A part of the philosophical concerns, apart from those, there are concerns about the design</span> <span data-start="986.98" data-end="989.54">of the web APIs.</span> <span data-start="989.54" data-end="993.31">They're more than just a bunch of interfaces.</span> <span data-start="993.31" data-end="998.379">Behind the Design of these APIs, there is just a very different context.</span> <span data-start="998.379" data-end="1004.18">For instance, the browser has a very different security model.</span> <span data-start="1004.18" data-end="1013.62">When you fetch an API endpoint, for example, at a script and you want to send credentials</span> <span data-start="1013.62" data-end="1016.629">like cookies along with the request.</span> <span data-start="1016.629" data-end="1024.1">Fetch as implemented according to the specifications should follow the crossorigin resource protocol</span> <span data-start="1024.1" data-end="1031.13">and check the access control allowed header in the HTTP response before invoking that</span> <span data-start="1031.13" data-end="1032.13">with the data.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1032.13" data-end="1036.7">So, that scripts cannot untrusted scripts cannot steal your cookies when the server</span> <span data-start="1036.7" data-end="1040.04">is not aware of them.</span> <span data-start="1040.04" data-end="1045.59">Somewhere in Node, there isn't really a concept of origins.</span> <span data-start="1045.59" data-end="1048.28">At least for now.</span> <span data-start="1048.28" data-end="1056.53">So, these are loaded from your local file system and are just trusted by default within</span> <span data-start="1056.53" data-end="1059.47">current security model of Node.</span> <span data-start="1059.47" data-end="1065.63">If you perform the request using the existing HTTP request method in Node, this security</span> <span data-start="1065.63" data-end="1068.81">policy would have to be implemented by the users.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1068.81" data-end="1071.42">Well, if they do want them.</span> <span data-start="1071.42" data-end="1075.35">It is not impossible to implement something like this in Node.</span> <span data-start="1075.35" data-end="1081.68">But this may just be confusing for most users because then we'll have two conflicting security</span> <span data-start="1081.68" data-end="1083.4">models in Node.</span> <span data-start="1083.4" data-end="1090.7">So, when we look at the Fetch specification, the interface itself is just the tip of the</span> <span data-start="1090.7" data-end="1092.04">iceberg.</span> <span data-start="1092.04" data-end="1099.59">There are many implications under the surface of the API like course origin, consent and</span> <span data-start="1099.59" data-end="1106.42">security policy, caching interop with service workers and like potential management.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1106.42" data-end="1109.7">So, some of this may make sense for now.</span> <span data-start="1109.7" data-end="1110.88">Some of them don't.</span> <span data-start="1110.88" data-end="1116.43">If we only implement part of the API that we think makes sense for Node, we may confuse</span> <span data-start="1116.43" data-end="1123.27">our users more because this will bring another kind of platform compatibility headache to</span> <span data-start="1123.27" data-end="1124.64">everyone.</span> <span data-start="1124.64" data-end="1127.83">There is also another type of concern.</span> <span data-start="1127.83" data-end="1134.42">The ecosystem has come to depend on a lot of existing infrastructure in Node.</span> <span data-start="1134.42" data-end="1139.15">And this may differ significantly from their web equivalence.</span> <span data-start="1139.15" data-end="1145.4">For example, we have different interfaces to do stringing and to emit events.</span> <span data-start="1145.4" data-end="1153.08">As usual, there are even more differences in the underlying design of these infrastructures.</span> <span data-start="1153.08" data-end="1158.26">When implementing web APIs in Node, we also need to decide whether we want to introduce</span> <span data-start="1158.26" data-end="1164.63">the web infrastructure into Node Core or base the higher-level APIs on the existing Node</span> <span data-start="1164.63" data-end="1168.44">infrastructure or just use some instruction layer instead.</span> <span data-start="1168.44" data-end="1174.84">We will also need to figure out the interop between these abstractions for other existing</span> <span data-start="1174.84" data-end="1175.84">modules.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1175.84" data-end="1178.94">And this work just takes a lot of time.</span> <span data-start="1178.94" data-end="1182.75">So, there are a lot of open questions to answer.</span> <span data-start="1182.75" data-end="1186.21">A lot of decisions to be made.</span> <span data-start="1186.21" data-end="1191.37">And this, you know, just takes time in the current this is the model in Node Core.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1191.37" data-end="1198.15">But how do new Web API actually ended up being added to Node Core these days?</span> <span data-start="1198.15" data-end="1205.39">It usually starts with a feature request opened in the Node.js/node repository.</span> <span data-start="1205.39" data-end="1212.52">To actually make progress on the request, someone, or some group of people, need to</span> <span data-start="1212.52" data-end="1216.49">step up and start a prototype.</span> <span data-start="1216.49" data-end="1218.64">They do not need to be Node collaborators.</span> <span data-start="1218.64" data-end="1223.58">It could be anyone who are willing to invest their time in the work.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1223.58" data-end="1226.67">Typically, they would create a fork.</span> <span data-start="1226.67" data-end="1231.29">Either as a personal fork or as a fork under the Node organization.</span> <span data-start="1231.29" data-end="1238.37">And they will hack together an initial invitation and then send a pull request back to the main</span> <span data-start="1238.37" data-end="1241.72">repository against the master branch.</span> <span data-start="1241.72" data-end="1248.641">At these stages there may be objections coming from collaborators or the community.</span> <span data-start="1248.641" data-end="1252.15">Sometimes the proposal just gets stalled and closed.</span> <span data-start="1252.15" data-end="1258.23">For example, this is the current status of the feature request for web crypto.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1258.23" data-end="1263.15">Sometimes, but rarely, there are no objections.</span> <span data-start="1263.15" data-end="1268.8">Or these objections get resolved either through discussion or through voting.</span> <span data-start="1268.8" data-end="1274.59">Either way, someone must be interested enough in this feature to get it through the consensusseeking</span> <span data-start="1274.59" data-end="1275.8">model.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1275.8" data-end="1281.88">Then the initial implementation may get merged into the master branch.</span> <span data-start="1281.88" data-end="1287.16">So, once the feature is merged in master, we'll start iterating on this.</span> <span data-start="1287.16" data-end="1289.26">Fixing bugs, optimizing.</span> <span data-start="1289.26" data-end="1296.89">At a certain point, depending how visible it is, we may start with the subset of web</span> <span data-start="1296.89" data-end="1303.9">platform tests with it and collaborate with the web platform tests upstring as well as</span> <span data-start="1303.9" data-end="1309.16">the authors to improve this spec and the test suite.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1309.16" data-end="1315.77">It is also typical to eventually expose these interfaces to the global object.</span> <span data-start="1315.77" data-end="1322.85">But this is depending on various complexities.</span> <span data-start="1322.85" data-end="1328.33">At this phase, the feature is still in experimental status.</span> <span data-start="1328.33" data-end="1334.92">Depending on the release schedule, this feature may be released to users while it is experimental.</span> <span data-start="1334.92" data-end="1341.36">And it may get updated in the release branch with patches back ported and the master branch.</span> <span data-start="1341.36" data-end="1347.79">So, this is the current status of web workers and the performance timing API.</span> <span data-start="1347.79" data-end="1355.42">Eventually this feature would be, or it is supposed to be, moved out of experiment and</span> <span data-start="1355.42" data-end="1357.53">becomes a stable feature.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1357.53" data-end="1362.06">This is the current status of the URL and encoding implementation.</span> <span data-start="1362.06" data-end="1365.3">So, here's a quick summary.</span> <span data-start="1365.3" data-end="1371.79">Node query APIs have diverged from the web APIs because they were designed for very different</span> <span data-start="1371.79" data-end="1373.12">use cases.</span> <span data-start="1373.12" data-end="1377.83">But more and more web APIs have now been added into Node Core.</span> <span data-start="1377.83" data-end="1383.58">We have work would through the existing web APIs in Node Core and their status.</span> <span data-start="1383.58" data-end="1389.24">Then we looked into the challenges and the workflow of bringing for APIs into Node Core</span> <span data-start="1389.24" data-end="1390.51">in the future.</span> <span data-start="1390.51" data-end="1396.78">So, finally, we are starting an open standards initiative in Node to collaborate more with</span> <span data-start="1396.78" data-end="1399.83">senders and other implementations.</span> <span data-start="1399.83" data-end="1406.02">As we said earlier, there are many questions to answer and it takes a lot of energy to</span> <span data-start="1406.02" data-end="1408">find the answers.</span> <span data-start="1408" data-end="1415.88">If you are interested, please get involved.</span> <span data-start="1415.88" data-end="1419.55">Thank you.</span> </p>
