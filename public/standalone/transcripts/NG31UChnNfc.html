not happening anytime soon so</span> <span data-start="381.1" data-end="385.1">then I took a little bit of a break from</span> <span data-start="385.1" data-end="387.53">robotics I was getting a little tired of</span> <span data-start="387.53" data-end="390.38">being alone in a lab and it was cold and</span> <span data-start="390.38" data-end="392.18">this whole academic process was really</span> <span data-start="392.18" data-end="395.389">slow and yeah so I decided to do</span> <span data-start="395.389" data-end="397.52">something that kind of filled my instant</span> <span data-start="397.52" data-end="401.18">gratification thing and that was web</span> <span data-start="401.18" data-end="403.22">development I was like hey I can press</span> <span data-start="403.22" data-end="406.849">refresh and boom look I can see what's</span> <span data-start="406.849" data-end="408.169">there and that's awesome i don't have to</span> <span data-start="408.169" data-end="409.91">worry about</span> <span data-start="409.91" data-end="411.62">and then porting it over to the robot</span> <span data-start="411.62" data-end="414.89">and hoping and praying that that the</span> <span data-start="414.89" data-end="417.77">robot will still work after everything</span> <span data-start="417.77" data-end="419.12">that there doesn't isn't like magic</span> <span data-start="419.12" data-end="420.8">smoke or something I can just literally</span> <span data-start="420.8" data-end="423.92">press refresh and see what happens but</span> <span data-start="423.92" data-end="426.95">then then you know Here I am playing</span> <span data-start="426.95" data-end="429.23">around a node and having some fun and</span> <span data-start="429.23" data-end="432.68">then there's this this guy you may have</span> <span data-start="432.68" data-end="435.89">met him um who decided that he wanted to</span> <span data-start="435.89" data-end="437.33">start playing around with hardware and</span> <span data-start="437.33" data-end="439.04">node and I was like okay that's that's</span> <span data-start="439.04" data-end="442.64">cool you know no big deal and then there</span> <span data-start="442.64" data-end="447.8">was this other guy yeah who decided that</span> <span data-start="447.8" data-end="450.47">you know really robots hard word one</span> <span data-start="450.47" data-end="453.71">okay robots yeah okay cool and I saw his</span> <span data-start="453.71" data-end="456.5">at his his talk at node conf last year</span> <span data-start="456.5" data-end="459.71">and and it was really cute there was</span> <span data-start="459.71" data-end="462.17">this little robot and he was he was</span> <span data-start="462.17" data-end="464.15">running around a stage he's trying to</span> <span data-start="464.15" data-end="466.99">avoid these obstacles and I was like um</span> <span data-start="466.99" data-end="469.94">but then I said wait a second what if we</span> <span data-start="469.94" data-end="474.73">could do more what if we could make them</span> <span data-start="474.73" data-end="481.72">smarter what if we could do stuff so I</span> <span data-start="481.72" data-end="487.58">did um so I basically have created this</span> <span data-start="487.58" data-end="489.169">module call vector which I'll get into a</span> <span data-start="489.169" data-end="491.72">little bit more and the quick version of</span> <span data-start="491.72" data-end="494.69">it it is it's a linear algebra module</span> <span data-start="494.69" data-end="497.66">specifically for robotics just kind of</span> <span data-start="497.66" data-end="501.53">as a starter so let's put that further</span> <span data-start="501.53" data-end="504.05">ado let's get into it a little bit of</span> <span data-start="504.05" data-end="506.15">robotics 101 artificial intelligence</span> <span data-start="506.15" data-end="509.03">let's
