<p><span data-start="41.11" data-end="43.64">So if you're interested in mentoring people who want</span> <span data-start="43.64" data-end="45.54">to become developers, please come talk to me.</span> <span data-start="45.54" data-end="50.7">If you would like to hire six, seven, 12 developers, also come talk to me.</span> <span data-start="50.7" data-end="53.62">I've got cards and other fun stuff.</span> <span data-start="53.62" data-end="59.79">Other administrivia  —  we're starting a nodebots group in Colorado.</span> <span data-start="59.79" data-end="63.04">So if you are in the Boulder region, come hang</span> <span data-start="63.04" data-end="65.21">out with us.</span> <span data-start="65.21" data-end="69.45">Everything you can see today lives in a little readme file on</span> <span data-start="69.45" data-end="70.479">this repo.</span> <span data-start="70.479" data-end="72.9">So you can play along.</span> <span data-start="72.9" data-end="76.479">If you start playing with it while I'm talking, this is an audio talk, and</span> <span data-start="76.479" data-end="80.88">I'll know  —  so maybe wait until lunchtime.</span> <span data-start="80.88" data-end="84.32">But everything is there along with the slides and everything else.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="84.32" data-end="88">So as you've probably gathered from the title of this talk, either A you're in the wrong</span> <span data-start="88" data-end="93.01">room or B you're here to hear about making music with a web browser.</span> <span data-start="93.01" data-end="95.39">So I have a little secret for you.</span> <span data-start="95.39" data-end="98.35">I'll just get this out of the way now.</span> <span data-start="98.35" data-end="103.29">As it turns out, somebody put a synthesizer into your web browser.</span> <span data-start="103.29" data-end="105.83">It's true.</span> <span data-start="105.83" data-end="107.16">So what does that mean?</span> <span data-start="107.16" data-end="110.72">It takes the form of this fun thing called the Web</span> <span data-start="110.72" data-end="115.74">Audio API, which Sam just kind of introduced us to a little bit, and I'm going</span> <span data-start="115.74" data-end="117.83">to go into a little more detail with.</span> <span data-start="117.83" data-end="121.32">And how do we use this Web Audio API?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="121.32" data-end="123.39">That's a great question and I'm glad that you asked it.</span> <span data-start="123.39" data-end="125.59">Start with some context.</span> <span data-start="125.59" data-end="128.6">So if you've ever worked with HTML5 canvas or anything along those</span> <span data-start="128.6" data-end="131.159">lines, you're familiar with a context.</span> <span data-start="131.159" data-end="132.95">It's the canvas you're drawing on.</span> <span data-start="132.95" data-end="134.599">In this case, it's the audio graph that you're</span> <span data-start="134.599" data-end="136.32">working with.</span> <span data-start="136.32" data-end="140.61">In most cases, there is one audio context per page.</span> <span data-start="140.61" data-end="142.709">Basically you create one, spin it up, and start</span> <span data-start="142.709" data-end="145.5">to hook together your different audio nodes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="145.5" data-end="146.5">How do we do that?</span> <span data-start="146.5" data-end="148.2">That's a good question as well.</span> <span data-start="148.2" data-end="150.859">Basically there's a built-in in the browser called audio</span> <span data-start="150.859" data-end="156.62">context, there's a little bit of vendor prefix silliness going on with Safari.</span> <span data-start="156.62" data-end="162.441">So in order to support Safari, we do this little trick  —  oh, hey, give me</span> <span data-start="162.441" data-end="163.79">your audio context.</span> <span data-start="163.79" data-end="164.79">You don't have that?</span> <span data-start="164.79" data-end="166">I'll take your Webkit audio context.</span> <span data-start="166" data-end="167">Either way.</span> <span data-start="167" data-end="169.889">We'll do Tomfoolery to get it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="169.889" data-end="175.319">And then we have it to use.</span> <span data-start="175.319" data-end="178.569">So what is a web audio context?</span> <span data-start="178.569" data-end="182.61">We need to get the audio out of our browser.</span> <span data-start="182.61" data-end="184.609">So we have this thing called a destination.</span> <span data-start="184.609" data-end="188.2">The metaphor I'm going to use if you've ever played guitar is  —  it's like your amplifier.</span> <span data-start="188.2" data-end="190.03">The thing you're plugging everything into.</span> <span data-start="190.03" data-end="196.72">Technically speaking, the operating system's audio, whatever.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="196.72" data-end="197.72">It's the amplifier.</span> <span data-start="197.72" data-end="200.42">Your computer speakers, your ear buds, whatever.</span> <span data-start="200.42" data-end="202.029">We also need some kind of sound source.</span> <span data-start="202.029" data-end="207.469">And we connect that sound source to our destination and we can make sound.</span> <span data-start="207.469" data-end="211.61">The other cool thing is we can put a whole bunch of stuff in the middle, like</span> <span data-start="211.61" data-end="212.61">effect pedals.</span> <span data-start="212.61" data-end="215.489">If you were playing guitar, a wa-wa pedal or delay or chord</span> <span data-start="215.489" data-end="216.489">pedal.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="216.489" data-end="223.159">Take the nodes, whatever sources, do the processing on it, and send</span> <span data-start="223.159" data-end="227.349">that processed version of our audio to the destination and get to use it as</span> <span data-start="227.349" data-end="228.769">well.</span> <span data-start="228.769" data-end="231.159">So let's start by talking about the first piece of this.</span> <span data-start="231.159" data-end="233.249">We want to get some sound out of the browser, so we're going</span> <span data-start="233.249" data-end="236.959">to need to set up that audio context destination.</span> <span data-start="236.959" data-end="238.54">And that is also pretty easy to do.</span> <span data-start="238.54" data-end="241.609">That context that we created in the last little code sample  —  it's</span> <span data-start="241.609" data-end="243.84">got a bunch of properties and methods on it.</span> <span data-start="243.84" data-end="247.889">One of those is destination, and that is a representation of</span> <span data-start="247.889" data-end="249.709">your audio context destination.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="249.709" data-end="250.739">It is your amplifier.</span> <span data-start="250.739" data-end="254.719">It's what you're going to plug other stuff into and where sound is</span> <span data-start="254.719" data-end="256.28">going to come out.</span> <span data-start="256.28" data-end="258.03">So we've got a destination.</span> <span data-start="258.03" data-end="260.91">And now we need some kind of audio source.</span> <span data-start="260.91" data-end="263.58">And we've got a bunch of options.</span> <span data-start="263.58" data-end="265.85">We could load in some kind of sound file.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="265.85" data-end="267.45">That would be cool.</span> <span data-start="267.45" data-end="272.03">We could take something from the user's microphone and analyze</span> <span data-start="272.03" data-end="275.09">it and process it along those lines.</span> <span data-start="275.09" data-end="277.19">Or we could generate our own tones.</span> <span data-start="277.19" data-end="280.27">Now, we're talking about making music with the browser.</span> <span data-start="280.27" data-end="281.27">Right?</span> <span data-start="281.27" data-end="283.41">So the first two are kind of off the table.</span> <span data-start="283.41" data-end="285.17">We don't want to take a pre-recorded music and</span> <span data-start="285.17" data-end="286.17">play it.</span> <span data-start="286.17" data-end="287.17">That's been done.</span> <span data-start="287.17" data-end="288.17">Right?</span> <span data-start="288.17" data-end="289.17">Midi files in the '90s.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="289.17" data-end="290.17">On my Geocities page.</span> <span data-start="290.17" data-end="292.13">I'm not embarrassed at all.</span> <span data-start="292.13" data-end="296.57">We don't just want to play recorded sounds.</span> <span data-start="296.57" data-end="298.25">We want to make sounds.</span> <span data-start="298.25" data-end="301.75">So our hero is going to be the oscillator, which you got</span> <span data-start="301.75" data-end="305.12">a bit of an introduction to in the last talk.</span> <span data-start="305.12" data-end="309.24">And an oscillator basically creates a sound wave.</span> <span data-start="309.24" data-end="314">And a sound wave is just kind of vibration in the air that your ear makes some</span> <span data-start="314" data-end="318.63">sense out of, and turns into a given tone, and there's some distance between</span> <span data-start="318.63" data-end="324.88">each of the waves and the amplitude, which is how high the peaks are and how</span> <span data-start="324.88" data-end="325.88">deep the valleys are.</span> <span data-start="325.88" data-end="326.88">Right?</span> <span data-start="326.88" data-end="327.88">Which..</span> <span data-start="327.88" data-end="331.97">For our purposes, is basically the volume.</span> <span data-start="331.97" data-end="333.2">How do we create an oscillator?</span> <span data-start="333.2" data-end="336.96">Again, we've got some methods on that context that we created before.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="336.96" data-end="344.75">And all we have to do is call create oscillator, and we have created an oscillator.</span> <span data-start="344.75" data-end="345.75">And that's great.</span> <span data-start="345.75" data-end="347.96">Now we've got an oscillator and a destination.</span> <span data-start="347.96" data-end="351.31">Next we need to connect the two of them.</span> <span data-start="351.31" data-end="354.53">Take our keytar in this case and plug it into our</span> <span data-start="354.53" data-end="357.94">amp to get any sound out of it.</span> <span data-start="357.94" data-end="363.71">So we've got a method on that oscillator and we connect the method to the</span> <span data-start="363.71" data-end="365.15">context destination.</span> <span data-start="365.15" data-end="368.5">So we plug the keytar into the amp and we're almost ready</span> <span data-start="368.5" data-end="369.5">to rock and roll.</span> <span data-start="369.5" data-end="373.42">Because the other thing is we need to hit some keys on the</span> <span data-start="373.42" data-end="376.11">keytar in order to play anything.</span> <span data-start="376.11" data-end="381.78">So we start our oscillator and have it create some sounds for us.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="381.78" data-end="385.35">How do we start an oscillator?</span> <span data-start="385.35" data-end="386.81">We call start on it.</span> <span data-start="386.81" data-end="387.81">You might be wondering..</span> <span data-start="387.81" data-end="388.86">What is this zero?</span> <span data-start="388.86" data-end="390.59">That is when you want it to start.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="390.59" data-end="393.33">How far in the future you want it to start.</span> <span data-start="393.33" data-end="395.87">In this case, we want it to start right now.</span> <span data-start="395.87" data-end="398.19">Firefox and Chrome  —  totally okay with you omitting this.</span> <span data-start="398.19" data-end="399.66">It will just start immediately.</span> <span data-start="399.66" data-end="401.53">Safari, not okay with this.</span> <span data-start="401.53" data-end="404.83">So we put in a zero, say  —  I want to start this oscillator and</span> <span data-start="404.83" data-end="406.7">start it right now.</span> <span data-start="406.7" data-end="407.7">And that's great.</span> <span data-start="407.7" data-end="409.87">You probably messed up your frequency.</span> <span data-start="409.87" data-end="412.02">If you're like me, you're blowing out your eardrums right now</span> <span data-start="412.02" data-end="414.67">with a super high pitched frequency.</span> <span data-start="414.67" data-end="418.09">Now you probably want to stop it.</span> <span data-start="418.09" data-end="421.15">Surprise  —  the method is called stop.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="421.15" data-end="422.41">Here's where it gets tricky.</span> <span data-start="422.41" data-end="423.41">All right.</span> <span data-start="423.41" data-end="424.9">I'm done blowing out my ear drums.</span> <span data-start="424.9" data-end="428.67">I want to adjust the frequency and I want to start the oscillator</span> <span data-start="428.67" data-end="430.56">again.</span> <span data-start="430.56" data-end="431.88">Not going to happen.</span> <span data-start="431.88" data-end="432.88">Right?</span> <span data-start="432.88" data-end="433.88">Here's the kind of gotcha on that.</span> <span data-start="433.88" data-end="436.99">Once you stop an oscillator, you cannot restart it.</span> <span data-start="436.99" data-end="437.99">Game over.</span> <span data-start="437.99" data-end="440.06">You have to get rid of it.</span> <span data-start="440.06" data-end="441.25">And get a new one.</span> <span data-start="441.25" data-end="442.43">So you might say to yourself..</span> <span data-start="442.43" data-end="443.43">All right.</span> <span data-start="443.43" data-end="444.43">Yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="444.43" data-end="445.43">I'll just generate another one.</span> <span data-start="445.43" data-end="446.43">No big deal.</span> <span data-start="446.43" data-end="448.58">The other thing you want to make sure that you do is disconnect the oscillator that</span> <span data-start="448.58" data-end="450.81">you had, so it can get garbage collected.</span> <span data-start="450.81" data-end="454.93">If you don't disconnect it, the context still has a reference to</span> <span data-start="454.93" data-end="459.46">it, it starts hanging out in memory, you get out of control, do that too much,</span> <span data-start="459.46" data-end="461.39">congratulations  —  you have a memory leak.</span> <span data-start="461.39" data-end="462.8">Don't have a memory leak.</span> <span data-start="462.8" data-end="463.8">Disconnect your oscillators when you're done.</span> <span data-start="463.8" data-end="468.15">It's the responsible thing to do.</span> <span data-start="468.15" data-end="469.74">So now it's gotten garbage collected.</span> <span data-start="469.74" data-end="470.74">We can bring in a new one.</span> <span data-start="470.74" data-end="474.21">And here it is.</span> <span data-start="474.21" data-end="477.62">The other thing we talked about before is that we can connect stuff in the</span> <span data-start="477.62" data-end="478.62">middle.</span> <span data-start="478.62" data-end="483.05">So you might say  —  I don't want to keep creating and destroying</span> <span data-start="483.05" data-end="484.05">oscillators.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="484.05" data-end="485.23">That seems reckless.</span> <span data-start="485.23" data-end="486.65">I'm not interested in doing that.</span> <span data-start="486.65" data-end="488.28">It's actually pretty efficient.</span> <span data-start="488.28" data-end="489.28">It's not a big deal.</span> <span data-start="489.28" data-end="490.28">But..</span> <span data-start="490.28" data-end="491.43">It makes me feel a little dirty.</span> <span data-start="491.43" data-end="495.83">So the other option is to plug in our sound source, into some</span> <span data-start="495.83" data-end="500.581">kind of intermediary node, that will process that sound, and in this case, we</span> <span data-start="500.581" data-end="504.84">use a gain node, where we can basically turn up and down the amplitude, which</span> <span data-start="504.84" data-end="506.71">for our purposes is the volume.</span> <span data-start="506.71" data-end="510.61">So we can turn the volume down to zero and yeah, the oscillator is still running, but</span> <span data-start="510.61" data-end="514.479">none of the sound is getting to the destination, which means for all intents and</span> <span data-start="514.479" data-end="516.37">purposes the thing is stopped.</span> </p>
