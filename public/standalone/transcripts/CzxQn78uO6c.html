<p><span data-start="25.619" data-end="27.22">Thank you very much.</span> <span data-start="27.22" data-end="33.98">So, I'm going to try to talk about a few things I've been working with for the last two years</span> <span data-start="33.98" data-end="39.65">and that I think haven't really gotten the attention specifically from the web developer</span> <span data-start="39.65" data-end="44.96">community just yet that they deserve, I'm going to do this in a unique way, I want to</span> <span data-start="44.96" data-end="52.899">create buzz, how do you create buzz about technology and how do you do that well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="52.899" data-end="57.26">I have a solution , I have a stage, you as an audience and I really appreciate your participation</span> <span data-start="57.26" data-end="66.64">in this a little bit, just being an audience, we are going to try this, you might want to</span> <span data-start="66.64" data-end="69.85">mute the microphone a little bit.</span> <span data-start="69.85" data-end="76.33">Just hold on.</span> <span data-start="76.33" data-end="80.649">All right.</span> <span data-start="80.649" data-end="93.399">I know beard and stuff doesn't work so well, but we're going to see, we're going to see.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="93.399" data-end="95.229">Right.</span> <span data-start="95.229" data-end="101.069">So, waiting for this moment about two and a half years now since the initial introduction</span> <span data-start="101.069" data-end="104.33">of it.</span> <span data-start="104.33" data-end="107.311">Every once in a lifetime, like technology</span> <span data-start="107.311" data-end="122.319">comes around that changes everything — \{Laughter\} clearly into the clicker, I've already given</span> <span data-start="122.319" data-end="123.319">up.</span> <span data-start="123.319" data-end="131.83">1944, The Telegraph, it was the first time that we as people could communicate over distance,</span> <span data-start="131.83" data-end="134.66">in real time.</span> <span data-start="134.66" data-end="142.76">It didn't only change communication, it invented distributed communication in the first place.</span> <span data-start="142.76" data-end="149.58">The telephone, suddenly it was possible to communicate with emotions and express urgency</span> <span data-start="149.58" data-end="152.25">over a phone call, all across the city.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="152.25" data-end="157.739">That's never been done before and it's still the way how we communicate all over the world</span> <span data-start="157.739" data-end="158.739">today.</span> <span data-start="158.739" data-end="169.359">Now, today, I'm going to introduce to you three technologies of this magnitude — \{Laughter\}.</span> <span data-start="169.359" data-end="175.53">Number one, a light speed media streaming service.</span> <span data-start="175.53" data-end="181.51">Number two, a revolutionary way to make calls.</span> <span data-start="181.51" data-end="186.59">Number three, a breakthrough internet communications technology.</span> <span data-start="186.59" data-end="190.87">A streaming service.</span> <span data-start="190.87" data-end="193.459">A way to make calls.</span> <span data-start="193.459" data-end="196.89">An internet communications technology.</span> <span data-start="196.89" data-end="198.87">A streaming service.</span> <span data-start="198.87" data-end="201.66">\{Laughter\} , A way to make calls.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="201.66" data-end="204.01">Are you getting it!?</span> <span data-start="204.01" data-end="213.27">These are not three separate technologies, this is one technology  —  we are calling it</span> <span data-start="213.27" data-end="215.299">iRTC.</span> <span data-start="215.299" data-end="217.329">\{Applause\}.</span> <span data-start="217.329" data-end="226.819">Today, we collectively, as web community, reinvent real time communications.</span> <span data-start="226.819" data-end="231.569">I call it the year of the peer-to-peer web.</span> <span data-start="231.569" data-end="232.629">2015.</span> <span data-start="232.629" data-end="238.049">So who his this guy, that's me, a web developer forever, lived indeed sin poor for last five</span> <span data-start="238.049" data-end="245.79">years, organise conferences and help developers with Web RTC for quite a while, two years,</span> <span data-start="245.79" data-end="252.13">this is what it is, a set of JavaScript APIs in the browser to enable peer-to-peer real</span> <span data-start="252.13" data-end="255.7">time media and data exchange.</span> <span data-start="255.7" data-end="265.66">Specifically these there are APIs I'm talking about, it's pretty technical, what powerful</span> <span data-start="265.66" data-end="271.7">about this, it's an open web standard, if HTML, JavaScript and CSS have taught us anything,</span> <span data-start="271.7" data-end="277.1">it's really sticky, a lot of people chip in and use them, they are you see to learn and</span> <span data-start="277.1" data-end="283.45">all over the place, we are seeing the same thing with web TC, the adoption is off the</span> <span data-start="283.45" data-end="284.45">chart.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="284.45" data-end="288.65">Let's start with the internet communication part.</span> <span data-start="288.65" data-end="293.58">This is maybe a little bit repetitive for everybody that knows peer-to-peer already,</span> <span data-start="293.58" data-end="299.75">how web communication usually works, you send a message to some kind of server farm somewhere,</span> <span data-start="299.75" data-end="304.28">it's pushed to another peer that receives it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="304.28" data-end="310.949">With peer-to-peer that all changes, suddenly this is how it looks, you can int connect</span> <span data-start="310.949" data-end="316.18">directly from one browser to another browser, send data without going through a server.</span> <span data-start="316.18" data-end="322.09">Now, that's not entirely true as we find out, you can do with Web RTC without a server,</span> <span data-start="322.09" data-end="328.55">it's about manual, there is still a server that's really handy to come into facilitate</span> <span data-start="328.55" data-end="336.33">two peers to another, like when two people know a third guy and you ask for an introduction.</span> <span data-start="336.33" data-end="342.56">Peer A and B here, are a known party and then do something audiology ice, a candidate exchange</span> <span data-start="342.56" data-end="349.37">to exchange IP addresses and port, so they can connect to each other and transfer data.</span> <span data-start="349.37" data-end="356.569">Now, this is great because the direct connection is by the default, by the design of the IP</span> <span data-start="356.569" data-end="361.53">protocol the shortest route they can find thorough the internet, shortest, the lowest</span> <span data-start="361.53" data-end="364.789">latency route that they find.</span> <span data-start="364.789" data-end="372.09">It's great, you know low latency in your connection, it was essentially invented for audio video</span> <span data-start="372.09" data-end="378.93">calling, conferencing, light presentations, file transfer, or even sync music streaming</span> <span data-start="378.93" data-end="386.32">we have seen, we saw earlier in the cool demo with the Create Audio in the web browser and</span> <span data-start="386.32" data-end="388.729">they do it collaboratively.</span> <span data-start="388.729" data-end="393.41">It's also really good to create resilient decentralised mesh networks, where you don't</span> <span data-start="393.41" data-end="399.011">need this bottleneck or point of failure of the server.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="399.011" data-end="403.919">So you can create mesh networks for sensor data, where sensors collectively create a</span> <span data-start="403.919" data-end="409.08">network to exchange data or file and content distribution.</span> <span data-start="409.08" data-end="414.65">There are also a few things I've learned that you don't want to use Web RTC for, really</span> <span data-start="414.65" data-end="420.919">not made for it, it's build usually on RDP, you don't really know if your message arrived,</span> <span data-start="420.919" data-end="428.09">it is a bit, unhandy in a lot of cases, for example, you too traditional music or video</span> <span data-start="428.09" data-end="435.8">streaming it's not great to use Web RTC, Web RTC prior ties the low latency part over the</span> <span data-start="435.8" data-end="441.509">quality part, so you would watch a movie and suddenly the quality would go down the bandwidth</span> <span data-start="441.509" data-end="447.889">was reduced a little bit, the traditional options are better, use a buffer to give the</span> <span data-start="447.889" data-end="454.819">best quality over latency, synchronised communication, a chat, is usually something you don't necessarily</span> <span data-start="454.819" data-end="461.59">want to do on Web RTC unless you want to make it really private and secure, but most chats</span> <span data-start="461.59" data-end="466.84">require the other party not to be online that same time, so it's an async communication,</span> <span data-start="466.84" data-end="471.53">you don't expect the other person to be in the same app at the same time and you want</span> <span data-start="471.53" data-end="476.939">to go through a server that actually pushes the message to the other party.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="476.939" data-end="481.44">In gaming I've seen some people trying to build multiplayer games on Web RTC, it's not</span> <span data-start="481.44" data-end="488.77">great, you end up having a different connection to ever other party, a different latency,</span> <span data-start="488.77" data-end="494.9">meaning that different events arrive at different players at different times, that brings the</span> <span data-start="494.9" data-end="501.52">whole logic of the game and confuses it, so better use a server and create a single event</span> <span data-start="501.52" data-end="503.669">that puts everything in order.</span> <span data-start="503.669" data-end="509.189">Now, the second part, this is what WebRTC was created for, audio and video calling,</span> <span data-start="509.189" data-end="513.75">it's really, really powerful and we should use it more.</span> <span data-start="513.75" data-end="518.69">To show how it was done so far, this is largely how we communicate with voice on the internet</span> <span data-start="518.69" data-end="525.84">these days, we type in a phone number we read on a website or chat, we exchange user names,</span> <span data-start="525.84" data-end="531.72">this what we do all day, or use Gmail hang outs where you need an account and this is</span> <span data-start="531.72" data-end="533.32">the website of Gmail.</span> <span data-start="533.32" data-end="541.85">Now, Web RTC changes this theme, because Web RTC is a real time communication as a feature</span> <span data-start="541.85" data-end="546.9">in any app or website, you don't need a separate software any more that facilitates that you</span> <span data-start="546.9" data-end="552.42">swap to, to be able to communicate with somebody else, but what you too, you use communication</span> <span data-start="552.42" data-end="555.71">wherever you are in the context of dealing with person already.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="555.71" data-end="560.91">You don't need to pull out your phone any more, you can swap devices, so in a way</span> <span data-start="560.91" data-end="567.44">Web RTC enables embedded and contextual communication, I've given some examples here that I would</span> <span data-start="567.44" data-end="572.8">like to see or have already been done, that for example, you can call your host on, via</span> <span data-start="572.8" data-end="578.42">Web RTC, both sides have the app, so why not use the data channel, sorry the data connection</span> <span data-start="578.42" data-end="584.24">of your phone to facilitate the call instead of incurring roaming charges on my side, the</span> <span data-start="584.24" data-end="589.649">came with Gruber, where my driver gets stuck somewhere where he can't call me in another</span> <span data-start="589.649" data-end="596.42">country, he doesn't want to call an international number, telehealth, restaurant booking, property</span> <span data-start="596.42" data-end="602.04">agents, where you can facilitate a conversion metric, most companies want to measure if</span> <span data-start="602.04" data-end="607.149">there was a communication happening between the interested party and the agent, now they</span> <span data-start="607.149" data-end="611.79">can measure with Web RTC how long it was, instead of just seeing if they clicked on</span> <span data-start="611.79" data-end="614.57">a field to unyield a phone number.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="614.57" data-end="621.089">Every market place, eBay, carousel, Singapore start up, where you want to check up on a</span> <span data-start="621.089" data-end="625.82">item or too a video call with a seller before you buy, it in those cases you can use Web</span> <span data-start="625.82" data-end="627.24">RTC.</span> <span data-start="627.24" data-end="632.81">Now, looking back at this, we want to get a little bit in the technology and the features</span> <span data-start="632.81" data-end="638.339">and how it works, the terminology, the introduction service is something you would need to write</span> <span data-start="638.339" data-end="643.44">on the service side, you have a client side component that communicates with the sir server,</span> <span data-start="643.44" data-end="647.32">they know a common language to facilitate the introduction.</span> <span data-start="647.32" data-end="653.29">You don't need to do this any more these days, their signalling services out there that do</span> <span data-start="653.29" data-end="661.32">this for you, so you can just use one of the STKs, or their server or even library that</span> <span data-start="661.32" data-end="665.139">you install on your server, to facilitate this.</span> <span data-start="665.139" data-end="668.279">That's, that's much easier than writing it yourself.</span> <span data-start="668.279" data-end="675.1">Now, there are more hosted services that help you specifically for the media calling part</span> <span data-start="675.1" data-end="680.86">in situations where the network might not necessarily allow for peer connection to be</span> <span data-start="680.86" data-end="686.019">established, specifically in those cases where fire-wall prevents it from happening to poke</span> <span data-start="686.019" data-end="689.88">through a hole into the corporate network for example.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="689.88" data-end="695.85">In those cases they are hosted services that provide turn, turn services, that essentially</span> <span data-start="695.85" data-end="705.09">you as a peer connect to, so that the turn server becomes your peer side of the communication.</span> <span data-start="705.09" data-end="710.709">So it, in other words, represents you as a peer with a direct connection to your device</span> <span data-start="710.709" data-end="716.87">cannot be established, for example, fire-wall constraints.</span> <span data-start="716.87" data-end="722.72">More sophisticated service that is very good in the specific use case of multiparty audio</span> <span data-start="722.72" data-end="730.829">video umm.. what it does, it increases performance on the peer side, so if you see this mesh</span> <span data-start="730.829" data-end="736.67">network up here, think of every peer sending a video stream to everybody else and receiving</span> <span data-start="736.67" data-end="743.14">a video stream from everybody else, it has to encrypt and encode and descript and decode,</span> <span data-start="743.14" data-end="747.589">six streams if you count the errors on each peer, six streams.</span> <span data-start="747.589" data-end="753.22">Now with the introduction of the so-called MCU, multicast unit of selective forwarding</span> <span data-start="753.22" data-end="760.66">university, you introduce a server the latency goes up in favour of the CPU and bandwidth</span> <span data-start="760.66" data-end="767.769">requirements on the band side, now the errors are just five, it's one less, everybody sends</span> <span data-start="767.769" data-end="770.889">just one video out and gets four videos back.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="770.889" data-end="776.22">Now, this number goes like the failings of this method go up obviously the more peers</span> <span data-start="776.22" data-end="781.93">you add to this communication, so this is a really valuable service for multiparty it's</span> <span data-start="781.93" data-end="786.93">available as hosted services you can actually just book through different providers.</span> <span data-start="786.93" data-end="793.42">SFU relays media streams to reduce the amount of connections and use on your device multiparty</span> <span data-start="793.42" data-end="795.88">sessions.</span> <span data-start="795.88" data-end="800.67">These are some of the providers out there that have services around Web RTC specifically</span> <span data-start="800.67" data-end="806.85">for the calling and conferencing case, I work one myself, it’s in the centre, sky link</span> <span data-start="806.85" data-end="814.67">IO, with that, we get to the last bit that is really fantastic about Web RTC, pretty</span> <span data-start="814.67" data-end="822.04">sophisticated and it can be of much use, specifically in emerging markets which I care about being</span> <span data-start="822.04" data-end="825.329">located into Singapore.</span> <span data-start="825.329" data-end="830.34">Let's look at how that works a little, this is how typically the CDN delivery works, you</span> <span data-start="830.34" data-end="835.69">receive a file from the CDN network, sometimes they have extra locations say at least it's</span> <span data-start="835.69" data-end="843.04">in closer proximity, you can increase the download speed if you had Web RTC to the mix</span> <span data-start="843.04" data-end="848.11">and you download the same content from other peers that are also downloading it in segments.</span> </p>
