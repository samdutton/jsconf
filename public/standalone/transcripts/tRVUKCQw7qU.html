have</span> <span data-start="686.47" data-end="688.21">a local butcher that can supply this to</span> <span data-start="688.21" data-end="691.15">you I have my butcher Louis Paesanos</span> <span data-start="691.15" data-end="694.15">also known as the friend and they are my</span> <span data-start="694.15" data-end="695.26">friends and they supply me with</span> <span data-start="695.26" data-end="697.81">excellent pork belly next thing you need</span> <span data-start="697.81" data-end="699.46">kosher salt which is not the salt that</span> <span data-start="699.46" data-end="700.72">you get in a little Morton's thing it's</span> <span data-start="700.72" data-end="703.12">like a big thing of kosher salt but it's</span> <span data-start="703.12" data-end="704.53">a they sell out the grocery store a</span> <span data-start="704.53" data-end="708.25">bunch of spices and pink salt which is</span> <span data-start="708.25" data-end="710.23">the only ingredient that you won't be</span> <span data-start="710.23" data-end="712.12">able to find in a regular grocery store</span> <span data-start="712.12" data-end="713.65">but you can get it mail-order and it's</span> <span data-start="713.65" data-end="715.96">like for a bag like this big like $3</span> <span data-start="715.96" data-end="718.9">seriously and you need a tablespoon per</span> <span data-start="718.9" data-end="722.29">entire five pounds of bacon and then you</span> <span data-start="722.29" data-end="724.36">did a big big asset block bag like two</span> <span data-start="724.36" data-end="729.04">gallons so step two curing so just to</span> <span data-start="729.04" data-end="730.12">tell you a little more details about</span> <span data-start="730.12" data-end="731.62">what curing is so you guys can leave</span> <span data-start="731.62" data-end="733.99">here knowing really what bacon is all</span> <span data-start="733.99" data-end="736.33">about curing and smoking are really</span> <span data-start="736.33" data-end="737.59">doing the same thing what they're doing</span> <span data-start="737.59" data-end="739.42">and I'll try to explain this in ways</span> <span data-start="739.42" data-end="743.89">that you can understand so when you cure</span> <span data-start="743.89" data-end="746.8">bacon all it's doing is over time and</span> <span data-start="746.8" data-end="748.6">over the course of a week here as you</span> <span data-start="748.6" data-end="753.61">can see is or that's by day daily daily</span> <span data-start="753.61" data-end="756.43">it's the moisture is going down so what</span> <span data-start="756.43" data-end="758.98">salt does this miracle thing is it takes</span> <span data-start="758.98" data-end="761.23">moisture out of whatever you put it on</span> <span data-start="761.23" data-end="762.67">basically you know when you like salt</span> <span data-start="762.67" data-end="764.35">tomatoes when you're making a salsa and</span> <span data-start="764.35" data-end="766.18">then ten minutes later you come back and</span> <span data-start="766.18" data-end="767.56">there's like a pile of tomato juice and</span> <span data-start="767.56" data-end="769.12">these like really mealy little tomato</span> <span data-start="769.12" data-end="771.61">bits that's salt that's salt at work all</span> <span data-start="771.61" data-end="773.76">it's doing is drawing moisture out so</span> <span data-start="773.76" data-end="776.83">why that works for curing is because</span> <span data-start="776.83" data-end="779.32">certain bacteria just or most bacteria</span> <span data-start="779.32" data-end="781.03">can't live without moisture they feed</span> <span data-start="781.03" data-end="782.71">off of it that's how they survive so</span> <span data-start="782.71" data-end="783.97">when you take the moisture away you kill</span> <span data-start="783.97" data-end="785.56">the bacteria or kill the potential</span> <span data-start="785.56" data-end="787.57">bacteria and then what pink salt does is</span> <span data-start="787.57" data-end="790.21">it doesn't even better plus it adds this</span> <span data-start="790.21" data-end="792.37">extra flavor plus</span> <span data-start="792.37" data-end="794.68">the chemical is in sodium nitrate which</span> <span data-start="794.68" data-end="799.24">are pink salt also promote the specific</span> <span data-start="799.24" data-end="801.61">bacteria that's good and prevents bad</span> <span data-start="801.61" data-end="803.8">bacteria so step three and this is the</span> <span data-start="803.8" data-end="804.399">hardest part</span> <span data-start="804.399" data-end="806.379">you wait for a week right and that's a</span> <span data-start="806.379" data-end="808.029">really really hard because you</span> <span data-start="808.029" data-end="809.23">see it in the fridge and you keep</span> <span data-start="809.23" data-end="810.999">turning it over and they're like oh my</span> <span data-start="810.999" data-end="812.68">god this is gonna be so good but you</span> <span data-start="812.68" data-end="814.209">can't touch it obviously it's raw you're</span> <span data-start="814.209" data-end="816.97">not gonna eat it raw and the step four</span> <span data-start="816.97" data-end="819.579">is smoking or baking so if you want to</span> <span data-start="819.579" data-end="821.079">smoke at home you don't need a smoker if</span> <span data-start="821.079" data-end="822.519">you have a kettle grill you take a</span> <span data-start="822.519" data-end="823.839">kettle grill you put some charcoal on</span> <span data-start="823.839" data-end="825.67">one side put a drip pan underneath it</span> <span data-start="825.67" data-end="827.74">put it down let it get to medium heat</span> <span data-start="827.74" data-end="830.05">put the cover on an hour and a half</span> <span data-start="830.05" data-end="831.67">later you check it check the temperature</span> <span data-start="831.67" data-end="834.069">when it gets up to 150 perfect you take</span> <span data-start="834.069" data-end="835.72">it off and it absorbed all that amazing</span> <span data-start="835.72" data-end="838.029">smoke from the charcoal grill but what I</span> <span data-start="838.029" data-end="839.29">do at home too and I don't have a</span> <span data-start="839.29" data-end="841.509">charcoal grill handy is you just put in</span> <span data-start="841.509" data-end="842.459">an oven at the lowest temperature</span> <span data-start="842.459" data-end="844.42">basically you're bringing it up to</span> <span data-start="844.42" data-end="846.37">temperature that's all you're doing and</span> <span data-start="846.37" data-end="848.86">then Step five isn't you enjoy the</span> <span data-start="848.86" data-end="851.23">out of your hard work so the things you</span> <span data-start="851.23" data-end="853.3">can do with your bacon you you can</span> <span data-start="853.3" data-end="854.829">imagine come on like what do you do with</span> <span data-start="854.829" data-end="857.41">bacon you make BLTs you

you</span> <span data-start="862.75" data-end="864.49">have bacon you're like hey buddy I know</span> <span data-start="864.49" data-end="866.139">you have all those home brews that</span> <span data-start="866.139" data-end="867.16">you're making because I know a lot of</span> <span data-start="867.16" data-end="868.809">people do home brewing it's like here I</span> <span data-start="868.809" data-end="871.689">will trade you this chunk of bacon for a</span> <span data-start="871.689" data-end="873.1">six-pack of your homebrew another guy's</span> <span data-start="873.1" data-end="875.23">like oh dude it's like old school</span> <span data-start="875.23" data-end="878.529">bartering it's pretty cool and basically</span> <span data-start="878.529" data-end="880.029">you add it to anything and it's awesome</span> <span data-start="880.029" data-end="882.309">eat it love it so alright we're gonna</span> <span data-start="882.309"

to cure anything so curing things</span> <span data-start="902.559" data-end="904.959">becomes a way to add flavor and imbue</span> <span data-start="904.959" data-end="907.48">something that we think will make our</span> <span data-start="907.48" data-end="909.519">food better it has nothing to do with</span> <span data-start="909.519" data-end="913.439">actual survival so when you get from</span>

data-start="919.029" data-end="921.37">if we can shortcut that entire system so</span> <span data-start="921.37" data-end="923.649">how do you systematically make big in</span> <span data-start="923.649" data-end="925.329">production cheaper it's really easy</span> <span data-start="925.329" data-end="925.9">actually</span> <span data-start="925.9" data-end="928.99">first you feed the pig surplus corn in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="928.99" data-end="931.15">America okay we have this ton of corn</span> <span data-start="931.15" data-end="933.55">pigs don't normally eat corn but it</span> <span data-start="933.55" data-end="936.58">let's feed it to them and everybody's</span> <span data-start="936.58" data-end="938.11">like oh this is awesome we have all this</span> <span data-start="938.11" data-end="940.21">extra corn and we don't know what to do</span> <span data-start="940.21" data-end="942.58">with it it's not human grade humans</span> <span data-start="942.58"

data-end="948.19">fat this rules</span> <span data-start="948.19" data-end="949.84">and we'll see why that's not the case in</span> <span data-start="949.84" data-end="952.54">a second but anyway then you also breed</span> <span data-start="952.54" data-end="954.04">the pigs for size and production so they</span> <span data-start="954.04" data-end="956.05">also realized oh hey we can crossbreed</span> <span data-start="956.05" data-end="957.94">get rid of these heirloom breeds that</span> <span data-start="957.94" data-end="960.19">sometimes produce like really a lot of</span> <span data-start="960.19" data-end="961.51">fat and sometimes are really a lot of</span> <span data-start="961.51" data-end="963.19">food and sometimes they don't let's just</span> <span
