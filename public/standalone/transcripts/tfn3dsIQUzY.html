<p><span data-start="60.399" data-end="67.67">You can take this, you can execute it in your browser console and it's thanks to works of</span> <span data-start="67.67" data-end="76.34">a friend of mine, Martin Kleppe, who presented this at JSConf 2013, and it basically turns</span> <span data-start="76.34" data-end="81.21">arbitrary JavaScript code into this weird thing that only has six different characters,</span> <span data-start="81.21" data-end="87.409">I think, and it's completely oblivious to white space, so I was able to turn it down</span> <span data-start="87.409" data-end="94.479">into these things that actually resemble title slides.</span> <span data-start="94.479" data-end="101.689">And I was speaking yesterday to someone who mentioned that in the title on the schedule</span> <span data-start="101.689" data-end="113.549">page, there's actually — I was using AE, like the Danish use all the time, and it's not</span> <span data-start="113.549" data-end="118.479">in here because I didn't have it in my talk title, the organisers came up with it and</span> <span data-start="118.479" data-end="124.649">I thought I need to fix this but the problem is that encoding that takes up a lot more</span> <span data-start="124.649" data-end="129.599">space so it doesn't really fit the title screen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="129.599" data-end="134.56">Speaking of Martin's work I just want to quickly point out what I don't really want to talk</span> <span data-start="134.56" data-end="135.56">about.</span> <span data-start="135.56" data-end="136.93">First of all, this.</span> <span data-start="136.93" data-end="139.9">You can look it up.</span> <span data-start="139.9" data-end="145.06">It's maybe aesthetic in its own way but it's not very practical probably, and also this</span> <span data-start="145.06" data-end="146.06">is not practical.</span> <span data-start="146.06" data-end="147.33">I love this.</span> <span data-start="147.33" data-end="158.09">It has also been presented as JSConf 2013 and it is very beautiful, it has its ownaesthetic</span> <span data-start="158.09" data-end="162.28">but again is not very practical.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="162.28" data-end="168.83">You can learn a lot by analysing what Martin does here but it's not very helpful for day-to-day</span> <span data-start="168.83" data-end="175.33">stuff so I'm going to talk about other things and the first thing I want to talk about is</span> <span data-start="175.33" data-end="180.879">programming languages versus natural languages, and if you have been here on the talk before</span> <span data-start="180.879" data-end="189.5">mine, there was this idea of turning natural language into something that computers can</span> <span data-start="189.5" data-end="195.19">understand, and I find this approach very cool.</span> <span data-start="195.19" data-end="203.599">I think it makes sense to always keep in mind that programming languages .. [sound problem]</span> <span data-start="203.599" data-end="208.68">.. can turn natural language into something that computers understand.</span> <span data-start="208.68" data-end="217.59">[Sound problem] .. pretty controversial example.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="217.59" data-end="222.13">So how many of you know what this is, where this is from?</span> <span data-start="222.13" data-end="229.099">So this is the official npm coding style guide, a talk of it, which talks about the comma</span> <span data-start="229.099" data-end="230.769">first syntax.</span> <span data-start="230.769" data-end="232.27">Don't yell at me yet.</span> <span data-start="232.27" data-end="236.26">So I find this interesting.</span> <span data-start="236.26" data-end="243.689">I find — so I personally completely, you know, I would never write this this way.</span> <span data-start="243.689" data-end="253.439">But for me it's just a different set of — yes, I don't know, conventions that have different</span> <span data-start="253.439" data-end="258.19">drawbacks and different benefits from what I would normally write, so I don't have a</span> <span data-start="258.19" data-end="269.22">huge issue with this, but in defence of this I read a blog post that some of you may have</span> <span data-start="269.22" data-end="278.85">read at the time, it's pretty old, where he says — I'm paraphrasing — don't compare JavaScript</span> <span data-start="278.85" data-end="280.35">to the English language.</span> <span data-start="280.35" data-end="282.1">JavaScript is not English.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="282.1" data-end="287.67">So the argument that punctuation should be at the end is silly.</span> <span data-start="287.67" data-end="293.77">I read that and had a pretty strong reaction because I think this is a weird way of thinking</span> <span data-start="293.77" data-end="296.51">of this.</span> <span data-start="296.51" data-end="302.35">We as humans are used to reading natural language every day, of course as programmers we are</span> <span data-start="302.35" data-end="311.53">used to reading programming language every day but I think most of the programming languages</span> <span data-start="311.53" data-end="316.86">are modelled after things we have in natural languages as well, and that makes a ton of</span> <span data-start="316.86" data-end="325.39">sense so to me that argument was kind of: no.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="325.39" data-end="331.11">The irony in the story, of course, is that I wanted to — because this is just an example</span> <span data-start="331.11" data-end="338.49">from the style guide and then I wanted to look up actual [sound problem] .. and I was</span> <span data-start="338.49" data-end="354.94">in for a surprise because I don't follow that very closely, and obviously since 2015 .. interesting,</span> <span data-start="354.94" data-end="360.35">but the coding style is still out there so if anyone from npm is here that might be something</span> <span data-start="360.35" data-end="368.72">you want to look at, more maybe I should — I don't know.</span> <span data-start="368.72" data-end="373.16">So speaking of closeness to natural languages, here is an example.</span> <span data-start="373.16" data-end="378.52">I'm a Ruby programmer — I'm sorry, don't shoot me.</span> <span data-start="378.52" data-end="379.94">I also write Ruby.</span> <span data-start="379.94" data-end="386.09">And to me this is a perfect example of how a language can look like that tries to mimic</span> <span data-start="386.09" data-end="388.86">natural language in some opponents.</span> <span data-start="388.86" data-end="390.66">Please ignore the puts.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="390.66" data-end="398.83">Puts is a terrible choice for something — you know, what does that even mean?</span> <span data-start="398.83" data-end="405.31">But ten times do, and then do something, that's something I can show to — I almost said my</span> <span data-start="405.31" data-end="406.31">Mum, which is terrible.</span> <span data-start="406.31" data-end="407.47">Don't do that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="407.47" data-end="413.36">So you can show that to anyone who is not familiar with programming and it will make</span> <span data-start="413.36" data-end="419.72">sense to them, and so I think this is a very elegant example, a very aesthetic example</span> <span data-start="419.72" data-end="426.301">of how code can actually look, and just an exercise for you to do in your head: turn</span> <span data-start="426.301" data-end="428.43">this into JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="428.43" data-end="434.07">You would probably use a 4 loop which is one of the constructs in JavaScript that probably</span> <span data-start="434.07" data-end="440.62">resemble natural language the least, I would say.</span> <span data-start="440.62" data-end="443.12">Another example.</span> <span data-start="443.12" data-end="444.66">This is Python.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="444.66" data-end="454.17">I could have chosen CoffeeScript but I didn't want it upset everyone in the audience, so</span> <span data-start="454.17" data-end="461.821">Python is one of those significant white space languages and interestingly I looked it up</span> <span data-start="461.821" data-end="466.15">on Wikipedia, and it is termed offside languages.</span> <span data-start="466.15" data-end="469.16">Who has heard that before?</span> <span data-start="469.16" data-end="472.65">A few people.</span> <span data-start="472.65" data-end="481.25">Explain that to an American who calls this thing soccer; interesting choice of words.</span> <span data-start="481.25" data-end="484.61">Anyway, I just found that funny.</span> <span data-start="484.61" data-end="492.15">So the thing I want to point out here is in slightly modern typesetting, so since we are</span> <span data-start="492.15" data-end="500.25">doing typesetting, we use indentation for grouping and categorising things, for building</span> <span data-start="500.25" data-end="506.9">a hierarchy of things, and the one thing that we never do in typesetting is actually writing</span> <span data-start="506.9" data-end="510.12">something at the end that kind of closes down that block.</span> <span data-start="510.12" data-end="511.46">You never do that.</span> <span data-start="511.46" data-end="517.209">So I think Python made an interesting choice and it works for Python because it turns this</span> <span data-start="517.209" data-end="522.769">thing into something that is still pretty good to read and it follows a convention that</span> <span data-start="522.769" data-end="529.69">has been set a few hundred years ago of how to do hierarchies.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="529.69" data-end="538.62">So there's two problems I see with these kind of languages and the first one is actually</span> <span data-start="538.62" data-end="544.959">probably not a problem, so at some point I don't know if he has coined that, but DHH,</span> <span data-start="544.959" data-end="554.05">the creator of Rails, used the term syntactic vinegar and I like that term, so if you imagine</span> <span data-start="554.05" data-end="561.36">you have code that longer than your screen in a language like this and you scroll down</span> <span data-start="561.36" data-end="565.959">and suddenly it's like: where am I?</span> <span data-start="565.959" data-end="566.959">Where does this close?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="566.959" data-end="568.07">I have no idea.</span> <span data-start="568.07" data-end="576.93">I'm completely lost in indentation and so the language or the syntax punishes you for</span> <span data-start="576.93" data-end="580.95">actually doing a thing that you shouldn't do in the first place which is writing long</span> <span data-start="580.95" data-end="583.509">functions, and I found that kind of interesting.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="583.509" data-end="590.01">The other issue I have with it is that, to me, it always looks a little bit like this.</span> <span data-start="590.01" data-end="593.1">So it's kind of off balance in a way.</span> <span data-start="593.1" data-end="594.61">It never returns.</span> <span data-start="594.61" data-end="596.62">This is weird.</span> <span data-start="596.62" data-end="601.779">So yes, that's significant white space.</span> <span data-start="601.779" data-end="611.689">This is interesting, so just a quick show of hands, who likes the first thing better?</span> <span data-start="611.689" data-end="613.87">Who likes the other thing better?</span> <span data-start="613.87" data-end="620.74">Okay, everyone else doesn't have any reaction to that, which is fine.</span> <span data-start="620.74" data-end="630.079">So to me at first this was — that's the JavaScript way and the other is the Ruby way.</span> <span data-start="630.079" data-end="640.25">There's a complete family of languages like Ruby, Python and others that join things together</span> <span data-start="640.25" data-end="646.37">with an underscore and there's a whole family of languages that uses the camel case kind</span> <span data-start="646.37" data-end="648.279">of thing.</span> <span data-start="648.279" data-end="650.079">What's the difference?</span> <span data-start="650.079" data-end="656.069">Turns out there's a study — I only found this one, but interesting enough — that kind of</span> <span data-start="656.069" data-end="664.089">tried to find out which works better in the context of how precise can you — how is the</span> <span data-start="664.089" data-end="668.66">precision of detecting things and how quickly can you actually read this?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="668.66" data-end="676.29">And it turns out that snake case is same precision but significantly faster and to me after thinking</span> <span data-start="676.29" data-end="684.62">about it for a minute that totally makes sense, so if you know how the brain and the eye together</span> <span data-start="684.62" data-end="690.8">parses words and sentences, you are not reading character by character, you are basically</span> <span data-start="690.8" data-end="697.33">reading shapes of words, and so making out the shapes of the words in a functioning like</span> <span data-start="697.33" data-end="702.769">that is significantly harder if you just jam them together and put some large characters</span> <span data-start="702.769" data-end="705.829">in there.</span> <span data-start="705.829" data-end="711.17">The underscore actually looks pretty familiar to the human eye because it's almost like</span> <span data-start="711.17" data-end="716.569">a space, and there's almost — the underscore almost takes up no room so there's no shape</span> <span data-start="716.569" data-end="718.199">to detect in a way.</span> <span data-start="718.199" data-end="723.86">That's my own almost unscientific explanation for it anyway.</span> <span data-start="723.86" data-end="727.67">So why did languages choose one or the other?</span> <span data-start="727.67" data-end="729.56">That's an interesting question.</span> <span data-start="729.56" data-end="735.259">I have no answer for that, of course.</span> <span data-start="735.259" data-end="742.029">To close this down, here is something, you know, that's from an example from a blog post</span> <span data-start="742.029" data-end="748.279">that I read during preparing for this talk by Joseph Wynne who talks about readability</span> <span data-start="748.279" data-end="755.73">in code and this is another thing where actually, you know, thinking about how we write natural</span> <span data-start="755.73" data-end="759.819">languages can help a lot because this for some reason is completely more readable.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="759.819" data-end="762.8">You have all the blocks in there and you just use paragraphs.</span> <span data-start="762.8" data-end="772.259">You know, it's a very simple thing and it might sound really mundane and trivial but</span> <span data-start="772.259" data-end="780.23">I have seen code bases where this rule wasn't applied and I don't mean Martin Kleppe's stuff</span> <span data-start="780.23" data-end="784.769">with that, or minified code.</span> <span data-start="784.769" data-end="791.01">The second thing I want to talk about really quickly is the principle of least surprise,</span> <span data-start="791.01" data-end="796.779">which is something that influences language design up to a point, and I have a very terrible</span> <span data-start="796.779" data-end="802.889">example for you that you will all know, like who in here knows what's going wrong with</span> <span data-start="802.889" data-end="807.709">these lines of code?</span> <span data-start="807.709" data-end="813.22">Come on, show your hands, please!</span> <span data-start="813.22" data-end="814.649">OMG.</span> <span data-start="814.649" data-end="819.569">So all of these things are complete garbage.</span> <span data-start="819.569" data-end="824.24">They parse into things you don't want them to be parsed into and they will all balk out</span> <span data-start="824.24" data-end="825.72">with terrible errors.</span> <span data-start="825.72" data-end="827.829">Why is that?</span> <span data-start="827.829" data-end="834.399">Because — I mean, it's JavaScript, so JavaScript wants to have semicolons at the end of every</span> <span data-start="834.399" data-end="836.809">instruction.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="836.809" data-end="838.529">Do you see any semicolons in here?</span> <span data-start="838.529" data-end="839.759">Well, I don't.</span> <span data-start="839.759" data-end="844.699">It's, of course, okay to write it because we have this awesome feature called automatic</span> <span data-start="844.699" data-end="847.93">semicolon insertion, or ASI.</span> <span data-start="847.93" data-end="854.209">The problem is there are a few cases where the ASI stuff simply doesn't know what to</span> <span data-start="854.209" data-end="860.839">do, and in this case I mean the worst example is like the one in the middle where it turns</span> <span data-start="860.839" data-end="867.589">it into a division because, you know, there's a variable and then there's a slash, so there</span> <span data-start="867.589" data-end="872.31">must be a division, and then everything goes wrong, of course.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1152.56" data-end="1158.07">So here is the Ruby example, and to me as a Ruby programmer, and probably also to you</span> <span data-start="1158.07" data-end="1163.71">as a JavaScript programmer, this makes a ton more sense so there's syntax to define the</span> <span data-start="1163.71" data-end="1166.05">end and the beginning of a function.</span> <span data-start="1166.05" data-end="1173.19">There's syntax to return something, there's an if thing which is kind of weird for JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1173.19" data-end="1179.07">programmers, but it's like inherited from Perl and I don't particularly like it but</span> <span data-start="1179.07" data-end="1180.63">it works.</span> <span data-start="1180.63" data-end="1190.87">Yes, there's just so much syntax in there in contrast to the thing before that I think</span> <span data-start="1190.87" data-end="1198.27">it just goes to show that while Lisp people always say that having syntax actually makes</span> <span data-start="1198.27" data-end="1203.21">things more complex, it also makes things more readable, I think, for the most part</span> <span data-start="1203.21" data-end="1206.04">at least.</span> <span data-start="1206.04" data-end="1207.28">So here is another example.</span> <span data-start="1207.28" data-end="1213.26">This is an incomplete example before you yell at me for something that could happen, in</span> <span data-start="1213.26" data-end="1224.21">Ruby on res, for example, and it's a definition for a user table or a user object that has</span> <span data-start="1224.21" data-end="1229.54">a relationship to photos, so users have many photos, and this looks — to me, this looks</span> <span data-start="1229.54" data-end="1233.78">quite elegant and it looks like a declaration.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1233.78" data-end="1241.56">There's a reason for that because there are — the method call that is in there technically</span> <span data-start="1241.56" data-end="1244.75">doesn't have the parentheses around it and that's a Ruby thing.</span> <span data-start="1244.75" data-end="1246.59">You can just leave out the parentheses.</span> <span data-start="1246.59" data-end="1252.23">You shouldn't do that all the time but for something like this it makes a ton of sense</span> <span data-start="1252.23" data-end="1259.37">because it is a declaration more or less, but technically internally it isn't.</span> <span data-start="1259.37" data-end="1268.1">That's just an example to show you how flexible syntax rules can really improve the readability</span> <span data-start="1268.1" data-end="1272.09">and the expressiveness of something.</span> <span data-start="1272.09" data-end="1275.19">The next thing I want to talk about is punctuation.</span> <span data-start="1275.19" data-end="1277.58">Who recognises the language in here?</span> <span data-start="1277.58" data-end="1279.28">Yes, exactly.</span> <span data-start="1279.28" data-end="1282.18">So this is Pascal.</span> <span data-start="1282.18" data-end="1286.35">I'm sorry, it's — the most important thing is at the bottom.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1286.35" data-end="1289.39">I should have changed that slide.</span> <span data-start="1289.39" data-end="1292.64">So there are two things in here that I find interesting.</span> <span data-start="1292.64" data-end="1295.21">The first one is the assignment operator of Pascal.</span> <span data-start="1295.21" data-end="1298.49">Who loves the assignment operator in Pascal?</span> <span data-start="1298.49" data-end="1299.49">Right.</span> <span data-start="1299.49" data-end="1307.68">Because it is a mathematically somewhat adequate description of an assignment whereas if you</span> <span data-start="1307.68" data-end="1313.24">compare two values in Pascal you are using the equals sign, which means that something</span> <span data-start="1313.24" data-end="1319.86">is equal, and for some reason in almost every other language we do this weird thing where</span> <span data-start="1319.86" data-end="1329.13">we use two equals sign for comparison, or even three, and that's kind of — yeah, I like</span> <span data-start="1329.13" data-end="1330.74">that.</span> <span data-start="1330.74" data-end="1335.42">The other thing is right at the bottom, and I'm sorry if you can't see that, but there's</span> <span data-start="1335.42" data-end="1339.17">a full stop at the end of the programme.</span> <span data-start="1339.17" data-end="1341.43">I just admire that simplicity.</span> <span data-start="1341.43" data-end="1344.04">It's like: end, full stop.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1344.04" data-end="1346.09">That's it.</span> <span data-start="1346.09" data-end="1348">Punctuation.</span> <span data-start="1348" data-end="1352.62">There are a few languages that use punctuation — I'm sorry for another Ruby example.</span> <span data-start="1352.62" data-end="1360.47">You have one which basically adds an exclamation mark to the method and most of the time it's</span> <span data-start="1360.47" data-end="1365.7">a version on a method that does something more dangerous than another method, in this</span> <span data-start="1365.7" data-end="1373.24">case it's the self-modifying method in contrast to a method that would return a copy, and</span> <span data-start="1373.24" data-end="1379.63">then we have the question mark methods which denotes that it will return and that's nice</span> <span data-start="1379.63" data-end="1387.07">because it allows you to return things like "is empty" or "does not have contents", and</span> <span data-start="1387.07" data-end="1392.33">all jammed together with camel case so that's pretty cool.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1392.33" data-end="1398.08">You can, of course, put this completely over the top and then you would end up with something</span> <span data-start="1398.08" data-end="1402.9">like this, so who knows what this is?</span> <span data-start="1402.9" data-end="1404.69">It's the programming language.</span> <span data-start="1404.69" data-end="1410.23">Actually, it's "a" programming language, it's APL.</span> <span data-start="1410.23" data-end="1416.6">And it's a very old language and it uses all kinds of mathematical characters to express</span> <span data-start="1416.6" data-end="1424.31">things and just think about how weird it would be to input this language, and so back in</span> <span data-start="1424.31" data-end="1428.24">the days, that was before computer screens were really a thing so they had to come up</span> <span data-start="1428.24" data-end="1432.44">with a printer head that would be able to print these things and of course also you</span> <span data-start="1432.44" data-end="1438.74">needed a special keyboard to be able to put this in and, yes, that's probably overdoing</span> <span data-start="1438.74" data-end="1444.19">it a bit with the symbols there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1444.19" data-end="1449.2">Another thing that improves expressiveness is operating overloading and I don't even</span> <span data-start="1449.2" data-end="1457.03">have an idea if this is really operator overloading technically, but in Ruby you can just overwrite</span> <span data-start="1457.03" data-end="1462.71">the array accessor and that's pretty nice because you can do various things with it.</span> <span data-start="1462.71" data-end="1466.64">There are other languages that do operator overloading.</span> <span data-start="1466.64" data-end="1471.5">If you haven't heard of — like, who knows what this is?</span> <span data-start="1471.5" data-end="1475.57">It's a language that has been talked a lot about a few years back and I haven't heard</span> <span data-start="1475.57" data-end="1476.79">a lot since.</span> <span data-start="1476.79" data-end="1481.34">It's Dart, and Dart has operator overloading.</span> <span data-start="1481.34" data-end="1487.03">That's how it looks and it's pretty nice because you can just take two objects, add them together</span> <span data-start="1487.03" data-end="1491.14">and something meaningful comes out of that, and that just makes for more beautiful code,</span> <span data-start="1491.14" data-end="1492.14">I think.</span> <span data-start="1492.14" data-end="1498.47">This is Ruby examples again, like having — being able to do a substring on something just by</span> <span data-start="1498.47" data-end="1500.85">adding square brackets to it.</span> <span data-start="1500.85" data-end="1506.21">I think this really makes a difference in how expressive a language is.</span> <span data-start="1506.21" data-end="1508.81">Number 4: shared aesthetics.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1508.81" data-end="1511.4">I am going to close out with this.</span> <span data-start="1511.4" data-end="1517.86">So there's lots of stuff I have talked about and I have also talked a lot about — I've</span> <span data-start="1517.86" data-end="1526.41">written in my description that this thing — Remy was talking about, like, nobody agrees</span> <span data-start="1526.41" data-end="1529.74">with you in terms of aesthetics.</span> <span data-start="1529.74" data-end="1533.07">I have something that we probably all agree on.</span> </p>
