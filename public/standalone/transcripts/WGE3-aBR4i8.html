<p><span data-start="63.739" data-end="65.79">I work as a technical writer.</span> <span data-start="65.79" data-end="68.51">We're a continuous integration platform.</span> <span data-start="68.51" data-end="70.28">Our product is mostly used by other developers.</span> <span data-start="70.28" data-end="76.23">So I spend a lot of time thinking about how best to explain parts of our product to nontechnical</span> <span data-start="76.23" data-end="79.15">users who may or may not be familiar with integration.</span> <span data-start="79.15" data-end="86.93">I worked for five years before I found I was interested in writing documentation and helping</span> <span data-start="86.93" data-end="90.98">other developers use cool tools than writing code.</span> <span data-start="90.98" data-end="93.5">This kicked off my master's degree.</span> <span data-start="93.5" data-end="99.88">And I'm mostly through a master�s of applied linguistic at the University of Melbourne.</span> <span data-start="99.88" data-end="108.17">I got interested in the intersection of linguistics and computer science.</span> <span data-start="108.17" data-end="112.35">This started as a paper for uni, this paper, in fact.</span> <span data-start="112.35" data-end="119.28">And gave me the opportunity to prepare a tutorial that introduced JavaScript from a few years</span> <span data-start="119.28" data-end="120.32">ago.</span> <span data-start="120.32" data-end="125.1">I can't squish 4 or 5,000 words into a 25minute talk.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="125.1" data-end="129.69">But I'll do my best and you can find me afterwards with questions.</span> <span data-start="129.69" data-end="131.879">For so let's talk about communities.</span> <span data-start="131.879" data-end="134.349">What is a community?</span> <span data-start="134.349" data-end="137.59">Pretty much just a bunch of people all together doing a thing.</span> <span data-start="137.59" data-end="140.29">In linguistics, it's a community of practice.</span> <span data-start="140.29" data-end="142.909">It's a shared meeting making.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="142.909" data-end="147.34">And usually this term is used for communities formed around a specific goal.</span> <span data-start="147.34" data-end="150.34">Like a project or an open source tool.</span> <span data-start="150.34" data-end="154.629">But we can take this further and look at communities that form around programming languages.</span> <span data-start="154.629" data-end="159.74">They're communities of practice just like those that form around natural languages.</span> <span data-start="159.74" data-end="163.09">We need to look at what the community looks like from the outside as well as from the</span> <span data-start="163.09" data-end="164.15">inside.</span> <span data-start="164.15" data-end="166.739">This is how it looks to potential members.</span> <span data-start="166.739" data-end="174.18">When they want to join the community, they have to look at what they are doing differently.</span> <span data-start="174.18" data-end="179.909">And we are part of the JavaScript and part of other ones as well.</span> <span data-start="179.909" data-end="190.76">How do you feel beauty talking about using JavaScript versus Ruby and Erlang.</span> <span data-start="190.76" data-end="198.359">They can be divided into language and culture.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="198.359" data-end="202.55">The language is jargon and communitywide injokes.</span> <span data-start="202.55" data-end="203.989">That kind of stuff.</span> <span data-start="203.989" data-end="208.439">The cultural things, our approach to open source, diversity strategy, how we go about</span> <span data-start="208.439" data-end="210.569">solving problems.</span> <span data-start="210.569" data-end="213.519">Problems with communication as well as programming problems.</span> <span data-start="213.519" data-end="220.01">The language can also be described in linguistic faction early, and social factors.</span> <span data-start="220.01" data-end="224.879">We mush these together, we get sociolinguistics.</span> <span data-start="224.879" data-end="226.599">And we have definitions.</span> <span data-start="226.599" data-end="229.189">Sociolinguistic, study of how language functions in a society.</span> <span data-start="229.189" data-end="234.15">This is a really broad field and covers way too much stuff for this talk.</span> <span data-start="234.15" data-end="239.419">So something relevant to us is language socialization.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="239.419" data-end="242.359">Becoming a member of society through the use of language.</span> <span data-start="242.359" data-end="246.29">I said this talk about would be about sociolinguistic, I lied.</span> <span data-start="246.29" data-end="247.529">It is about socialization.</span> <span data-start="247.529" data-end="249.949">But doesn't sound as exciting.</span> <span data-start="249.949" data-end="257.58">In the natural language learning sense, socialization is the words we use and all of the other stuff</span> <span data-start="257.58" data-end="259.03">that's not words as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="259.03" data-end="262.46">You might be familiar with this concept.</span> <span data-start="262.46" data-end="265.81">Have you found it's easier to learn a language if you're living in a country that speaks</span> <span data-start="265.81" data-end="267.05">it?</span> <span data-start="267.05" data-end="270.65">You get the pronunciation and the slang and the body language and all this important junk</span> <span data-start="270.65" data-end="271.76">at the same time.</span> <span data-start="271.76" data-end="275.19">All of this together is socialization.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="275.19" data-end="279.441">So being part of a community means that you're helping to build it.</span> <span data-start="279.441" data-end="281.66">And we want nice communities.</span> <span data-start="281.66" data-end="282.97">We want people to feel welcome.</span> <span data-start="282.97" data-end="285.65">And we want it to be easy for them to join.</span> <span data-start="285.65" data-end="289.34">And these things are really important because we want people to be part of the JavaScript</span> <span data-start="289.34" data-end="291.1">magic.</span> <span data-start="291.1" data-end="293.68">Let's look at how we can do this better.</span> <span data-start="293.68" data-end="297.9">The JavaScript people are pretty great at this stuff compared to a lot of other tech</span> <span data-start="297.9" data-end="300.01">communities.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="300.01" data-end="305.13">But what does socialization look like in practice?</span> <span data-start="305.13" data-end="310.42">The most important thing for us is the language that we use when we talk about JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="310.42" data-end="312.14">So there are different programming languages.</span> <span data-start="312.14" data-end="314.17">We have different ways of being a member.</span> <span data-start="314.17" data-end="319.45">So how do we let people know what our special JavaScript way of doing things actually is?</span> <span data-start="319.45" data-end="322.2">We use socialization strategies.</span> <span data-start="322.2" data-end="324.44">And there's heaps of them and I'm not going to cover them together.</span> <span data-start="324.44" data-end="329.66">I have picked out some and divided into three categories to make them easy to use.</span> <span data-start="329.66" data-end="334.98">We have welcoming, focused and communityfocused.</span> <span data-start="334.98" data-end="339.77">There are two types of welcoming.</span> <span data-start="339.77" data-end="340.77">Positive and negative.</span> <span data-start="340.77" data-end="345.37">So an example of some positive welcoming is something like this.</span> <span data-start="345.37" data-end="347.68">So here's my tiny project.</span> <span data-start="347.68" data-end="351.1">Learning this thing was hard, but was also fun and worth it.</span> <span data-start="351.1" data-end="354.75">So let's break this down into sections.</span> <span data-start="354.75" data-end="356.67">Here's some of my tiny project.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="356.67" data-end="360.69">This little bit actually tell us quite a lot about our community of practice.</span> <span data-start="360.69" data-end="365.44">It tells us that posting a small project or a fragment of one is totally normal and things</span> <span data-start="365.44" data-end="372.46">don't have to be huge, brilliant ideas or finished or perfect for us to share them.</span> <span data-start="372.46" data-end="374.09">Learning this thing was hard.</span> <span data-start="374.09" data-end="377.52">This shows people who are reading the Tweet that JavaScript developers are comfortable</span> <span data-start="377.52" data-end="381.73">with vulnerability and it makes vulnerability okay for others as well.</span> <span data-start="381.73" data-end="385.86">And it was also fun and worth it.</span> <span data-start="385.86" data-end="388.87">So this shows that there's a payoff for all of this work that you're putting in, and you</span> <span data-start="388.87" data-end="393.83">don't have to finish things for them to be worthwhile to share.</span> <span data-start="393.83" data-end="397.461">So these things together, when viewed from outside the JavaScript community, welcome</span> <span data-start="397.461" data-end="399.7">people in a positive fashion.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="399.7" data-end="403.94">Seeing Tweets like this fosters good will towards our community and could spark people's</span> <span data-start="403.94" data-end="407.02">interest in learning JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="407.02" data-end="410.21">So seeing Tweets like this is great for users who are new to JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="410.21" data-end="413.76">But it's also nice for people who are already members.</span> <span data-start="413.76" data-end="417">It helps everyone feel more comfortable about using JavaScript and being associated with</span> <span data-start="417" data-end="419.9">our community.</span> <span data-start="419.9" data-end="423.7">Just as a side note, it's often not possible for people in minority groups to post things</span> <span data-start="423.7" data-end="424.7">like this.</span> <span data-start="424.7" data-end="429.17">They can be seen as less capable and less experienced even if they're an expert, and</span> <span data-start="429.17" data-end="432.09">it's potentially damaging to their job opportunities.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="432.09" data-end="437.73">So those of you in positions of privilege, please use that privilege� so many Ps�</span> <span data-start="437.73" data-end="441.79">to make this communication style the norm.</span> <span data-start="441.79" data-end="443">Next up we have negative welcoming.</span> <span data-start="443" data-end="445">I have made this pull request.</span> <span data-start="445" data-end="447.59">How about this for the photo?</span> <span data-start="447.59" data-end="449.12">My friend has commented on it.</span> <span data-start="449.12" data-end="450.91">LOL, so gross.</span> <span data-start="450.91" data-end="453.78">This might be an injoke, we know it's sarcasm.</span> <span data-start="453.78" data-end="459.15">But for those not in the sarcasm club, it might look mean.</span> <span data-start="459.15" data-end="461.23">It's actually a joke, right?</span> <span data-start="461.23" data-end="468.811">No, it's not it makes it look like when someone makes a pull request, we're going to make</span> <span data-start="468.811" data-end="474.61">light of their efforts and could be alienating to existing team members as well as newcomers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="474.61" data-end="479.46">Could entirely scare off external potential contributors.</span> <span data-start="479.46" data-end="483.96">Negative welcoming like this and other hazing confronts new members with their short comings.</span> <span data-start="483.96" data-end="491.7">Imagine seeing this when you just starting using JavaScript and you thought this PR looks</span> <span data-start="491.7" data-end="492.7">great.</span> <span data-start="492.7" data-end="495.43">If they're saying this about this code, what are they going to say about mine?</span> <span data-start="495.43" data-end="498.44">That's discouraging.</span> <span data-start="498.44" data-end="500.76">Next up we have learnerfocused strategies.</span> <span data-start="500.76" data-end="505.41">And start off with legitimation.</span> <span data-start="505.41" data-end="509.31">This is telling learners and members that the things that they have been working on</span> <span data-start="509.31" data-end="511.24">are legitimate.</span> <span data-start="511.24" data-end="515.34">So being encouraging to people working in JavaScript or on a particular project.</span> <span data-start="515.34" data-end="517.06">It's kind of like positive reinforcement.</span> <span data-start="517.06" data-end="522.76">So it's hard to be in the JavaScript community if no one recognizes the work you're doing</span> <span data-start="522.76" data-end="525.53">as an appropriate use of JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="525.53" data-end="529.45">For example, a colleague post this is pull request.</span> <span data-start="529.45" data-end="530.63">Updates to the new sign in page.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="530.63" data-end="534.5">And I have gone into cool� thumbs up.</span> <span data-start="534.5" data-end="538.24">At first glance, this is friendly and supportive.</span> <span data-start="538.24" data-end="542.07">But what if we took this a step forward with something like this.</span> <span data-start="542.07" data-end="547.09">Nice use of props, you're really getting the hang of React.</span> <span data-start="547.09" data-end="551.27">This is not much longer, but conveys the same message as the previous comment.</span> <span data-start="551.27" data-end="556">But makes it so clear to the author of the pull request that the work they have done</span> <span data-start="556" data-end="559.84">is a good use of the language they are working in.</span> <span data-start="559.84" data-end="564.02">And use this strategy if they tried a new approach to a problem that didn't work out</span> <span data-start="564.02" data-end="567.11">or a pull request that's not going to be merged.</span> <span data-start="567.11" data-end="572.11">These scenarios should not delegitimatize the work that's done.</span> <span data-start="572.11" data-end="576.9">Make sure that the authors still feel good about working with java script just by changing</span> <span data-start="576.9" data-end="579.21">how we talk about.</span> <span data-start="579.21" data-end="582.45">This leads into our next strategy, normalizing failure.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="582.45" data-end="587.7">So failing to complete a task shouldn't reflect on you personally or your coding ability.</span> <span data-start="587.7" data-end="592.62">We all know that writing java script is hard and we're not perfect all the time.</span> <span data-start="592.62" data-end="596.42">We need to make sure that our juniors and people outside our community know this as</span> <span data-start="596.42" data-end="598.75">well, as well as our existing members.</span> <span data-start="598.75" data-end="603.57">For example, I've personally been trying to stop using the words "easy" and" Simple" in</span> <span data-start="603.57" data-end="606.34">documentation we write.</span> <span data-start="606.34" data-end="610.12">We have some setup introductions.</span> <span data-start="610.12" data-end="613">My setup instructions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="613" data-end="616.14">Get set up with the short and easy instructions.</span> <span data-start="616.14" data-end="620.69">Spin up the Docker container, run tests, run build, party.</span> <span data-start="620.69" data-end="624.79">We have both the words "Easy" and" Simple" here.</span> <span data-start="624.79" data-end="629.76">These are fine if you know how to do all the steps and they run smoothly.</span> <span data-start="629.76" data-end="633.3">But if you don't know how to use Docker or anything goes wrong, we have undercut the</span> <span data-start="633.3" data-end="638.14">user's confidence by telling them it's easy.</span> <span data-start="638.14" data-end="641.95">By adding a few extra bits to the instructions, we could make people more comfortable with</span> <span data-start="641.95" data-end="644.31">not succeeding on their first shot.</span> <span data-start="644.31" data-end="647.29">So let's add more to the introduction.</span> <span data-start="647.29" data-end="650.13">The steps below will help you set up the project.</span> <span data-start="650.13" data-end="656.82">If you run into trouble, check out our FAQs or ask a question in Slack.</span> <span data-start="656.82" data-end="659.91">We have removed the word, easy, which is a great start.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="659.91" data-end="663.49">And by mentioning that you may need help, we are immediately noticing the possibility</span> <span data-start="663.49" data-end="664.86">of failing to set this up.</span> <span data-start="664.86" data-end="668.09">So we can make a list of instructions better too.</span> <span data-start="668.09" data-end="673.089">Spin up a Docker container, run test.</span> <span data-start="673.089" data-end="677.05">Build the code with npm run build.</span> <span data-start="677.05" data-end="680.88">So by removing the word "Simply" from the first step, we have changed the expectations</span> <span data-start="680.88" data-end="683.52">how difficult this task is going to be.</span> <span data-start="683.52" data-end="688.77">And by removing the links we have removed the frankly unreasonable assumption that you</span> <span data-start="688.77" data-end="694.4">know what you're doing and don't need to look anything up.</span> <span data-start="694.4" data-end="699.93">So these two learnerfocused strategies, legitimization and normalizing failure work together to make</span> <span data-start="699.93" data-end="704.72">it easier to persevere when we are faced with problems we don't know how to solve.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="704.72" data-end="713.5">Next up is selfefficacy, which is about supporting the belief to succeed.</span> <span data-start="713.5" data-end="722.1">The first study in 2012, their coding abilities learning how to program.</span> <span data-start="722.1" data-end="729.751">If they didn't believe in their own ability and succeed and successfully write code, even</span> <span data-start="729.751" data-end="735.52">if nay made a lot of mistakes along the way, both their performance and their mental well-being</span> <span data-start="735.52" data-end="738.37">decreased dramatically.</span> <span data-start="738.37" data-end="743.08">One of the major takeaways from the study was that if students have much higher ratio</span> <span data-start="743.08" data-end="747.21">of successes to failures when they're first learning, they're much more likely to develop</span> <span data-start="747.21" data-end="749.69">resilience and positive selfefficacy.</span> <span data-start="749.69" data-end="754.49">So we can take that suggestion and apply it to our community.</span> <span data-start="754.49" data-end="758.51">When people are learning JavaScript, help them have a good time with it.</span> <span data-start="758.51" data-end="763.44">If your project or team has new contributors, start tagging your tasks even if you know</span> <span data-start="763.44" data-end="766.31">it's something you're working on.</span> <span data-start="766.31" data-end="770.28">So lots of projects use tags on their issues and usually look like this.</span> <span data-start="770.28" data-end="772.279">Here we have an issue.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="772.279" data-end="774.94">Update team photos to use team module.</span> <span data-start="774.94" data-end="783.6">Three tags, frontend, new contributor� and they flag things appropriately for those starting</span> <span data-start="783.6" data-end="784.86">out.</span> <span data-start="784.86" data-end="786.66">But I think we can do one better.</span> <span data-start="786.66" data-end="793.68">What if we were tagging with more useful and less� reaction like these� React only,</span> <span data-start="793.68" data-end="796.1">selfcontained and documented.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="796.1" data-end="798.04">These provide even more information.</span> <span data-start="798.04" data-end="804.56">And they're not tying in people who have contributed.</span> <span data-start="804.56" data-end="809.8">Juniors can identify this is a task they're capable of and provides all of the pertinent</span> <span data-start="809.8" data-end="814.68">knowledge straight up, rather than having to wade through an issue description.</span> <span data-start="814.68" data-end="818.52">It tells you it that's React, so you know you won't suddenly find yourself waiting for</span> <span data-start="818.52" data-end="820.54">a C library.</span> <span data-start="820.54" data-end="828.48">And adding that it's documented lets contributors know there's help available.</span> <span data-start="828.48" data-end="837.14">So having� busy work junior task, which to be quite honest I hated being assign when</span> <span data-start="837.14" data-end="838.66">had I was a junior.</span> <span data-start="838.66" data-end="841.25">And the legitimate useful work that it is.</span> <span data-start="841.25" data-end="845.75">And it is much more appealing for developers at other stages of their career.</span> <span data-start="845.75" data-end="852.87">As a senior developer, you don't want to be rearchitecting parts of your code, or shaving</span> <span data-start="852.87" data-end="854.92">yaks while looking at complex bugs.</span> <span data-start="854.92" data-end="858.87">Sometimes you need small tasks that are well documented.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="858.87" data-end="865.84">The last strategy I'm going to talk about is legitimate peripheral participation.</span> <span data-start="865.84" data-end="871.02">This one I'm particularly passionate about, so it gets rockets.</span> <span data-start="871.02" data-end="876.56">So this is about ways that you can participate in the JavaScript community that aren't writing</span> <span data-start="876.56" data-end="877.56">code.</span> <span data-start="877.56" data-end="880.73">But are still important parts of being a member.</span> <span data-start="880.73" data-end="883.43">Things like uploading stack questions and answers.</span> <span data-start="883.43" data-end="888.36">Or asking and answering yourself.</span> <span data-start="888.36" data-end="891.95">Tweeting about new thing was done or challenges you are facing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="891.95" data-end="896.089">Making these activities just as important as writing code makes our community easier</span> <span data-start="896.089" data-end="897.98">to join.</span> <span data-start="897.98" data-end="901.83">And it's easier to be a part of for existing members.</span> <span data-start="901.83" data-end="906.36">Writing code is a cool part of our community, having other activities be equally important</span> <span data-start="906.36" data-end="911.68">is way more fun and provides us all with legitimate ways to engage when we can't or don't want</span> <span data-start="911.68" data-end="913.07">to be writing code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="913.07" data-end="922.25">So finally, we've got a communityfocused strategies.</span> <span data-start="922.25" data-end="925.31">First one I'll talk about is active participation.</span> <span data-start="925.31" data-end="929.08">This is about encouraging people to do communication well.</span> <span data-start="929.08" data-end="933.95">And we don't get awesome communities without people interacting with each other.</span> <span data-start="933.95" data-end="938.61">So even though this is called active participation, it covers activities like reading blog posts</span> <span data-start="938.61" data-end="943.81">or looking at things on stack overflow, as well as obviously active things like talking</span> <span data-start="943.81" data-end="945.97">to other developers and attending meetups.</span> <span data-start="945.97" data-end="950.01">Everyone here has take a great step for this one by attending this conference.</span> <span data-start="950.01" data-end="953.42">And now you can all take it a step further.</span> <span data-start="953.42" data-end="956.29">Tell the people that you meet what you're working on.</span> <span data-start="956.29" data-end="958.399">Even if you don't think it's particularly exciting.</span> <span data-start="958.399" data-end="962.95">Or if you're willing to really commit to improving your community, tell people what you're struggling</span> <span data-start="962.95" data-end="963.95">with.</span> <span data-start="963.95" data-end="967.7">You might find yourself talking to someone who has that exact same niche web compact</span> <span data-start="967.7" data-end="971.209">con fig bug and can help you fix it.</span> <span data-start="971.209" data-end="976.44">For next up, strategies for getting help.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="976.44" data-end="980.25">Defining how people can find help relating to your project.</span> <span data-start="980.25" data-end="983.12">Applies to internal projects as well as open source ones.</span> <span data-start="983.12" data-end="989.76">Rather than just listing the names of the maintainers and assuming people can get in</span> <span data-start="989.76" data-end="997.35">touch with you, have a go at figuring out ways that users or team members can get help.</span> <span data-start="997.35" data-end="1001.65">We want to define as much as we can so people are comfortable trying to help themselves.</span> <span data-start="1001.65" data-end="1006.6">If that doesn't work, they're also comfortable asking other people for help.</span> <span data-start="1006.6" data-end="1008.11">This can be scary.</span> <span data-start="1008.11" data-end="1012.12">It's a bit like booking your own doctor�s appointment and talking to people on the phone</span> <span data-start="1012.12" data-end="1014.14">is not a good time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1014.14" data-end="1018.13">But it's vastly improved if you know what you should say and what to say it.</span> <span data-start="1018.13" data-end="1023.86">In the same way, asking for help with JavaScript can be much less difficult if you know there</span> <span data-start="1023.86" data-end="1025.76">are steps you can follow.</span> <span data-start="1025.76" data-end="1029.339">So add more to the read me.</span> <span data-start="1029.339" data-end="1032.17">We can add sections for debugging.</span> <span data-start="1032.17" data-end="1035.36">Maybe different parts of your project have different debugging strategies.</span> <span data-start="1035.36" data-end="1037.65">Like installation versus rung tests.</span> <span data-start="1037.65" data-end="1040.53">You can add an FAQ.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1040.53" data-end="1045.1">If you have community support, like Slack groups or local meetups.</span> <span data-start="1045.1" data-end="1046.9">And tell them where to ask questions.</span> <span data-start="1046.9" data-end="1050.3">So other places that people can go to ask question it is they can't sort is out for</span> <span data-start="1050.3" data-end="1052.309">themselves.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1052.309" data-end="1056.88">So where to ask questions is really a whole point of its own and leads me to my final</span> <span data-start="1056.88" data-end="1061.1">communityfocused strategy, support structures.</span> <span data-start="1061.1" data-end="1062.1">These are really vital.</span> <span data-start="1062.1" data-end="1065.64">There are so many different places you can get help in the JavaScript community.</span> <span data-start="1065.64" data-end="1072.29">There are thousands of online tutorials, meetups, Twitter, conferences, GitHub issues, Slack</span> <span data-start="1072.29" data-end="1074.25">groups, and so many more.</span> <span data-start="1074.25" data-end="1079.01">But we need to let people know where to go and that it's okay to do so.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1079.01" data-end="1081.85">So JavaScript already does this pretty well.</span> <span data-start="1081.85" data-end="1086.23">We encourage people to talk about things that have gone badly as well as the ones that have</span> <span data-start="1086.23" data-end="1087.23">worked.</span> <span data-start="1087.23" data-end="1090.91">But we can set an even better example for our newcomers by posting about things we have</span> <span data-start="1090.91" data-end="1092.11">learned at every level.</span> <span data-start="1092.11" data-end="1096.299">So doesn't just have to be junior developers writing about their first experience with</span> <span data-start="1096.299" data-end="1097.299">JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1097.299" data-end="1101.65">Or senior developers talking about superadvanced and deep technical concepts.</span> <span data-start="1101.65" data-end="1105.96">It's how you have been working with JavaScript for five years and set up your first express</span> <span data-start="1105.96" data-end="1107.34">server the other day.</span> <span data-start="1107.34" data-end="1111.79">Or finally looked up what that actually means.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1111.79" data-end="1118.97">Opening up the conversation at all levels combines and creates the support for all levels</span> <span data-start="1118.97" data-end="1123.46">no matter where they are in the JavaScript journey.</span> <span data-start="1123.46" data-end="1126.1">So let's recap.</span> <span data-start="1126.1" data-end="1129.89">Socialization is all the things that we do to become members of a new community.</span> <span data-start="1129.89" data-end="1133.28">And all the things that I talk about today are used all the time in natural language</span> <span data-start="1133.28" data-end="1138.54">learning and really effective at building language communities.</span> <span data-start="1138.54" data-end="1142.76">They're all things that we can start using in our programming communities.</span> <span data-start="1142.76" data-end="1145.77">So let's start thinking about the language that we're using when we interact with our</span> <span data-start="1145.77" data-end="1150.33">fellow developers, when we're training new team members, when friends ask about JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1150.33" data-end="1152.66">or start using it for the first time.</span> <span data-start="1152.66" data-end="1156.48">And especially when we post on the Internet about JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1156.48" data-end="1160.78">By thinking about the language we use when we talk about JavaScript, each of us can make</span> <span data-start="1160.78" data-end="1165.47">our community a friendlier, more welcoming place for new people and new ideas.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1165.47" data-end="1166.47">Thanks.</span> <span data-start="1166.47" data-end="1167.47">[ Applause ] >> Thanks Harriet.</span> <span data-start="1167.47" data-end="1168.47">I think we're going to take a short break here as we have a few minutes before we sync</span> <span data-start="1168.47" data-end="1169.47">up with the next session at 4:30.</span> </p>
