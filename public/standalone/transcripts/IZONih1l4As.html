data-end="356.819">the price really adds up quickly then</span> <span data-start="356.819" data-end="358.349">the question is like what do you do if</span> <span data-start="358.349"

data-end="384.33">something like all recipes which is I'm</span> <span data-start="384.33" data-end="386.61">really appreciative of and they've been</span> <span data-start="386.61" data-end="388.86">in existence for years I don't think</span> <span data-start="388.86" data-end="390.839">that they're broken it's that I want to</span> <span data-start="390.839" data-end="392.639">play with the idea of another way and I</span> <span data-start="392.639" data-end="393.839">wanted more i wanted to be able to</span> <span data-start="393.839" data-end="399.389">explore so again the bright side is I'm</span> <span data-start="399.389" data-end="401.43">not pooh-poohing all recipe is there an</span> <span data-start="401.43" data-end="404.31">incredible website and I believe that</span> <span data-start="404.31" data-end="406.019">they were the most robust for collection</span> <span data-start="406.019" data-end="409.529">and discovering it labels itself as a</span> <span data-start="409.529" data-end="410.76">food focused social</span> <span data-start="410.76" data-end="412.62">a website and I would say that that's</span> <span data-start="412.62" data-end="415.47">very on point what's been so interesting</span> <span data-start="415.47" data-end="417.06">about all recipes over the years is that</span> <span data-start="417.06" data-end="419.04">as they've added features and even</span> <span data-start="419.04" data-end="422.64">trying to clean up the UI the user added</span> <span data-start="422.64" data-end="424.14">comments has still remained the most</span> <span data-start="424.14" data-end="427.56">valuable piece of that website for me</span> <span data-start="427.56" data-end="430.53">and really across the internet it's it</span> <span data-start="430.53" data-end="432.51">helps me learn and helps me spot out</span> <span data-start="432.51" data-end="434.61">when there's issues in a recipe you know</span> <span data-start="434.61" data-end="436.08">you'll look at something in the comments</span> <span data-start="436.08" data-end="438.09">for instance we'll have something like</span> <span data-start="438.09" data-end="440.28">this recipe had way too much baking soda</span> <span data-start="440.28" data-end="442.74">in it or I prefer less salt and they</span> <span data-start="442.74" data-end="445.86">even have user ratings on how helpful</span> <span data-start="445.86" data-end="447.63">these comments have been in the past and</span> <span

data-start="454.07" data-end="456.57">was sort of flabbergasted when i was</span> <span data-start="456.57" data-end="458.25">working through this project and how</span> <span data-start="458.25" data-end="459.81">valuable that could be and sort of like</span> <span data-start="459.81" data-end="462.18">how you can harness that you know it's</span> <span data-start="462.18"
