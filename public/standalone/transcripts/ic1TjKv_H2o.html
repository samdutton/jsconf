data-start="1688.72" data-end="1693.31">kind of catching up but anyway you need</span> <span data-start="1693.31" data-end="1695.2">to be able to refresh the page and the</span> <span data-start="1695.2" data-end="1696.88">tab i selected last time is still</span> <span data-start="1696.88" data-end="1699.31">selected by it why can't these things</span> <span data-start="1699.31" data-end="1703.24">just be done but it's not that hard most</span> <span data-start="1703.24" data-end="1706.12">of how this works is but in this</span> <span data-start="1706.12" data-end="1707.86">particular instance you can refresh it</span> <span data-start="1707.86" data-end="1709.51">and a tab stays oh there's an API for</span> <span data-start="1709.51" data-end="1711.58">that it's the storage API that's been</span> <span data-start="1711.58" data-end="1713.17">there for a while no one really knows</span> <span data-start="1713.17" data-end="1716.23">about it but it takes care of a lot of</span> <span data-start="1716.23" data-end="1718.36">the problems that we usually have with</span> <span data-start="1718.36" data-end="1721.05">remembering things filling out a form</span> <span data-start="1721.05" data-end="1724.03">you get an error it reloads the page and</span> <span data-start="1724.03" data-end="1725.29">everything you've filled out it's gone</span> <span data-start="1725.29" data-end="1728.47">because no one knows how to do this but</span> <span data-start="1728.47" data-end="1730.03">storage lets you do all of that on the</span> <span data-start="1730.03" data-end="1731.14">client side without a pro</span> <span data-start="1731.14" data-end="1735.25">it's really really powerful but the</span> <span data-start="1735.25" data-end="1737.61">essence of it is to make sure you don't</span> <span data-start="1737.61" data-end="1740.98">kill what sorry there you maintain the</span> <span data-start="1740.98" data-end="1743.04">standards of what things should do and</span> <span data-start="1743.04" data-end="1746.11">it's not good enough to say that oh I</span> <span data-start="1746.11" data-end="1747.73">know everyone's going to have JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1747.73" data-end="1750.7">turned on so you know it's all going to</span> <span data-start="1750.7" data-end="1752.56">be fine all my users have got perfect</span> <span data-start="1752.56" data-end="1754.92">vision I've asked them it's all right</span> <span data-start="1754.92" data-end="1757.12">you need to actually think that little</span> <span data-start="1757.12" data-end="1759.52">bit further and it's really what</span> </p>

data-start="1764.29" data-end="1765.94">that's just the better way of doing</span> <span data-start="1765.94" data-end="1769.12">things a lot of accessibility talks use</span> <span data-start="1769.12" data-end="1770.74">a lot of stick where they're just</span> <span data-start="1770.74" data-end="1772.75">telling you a bad person if you don't do</span> <span data-start="1772.75" data-end="1773.95">this thing I'm trying to give you a</span> <span data-start="1773.95" data-end="1776.02">carrot here to make you feel better</span> <span data-start="1776.02" data-end="1778.75">about just making your code better the</span> <span data-start="1778.75" data-end="1780.79">fact it's accessible and people get to</span> <span data-start="1780.79" data-end="1783.07">use it is a bonus it's just a better</span> <span data-start="1783.07" data-end="1786.81">quality product that you'll be producing</span> <span data-start="1786.81" data-end="1791.8">and universal design has gone into other</span> <span data-start="1791.8" data-end="1794.59">fields this is a whole range of</span> <span data-start="1794.59" data-end="1796.75">prototype peelers and finished products</span> <span data-start="1796.75" data-end="1798.97">that were the first product from ox 0</span> <span data-start="1798.97" data-end="1802.24">and Sam Farber founder noticed that his</span> <span data-start="1802.24" data-end="1805.18">wife feels quite athletic and had</span> <span data-start="1805.18"

data-end="1811.54">went to the shop and there was nothing</span> <span data-start="1811.54" data-end="1814.51">he could find that did the job so he</span> <span data-start="1814.51" data-end="1817.03">iterated through several designs and got</span> <span data-start="1817.03" data-end="1819.37">her to test it out and this is designed</span> <span data-start="1819.37" data-end="1822.46">only for his wife I've got oxide product</span> <span data-start="1822.46" data-end="1824.59">so I had no idea about this until I</span> <span data-start="1824.59" data-end="1826.09">actually looked into it I just thought</span> <span data-start="1826.09" data-end="1828.37">they were really well designed and</span> <span data-start="1828.37" data-end="1830.94">that's the essence of what this is about</span> <span data-start="1830.94" data-end="1834.63">making your products fit into the</span> <span data-start="1834.63" data-end="1837.16">philosophies of universal design will</span> <span data-start="1837.16" data-end="1839.47">make a better products inherently even</span> <span data-start="1839.47"
