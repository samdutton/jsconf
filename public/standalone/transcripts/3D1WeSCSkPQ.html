data-start="320.9" data-end="324.03">because as we've seen ten people said</span> <span data-start="324.03" data-end="325.44">that they're actually reading the code</span> <span data-start="325.44"

data-end="394.41">this fancy date picker so I found this</span> <span data-start="394.41" data-end="396.78">cool library which is doing fancy date</span> <span data-start="396.78"

data-end="408.84">this really affects the complexity</span> <span data-start="408.84" data-end="411.72">you're willing to deal with and this is</span> <span data-start="411.72" data-end="414.45">also a problem of cognitive load</span> <span data-start="414.45" data-end="415.89">which is translated to the difficult</span> <span data-start="415.89" data-end="417.66">difficulty associated with the</span> <span data-start="417.66" data-end="419.31">understanding of a certain content</span> <span data-start="419.31" data-end="423.54">concept so should libraries really be</span> <span data-start="423.54" data-end="426.66">that complex should they solve that many</span> <span data-start="426.66" data-end="429.57">issues or should they be more</span> <span data-start="429.57" data-end="432.9">specialized for me kind of the idea of</span> <span data-start="432.9" data-end="435.72">the library is that is addressing one</span> <span data-start="435.72" data-end="438.6">issue or maybe a few small issues it's</span> <span data-start="438.6" data-end="440.85">not like oh let's just put Ajax in</span> <span data-start="440.85" data-end="443.28">jQuery because Jake Ajax is so cool so</span> <span data-start="443.28" data-end="444.84">let's put it there but why on the other</span> <span data-start="444.84" data-end="449.85">hand so maybe they should not follow</span> <span

data-end="469.2">developers like powers of course and we</span> <span data-start="469.2" data-end="470.91">can notice good patterns we can benefit</span> <span data-start="470.91" data-end="473.37">from that we can learn because not all</span> <span data-start="473.37" data-end="476.21">of us are really great programmers right</span> <span data-start="476.21" data-end="479.13">on the other hand some parts may be</span> <span data-start="479.13" data-end="482.04">really really over engineered may be</span> <span data-start="482.04" data-end="483.12">very complicated</span> <span data-start="483.12" data-end="486.78">unnecessarily and we all strive for</span> <span data-start="486.78" data-end="491.76">simplicity the solution we may take is</span> <span data-start="491.76" data-end="494.22">to choose a micro framework over a</span> <span data-start="494.22" data-end="497.52">library because I've said the library is</span> <span data-start="497.52" data-end="499.98">usually huge its kind of framework ish</span> <span data-start="499.98" data-end="503.85">and micro framework has usually modular</span> <span data-start="503.85" data-end="505.8">approach it's very lightweight is</span> <span data-start="505.8" data-end="508.5">addressing a specific issue for example</span> <span data-start="508.5" data-end="510.54">if you go to micro J's what tile you</span> <span data-start="510.54" data-end="512.34">have this all really tiny libraries</span> <span data-start="512.34" data-end="515.43">which will work great for my well</span> <span data-start="515.43" data-end="518.1">they're easy to understand because the</span> <span data-start="518.1" data-end="521.58">code base is smaller on the other hand</span> <span

data-end="529.23">browser compatibility they have</span> <span data-start="529.23" data-end="532.46">backtracking software more documentation</span> <span data-start="532.46" data-end="535.65">sometimes they are more reliable for</span> <span data-start="535.65" data-end="543.54">production so do not give this talk only</span> <span data-start="543.54" data-end="546">inspirational there's some examples I</span> <span data-start="546" data-end="548.25">said to halogen which</span> <span data-start="548.25" data-end="551.55">a query but jQuery is good for central</span> <span data-start="551.55" data-end="553.32">and thanks of course like every library</span> <span data-start="553.32" data-end="557.61">is and when is used in a good way by</span>

data-end="575.28">doing all the weird things they're</span> <span data-start="575.28" data-end="577.83">mapping CSS selectors so you can use</span> <span data-start="577.83" data-end="580.2">selectors
