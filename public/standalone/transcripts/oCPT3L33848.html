<p><span data-start="21.009" data-end="23.509">I'm Arne Martin, I live in Trondheim Norway.</span> <span data-start="23.509" data-end="27.019">I work for Boost Communications.</span> <span data-start="27.019" data-end="32.009">They paid for my trip.</span> <span data-start="32.009" data-end="38.68">I'll be talking about programming languages.</span> <span data-start="38.68" data-end="41.85">I'll be talking about isotheric languages.</span> <span data-start="41.85" data-end="49.85">And why I think you should write in one of these crazy languages.</span> <span data-start="49.85" data-end="59.47">But, what's an isotheric language?</span> <span data-start="59.47" data-end="62.31">Programming shouldn't be all business.</span> <span data-start="62.31" data-end="70.05">Esotheric programming languages are languages that are often just for fun.</span> <span data-start="70.05" data-end="74.229">And they are in almost all cases completely useless for any practical use.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="74.229" data-end="77.78">That makes it great.</span> <span data-start="77.78" data-end="85.88">I have a few examples that you might have heard of.</span> <span data-start="85.88" data-end="87.909">Brainfuck.</span> <span data-start="87.909" data-end="88.909">Hello world.</span> <span data-start="88.909" data-end="93.17">It is one of the most minimal languages.</span> <span data-start="93.17" data-end="94.17">Only 8.</span> <span data-start="94.17" data-end="103.409">It is  kind of hard to use though.</span> <span data-start="103.409" data-end="104.76">Then you have Malboge.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="104.76" data-end="111.84">It is harder to use.</span> <span data-start="111.84" data-end="116.399">This is created to be hard to write programs.</span> <span data-start="116.399" data-end="118.45">Each instruction is encrypted.</span> <span data-start="118.45" data-end="122.59">The encryption changes for each step of the program.</span> <span data-start="122.59" data-end="132.7">This Hello World example has not been written, as much as generated using brute force.</span> <span data-start="132.7" data-end="136.569">And then we have things like Piat.</span> <span data-start="136.569" data-end="147.78">It is a language you can write in an image editor.</span> <span data-start="147.78" data-end="151.26">But why should anyone want to do that?</span> <span data-start="151.26" data-end="154.319">Well, my main idea is: Why not?</span> <span data-start="154.319" data-end="155.319">It is fun.</span> <span data-start="155.319" data-end="165.18">Have some fun, write some code you would never write at your day jobs.</span> <span data-start="165.18" data-end="167.4">Programming in new ways.</span> <span data-start="167.4" data-end="169.739">As you write.</span> <span data-start="169.739" data-end="178.959">And trying to learn the language you are writing for.</span> <span data-start="178.959" data-end="182.29">I have to warn you before we proceed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="182.29" data-end="186.75">I have no idea what I'm doing.</span> <span data-start="186.75" data-end="191.95">No education or knowledge of writing compilers or interpreters.</span> <span data-start="191.95" data-end="196.99">I just do things.</span> <span data-start="196.99" data-end="201.28">I hope that you will not use any techniques, code, concept.</span> <span data-start="201.28" data-end="203.269">That you will see here in any production code.</span> <span data-start="203.269" data-end="206.88">I will not be held responsible.</span> <span data-start="206.88" data-end="221.05">When I write code for fun, I don't do writing comments, or consider issues, like logging.</span> <span data-start="221.05" data-end="222.189">It is just for fun.</span> <span data-start="222.189" data-end="224.319">If I can save 2 lines.</span> <span data-start="224.319" data-end="228.45">I will do so.</span> <span data-start="228.45" data-end="231.14">The first language I will demonstrate is Befunge.</span> <span data-start="231.14" data-end="240.51">Befunge is an ideocratic language.</span> <span data-start="240.51" data-end="243.279">Which has new concepts.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="243.279" data-end="246.709">It is stack based.</span> <span data-start="246.709" data-end="248.13">No variables.</span> <span data-start="248.13" data-end="250.1">Only on a stack.</span> <span data-start="250.1" data-end="255.34">You can only push and pop from this stack.</span> <span data-start="255.34" data-end="258.41">Befunge are reflective.</span> <span data-start="258.41" data-end="264.73">Can read and modify their own sourcecode at runtime.</span> <span data-start="264.73" data-end="268.72">Multidimensional.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="268.72" data-end="272.89">Consist of single character instructions on a grid.</span> <span data-start="272.89" data-end="278">There is an insertion pointer that moves in any direction.</span> <span data-start="278" data-end="283.19">And executes instructions as it passes.</span> <span data-start="283.19" data-end="286.73">Because of this, it is a cross between Forth and Lemmings.</span> <span data-start="286.73" data-end="293.45">It is quite annoying to write programs for.</span> <span data-start="293.45" data-end="294.78">It is completely useless.</span> <span data-start="294.78" data-end="298.02">But also quite fun.</span> <span data-start="298.02" data-end="301.54">I'll show you what it looks like.</span> <span data-start="301.54" data-end="306.37">Here is an interpreter I have written for Befunge.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="306.37" data-end="310.28">It is using React.</span> <span data-start="310.28" data-end="318.98">Now, the code is Hello World.</span> <span data-start="318.98" data-end="323.54">It is on the stack in reversed order.</span> <span data-start="323.54" data-end="328.5">A loop that will print out all the characters.</span> <span data-start="328.5" data-end="331.65">Until it hits zero and terminates.</span> <span data-start="331.65" data-end="335.85">Slow it down a bit.</span> <span data-start="335.85" data-end="343.03">You can see down here, the program as it executes.</span> <span data-start="343.03" data-end="347.03">The characters.</span> <span data-start="347.03" data-end="348.88">And printing them.</span> <span data-start="348.88" data-end="355.06">Back and forth.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="355.06" data-end="361.07">There.</span> <span data-start="361.07" data-end="362.12">Another example.</span> <span data-start="362.12" data-end="365.31">You know Fizzbuzz.</span> <span data-start="365.31" data-end="371.1">You write the numbers from 1 to 100.</span> <span data-start="371.1" data-end="376.41">You print fizz or buzz.</span> <span data-start="376.41" data-end="383.32">You write fizzbuzz or just the number.</span> <span data-start="383.32" data-end="384.68">Pay attention to the instruction pointer.</span> <span data-start="384.68" data-end="387.72">Look at it go!</span> <span data-start="387.72" data-end="393.84">Isn't it hilarious?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="393.84" data-end="401.81">So, what it does is, it adds 1 to the current number.</span> <span data-start="401.81" data-end="413.16">Checks if it divisible by 3, if not it goes this way.</span> <span data-start="413.16" data-end="416.4">It pushes the string it needs onto the stack.</span> <span data-start="416.4" data-end="422.3">It goes down here down to this area to print it out.</span> <span data-start="422.3" data-end="425.78">Then it goes all the way back to the beginning.</span> <span data-start="425.78" data-end="433.62">And, does it over again.</span> <span data-start="433.62" data-end="436.76">Nice example.</span> <span data-start="436.76" data-end="439.77">This program demonstrates the reflective nature.</span> <span data-start="439.77" data-end="444.81">If you pay attention to the upper left corner of the program.</span> <span data-start="444.81" data-end="445.81">There is a number.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="445.81" data-end="453.79">When I run this.</span> <span data-start="453.79" data-end="455.15">It is a counter.</span> <span data-start="455.15" data-end="457.81">It reads in the number, adds 1 to it and prints it back out.</span> <span data-start="457.81" data-end="463.97">Modifying the source code.</span> <span data-start="463.97" data-end="469.4">Because it is reflective, Quine quite simple.</span> <span data-start="469.4" data-end="473.89">Quine is a program that prints out its own source code.</span> <span data-start="473.89" data-end="482.71">It reads from itself and prints itself out.</span> <span data-start="482.71" data-end="485.55">You can write things like this one.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="485.55" data-end="488.06">Which I'm proud of.</span> <span data-start="488.06" data-end="490.3">This program.</span> <span data-start="490.3" data-end="494.8">Reads itself, one character at a time and prints itself back into the program on the</span> <span data-start="494.8" data-end="496.48">next line.</span> <span data-start="496.48" data-end="501">Moves down, and keeps going.</span> <span data-start="501" data-end="504.16">You'll see what I mean.</span> <span data-start="504.16" data-end="505.81">Prints itself out.</span> <span data-start="505.81" data-end="514.43">When it is done it jumps down.</span> <span data-start="514.43" data-end="520.47">Does it once more.</span> <span data-start="520.47" data-end="525.01">It keeps going.</span> <span data-start="525.01" data-end="527.29">Quite fun.</span> <span data-start="527.29" data-end="529.24">Right.</span> <span data-start="529.24" data-end="538.55">Let's look at the source code for this interpreter.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="538.55" data-end="541.89">The main entrypoint is this file.</span> <span data-start="541.89" data-end="543.61">JS.</span> <span data-start="543.61" data-end="546.59">What it does is basically create a new object.</span> <span data-start="546.59" data-end="553.21">The main entry point for the interpreter.</span> <span data-start="553.21" data-end="559.7">Functions like stopping and starting and stepping and things like that.</span> <span data-start="559.7" data-end="566.07">The parser is what reads the source code and turns it into an actual program.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="566.07" data-end="569.17">Like a data structure.</span> <span data-start="569.17" data-end="571.59">That the interpreter can work on.</span> <span data-start="571.59" data-end="574.4">And that's actually quite simple in this case.</span> <span data-start="574.4" data-end="581.34">All it needs to do is read in a text file and dump it into a 2D array.</span> <span data-start="581.34" data-end="584.56">Splits the screen.</span> <span data-start="584.56" data-end="590.12">And divides each line into separate characters.</span> <span data-start="590.12" data-end="598.51">The interpreter for this thing is the main meat of the program.</span> <span data-start="598.51" data-end="603.89">So, the interpreter is a huge multi method.</span> <span data-start="603.89" data-end="607.81">Which has 1 implementation for each command in the language.</span> <span data-start="607.81" data-end="613.94">It is like a functional switch statement.</span> <span data-start="613.94" data-end="618.81">Different implementations, based on its first argument.</span> <span data-start="618.81" data-end="622">If you get a space, we do a noap.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="622" data-end="624.83">There is a lot of stuff.</span> <span data-start="624.83" data-end="626.37">Hash.</span> <span data-start="626.37" data-end="630.34">We skip to the next cell.</span> <span data-start="630.34" data-end="639.69">The add cell terminates the program.</span> <span data-start="639.69" data-end="642.35">the underscore is the east-west if.</span> <span data-start="642.35" data-end="650.14">If it is zero, go right, otherwise go left.</span> <span data-start="650.14" data-end="656.57">The pipe-character is a north-south if.</span> <span data-start="656.57" data-end="661.32">The numbers, push themselves on the stack.</span> <span data-start="661.32" data-end="664.07">Including hexidecimal numbers.</span> <span data-start="664.07" data-end="666.63">Basic aritmethic operators.</span> <span data-start="666.63" data-end="675.17">Pops 2 values from the stack and pushes the result back.</span> <span data-start="675.17" data-end="683.13">It  takes 2 values and the operator in between</span> <span data-start="683.13" data-end="690.49">and evals the result.</span> <span data-start="690.49" data-end="694.48">Everything here is written.</span> <span data-start="694.48" data-end="698.41">I don't know if you heard of that.</span> <span data-start="698.41" data-end="702.74">If you haven't, I recommend you to check it out.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="702.74" data-end="705.65">It was brand new at the time.</span> <span data-start="705.65" data-end="708.5">I started doing this.</span> <span data-start="708.5" data-end="713.26">And it is a bad idea when it comes to memory usage.</span> <span data-start="713.26" data-end="717.33">It was fun.</span> <span data-start="717.33" data-end="730.17">Let's go back to the presentation.</span> <span data-start="730.17" data-end="733.79">Did you enjoy it?</span> <span data-start="733.79" data-end="737.01">(applause)</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="737.01" data-end="738.01">This is online.</span> <span data-start="738.01" data-end="739.44">You can try it if you want.</span> <span data-start="739.44" data-end="743.66">I'll get the address later.</span> <span data-start="743.66" data-end="747.38">I have 1 more language to show you.</span> <span data-start="747.38" data-end="751.38">It is Thue.</span> <span data-start="751.38" data-end="754.18">It is named after a Norwegian mathematician Thue.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="754.18" data-end="763.37">It is a quite different language.</span> <span data-start="763.37" data-end="764.779">Very simple.</span> <span data-start="764.779" data-end="769.42">It is based entirely around string rewriting.</span> <span data-start="769.42" data-end="771.65">It is non deterministic.</span> <span data-start="771.65" data-end="778.279">Which makes doing certain things hard.</span> <span data-start="778.279" data-end="781.44">It is very simple.</span> <span data-start="781.44" data-end="786.71">A program in Thue consists of several rules.</span> <span data-start="786.71" data-end="796.96">Lefthand side, righthandside and colon, colon, equal.</span> <span data-start="796.96" data-end="800.15">It will read from the user.</span> <span data-start="800.15" data-end="804.98">It will print out what comes after.</span> <span data-start="804.98" data-end="809.03">And then return the empty string.</span> <span data-start="809.03" data-end="814.35">The rules section is finished with an empty rule.</span> <span data-start="814.35" data-end="817.32">Below that is the initial state of the program.</span> <span data-start="817.32" data-end="824.33">And the program runs by picking a rule at random.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="824.33" data-end="827.18">Applying it to the current state.</span> <span data-start="827.18" data-end="831.91">Replaces the content of the lefthand side with the righthandside.</span> <span data-start="831.91" data-end="833.48">And repeats.</span> <span data-start="833.48" data-end="837.63">Until there are normal rules that can apply.</span> <span data-start="837.63" data-end="842.04">So, let's implement this.</span> <span data-start="842.04" data-end="851.32">Here is the basic skeleton for the Thue interpreter.</span> <span data-start="851.32" data-end="853.529">A few basic functions.</span> <span data-start="853.529" data-end="855.25">Parse to read the string.</span> <span data-start="855.25" data-end="861.31">And generate program data structure thing.</span> <span data-start="861.31" data-end="863.13">Run function to run the program.</span> <span data-start="863.13" data-end="869.75">And it reads the file from arguments.</span> <span data-start="869.75" data-end="873.76">And parses it and runs it.</span> <span data-start="873.76" data-end="882.089">So, to parse is quite simple.</span> <span data-start="882.089" data-end="886.76">First we start with what should the data structure look like.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="886.76" data-end="889.19">It is very simple.</span> <span data-start="889.19" data-end="891.06">An array of rules.</span> <span data-start="891.06" data-end="893.19">It has a string, current state.</span> <span data-start="893.19" data-end="901.96">There is a flag that tells us if there are more rules that can match.</span> <span data-start="901.96" data-end="908.18">So, what we do is to take the input string.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="908.18" data-end="913.62">And first of all we strip out the new lines and comments.</span> <span data-start="913.62" data-end="917.67">And we divide it into 2 parts.</span> <span data-start="917.67" data-end="918.67">The rules part.</span> <span data-start="918.67" data-end="922.66">The initial input part.</span> <span data-start="922.66" data-end="926.03">And we assign the initial input to the program state.</span> <span data-start="926.03" data-end="929.31">Then we split the rules.</span> <span data-start="929.31" data-end="935.83">And push them one by one on the array of rules.</span> </p>
