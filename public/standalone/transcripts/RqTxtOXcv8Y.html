<p><span data-start="1.04" data-end="4.04">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="4.04" data-end="5.21">Is this on?</span> <span data-start="5.21" data-end="7.359">Can you all hear me?</span> <span data-start="7.359" data-end="10.44">All right.</span> <span data-start="10.44" data-end="11.44">There we go!</span> <span data-start="11.44" data-end="12.64">All right.</span> <span data-start="12.64" data-end="13.99">So, yeah.</span> <span data-start="13.99" data-end="21.2">My talk is simplifying, though I would have liked to see a talk titled simplifying complex</span> <span data-start="21.2" data-end="24.93">talk titles with fewer words.</span> <span data-start="24.93" data-end="28.02">I know what you might be thinking right now.</span> <span data-start="28.02" data-end="31.869">The react API, a little scary?</span> <span data-start="31.869" data-end="40.18">There's a good book in order to understand how to best work with it, and it's doing whatever</span> <span data-start="40.18" data-end="46.32">Danny says to do.</span> <span data-start="46.32" data-end="52.17">The second half of this talk is exactly what I'm talking about today, except in the more</span> <span data-start="52.17" data-end="55.94">general sense.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="55.94" data-end="58.15">I want to talk about it, though.</span> <span data-start="58.15" data-end="64.33">Not in the context of React or you or angular or any of the last frameworks that came out</span> <span data-start="64.33" data-end="65.33">last week.</span> <span data-start="65.33" data-end="69.86">But I want to talk about it in a frameworkless context.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="69.86" data-end="74.92">This is an idea that doesn't just apply to any framework or no framework in general,</span> <span data-start="74.92" data-end="77.72">but really any programming language as well.</span> <span data-start="77.72" data-end="81.96">We can see how it could help us simplify our UIs.</span> <span data-start="81.96" data-end="87.159">So I'm a pianist, and I have been playing for about 20 years.</span> <span data-start="87.159" data-end="94.89">This is the approach that I take to software development.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="94.89" data-end="100.92">I made the analogy that if software is music, then developers are composers.</span> <span data-start="100.92" data-end="108.21">We're taking that music, and we're composing it in a way that is applicable to any language</span> <span data-start="108.21" data-end="109.44">or any platform.</span> <span data-start="109.44" data-end="112.549">And we do so in a variety of ways.</span> <span data-start="112.549" data-end="117.049">However, music's interesting, because with music, you have music notation, which you</span> <span data-start="117.049" data-end="118.049">just saw there.</span> <span data-start="118.049" data-end="120.37">Let's go back and see it.</span> <span data-start="120.37" data-end="122.64">So this stuff right here.</span> <span data-start="122.64" data-end="126.14">This music notation is hundreds and hundreds of years old.</span> <span data-start="126.14" data-end="133.189">However, the exact same notation is used today to represent music from classical, romantic,</span> <span data-start="133.189" data-end="135.59">whatever the hell�Bjork is.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="135.59" data-end="145.68">You can give a musician who understands how to read sheet music, and they will be able</span> <span data-start="145.68" data-end="147.06">to play it.</span> <span data-start="147.06" data-end="152.09">And this works for all instruments, and you know, all musicians of all levels.</span> <span data-start="152.09" data-end="161.98">So I was wondering, what is the music notation of user interfaces?</span> <span data-start="161.98" data-end="169.389">What do all user interfaces have in common, and how can we represent that declaratively?</span> <span data-start="169.389" data-end="173.969">So when we're working with software, we usually deal with APIs.</span> <span data-start="173.969" data-end="178.73">Good APIs have three main qualities.</span> <span data-start="178.73" data-end="180.159">They're well documented.</span> <span data-start="180.159" data-end="184.159">You can read the documentation and understand exactly what's happening with the API.</span> <span data-start="184.159" data-end="186.11">They are very predictable.</span> <span data-start="186.11" data-end="191.189">The API is going to work the exact same way every time.</span> <span data-start="191.189" data-end="192.87">And they're also testable.</span> <span data-start="192.87" data-end="194.909">You can test against an API.</span> <span data-start="194.909" data-end="200.999">They provide mocks for you or have a test database or something like that.</span> <span data-start="200.999" data-end="204.819">So user interfaces, though?</span> <span data-start="204.819" data-end="207.239">User interfaces are really complex.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="207.239" data-end="213.309">I mean, does anyone find developing user interfaces easy?</span> <span data-start="213.309" data-end="217.12">Those of you watching online, no one raised their hand, which is good, because I would</span> <span data-start="217.12" data-end="219.989">have called them out if they did.</span> <span data-start="219.989" data-end="223.989">We have to deal with something called a human API.</span> <span data-start="223.989" data-end="227.26">That's all of you, all of our clients, everyone we work with.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="227.26" data-end="232.719">Human API is undocumented or unpredictable, and we're untestable.</span> <span data-start="232.719" data-end="235.72">And we're also extremely buggy.</span> <span data-start="235.72" data-end="242.29">If you don't believe me, turn on an American news network, and you'll see proof of that.</span> <span data-start="242.29" data-end="243.29">So I work for Microsoft.</span> <span data-start="243.29" data-end="249.59">By the way, I'm not relating Microsoft to any of this terrible API stuff, I promise.</span> <span data-start="249.59" data-end="256.94">And at Microsoft, we have more than 50,000 software engineers throughout the world, and</span> <span data-start="256.94" data-end="259.9">at least 7 designers, I'm sure.</span> <span data-start="259.9" data-end="264.72">[ Laughter ] And we also serve one and a half billion customers.</span> <span data-start="264.72" data-end="266.3">I think this is just for windows.</span> <span data-start="266.3" data-end="269.62">It might be more than that.</span> <span data-start="269.62" data-end="275.56">When we're developing user interfaces for 1.5 billion people, we have to imagine all</span> <span data-start="275.56" data-end="278.59">the different ways a user could use the user interface.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="278.59" data-end="282.21">And you know, this is different cultures and languages.</span> <span data-start="282.21" data-end="285.44">You wonder why diversity is so important in tech?</span> <span data-start="285.44" data-end="289.29">We have to reach the 1.5 billion people.</span> <span data-start="289.29" data-end="292.45">So we don't develop software for just one person.</span> <span data-start="292.45" data-end="298.98">However, when we're developing software with just the happy path in mind, that's essentially</span> <span data-start="298.98" data-end="300.44">what we're doing.</span> <span data-start="300.44" data-end="306">We're assuming that there's this ideal user who's using our applications in the exact</span> <span data-start="306" data-end="307.7">way that we want them to.</span> <span data-start="307.7" data-end="310.1">But this never happens.</span> <span data-start="310.1" data-end="314.16">We're going to take a look at the code example, but I don't want you to read too deeply into</span> <span data-start="314.16" data-end="315.16">the code.</span> <span data-start="315.16" data-end="319.06">I just want to see if you relate to this.</span> <span data-start="319.06" data-end="326.73">We're going to create a sample F where we query the flickr API and then the results.</span> <span data-start="326.73" data-end="332.31">Similar to what Dan was doing with movies in his last talk.</span> <span data-start="332.31" data-end="334.46">So it's pretty simple right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="334.46" data-end="335.59">We do a fetch.</span> <span data-start="335.59" data-end="340.5">Then when we get the data, we show it.</span> <span data-start="340.5" data-end="341.65">Are there any bugs here?</span> <span data-start="341.65" data-end="343.74">Are we done?</span> <span data-start="343.74" data-end="344.74">Well..</span> <span data-start="344.74" data-end="346.59">Let's say the data takes a long time to load.</span> <span data-start="346.59" data-end="347.59">Okay.</span> <span data-start="347.59" data-end="351">So now we have to set this loading flag, loading is true.</span> <span data-start="351" data-end="355.75">And once we finish loading data, then we have to set loading to false.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="355.75" data-end="357.63">Are we done?</span> <span data-start="357.63" data-end="358.63">No.</span> <span data-start="358.63" data-end="360.65">What if we have an error.</span> <span data-start="360.65" data-end="365.75">Well, we have to hide the loading screen, show the error, right?</span> <span data-start="365.75" data-end="368.01">But, are we home free yet?</span> <span data-start="368.01" data-end="369.01">No.</span> <span data-start="369.01" data-end="376.28">Because, we also have to make sure that we clear the error once we try to search again.</span> <span data-start="376.28" data-end="379.3">As you can see, the complexity is getting bigger and bigger.</span> <span data-start="379.3" data-end="382.6">Now my onserve to vent handler is getting extremely huge.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="382.6" data-end="386.43">I'm sure many of you can relate to this code.</span> <span data-start="386.43" data-end="390.64">Many of you will say yeah, some of my code looks like that.</span> <span data-start="390.64" data-end="391.8">Sure.</span> <span data-start="391.8" data-end="398.44">What if your boss comes to you and says we want the use tore be able to cancel the search,</span> <span data-start="398.44" data-end="400.95">because, you know, sometimes it takes too long.</span> <span data-start="400.95" data-end="403.67">Sometimes they want to search for something else.</span> <span data-start="403.67" data-end="406.78">That logic gets crazier.</span> <span data-start="406.78" data-end="408.22">I don't know if you can read that.</span> <span data-start="408.22" data-end="410.12">I'll zoom in for you.</span> <span data-start="410.12" data-end="417.58">But there's a lot of complexity in just one event handler.</span> <span data-start="417.58" data-end="422.16">You might know this as spaghetti code, where our code quickly gets unmanageable.</span> <span data-start="422.16" data-end="427.2">Some of you might see your engineers and think I don't do spaghetti code.</span> <span data-start="427.2" data-end="433.15">All of my code is modular and layered and separation of concerns.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="433.15" data-end="437.42">You might not write spaghetti code, but you might write lasagne code, which is spaghetti</span> <span data-start="437.42" data-end="440.46">code in layers.</span> <span data-start="440.46" data-end="442.63">This is called the bottomup approach.</span> <span data-start="442.63" data-end="450.889">That approach is whenever you have an event like onclick or on change, you do all of the</span> <span data-start="450.889" data-end="452.26">logic in that event.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="452.26" data-end="458.18">And that can refer to so many different actions, and some of those actions might change the</span> <span data-start="458.18" data-end="459.18">states.</span> <span data-start="459.18" data-end="465.24">But you have to choose which actions are executed, otherwise you might edit the state in a wrong</span> <span data-start="465.24" data-end="473.8">way, and you have to ad if statements.</span> <span data-start="473.8" data-end="476.24">There's a lot of downsides to this.</span> <span data-start="476.24" data-end="479.36">This bottomup code is difficult to test.</span> <span data-start="479.36" data-end="481.74">All the application logic lives in your mind.</span> <span data-start="481.74" data-end="486.55">So when you're writing your tests, you have to output it from the developer's mind on</span> <span data-start="486.55" data-end="487.55">to the tests.</span> <span data-start="487.55" data-end="490.78">And it makes it really hard to work with other developers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="490.78" data-end="492.86">The code is difficult to understand.</span> <span data-start="492.86" data-end="497.2">The code that I just showed you for showing and hiding the gallery, if you were to try</span> <span data-start="497.2" data-end="502.52">to parse that as a brandnew developer working on the project, you would find it really difficult</span> <span data-start="502.52" data-end="504.389">to do so.</span> <span data-start="504.389" data-end="508.65">The code will contain bugs, for sure, because there's going to be edge cases that you might</span> <span data-start="508.65" data-end="510.04">not have considered.</span> <span data-start="510.04" data-end="513.909">It will also be difficult to enhance, just like we've seen with cancellation.</span> <span data-start="513.909" data-end="518.749">And features, such as cancellation, make the code work.</span> <span data-start="518.749" data-end="525.81">They explode the potential possible states and actions that could happen in your application.</span> <span data-start="525.81" data-end="530.6">Here's an intuition for moving forward.</span> <span data-start="530.6" data-end="534.3">We have a realization that UI components are not independent.</span> <span data-start="534.3" data-end="539.889">We have frameworks that they isolate components and say these components fit in their nice</span> <span data-start="539.889" data-end="549.82">little box, and we can stick them in the page anywhere.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="549.82" data-end="555.05">Everything they see on the screen is in the exact same context, and we have to coordinate</span> <span data-start="555.05" data-end="557.74">from components to component.</span> <span data-start="557.74" data-end="562.601">So another realization is that actions, which is what happens when you do an event, are</span> <span data-start="562.601" data-end="570.61">based both on the events executed, and the current state of the context.</span> <span data-start="570.61" data-end="578.86">And it's also that this event action paradigm is too simple to represent all the possible</span> <span data-start="578.86" data-end="580.071">states our app can be in.</span> <span data-start="580.071" data-end="585.21">So, what's the solution?</span> <span data-start="585.21" data-end="587.79">Standard statecharts.</span> <span data-start="587.79" data-end="595.04">I know a lot of you may have heard these before or studied them in school.</span> <span data-start="595.04" data-end="600.009">Even though you might know what these are, you probably haven't applied them to user</span> <span data-start="600.009" data-end="603.529">interfaces and actual software.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="603.529" data-end="607.04">So, looking up material for this could be a little complicated.</span> <span data-start="607.04" data-end="616.579">I'm a visual person, and I'm going to do it in a very visual way.</span> <span data-start="616.579" data-end="620.3">First you have an initial state.</span> <span data-start="620.3" data-end="627.309">Then you have a finite number of states, which represents the states that the app could be</span> <span data-start="627.309" data-end="628.309">in.</span> <span data-start="628.309" data-end="632.93">When an app is in one state, it can't be in the other state at the same time.</span> <span data-start="632.93" data-end="639.259">You have a finite number of events, such as fetching, resolving, or rejecting a promise.</span> <span data-start="639.259" data-end="644.18">You have a mapping from state to state based on these events.</span> <span data-start="644.18" data-end="648.8">So for example, when you're fetching a promise and it resolves, you go to the fulfilled state.</span> <span data-start="648.8" data-end="652.36">And same way with reject and rejected state.</span> <span data-start="652.36" data-end="657.47">And you have a finite number of final states.</span> <span data-start="657.47" data-end="660.259">User interfaces can be continuous.</span> <span data-start="660.259" data-end="662.36">We could keep using them.</span> <span data-start="662.36" data-end="668.73">It doesn't say we're done, so go uninstall Instagram because you're not going to need</span> <span data-start="668.73" data-end="669.73">it.</span> <span data-start="669.73" data-end="676.439">If you go to this site, it's going to say promises are just a state machine.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="676.439" data-end="679.889">That should give you a big clue with what we're working with here.</span> <span data-start="679.889" data-end="684.939">So the original app that I showed you, the gallery app can be modelled as the state machine</span> <span data-start="684.939" data-end="686.129">right here.</span> <span data-start="686.129" data-end="689.42">So we start in the idle state, and then we go to search.</span> <span data-start="689.42" data-end="690.98">Then we're in the searching state.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="690.98" data-end="694.17">If we try to search again, it loops back.</span> <span data-start="694.17" data-end="695.3">It's like hold on.</span> <span data-start="695.3" data-end="696.8">We're already searching.</span> <span data-start="696.8" data-end="702.22">We can either resolve or reject the search results.</span> <span data-start="702.22" data-end="706.8">And from those two states, we could search again.</span> <span data-start="706.8" data-end="713.939">This is clearly seen by the arrows going from success or failure back to searching again.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="713.939" data-end="722.04">So, the machine that� the state machine that I envision looks sort of like this.</span> <span data-start="722.04" data-end="723.399">It's a JSON object.</span> <span data-start="723.399" data-end="729.49">I like JSON better than blackbox functions because you can enumerate all the possible</span> <span data-start="729.49" data-end="735.67">states and actions and be able to transition from one to the other with nice, simple function</span> <span data-start="735.67" data-end="736.7">right here.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1573.48" data-end="1581.23">In order to show you what I'm talking about, here is an example of a visualization tool.</span> <span data-start="1581.23" data-end="1586.9">That same JSON object that you passed into xstate and the same one I used for my gallery</span> <span data-start="1586.9" data-end="1598.5">app, this is one example of where you would use this.</span> <span data-start="1598.5" data-end="1605.28">My initial state is start, and I can hover over this search action, and go to this state.</span> <span data-start="1605.28" data-end="1610.57">Then I could see the possible different actions� sorry, events that I could take from this</span> <span data-start="1610.57" data-end="1611.57">state.</span> <span data-start="1611.57" data-end="1614.11">So let's say I have a search success.</span> <span data-start="1614.11" data-end="1616.77">And so, I go into the gallery view.</span> <span data-start="1616.77" data-end="1623.86">And then I choose to search again, or I could select a photo.</span> <span data-start="1623.86" data-end="1633.63">So, I can visually see what's happening in my state machine by pasting in that JSON object.</span> <span data-start="1633.63" data-end="1638.2">That's hard to do with just a function, so that's why I decided to do it in a more declarative</span> <span data-start="1638.2" data-end="1640.31">way.</span> <span data-start="1640.31" data-end="1642.38">I'm going to be releasing this soon.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1642.38" data-end="1647.81">I want you all to enjoy the rest of the conference before I release it, so you can have time</span> <span data-start="1647.81" data-end="1648.97">to play with it afterwards.</span> <span data-start="1648.97" data-end="1652.25">That's my excuse, at least.</span> <span data-start="1652.25" data-end="1658.68">It's not out yet.</span> <span data-start="1658.68" data-end="1666.22">Now, it would be, you know, sort of remiss of me to not talk about sort of the downsides</span> <span data-start="1666.22" data-end="1673.19">of state machines and statecharts, but the truth is that you all are already creating</span> <span data-start="1673.19" data-end="1677.58">finite state machines and statecharts in your app already, and you don't even know it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1677.58" data-end="1680.77">However, the ones that you're creating are implicit.</span> <span data-start="1680.77" data-end="1683.03">They're full of bugs.</span> <span data-start="1683.03" data-end="1685.03">They're incomplete.</span> <span data-start="1685.03" data-end="1690.25">And that's just the nature of how we code.</span> <span data-start="1690.25" data-end="1696.63">So the advantage of finite state machines and modeling them in a very explicit way is</span> <span data-start="1696.63" data-end="1703.49">that you reduce a lot of complexity up front just by getting rid of your if/else statements</span> <span data-start="1703.49" data-end="1707.6">and getting rid of your switch statements and having a direct mapping.</span> <span data-start="1707.6" data-end="1711.43">However, that quickly explodes into many, many different states.</span> <span data-start="1711.43" data-end="1717.15">So statecharts help manage that with a little higher complexity cost up front.</span> <span data-start="1717.15" data-end="1723.62">But in the long run, you will see it will be very easy to add features, remove features,</span> <span data-start="1723.62" data-end="1729.74">and handle different actions and different possible modes of your application.</span> <span data-start="1729.74" data-end="1735.63">So, of course, there's a lot of advantages to using statecharts, and the ones I am going</span> <span data-start="1735.63" data-end="1739.27">to quote are not actually from me.</span> <span data-start="1739.27" data-end="1741.24">They're from NASA.</span> <span data-start="1741.24" data-end="1748.11">A few years ago, NASA had to send this little vehicle right here all the way to Mars.</span> <span data-start="1748.11" data-end="1751.24">And they did so using statecharts.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1751.24" data-end="1756.27">So the advantages that they said was, first of all, there's visualized modeling.</span> <span data-start="1756.27" data-end="1763.65">So you could both model and examine the model of a state chart using visual tools.</span> <span data-start="1763.65" data-end="1769.31">You get these precise diagrams that tell you exactly what's going to happen when certain</span> <span data-start="1769.31" data-end="1773.4">conditions are met, when you're in a certain state, and this event happens.</span> <span data-start="1773.4" data-end="1778.08">When you're sending something to Mars, you can't exactly just send it there and hope</span> <span data-start="1778.08" data-end="1779.65">that it works, right?</span> <span data-start="1779.65" data-end="1785.8">You have to be absolutely sure that your billion dollar project is going to handle every single</span> <span data-start="1785.8" data-end="1788.24">possible state.</span> <span data-start="1788.24" data-end="1791.79">And so they also use state charts for automatic code generation.</span> <span data-start="1791.79" data-end="1796.93">I'm not a fan, but you could see how it could be beneficial.</span> <span data-start="1796.93" data-end="1799.97">Also, comprehensive test coverage.</span> <span data-start="1799.97" data-end="1806.47">By using state charts, they were able to generate just all of these integration tests where</span> <span data-start="1806.47" data-end="1811.87">they could test each and every one, and ensure that every single state was being hit, and</span> <span data-start="1811.87" data-end="1815.51">every single possible action or event was being handled.</span> <span data-start="1815.51" data-end="1822.61">Also, you know, being on a big project, you have a lot of requirement changes.</span> <span data-start="1822.61" data-end="1824.87">We want to add this to the rover.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1824.87" data-end="1827.22">We want to remove this functionality.</span> <span data-start="1827.22" data-end="1829.47">We want to change the way this works.</span> <span data-start="1829.47" data-end="1834.63">And when you're working on a big project, and you have these late breaking requirement</span> <span data-start="1834.63" data-end="1838.08">changes, then things can get really stressful.</span> <span data-start="1838.08" data-end="1843.07">With state charts, since you could clearly see the full flow of your application, you</span> <span data-start="1843.07" data-end="1848.67">could easily add and remove features without worrying what's going to break, what's going</span> <span data-start="1848.67" data-end="1853.25">to change, what's going to be affected.</span> <span data-start="1853.25" data-end="1855.76">So there are some disadvantages as well.</span> <span data-start="1855.76" data-end="1860.529">And the disadvantage is that my screen just went black.</span> <span data-start="1860.529" data-end="1863.98">I guess that means there are no disadvantages.</span> <span data-start="1863.98" data-end="1865.63">Ha ha.</span> <span data-start="1865.63" data-end="1866.63">Anyway..</span> <span data-start="1866.63" data-end="1871.61">Since the rest of my slides are forked, I want to show you this real quick.</span> <span data-start="1871.61" data-end="1876.58">I gave a talk about one and a half years ago.</span> <span data-start="1876.58" data-end="1880.34">It was at JSConf Iceland.</span> <span data-start="1880.34" data-end="1885.13">This is where I saw the primary use case for using state machines and statecharts.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1885.13" data-end="1894.53">There was this really complex UI design that I really wanted to model, and I found it pretty</span> <span data-start="1894.53" data-end="1899.16">difficult without using an explicit state machine or state chart.</span> <span data-start="1899.16" data-end="1904.25">So what I'm doing here, there's three different states.</span> <span data-start="1904.25" data-end="1905.809">This one.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1906.809" data-end="1908.62">And there's different actions as well.</span> <span data-start="1908.62" data-end="1914.08">So the user could pan right, but just a little bit.</span> <span data-start="1914.08" data-end="1921.08">So I handle that as a transition from going to state A, back to state A if they didn't</span> <span data-start="1921.08" data-end="1922.24">move far enough.</span> <span data-start="1922.24" data-end="1928.94">Of course, if they move far enough, it goes to the next state successfully.</span> <span data-start="1928.94" data-end="1934.13">And also, it handles, like, if I'm going up, and I decide to go left and right, it's not</span> <span data-start="1934.13" data-end="1938.809">going to do anything, because we're already going up and down.</span> <span data-start="1938.809" data-end="1943.99">So it knows when this event happens, don't try to go to a different state, because we're</span> <span data-start="1943.99" data-end="1952.57">already transitioning to one state.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1952.57" data-end="1956.63">I also wanted to mention two very good resources.</span> <span data-start="1956.63" data-end="1964.6">The first one is on spectrum.oi/statecharts.</span> <span data-start="1964.6" data-end="1969.65">This is a community where we talk about statecharts, their possible applications, and how they're</span> <span data-start="1969.65" data-end="1971.77">used everywhere.</span> <span data-start="1971.77" data-end="1974.8">Statecharts are nothing new.</span> <span data-start="1974.8" data-end="1978.55">They're invented by David Harel in 1987, which is what?</span> <span data-start="1978.55" data-end="1981">30 years ago?</span> <span data-start="1981" data-end="1983.02">This is not cuttingedge stuff.</span> <span data-start="1983.02" data-end="1987.68">If people are asking why aren't we using statecharts everywhere now?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1987.68" data-end="1993.97">Well, the thing is, they are in embedded systems or systems programming.</span> <span data-start="1993.97" data-end="1997.67">People do use statecharts in order to model their applications.</span> <span data-start="1997.67" data-end="2002.33">We don't, quite yet, but I think it's about time that we catch up to it.</span> <span data-start="2002.33" data-end="2012.6">And so, Eric Mogansen made a wonderful resource called the unfinished world of statecharts.</span> <span data-start="2012.6" data-end="2026.4">Over here, if you want to learn more information, there's a well wealth of information here.</span> <span data-start="2026.4" data-end="2034.14">I really want to encourage you to revisit your application and the way you think about</span> <span data-start="2034.14" data-end="2037.51">things, and actually try to visualize things.</span> <span data-start="2037.51" data-end="2043.49">You will see that by visualizing your application, all of its possible states, all the events</span> <span data-start="2043.49" data-end="2051.36">that could happen, that you're going to have a clearer representation of the possible bugs,</span> <span data-start="2051.36" data-end="2056.389">the possible features that you might have, the user improvements, and everything else.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2056.389" data-end="2058.72">So I want to thank you all for having me.</span> <span data-start="2058.72" data-end="2062.23">Unfortunately, I can't show you my last slide, because it's not working, but thank you.</span> </p>
