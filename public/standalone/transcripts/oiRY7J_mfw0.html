libraries yeah let's start by asking</span> <span data-start="94.59" data-end="97.439">the question what is going on okay we</span> <span data-start="97.439" data-end="99.78">numb genome is a group of people it's a</span> <span data-start="99.78" data-end="104.28">game it truly community-driven break it</span> <span data-start="104.28" data-end="109.77">has 11 years array almost and yeah it's</span> <span data-start="109.77" data-end="111.869">also a full featured desktop environment</span> <span data-start="111.869" data-end="115.979">air I'm going to ask you how many of you</span> <span data-start="115.979" data-end="120.39">have tried you know or have said of</span> <span data-start="120.39" data-end="124.61">course it will be easy</span> <span data-start="124.61" data-end="128.759">yes you can see in this light that's the</span> <span data-start="128.759" data-end="133.11">genome two in the those and this genome</span> <span data-start="133.11" data-end="134.94">free maybe you can see a clear</span> <span data-start="134.94" data-end="137.88">difference ok genome is also collection</span> <span data-start="137.88" data-end="139.71">of

bunch of</span> <span data-start="146.69" data-end="149.79">programs and libraries that has more</span> <span data-start="149.79" data-end="154.11">than 10 years of evolution and they have</span> <span data-start="154.11" data-end="157.56">been used in production for a lot of</span> <span data-start="157.56" data-end="163.26">time already yeah in Apple this year the</span> <span data-start="163.26" data-end="165.9">non-free was released it was the a very</span> <span data-start="165.9" data-end="168.81">important milestone for us there was a</span> <span data-start="168.81" data-end="170.73">lot of people working for a lot of time</span> <span data-start="170.73" data-end="179.63">on this and a the genome free include a</span> <span data-start="179.63" data-end="184.05">major breakthrough in several points for</span> <span data-start="184.05" data-end="185.7">example in this time we just revamped</span> <span data-start="185.7" data-end="188.01">everything we created a new user</span> <span data-start="188.01" data-end="191.07">experience we now use the new Howard</span> <span data-start="191.07" data-end="192.6">capabilities that we have in modern</span> <span data-start="192.6" data-end="196.17">computers and we really did a lot of</span> <span data-start="196.17" data-end="198.42">work clean up the stack here there was a</span> <span data-start="198.42" data-end="204.57">lot of the stuff was very it was very</span> <span data-start="204.57" data-end="206.79">full of things that we really didn't</span> <span data-start="206.79" data-end="211.26">need or we could really remove from the</span> <span data-start="211.26" data-end="216.15">stack make a genome simpler and yeah</span> <span data-start="216.15" data-end="219.63">also we use the genome shell and I said</span> <span data-start="219.63" data-end="221.489">we follow you you see experiencing you</span> <span data-start="221.489" data-end="225.44">know for this version beckenham shell</span> <span data-start="225.44" data-end="228.15">maybe some of you have seen it already</span> <span data-start="228.15" data-end="236.6">was just a I'm a full desktop experience</span> <span data-start="236.6" data-end="242.84">integrating compensating</span> <span data-start="242.85" data-end="250.01">okay loader or

data-end="489.689">you want to make it accessible in a</span> <span data-start="489.689" data-end="492.09">scriptable language you need to write a</span> <span data-start="492.09"

data-end="534.05">but very simple oops sorry about this i</span> <span data-start="534.05" data-end="536.459">will mention that this technology was</span> <span data-start="536.459" data-end="537.99">initially created by the start by a</span> <span data-start="537.99" data-end="540.87">startup called little that they wanted</span> <span data-start="540.87" data-end="542.959">to create a new user experience for the</span> <span data-start="542.959" data-end="546.36">vision of the device and they hired a</span> <span data-start="546.36" data-end="550.88">some of the very good genome hackers</span> <span data-start="550.88" data-end="553.29">from the genome community and they start</span> <span data-start="553.29" data-end="555.269">creating this ontology and NASA

picture of</span> <span data-start="587.27" data-end="589.37">what's going on here the only bit</span> <span data-start="589.37" data-end="591.98">missing is it is the label that says run</span> <span

to see it's 40</span> <span data-start="1743.85" data-end="1754.18">lines of code on in JavaScript yes but</span> <span data-start="1754.19" data-end="1760.279">it's demo one yeah so it's kind of the</span> <span data-start="1760.279" data-end="1763.61">same we have just trimmer which is this</span> <span data-start="1763.61" data-end="1765.98">line clutter we have clutter gstreamer</span>
