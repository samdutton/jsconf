once you want to turn</span> <span data-start="1552.519" data-end="1554.349">to SVG so you want to turn it into</span> <span data-start="1554.349" data-end="1556.239">grayscale that's that's perfectly

data-end="1634.629">in kind of the way of the dodo they're</span> <span data-start="1634.629" data-end="1636.639">not responsive they will grind these big</span> <span data-start="1636.639"

data-end="1654.219">can absolutely make responsive image</span> <span data-start="1654.219" data-end="1656.289">maps because you can make SVG responsive</span> <span data-start="1656.289" data-end="1657.909">or you can put an image bitmap image to</span> <span data-start="1657.909" data-end="1660.94">the background and that hotspot will</span> <span data-start="1660.94" data-end="1662.889">exactly scale with the image as it moves</span> <span data-start="1662.889" data-end="1666.419">up and down which is really neat</span> <span data-start="1666.419" data-end="1672.55">animated measurements using</span> <span data-start="1672.55" data-end="1676.51">clip areas you can clip out bitmap</span> <span data-start="1676.51" data-end="1679.75">photographs using parse and SVG you can</span> <span data-start="1679.75" data-end="1681.82">then again because it's perfect pixel</span> <span data-start="1681.82" data-end="1684.64">pixel perfect registration

data-end="1710.26">are the idea that you can do media</span> <span data-start="1710.26" data-end="1715.83">queries inside of SVG so a lot of</span> <span data-start="1715.83" data-end="1722.26">traditional kinds of use of SVG is in</span> <span data-start="1722.26" data-end="1724.27">responsive design is making things small</span> <span data-start="1724.27" data-end="1726.16">again nothing wrong with making things</span> <span data-start="1726.16" data-end="1728.62">smaller rearranging them placing them in</span> <span data-start="1728.62" data-end="1730.06">different orders that's perfectly fine</span> <span data-start="1730.06" data-end="1733.81">what's somewhat unexplored I think is</span> <span data-start="1733.81" data-end="1737.59">the concept of well we we don't just</span> <span data-start="1737.59" data-end="1740.11">need to make things smaller we could</span> <span data-start="1740.11" data-end="1743.64">also do things like as an example</span> <span data-start="1743.64" data-end="1748.15">starting to remove components and you</span> <span data-start="1748.15" data-end="1749.92">can remove components you can see the</span> <span data-start="1749.92" data-end="1752.62">top there you can see other components</span> <span data-start="1752.62" data-end="1755.74">moving outside of this because each</span> <span data-start="1755.74" data-end="1759.07">fragment is identifiable inside that SVG</span> <span data-start="1759.07" data-end="1761.8">so you can absolutely remove them using</span> <span data-start="1761.8" data-end="1765.4">media queries and simplify designs not</span> <span data-start="1765.4" data-end="1768.46">just say okay this thing has to get</span> <span data-start="1768.46" data-end="1770.44">smaller and not just saying oh we have</span> <span data-start="1770.44" data-end="1771.73">to switch to something else but</span> <span data-start="1771.73" data-end="1773.53">literally simplifying diagrams on</span> <span data-start="1773.53" data-end="1776.83">smaller screens simplifying tree</span> <span data-start="1776.83" data-end="1778.57">diagrams for instance on smaller screens</span> <span data-start="1778.57" data-end="1780.25">because you don't have the space no one</span> <span data-start="1780.25" data-end="1782.14">sort of zoom in/out it's all kinds of</span> <span data-start="1782.14" data-end="1784.95">really wonderful possibilities there</span> <span data-start="1784.95" data-end="1790.27">very finally the CSS spec for gradients</span> <span data-start="1790.27" data-end="1793.78">is meant to have animation it's meant to</span> <span data-start="1793.78" data-end="1794.38">do it</span> <span data-start="1794.38" data-end="1796.84">and fortunately it doesn't know no one</span> <span data-start="1796.84" data-end="1799.27">to my knowledge no one supports it yet</span> <span data-start="1799.27" data-end="1800.97">which is really really unfortunate</span> <span data-start="1800.97" data-end="1804.46">however SVG has supported animation</span> <span data-start="1804.46" data-end="1806.18">gradients for a</span> <span data-start="1806.18" data-end="1809.84">forever so you can start do really</span> <span data-start="1809.84" data-end="1813.38">really interesting work but this comes</span> <span data-start="1813.38" data-end="1819.98">up by animating the actual gradients you</span> <span data-start="1819.98" data-end="1824.54">have to use animate tags inside of SVG</span> <span data-start="1824.54" data-end="1828.11">and they're not too dissimilar to the</span> <span data-start="1828.11" data-end="1830.27">concept of transitions so it takes a</span> <span data-start="1830.27" data-end="1831.65">little bit again you see but it's not</span> <span data-start="1831.65" data-end="1833.36">too too terribly too simple</span> <span data-start="1833.36" data-end="1837.2">so you can finally this is a basic sky</span> <span data-start="1837.2" data-end="1839.93">24 hour Skype intermission you can</span> <span data-start="1839.93" data-end="1843.14">finally start to animate gradients which</span> <span data-start="1843.14" data-end="1846.08">is wonderful and there's a lot in there</span> <span data-start="1846.08" data-end="1847.94">but eventually of course this won't be</span> <span data-start="1847.94" data-end="1850.43">supported in CSS but if you need it</span> <span data-start="1850.43" data-end="1850.97">right now</span> <span data-start="1850.97" data-end="1852.86">and you you wanted to animate it great</span> <span data-start="1852.86" data-end="1856.82">in don't in SPG absolutely so that's all</span> <span data-start="1856.82" data-end="1859.48">the time I have I hope this was helpful</span> <span data-start="1859.48" data-end="1864.11">again if you have follow-up questions
