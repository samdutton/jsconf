<p><span data-start="37.59" data-end="40.15">it's really amazing to be able to speak</span> <span data-start="40.15" data-end="41.89">with you all today so thank you for the</span> <span data-start="41.89" data-end="45.31">opportunity this talk is really about</span> <span data-start="45.31" data-end="47.88">package management for the browser and</span> <span data-start="47.88" data-end="50.74">the reason why the focus is on es6</span> <span data-start="50.74" data-end="56.35">modules Israeli because they currently</span> <span data-start="56.35" data-end="58.96">been drafted into the es6 specification</span> <span data-start="58.96" data-end="63.61">and they're being reviewed right now so</span> <span data-start="63.61" data-end="68.17">it's it's something on the way and the</span> <span data-start="68.17" data-end="69.789">reason why I first got interested in es6</span> <span data-start="69.789" data-end="72.64">modules myself was because I got very</span> <span data-start="72.64" data-end="73.929">frustrated with the fact that we have</span> <span data-start="73.929" data-end="76.539">all these different module formats and</span> <span data-start="76.539" data-end="78.49">the common jeaious in global scripts I</span> <span data-start="78.49" data-end="80.17">just wanted to see if there was a way</span> <span data-start="80.17" data-end="82.149">that we could unify these and it's very</span> <span data-start="82.149" data-end="84.219">much something that es6 is bringing to</span> <span data-start="84.219" data-end="86.289">javascript through the specification</span> <span data-start="86.289" data-end="90.009">it's it's a specified module syntax and</span> <span data-start="90.009" data-end="93.31">it's it's built to support bridging the</span> <span data-start="93.31" data-end="94.78">different module formats we have today</span> <span data-start="94.78" data-end="99.009">so I've got a lot of hopes for that at</span> <span data-start="99.009" data-end="102.639">the same time in the process it's it's a</span> <span data-start="102.639" data-end="104.709">whole new way to reconsider what we what</span> <span data-start="104.709" data-end="106.149">we want to think about in terms of</span> <span data-start="106.149" data-end="109.45">package management for the browser so so</span> <span data-start="109.45" data-end="111.399">that's what really excites me about es6</span> <span data-start="111.399" data-end="114.49">modules at the moment the project I want</span> <span data-start="114.49" data-end="117.369">to show you is called JSP m and it's an</span> <span data-start="117.369" data-end="119.759">experimental project exploring what's</span> <span data-start="119.759" data-end="121.99">package management for the browser can</span> <span data-start="121.99" data-end="126.399">be and the the starting point for this</span> <span data-start="126.399" data-end="130.24">idea was let's look at a package manager</span> <span data-start="130.24" data-end="132.66">for the es6 module loader</span> <span data-start="132.66" data-end="134.55">think about where we want to package</span> <span data-start="134.55" data-end="136.98">management to be where it could be and</span> <span data-start="136.98" data-end="139.44">explore that and and the core package</span> <span data-start="139.44" data-end="140.64">might into an idea you want to start</span> <span data-start="140.64" data-end="142.44">with is that installing something you</span> <span data-start="142.44" data-end="144.66">should just do a one-line install and a</span> <span data-start="144.66" data-end="146.82">one-line require so anything more than</span> <span data-start="146.82" data-end="148.41">that and you've added unnecessary</span> <span data-start="148.41" data-end="151.95">complexity and I think the argument is</span> <span data-start="151.95" data-end="153.9">that to really get to that point where</span> <span data-start="153.9" data-end="155.67">you can have a single line required and</span> <span data-start="155.67" data-end="158.85">a single line install you need to have a</span> <span data-start="158.85" data-end="160.35">package manager that understands the</span> <span data-start="160.35" data-end="163.5">loader so by having a package manager</span> <span data-start="163.5" data-end="165">that knows how the loader behaves you</span> <span data-start="165" data-end="166.17">avoid all the problems around</span> <span data-start="166.17" data-end="169.5">configuration friction so that's the</span> <span data-start="169.5" data-end="174.65">really the core idea so so let's go into</span> <span data-start="174.65" data-end="176.76">the first thing we need is a module</span> <span data-start="176.76" data-end="178.65">loader so how can we actually start</span> <span data-start="178.65" data-end="181.74">using this es6 module loader today well</span> <span data-start="181.74" data-end="184.5">there's a polyfill called the ESX module</span> <span data-start="184.5" data-end="187.05">loader party votes on github and it's</span> <span data-start="187.05" data-end="189.27">it's a complete polyfill for the way</span> <span data-start="189.27" data-end="191.49">that the es6 module loader specification</span> <span data-start="191.49" data-end="195.36">is written right now so that actually</span> <span data-start="195.36" data-end="197.34">allows us to start working with es6</span> <span data-start="197.34" data-end="200.7">modules today in the browser and no J's</span> <span data-start="200.7" data-end="205.35">on the server it's a seven kilobyte</span> <span data-start="205.35" data-end="207.84">polyfill so it's actually suitable for</span> <span data-start="207.84" data-end="213.18">production so just to explain what it</span> <span data-start="213.18" data-end="215.64">does it obviously gives us support for</span> <span data-start="215.64" data-end="217.47">the module syntax like you can see here</span> <span data-start="217.47" data-end="221.52">and but the really key thing that the</span> <span data-start="221.52" data-end="223.05">spec authors have done is they've</span> <span data-start="223.05" data-end="227.54">created this module loader pipeline so</span> <span data-start="227.54" data-end="229.77">just to explain how it works a little</span> <span data-start="229.77" data-end="232.79">bit that they've they based it on this</span> <span data-start="232.79" data-end="237.72">extensible web principles and the idea</span> <span data-start="237.72" data-end="239.01">is that they've solved the really hard</span> <span data-start="239.01" data-end="242.31">problems around modules things like how</span> <span data-start="242.31" data-end="244.26">to deal with circular references how to</span> <span data-start="244.26" data-end="246.69">deal with interrupts between AMD and es6</span> <span data-start="246.69" data-end="249.06">and common J's but then they've they've</span> <span data-start="249.06" data-end="250.95">left the exact solutions to those</span> <span data-start="250.95" data-end="254.73">problems up to hooks in the spec so we</span> <span data-start="254.73" data-end="256.38">have these loader hooks normalized</span> <span data-start="256.38" data-end="258.62">located fetch translate instantiate and</span> <span data-start="258.62" data-end="260.79">most users don't come up against the</span> <span data-start="260.79" data-end="263.37">hook but but the point is that you can</span> <span data-start="263.37" data-end="265.16">construct</span> <span data-start="265.16" data-end="268.56">customized the es6 module loader with</span> <span data-start="268.56" data-end="270.9">with new functionality and and how to</span> <span data-start="270.9" data-end="273.87">interpret modules so for example if i if</span> <span data-start="273.87" data-end="276.24">i customize the fetch hook i can</span> <span data-start="276.24" data-end="278.55">customize how to fetch jquery in the</span> <span data-start="278.55" data-end="281.91">example above in the browser your fetch</span> <span data-start="281.91" data-end="284.58">hook would be an HTTP request get</span> <span data-start="284.58" data-end="287.31">request and in the on ojs it would be an</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="363.18" data-end="365.01">J's and and dealing with the edge cases</span> <span data-start="365.01" data-end="367.11">like things like circular references and</span> <span data-start="367.11" data-end="368.61">common J's circular references act</span> <span data-start="368.61" data-end="370.68">differently to MD circular references</span> <span data-start="370.68" data-end="374.55">and getting all that in as I say it's</span> <span data-start="374.55" data-end="376.83">it's it's very much what you would get</span> <span data-start="376.83" data-end="378.57">if you took in one of the existing AMD</span> <span data-start="378.57" data-end="380.88">loaders and rebuilt it on top of the cr6</span> <span data-start="380.88" data-end="382.17">hooks</span> <span data-start="382.17" data-end="384.27">it's got map it's got shim it's got a</span> <span data-start="384.27" data-end="387.89">plug-in system for asset loading and</span> <span data-start="387.89" data-end="389.76">bundles which was a new feature in</span> <span data-start="389.76" data-end="391.77">requires yes and then there's other</span> <span data-start="391.77" data-end="394.14">thing called versions which I explained</span> <span data-start="394.14" data-end="397.05">a bit more later</span> <span data-start="397.06" data-end="400.43">so yeah this is system dis it's a it's a</span> <span data-start="400.43" data-end="402.35">seven killer by minified and gzip</span> <span data-start="402.35" data-end="403.97">project so together with the module</span> <span data-start="403.97" data-end="405.71">loader you're getting 14 kilobytes in</span> <span data-start="405.71" data-end="407.03">production you've actually got this</span> <span data-start="407.03" data-end="409.79">dynamic loader based on the technologies</span> <span data-start="409.79" data-end="412.1">that are specified for the loader in the</span> <span data-start="412.1" data-end="414.02">future that we can use today through</span> <span data-start="414.02" data-end="417.71">these polyfill techniques so that's the</span> <span data-start="417.71" data-end="420.35">lowdown the other side of it now is</span> <span data-start="420.35" data-end="422.09">package management so if you've got this</span> <span data-start="422.09" data-end="424.19">loader can we create a package manager</span> <span data-start="424.19" data-end="426.139">to really simplify the process of using</span> <span data-start="426.139" data-end="429.02">it and the first thing I want to think</span> <span data-start="429.02" data-end="430.4">about is the sort of time scale you're</span> <span data-start="430.4" data-end="433.51">looking at four years six is actually</span> <span data-start="433.51" data-end="438.05">very similar time scale to HTTP two and</span> <span data-start="438.05" data-end="441.5">and widespread speedy and HTTP 2 so you</span> <span data-start="441.5" data-end="444.56">actually in this kind of thinking</span> <span data-start="444.56" data-end="447.53">bundling is an anti-pattern we want to</span> <span data-start="447.53" data-end="449.39">be thinking beyond bundling and and</span> <span data-start="449.39" data-end="450.53">that's there's a good reason why</span> <span data-start="450.53" data-end="453.29">bundling isn't catered for in the es6</span> <span data-start="453.29" data-end="457.61">specifc specification because it's it's</span> <span data-start="457.61" data-end="458.75">it's something we're actually going to</span> <span data-start="458.75" data-end="460.7">move away from over time and yes it will</span> <span data-start="460.7" data-end="462.59">be a while still it'll be a few years</span> <span data-start="462.59" data-end="466.6">but in that's where we want to be and</span> <span data-start="466.6" data-end="468.65">not only will that make our build</span> <span data-start="468.65" data-end="471.5">simpler but the other benefit you get is</span> <span data-start="471.5" data-end="474.8">fine grained caching so if you have a</span> <span data-start="474.8" data-end="476.27">large application you have a build of</span> <span data-start="476.27" data-end="479.51">that application you have to resend a</span> <span data-start="479.51" data-end="481.789">lot of assets again just when you make a</span> <span data-start="481.789" data-end="483.56">minor change if you can have fine grain</span> <span data-start="483.56" data-end="486.95">caching with version URLs you can just</span> <span data-start="486.95" data-end="488.51">update the versions that have changed</span> <span data-start="488.51" data-end="491.27">and the other assets remain in the cache</span> <span data-start="491.27" data-end="493.84">of your users so it is much less</span> <span data-start="493.84" data-end="497.93">redownload in you do upgrades but in</span> <span data-start="497.93" data-end="499.52">order to properly take advantage of this</span> <span data-start="499.52" data-end="502.61">we want to allow unique version URLs you</span> <span data-start="502.61" data-end="504.44">want to have a node modules folder that</span> <span data-start="504.44" data-end="506.9">you can drag onto your CDN host it as</span> <span data-start="506.9" data-end="509.27">your static assets but have those URLs</span> <span data-start="509.27" data-end="511.789">versioned so that your users can get</span> <span data-start="511.789" data-end="514.039">them cached and you can just update the</span> <span data-start="514.039" data-end="517.76">versions and the URLs and then and then</span> <span data-start="517.76" data-end="519.469">the real high problem around package</span> <span data-start="519.469" data-end="522.08">management is is obviously the</span> <span data-start="522.08" data-end="523.839">dependency management principles and</span> <span data-start="523.839" data-end="527.839">it's not enough to just assume that you</span> <span data-start="527.839" data-end="529.279">can solve every version count</span> <span data-start="529.279" data-end="530.689">you will reach a point where you have</span> <span data-start="530.689" data-end="532.279">two dependencies that you've loaded into</span> <span data-start="532.279" data-end="536.089">the page and they're both dependent on</span> <span data-start="536.089" data-end="537.74">another dependency but they need</span> <span data-start="537.74" data-end="539.48">different versions of it and you have a</span> <span data-start="539.48" data-end="541.73">version conflict and when that happens</span> <span data-start="541.73" data-end="544.939">what are you going to do you can't let</span> <span data-start="544.939" data-end="546.92">that break down the entire workflow if</span> <span data-start="546.92" data-end="549.199">you really want to get a proper package</span> <span data-start="549.199" data-end="550.519">manager going you need to be able to</span> <span data-start="550.519" data-end="552.8">deal with version conflicts and and the</span> <span data-start="552.8" data-end="554.209">way to do that is to have the multi</span> <span data-start="554.209" data-end="555.559">version support you have to be able to</span> <span data-start="555.559" data-end="557.48">run two versions of the same library at</span> <span data-start="557.48" data-end="559.97">the same time and then as much as</span> <span data-start="559.97" data-end="562.279">possible minimise that duplication so we</span> <span data-start="562.279" data-end="563.87">know the range is that every package is</span> <span data-start="563.87" data-end="566.24">allowed to be installed in two and then</span> <span data-start="566.24"

data-end="1802.509">names and that's how you can easily do</span> <span data-start="1802.509" data-end="1805.269">the multi version stuff we've got quite</span> <span data-start="1805.269" data-end="1806.98">a deep tree now because I installed all</span> <span data-start="1806.98" data-end="1810.909">that stuff from NPM and then at the very</span> <span data-start="1810.909" data-end="1813.999">bottom we've got this versions and this</span> <span data-start="1813.999" data-end="1816.19">is the final version solution currently</span> <span data-start="1816.19" data-end="1818.879">for everything every package in the page</span> <span data-start="1818.879" data-end="1822.039">so we can see every version and there's</span> <span data-start="1822.039" data-end="1824.11">actually when I installed from this NPM</span> <span data-start="1824.11" data-end="1826.119">module it created a few version folks</span> <span data-start="1826.119" data-end="1828.82">that come up as arrays in the version</span> <span data-start="1828.82" data-end="1832.119">map so for example geo shader we're</span> <span data-start="1832.119"

data-end="1838.6">in the page I don't want to be doing</span> <span data-start="1838.6" data-end="1840.759">that so what I can do is I can check</span> <span data-start="1840.759" data-end="1842.409">this configuration file into version</span> <span data-start="1842.409" data-end="1845.049">control there is no state in the JSP and</span> <span data-start="1845.049" data-end="1846.85">packages folder there's no information</span> <span data-start="1846.85" data-end="1848.71">about versions in there it's it's a</span> <span data-start="1848.71" data-end="1851.71">universal kind of property and I can</span> <span data-start="1851.71" data-end="1854.019">just modify this this versions config</span> <span data-start="1854.019" data-end="1855.429">here and say I actually just want to be</span> <span data-start="1855.429" data-end="1859.749">using GL shader version or point 0.6 and</span> <span data-start="1859.749" data-end="1861.759">this is how I can go through and</span> <span data-start="1861.759" data-end="1864.539">manually manipulate my own version tree</span> <span data-start="1864.539" data-end="1866.74">the problem is I'm going to now have</span> <span data-start="1866.74" data-end="1869.499">some unfulfilled dependencies so I'm</span> <span data-start="1869.499" data-end="1870.999">just going to search through them the</span> <span data-start="1870.999" data-end="1873.07">dependency map and see what is using</span> <span data-start="1873.07" data-end="1876.519">version or point 0.5 that I saw that I</span> <span data-start="1876.519" data-end="1878.559">can remove it so here's the first thing</span> <span data-start="1878.559" data-end="1881.11">that's using GL shader is calling it by</span> <span data-start="1881.11" data-end="1883.059">named Yoshida and actually getting this</span> <span data-start="1883.059" data-end="1886.299">full version no point 0.6 where's the</span> <span data-start="1886.299" data-end="1891.059">next one here so NPM error shader is</span> <span data-start="1891.059" data-end="1894.46">actually using GL shader compatible with</span> <span data-start="1894.46" data-end="1898.09">version or point 0.5 and that's what was</span> <span data-start="1898.09" data-end="1900.759">causing us to need to fork and run the</span> <span data-start="1900.759" data-end="1902.23">second version so I'm just going to</span> <span data-start="1902.23" data-end="1905.049">update this here to no point 0.6</span> <span data-start="1905.049" data-end="1906.46">we can now check that into version</span> <span data-start="1906.46" data-end="1908.77">control and that's a version up</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1908.77" data-end="1910.39">I've changed the dependencies sub</span> <span data-start="1910.39" data-end="1913.15">dependency but because the full version</span> <span data-start="1913.15" data-end="1916.12">manifest is in one place I can have</span> <span data-start="1916.12" data-end="1918.82">final say over that so I'm just going to</span> <span data-start="1918.82" data-end="1920.86">rerun the page one more time we're now</span> <span data-start="1920.86" data-end="1922.99">running just that no point 0.6 version</span> <span data-start="1922.99" data-end="1925.09">we've resolved the fork and then I can</span> <span data-start="1925.09" data-end="1926.32">now test it and see if it's still</span> <span data-start="1926.32" data-end="1928.72">working and it is so we know that that's</span> <span data-start="1928.72" data-end="1930.88">worked and that's how I can have full</span> <span data-start="1930.88" data-end="1934.99">control over the dependency tree so now</span> <span data-start="1934.99" data-end="1937.75">I want to bundle this for production so</span> <span data-start="1937.75" data-end="1939.01">I'm just going to do JSP and bundle</span> <span data-start="1939.01" data-end="1942.79">again and the same name so the name that</span> <span data-start="1942.79" data-end="1943.99">I'm writing here will still go through</span> <span data-start="1943.99" data-end="1947.02">all those map config things and etc and</span> <span data-start="1947.02" data-end="1951.46">let's call this voxel bundle J's so that</span> <span data-start="1951.46" data-end="1953.29">creates a full bundle like a browserify</span> <span data-start="1953.29" data-end="1956.47">bundle but we only want to load this in</span> <span data-start="1956.47" data-end="1959.02">the page so someone might never click</span> <span data-start="1959.02" data-end="1960.61">that button you know it might be a</span> <span data-start="1960.61" data-end="1962.41">pop-up that features new functionality</span> <span data-start="1962.41" data-end="1965.71">or something so you might not want to</span> <span data-start="1965.71" data-end="1968.14">load everything up front I just want a</span> <span data-start="1968.14" data-end="1969.76">load in that new functionality when</span> <span data-start="1969.76" data-end="1972.7">someone clicks the button so what we can</span> <span data-start="1972.7" data-end="1974.47">do for that is something called bundles</span> <span data-start="1974.47" data-end="1979.75">config and it's it's a feature in</span> <span data-start="1979.75" data-end="1982.84">require.js today so again I didn't</span> <span data-start="1982.84" data-end="1986.62">invent it at all so we call this box</span> <span data-start="1986.62" data-end="1989.4">whole bundle was that the name I gave it</span> <span data-start="1989.4" data-end="1993.07">yes so the local name I would type</span> <span data-start="1993.07" data-end="1995.26">import voxel bundle to load that bundle</span> <span data-start="1995.26" data-end="1997.78">so I used that name and now I can say</span> <span data-start="1997.78" data-end="1999.91">what the bundle contains so what modules</span> <span data-start="1999.91" data-end="2003.33">are inside the bundle and what that</span> <span data-start="2003.33" data-end="2005.16">means is anytime I request one of these</span> <span data-start="2005.16" data-end="2006.99">modules that upfront has been declared</span> <span data-start="2006.99" data-end="2009.06">as belonging to the bundle it'll make</span> <span data-start="2009.06" data-end="2010.44">sure it's loading from that single</span> <span data-start="2010.44" data-end="2013.14">bundle I have to now enter in fully</span> <span data-start="2013.14" data-end="2015.21">normalized names because bundles contain</span> <span data-start="2015.21" data-end="2018.66">normalized module names so I'm going to</span> <span data-start="2018.66" data-end="2022.47">load in nor point 1.0 so voxel demo nor</span> <span data-start="2022.47" data-end="2024.54">point 1.0 is contained within this</span> <span data-start="2024.54" data-end="2026.46">bundle if there were other things like</span> <span data-start="2026.46" data-end="2028.59">if I put jQuery into that bundle I could</span> <span data-start="2028.59" data-end="2031.05">also add it to this list so as soon as</span> <span data-start="2031.05" data-end="2032.49">there's a requester it will go to the</span> <span data-start="2032.49" data-end="2036.33">bundle and with some luck I think that</span> <span data-start="2036.33" data-end="2037.56">should do it now</span> <span data-start="2037.56" data-end="2040.77">so if you look at the network tab we</span> <span data-start="2040.77" data-end="2042.93">load the initial page with our app build</span> <span data-start="2042.93" data-end="2045.45">that we did just now and when I click on</span> <span data-start="2045.45" data-end="2049.94">the new functionality it it didn't work</span> <span data-start="2049.94" data-end="2054.659">so why didn't that work I think it's no</span> <span data-start="2054.659" data-end="2057.87">point 0.1 so you do have to get the</span> <span data-start="2057.87" data-end="2064.29">exact name and exact version right all</span> <span data-start="2064.29" data-end="2067.56">right so when I click the button it just</span> <span data-start="2067.56" data-end="2069.72">loads that single bundle if you can see</span> <span data-start="2069.72" data-end="2072.96">it on in the network tab there and it's</span> <span data-start="2072.96" data-end="2074.63">then just like a browserify</span> <span data-start="2074.63" data-end="2077.76">bundle loading the full common J's tree</span> <span data-start="2077.76" data-end="2081.659">from within that so yeah that's it</span> <span data-start="2081.659" data-end="2084.659">that's pretty much what there is — it's</span> <span data-start="2084.659" data-end="2086.52">it allows you to kind of package manage</span> <span data-start="2086.52" data-end="2090.179">your existing modules today and and</span> <span data-start="2090.179" data-end="2091.23">bundle them up with these kind of</span> <span data-start="2091.23" data-end="2095.02">workflows using any a6 module loader</span> <span data-start="2095.03" data-end="2097.41">right and then there's one other thing I</span> <span data-start="2097.41" data-end="2098.76">want to talk about which is how we</span> <span data-start="2098.76" data-end="2100.89">looking at the future workflows of HTTP</span> <span data-start="2100.89" data-end="2103.5">- so I said at the beginning bundling is</span> <span data-start="2103.5" data-end="2105.69">actually an anti-pattern it's it's it's</span> <span data-start="2105.69" data-end="2106.59">something that we're going to be moving</span> <span data-start="2106.59" data-end="2109.59">away from how can this work when we're</span> <span data-start="2109.59" data-end="2110.88">actually going to be looking beyond</span> <span data-start="2110.88" data-end="2113.9">bundling and one way we can do this is</span> <span data-start="2113.9" data-end="2116.76">we basically take that JSP in packages</span> <span data-start="2116.76" data-end="2119.55">folder host it on your local assets</span> <span data-start="2119.55" data-end="2123">server and put that into production</span> <span data-start="2123" data-end="2126.72">effectively and because of the fact that</span> <span data-start="2126.72" data-end="2129.45">the the files of versioned you get</span> <span data-start="2129.45" data-end="2131.33">everything running through that and</span> <span data-start="2131.33" data-end="2134.16">there is actually a CDN set up as well</span> <span data-start="2134.16" data-end="2135.69">so you can actually run directly through</span> <span data-start="2135.69" data-end="2138.81">that and and that core thing is that the</span> <span data-start="2138.81" data-end="2141.48">config manages your full dependency tree</span> <span data-start="2141.48" data-end="2146.28">and the exact resolutions right so</span> <span data-start="2146.28" data-end="2150.18">that's it some of the next things I want</span> <span data-start="2150.18" data-end="2152.87">to work on include conditional loading</span> <span data-start="2152.87" data-end="2158.19">for example in reality I wouldn't just</span> <span data-start="2158.19" data-end="2160.47">load a web component I would want to do</span> <span data-start="2160.47" data-end="2162.93">a conditional check on my environment to</span> <span data-start="2162.93" data-end="2164.52">check that the environment supports web</span> <span data-start="2164.52" data-end="2166.98">components if it doesn't load a polyfill</span> <span data-start="2166.98" data-end="2169.95">and have that conditional loading baked</span> <span data-start="2169.95" data-end="2170.76">into the module</span> <span data-start="2170.76" data-end="2173.67">system itself and then to look at builds</span> <span data-start="2173.67" data-end="2174.98">around it and also thinking about</span> <span data-start="2174.98" data-end="2177.57">internationalized builds and how you can</span> <span data-start="2177.57" data-end="2180.63">do builds around different languages and</span> <span data-start="2180.63" data-end="2182.52">mobile build tooling for plugins as well</span> <span data-start="2182.52" data-end="2184.14">so this look at the kind of things that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2184.14" data-end="2189.63">I'd really like to work on next yeah so</span> <span data-start="2189.63" data-end="2190.5">that's it</span> <span data-start="2190.5" data-end="2193.86">the I'm not telling you all to go off</span> <span data-start="2193.86" data-end="2196.38">and start writing years six web</span> <span data-start="2196.38" data-end="2199.94">components what it's really about is</span> <span data-start="2199.94" data-end="2202.68">focusing on an approach that can be</span> <span data-start="2202.68" data-end="2204.18">based on the ideas of year six and you</span> <span data-start="2204.18" data-end="2206.55">can use it for AMD common J's and</span> <span data-start="2206.55" data-end="2210.84">existing workflows today and I mean the</span> <span data-start="2210.84" data-end="2214.71">real path to es6 is it is much more</span> <span data-start="2214.71" data-end="2217.08">nuanced than than just using these kind</span> <span data-start="2217.08" data-end="2220.32">of approaches but by basing the by</span> <span data-start="2220.32" data-end="2221.91">basing ourselves on these approaches we</span> <span data-start="2221.91" data-end="2225.12">can we can find a stable workflow that</span> <span data-start="2225.12" data-end="2226.65">can that can make package management</span> <span data-start="2226.65" data-end="2229.59">really easy and that's that so yeah</span> <span data-start="2229.59" data-end="2230.94">check out the projects let me know what</span> <span data-start="2230.94" data-end="2232.26">you think if you like it if you hate it</span> <span data-start="2232.26" data-end="2233.94">are we great to hear so thanks so much</span> </p>
