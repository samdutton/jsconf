function which is called pixel eyes</span> <span data-start="552.03" data-end="554.55">and we need to map yet because again the</span> <span data-start="554.55" data-end="557.49">heart map is inside

<p><span data-start="595.98" data-end="599.1">Hart after setup in there I'm going to</span> <span data-start="599.1" data-end="601.11">give this an outline so I can debug this</span> <span

you want to use this within our game</span> <span data-start="612.36" data-end="614.79">itself it has to take up some space so</span> <span data-start="614.79" data-end="616.71">first I want to give a special relative</span> <span data-start="616.71" data-end="621.81">oh and I then want to give it a width</span> <span data-start="621.81" data-end="623.04">and height and I'm going to be using</span> <span data-start="623.04" data-end="624.57">that based on the size that we've</span> <span data-start="624.57" data-end="626.07">dynamically created in this nature</span> <span data-start="626.07" data-end="628.38">because we can also set the size so I'm</span> <span data-start="628.38" data-end="631.92">going to give it a height and the height</span> <span data-start="631.92" data-end="633.66">again is the length that matrix times</span> <span data-start="633.66" data-end="636.24">the size so get the pixel size and</span> <span data-start="636.24" data-end="638.25">multiply it by the length of that matrix</span> <span data-start="638.25" data-end="640.98">and in this case the matrix is map get</span> <span data-start="640.98" data-end="643.589">pixel art Hart copy that paste it in</span> <span data-start="643.589" data-end="647.04">there and then height the width is going</span> <span data-start="647.04" data-end="648.69">to be the length of one of those columns</span> <span data-start="648.69" data-end="650.46">so since we're out inside that loop</span> <span data-start="650.46" data-end="653.31">again we can get the size and the length</span> <span data-start="653.31" data-end="655.47">of just one of those columns so we're</span> <span data-start="655.47" data-end="657.21">going to have to map get one of them and</span> <span data-start="657.21" data-end="660.18">use that nth value again to say ends of</span> <span data-start="660.18" data-end="663.33">this matrix and the first column because</span> <span data-start="663.33" data-end="667.02">why not so say that and it is now</span> <span data-start="667.02" data-end="669.3">properly placed but you can see that</span> <span data-start="669.3" data-end="670.86">it's shifted over and the reason why is</span> <span data-start="670.86" data-end="672.72">because black shadow starts at the</span> <span data-start="672.72" data-end="674.85">bottom right corner of the div it starts</span> <span data-start="674.85" data-end="676.38">at the end of it so now we have to shift</span> <span data-start="676.38" data-end="679.02">this up so we can say top of negative</span> <span data-start="679.02" data-end="682.32">size maybe left of negative size and</span> <span data-start="682.32" data-end="684.9">boom our heart is placed inside of the</span> <span data-start="684.9" data-end="687.959">div as we expected based on this

data-start="694.4" data-end="700.08">we can then take this idea and open</span> <span data-start="700.08" data-end="703.17">something like I have a character's SCSS</span> <span data-start="703.17" data-end="705.75">where I already did this and I'm going</span> <span data-start="705.75" data-end="707.73">to just uncomment and zoom out of here</span> <span data-start="707.73" data-end="710.82">so you can see what the characters</span> <span data-start="710.82" data-end="713.55">actually look like my vision is forever</span> <span data-start="713.55" data-end="715.92">ruined but it's fine</span> <span data-start="715.92" data-end="717.31">so if I</span> <span data-start="717.31" data-end="719.41">save this and then I open I have a</span> <span data-start="719.41" data-end="722.86">characters file you can see all the</span> <span data-start="722.86" data-end="724.42">characters have appeared out of this</span> <span data-start="724.42" data-end="726.01">generated map and you can dynamically</span> <span data-start="726.01" data-end="728.47">change the colors so like if I wanted to</span> <span data-start="728.47" data-end="731.11">go into here and I wanted to change all</span> <span data-start="731.11" data-end="735.25">of the black to like a red because why</span> <span data-start="735.25" data-end="737.65">not once I save this instantly it'll all</span> <span data-start="737.65" data-end="739.33">change so you can just create this art</span> <span data-start="739.33" data-end="741.37">dynamically in your browser and it's</span> <span data-start="741.37" data-end="743.38">really fun to play with you can also</span> <span data-start="743.38" data-end="745.54">animate this if you're a masochist</span> <span data-start="745.54" data-end="747.19">and want to make your browser run really</span> <span data-start="747.19"

next thing we</span> <span data-start="753.79" data-end="756.13">want to do is keep some score we have</span> <span data-start="756.13" data-end="757.63">our characters but we don't really have</span> <span data-start="757.63" data-end="760.6">our game set so we have to create like</span> <span data-start="760.6" data-end="763.75">our entire game area in here we're going</span> <span
