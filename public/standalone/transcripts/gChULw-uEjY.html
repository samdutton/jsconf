<p><span data-start="12.139" data-end="16.47"Audience member: Hello, JSConf holy Cow!</span> <span data-start="16.47" data-end="19.359">There are so many of you.</span> <span data-start="19.359" data-end="24.789">This is the biggest conference I've ever been to, and it is also, I'm embarrassed to say,</span> <span data-start="24.789" data-end="27.48">this is my first JSConf EU.</span> <span data-start="27.48" data-end="33.39">I kept trying to come but I had immigration issues and all sorts of stuff, and I made</span> <span data-start="33.39" data-end="35.78">it just in lime for the last one.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="35.78" data-end="42.5">I'm extra specially thrilled to be here and be invited to speak, but before we get started,</span> <span data-start="42.5" data-end="48.16">the way that I don't die of nervousness is I always take a speaker selfie, but there</span> <span data-start="48.16" data-end="53.309">are millions of you, so I'm going to take a bunch.</span> <span data-start="53.309" data-end="54.95">Look happy!</span> <span data-start="54.95" data-end="58.289">Like you just heard the best talk of your life!</span> <span data-start="58.289" data-end="59.62">Amazing.</span> <span data-start="59.62" data-end="62.28">All right.</span> <span data-start="62.28" data-end="67.09">With that important business out of the way, hello, everybody, I'm Laurie.</span> <span data-start="67.09" data-end="73.31">I'm one of the co-founders of npm Inc, one of the chief data officers there, but what</span> <span data-start="73.31" data-end="79.82">I really am is a web developer, making the web bigger, and better, and more accessible</span> <span data-start="79.82" data-end="86.68">to everyone is what drives me, and it's been driving me for 23 years now, which means sometimes</span> <span data-start="86.68" data-end="91.5">I meet people who are younger than my web development career!</span> <span data-start="91.5" data-end="92.71">Which is weird.</span> <span data-start="92.71" data-end="97.03">And, today, I'm here to talk about JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="97.03" data-end="100.93">I'm going to talk about who we are, the people who write JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="100.93" data-end="106.94">I'm talking about where we use JavaScript, and what we are doing with it today, and also</span> <span data-start="106.94" data-end="111.369">I'm going to talk about why, the forces that are driving us to the state that we are in</span> <span data-start="111.369" data-end="112.509">right now.</span> <span data-start="112.509" data-end="115.95">Finally, I'm going to talk about what comes next.</span> <span data-start="115.95" data-end="120.35">Looking at current trends, and guessing where they're going.</span> <span data-start="120.35" data-end="126.61">The goal of this talk is to give you a sense of perspective about the state of JavaScript</span> <span data-start="126.61" data-end="129.94">as a whole and where you sit in it.</span> <span data-start="129.94" data-end="137.48">So many developers work in a vacuum, not knowing whether it is best practice, a fad, or this</span> <span data-start="137.48" data-end="141.73">hopelessly out-of-date thing that nobody does any more.</span> <span data-start="141.73" data-end="147.01">I hope you leave this talk knowing the one thing you're using is a really good thing</span> <span data-start="147.01" data-end="153.22">with feeling that you should move away from one thing that you're using, and also excited</span> <span data-start="153.22" data-end="157.16">about learning one new thing that you hadn't heard about or you hadn't decided to get into</span> <span data-start="157.16" data-end="159.51">before.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="159.51" data-end="162.39">But before I say all of that stuff, it's worth asking how I know?</span> <span data-start="162.39" data-end="164.53">Where did I get all of this information?</span> <span data-start="164.53" data-end="168.15">We have three main sources for the stuff I'm about to present.</span> <span data-start="168.15" data-end="171.97">The first is the npm registry statistics.</span> <span data-start="171.97" data-end="176.6">The npm registry contains amazing data about what JavaScript developers are up to and what</span> <span data-start="176.6" data-end="180.12">they're using, and we also did a survey.</span> <span data-start="180.12" data-end="186.09">Our first annual survey got 1,600 responses, and our second got 33,000 responses.</span> <span data-start="186.09" data-end="189.879">We have an enormous amount of information of people telling us what you're up to and</span> <span data-start="189.879" data-end="191.34">why you're doing it.</span> <span data-start="191.34" data-end="196.11">I also supplemented and double-checked our numbers using the excellent State of JavaScript</span> <span data-start="196.11" data-end="197.97">Survey run by the community.</span> <span data-start="197.97" data-end="207.6">I also have one final surprise source which is ten years of JSConf EU talk proposals!</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="207.6" data-end="208.6">Ten years!</span> <span data-start="208.6" data-end="209.6">My goodness.</span> <span data-start="209.6" data-end="210.6">That is so much work.</span> <span data-start="210.6" data-end="215.55">Can we have another round of applause for ten years?</span> <span data-start="215.55" data-end="218.78">[Applause].</span> <span data-start="218.78" data-end="224.989">As part of the celebration of the tenth year of JSConf EU, the organisers asked me to analyse</span> <span data-start="224.989" data-end="225.989">the data.</span> <span data-start="225.989" data-end="229.95">They gave me all of the titles and descriptions of all of the talks that have ever been submitted</span> <span data-start="229.95" data-end="234.55">to JSConf EU and they asked could I find something interesting in this?</span> <span data-start="234.55" data-end="237.4">Boy, I found interesting things in this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="237.4" data-end="241.82">First off, there are so many talks this year.</span> <span data-start="241.82" data-end="251.599">The first JSConf EU had 44 talks submitted, and this year, there were 932.</span> <span data-start="251.599" data-end="262.03">In 2012, someone had the bright idea that someone submit their talks at JSON which was</span> <span data-start="262.03" data-end="268.06">a goddamned nightmare to parse back into text and sentences, so thank you whose ever bright</span> <span data-start="268.06" data-end="271.21">idea that was.</span> <span data-start="271.21" data-end="282.6">The single most common phrase in the last ten years has been "in this talk we will ..", and</span> <span data-start="282.6" data-end="290.719">the second most common phrase was "learn how to", and sometimes, it was both.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="290.719" data-end="296.76">But there's something much more interesting which is the JSConf hype meter.</span> <span data-start="296.76" data-end="305.52">I wanted to track how popular various technologies were, and technologies get mentioned more</span> <span data-start="305.52" data-end="306.72">and more often.</span> <span data-start="306.72" data-end="308.89">Everything is going up and to the right.</span> <span data-start="308.89" data-end="315.02">Instead, I measured how many talks contain a word as a percentage of all of the talks</span> <span data-start="315.02" data-end="316.33">submitted.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="316.33" data-end="319.409">This is an example one before it's of Node and npm.</span> <span data-start="319.409" data-end="324.58">We're talking about Node last time much less than we used to but talking about npm about</span> <span data-start="324.58" data-end="327.82">as much as the same as we ever did.</span> <span data-start="327.82" data-end="333.82">All through this talk, I will weave in the JSConf data and if what we are talking about</span> <span data-start="333.82" data-end="336.79">lines up with the reality of what we're doing.</span> <span data-start="336.79" data-end="343.13">But, l Laurie, you had a huge corpus of text.</span> <span data-start="343.13" data-end="345.849">You could have built a markup generate colour.</span> <span data-start="345.849" data-end="349.51">You bet your ass I built up a markup generator.</span> <span data-start="349.51" data-end="358.52">Here is a machine-generate the titles based on past submissions to use for your future</span> <span data-start="358.52" data-end="360.74">consequences.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="360.74" data-end="364.35">Train your next-level sequential arts.</span> <span data-start="364.35" data-end="370.68">This is definitely going to be done by Jenn Schiffer.</span> <span data-start="370.68" data-end="372.55">Talk about tools for capitalism!</span> <span data-start="372.55" data-end="378.31">I think it's possible that CJ has already written this talk!</span> <span data-start="378.31" data-end="381.36">Distributed computing in the world of CSS and JS.</span> <span data-start="381.36" data-end="384.43">It is possible they did this yesterday!</span> <span data-start="384.43" data-end="386.25">I wasn't here yet!</span> <span data-start="386.25" data-end="390.2">AMP for why you're being an Eyebrow.</span> <span data-start="390.2" data-end="394.33">Martin is going to handle this one.</span> <span data-start="394.33" data-end="396.66">Serverless.</span> <span data-start="396.66" data-end="400.909">I don't know what this means but I bet somebody could talk for 25 minutes and persuade me</span> <span data-start="400.909" data-end="403.84">it's true!</span> <span data-start="403.84" data-end="407.05">Go Node and JavaScript Crypto.</span> <span data-start="407.05" data-end="412.649">I don't know what it is but it's probably a bad idea, and I'm looking forward to seeing</span> <span data-start="412.649" data-end="416.08">these conference talks in future.</span> <span data-start="416.08" data-end="420.41">Before we dive in, a couple of disclaimers, some of what I'm presenting here are facts,</span> <span data-start="420.41" data-end="425.04">and some of what I'm presenting are opinions, and I'm trying to be as clear as possible.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="425.04" data-end="432.599">Sometimes, you're going to see a graph that says that your favourite technology is getting</span> <span data-start="432.599" data-end="438.25">less popular, and what I'm asking is that you don't get mad about that.</span> <span data-start="438.25" data-end="439.39">Don't get mad about facts.</span> <span data-start="439.39" data-end="444.969">I have so many terrible opinions that you can get mad about, but try not to get mad</span> <span data-start="444.969" data-end="446.66">about the facts.</span> <span data-start="446.66" data-end="448.77">I do not have a horse in this race.</span> <span data-start="448.77" data-end="453.65">Apart from npm, I'm not a contributor to any of the technologies I'm discussing, I'm just</span> <span data-start="453.65" data-end="456.08">presenting the facts.</span> <span data-start="456.08" data-end="461.06">Secondly, a lot of what I'm talking about involves relative popularity of technologies,</span> <span data-start="461.06" data-end="465.589">and I want to make clear that, just because a technology is popular doesn't mean that</span> <span data-start="465.589" data-end="466.589">it is good.</span> <span data-start="466.589" data-end="467.77">It doesn't mean that it's the best technology.</span> <span data-start="467.77" data-end="470.95">I don't know what the best technology means.</span> <span data-start="470.95" data-end="476.13">But for technology, popularity is useful in and of itself.</span> <span data-start="476.13" data-end="479.93">If there are a lot of people using your technology, then there will be a lot of people find and</span> <span data-start="479.93" data-end="484.02">fix bugs, there will be a lot of tutorials, there will be a lot of Stack Overflow questions</span> <span data-start="484.02" data-end="485.88">answered for you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="485.88" data-end="490.65">If you work with something popular, it often makes your work easier regardless of how good</span> <span data-start="490.65" data-end="492.54">it really is.</span> <span data-start="492.54" data-end="500.05">Finally, I really love what I talk about, and I'm going to get excited towards the end</span> <span data-start="500.05" data-end="507.78">and swear like an absolute fucking sailor, so I have no intention of toning that down</span> <span data-start="507.78" data-end="513.279">in any way, so apologies in advance.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="513.279" data-end="515.779">Who are we, JavaScript developers?</span> <span data-start="515.779" data-end="520.709">The answer is at this point, we're pretty much like everyone else.</span> <span data-start="520.709" data-end="525.21">If you look at our demographics, the same age distribution, same instrument profile,</span> <span data-start="525.21" data-end="529.13">we live in all the same countries as all of the other software developers and the reason</span> <span data-start="529.13" data-end="533.32">for that is because we nearly are all software developers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="533.32" data-end="538.33">We are 11 million developers now writing JavaScript every day.</span> <span data-start="538.33" data-end="544.03">And those 11 million developers are using more open-source software than any other language</span> <span data-start="544.03" data-end="545.03">community.</span> <span data-start="545.03" data-end="551.27">The npm registry is now the largest repository of open source of any kind, by any measure,</span> <span data-start="551.27" data-end="556.05">by number of modules, by lines of code, number of users — what are you want to pick.</span> <span data-start="556.05" data-end="558.72">It's more than twice as big as the next registry.</span> <span data-start="558.72" data-end="563.13">You could fold all the other registries into our registry if you wanted.</span> <span data-start="563.13" data-end="569.05">Does having a big registry of open source software translate to activity?</span> <span data-start="569.05" data-end="575.87">On GitHub, JavaScript is the biggest repository by numbers of line of code, and it has been</span> <span data-start="575.87" data-end="578.16">in seven years in a row.</span> <span data-start="578.16" data-end="583.39">In stack overflow's huge developer survey of 80,000 people, JavaScript was the most</span> <span data-start="583.39" data-end="588.86">popular language with 68 per cent of all developers saying they write JavaScript at least some</span> <span data-start="588.86" data-end="590.21">of the time.</span> <span data-start="590.21" data-end="594.28">Of course, you're all at a JavaScript conference, so that you knew that JavaScript was popular</span> <span data-start="594.28" data-end="600.75">already, but here is the truth: JavaScript is the most popular programming language in</span> <span data-start="600.75" data-end="607.17">the world right now, and there are more developers than ever before, so JavaScript is really</span> <span data-start="607.17" data-end="610.5">the most popular programming language there has ever been.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="610.5" data-end="616.81">And as JavaScript continues to grow, the JavaScript community is changing.</span> <span data-start="616.81" data-end="622.55">One thing we noticed that has changed between our survey in 2018 and the last one we did,</span> <span data-start="622.55" data-end="626.02">is that JavaScript developers are getting more experienced.</span> <span data-start="626.02" data-end="629.24">They've been writing JavaScript for longer.</span> <span data-start="629.24" data-end="631.92">We especially noticed this with npm itself.</span> <span data-start="631.92" data-end="636.95">A year ago, half of our npm users were new, which is to say they had been using npm for</span> <span data-start="636.95" data-end="641.8">less than two years, and this year, only about 36 per cent of people are.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="641.8" data-end="649.19">Around about 2014, and 2015, there was a massive spike in the number of npm users — around</span> <span data-start="649.19" data-end="655.65">about that time, it's when JavaScript — existing JavaScript developers tuned into npm and the</span> <span data-start="655.65" data-end="660.69">existing pool of JavaScript developers all sort of adopted npm en masse.</span> <span data-start="660.69" data-end="667.12">But, today, the number of new npm users and the number of new JavaScript users, they look</span> <span data-start="667.12" data-end="672.87">about the same, because, basically, anybody who learns JavaScript in 2019 is learning</span> <span data-start="672.87" data-end="675.07">npm at the same time.</span> <span data-start="675.07" data-end="682.83">So now believe that about 99 per cent of JavaScript developers are using npm, and that's part</span> <span data-start="682.83" data-end="689.55">of why npm has so much information about what JavaScript developers are up to at the.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="689.55" data-end="693.86">This ever-growing pool of increasingly experienced JavaScript developers means that we've also</span> <span data-start="693.86" data-end="694.86">seen a shift?</span> <span data-start="694.86" data-end="697.73">In what JavaScript developers care about.</span> <span data-start="697.73" data-end="702.85">We knew from analysing last year's data that more experienced developers care more about</span> <span data-start="702.85" data-end="703.9">best practices.</span> <span data-start="703.9" data-end="708.9">They do more testing, they use more linters and bundlers, they care more about security,</span> <span data-start="708.9" data-end="713.49">and so now the whole community is getting more experienced, and so everybody is caring</span> <span data-start="713.49" data-end="716.48">more about those sorts of things.</span> <span data-start="716.48" data-end="721.79">Since last year's survey, the number of people who said they were concerned about the security</span> <span data-start="721.79" data-end="725.96">of the open-source modules that they use, has increased.</span> <span data-start="725.96" data-end="732.1">In the last two years, npm has added two-parking auth to protect publishers from account theft</span> <span data-start="732.1" data-end="739.75">as well as security teams to detect and flag malicious packages.</span> <span data-start="739.75" data-end="742.79">Malicious packages aren't the good threat model.</span> <span data-start="742.79" data-end="746.42">Accidental vulnerabilities are much, much more common.</span> <span data-start="746.42" data-end="752.45">So, last year, we introduced the npm audit command which will find and fix security vulnerabilities</span> <span data-start="752.45" data-end="758.24">in your application by upgrading to more secure versions of the packages that are out there.</span> </p>
