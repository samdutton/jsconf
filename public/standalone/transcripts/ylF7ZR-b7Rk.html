<p><span data-start="222.35" data-end="226.09">Oasis released what's the story morning glory.</span> <span data-start="226.09" data-end="233.34">But that's just as uninteresting to me tonight as the JavaScript origin story.</span> <span data-start="233.34" data-end="237.9">I bet you didn't think that someone from outside the world of package managers would be bringing</span> <span data-start="237.9" data-end="240.87">the hottest takes to the JavaScript conference.</span> <span data-start="240.87" data-end="243.85">But here we are.</span> <span data-start="243.85" data-end="247.48">The only year in the past that we are going to talk about is probably the most impactful</span> <span data-start="247.48" data-end="250.91">to all of us tonight and that is ten years ago.</span> <span data-start="250.91" data-end="252.43">That is 2009.</span> <span data-start="252.43" data-end="254.62">I know a lot of math.</span> <span data-start="254.62" data-end="260.79">So, what were JavaScript, the community and I up to in 2009?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="260.79" data-end="264.48">And how we all have collectively grown up since.</span> <span data-start="264.48" data-end="266.59">So, let's explore.</span> <span data-start="266.59" data-end="273.52">In 2009, JavaScript had just about started getting use to the actually being useful.</span> <span data-start="273.52" data-end="276.47">Both for normals and nerds.</span> <span data-start="276.47" data-end="279.18">The iPhone had only been out for about two years.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="279.18" data-end="283.15">So, the idea of JavaScript in everyone's pockets was real.</span> <span data-start="283.15" data-end="284.72">But it was still in its infancy.</span> <span data-start="284.72" data-end="286.24">Not a lot of people knew.</span> <span data-start="286.24" data-end="290.6">And it had been about four years since AJAX had come about.</span> <span data-start="290.6" data-end="295.23">And I think stronger than dirt is a pretty good bar to reach for scripting languages.</span> <span data-start="295.23" data-end="304.22">In part with AJAX, web 2.0 was evolving from user interactions like shit posting comments,</span> <span data-start="304.22" data-end="311.26">to collaboration and real time shit posting comments with Google wave.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="311.26" data-end="318.58">They reprogrammed the algorithm that most use today like Glitch.</span> <span data-start="318.58" data-end="321.9">So, honestly, haters of Google Wave can eat it.</span> <span data-start="321.9" data-end="325.12">GitHub and StackOverflow were about a year old.</span> <span data-start="325.12" data-end="330.16">And the most popular JavaScript questions from that year were a reflection of the language's</span> <span data-start="330.16" data-end="332.42">youth and complexity.</span> <span data-start="332.42" data-end="336.85">Which nearly matched that of the social construct of time which to this day we still have issues</span> <span data-start="336.85" data-end="342.75">with  in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="342.75" data-end="347.15">Prototype, jQuery, all a few years old.</span> <span data-start="347.15" data-end="348.78">It's about the user interface, baby.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="348.78" data-end="352.31">I'm sorry, I cringe whenever I hear that.</span> <span data-start="352.31" data-end="358.05">For the client side, there wasn't much besides the cringy taglines and logos.</span> <span data-start="358.05" data-end="362.11">Entirely exciting or dramatic going on.</span> <span data-start="362.11" data-end="365.66">And to be fair, this is the year before backbone was released.</span> <span data-start="365.66" data-end="370.31">So, there was no real framework wars in sight yet.</span> <span data-start="370.31" data-end="375.37">It would be another year before Steve Jobs would release his viral YouTube video/open</span> <span data-start="375.37" data-end="376.37">letter, thoughts on Flash.</span> <span data-start="376.37" data-end="382">By the way, Flash ends of life next year.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="382" data-end="389.56">So, rich people and blogging males weren't quite yet talking about HTML5 as if it were</span> <span data-start="389.56" data-end="393.64">like an actual brand new language literally to solve every problem yet.</span> <span data-start="393.64" data-end="399.72">It was a simpler, softer, more down to Earth time for the document object model and those</span> <span data-start="399.72" data-end="403.69">of us fucking around with it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="403.69" data-end="409.73">But that's not to say that 2009 was without excitement or even conflict and drama.</span> <span data-start="409.73" data-end="412.419">Shouts out to the TC39 panel a little bit earlier.</span> <span data-start="412.419" data-end="414.09">It looked a lot different back then.</span> <span data-start="414.09" data-end="416.48">Looked a lot different last year.</span> <span data-start="416.48" data-end="422.24">They were having a tough time coming to a resolution to a debate that I will summarize</span> <span data-start="422.24" data-end="428.93">as I do most in the community, grownups fighting on blogs instead of saying it to their faces.</span> <span data-start="428.93" data-end="436.4">Blogs, for the unfamiliar, it was how people put long threads of Tweets into a single page,</span> <span data-start="436.4" data-end="438.06">by the way.</span> <span data-start="438.06" data-end="439.16">RIP.</span> <span data-start="439.16" data-end="444.68">And TC39 for those that missed the panel, it was great panel.</span> <span data-start="444.68" data-end="451.62">It's a technical committee to which large companies pay 70K or more dollars to join.</span> <span data-start="451.62" data-end="456.19">And what does or doesn't change with JavaScript the language.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="456.19" data-end="462.81">It appears that in 2009 the committee of the pulling a weekend at Bernie's with the math</span> <span data-start="462.81" data-end="467.25">icon John Von Neumann.</span> <span data-start="467.25" data-end="474.3">Fun fact, Neumann invented merge sort, the second best sorting algorithm next to Jortsort.</span> <span data-start="474.3" data-end="477.41">I don't know.</span> <span data-start="477.41" data-end="479.97">Maybe this is what TC39 was fighting about.</span> <span data-start="479.97" data-end="485.57">Honestly, it was one of the least interesting things I was reading about in 2009.</span> <span data-start="485.57" data-end="489.56">But to be fair, there was a lot of competition in being interesting.</span> <span data-start="489.56" data-end="493.71">Remember, Google Wave came out that year.</span> <span data-start="493.71" data-end="501.53">And by the way, it's hard not to see some irony in the year collaboration was disrupted,</span> <span data-start="501.53" data-end="508.11">some dudes from large companies had a hard time collaborating with each other.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="508.11" data-end="511.84">Maybe that's the hardest problem in computer science.</span> <span data-start="511.84" data-end="520.259">But if you stare directly into the sun, you may find it interesting that the resolution</span> <span data-start="520.259" data-end="526.699">of this particular conflict was the committee renaming ECMAScript 3.1 to ECMAScript fifth</span> <span data-start="526.699" data-end="527.699">edition.</span> <span data-start="527.699" data-end="533.16">The version, one point, nine points, is a huge thing back thing.</span> <span data-start="533.16" data-end="542.73">It was a few years later that TC39 had another conflict and moved up the version 2009 points.</span> <span data-start="542.73" data-end="548.339">Obviously, an homage to the 2009 renaming.</span> <span data-start="548.339" data-end="554.559">Numerologists should be all over this shit.</span> <span data-start="554.559" data-end="559.48">Most of the news about JavaScript 2009 was not about JavaScript, but about browsers who</span> <span data-start="559.48" data-end="562.259">were all allegedly the best.</span> <span data-start="562.259" data-end="564.72">Stallman was mad about open source.</span> <span data-start="564.72" data-end="568.139">And, yeah, some things haven't changed.</span> </p>
