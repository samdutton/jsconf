<p><span data-start="26.19" data-end="31.97"><span class="speaker">Laura</span>: Good morning, everyone.</span> <span data-start="31.97" data-end="38.05">I was in the audience for a talk on accessibility a few years back much like you are right now,</span> <span data-start="38.05" data-end="43.589">and I was sitting with some colleagues from a previous job and I remember feeling stuff</span> <span data-start="43.589" data-end="49.489">like, well, this is really nice, really cool, but does it really apply to the thing that</span> <span data-start="49.489" data-end="50.489">I'm building?</span> <span data-start="50.489" data-end="54.929">I was working on a mobile site at a time and I kept hearing about all this keyboard stuff</span> <span data-start="54.929" data-end="56.21">that I had to look into.</span> <span data-start="56.21" data-end="58.799">So that didn't really matter to me.</span> <span data-start="58.799" data-end="63.199">And I thought, well, maybe we were starting a new project, so it felt, like, there was</span> <span data-start="63.199" data-end="67.86">this huge gap between the thing that I was building and accessibility.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="67.86" data-end="72.11">And looking back, I'm honestly a little bit embarrassed to admit this, but I also like</span> <span data-start="72.11" data-end="78.89">to full own having been there because it helps me appreciate just how easy it is to feel</span> <span data-start="78.89" data-end="84.439">that way, and just how far accessibility can be from the thing that you're doing.</span> <span data-start="84.439" data-end="90.45">So fast forward to 2016, I was working at the Financial Times, we were building the</span> <span data-start="90.45" data-end="93.689">fastest, greatest new site out there.</span> <span data-start="93.689" data-end="95.549">We released that October.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="95.549" data-end="100.689">We replaced our old monolithic website and it was a great success.</span> <span data-start="100.689" data-end="102.369">We were winning all these awards.</span> <span data-start="102.369" data-end="104.24">We were excelling at performance, security.</span> <span data-start="104.24" data-end="109.6">So basically every metric that we set out to excel at, we were.</span> <span data-start="109.6" data-end="115.159">So one thing we decided to look at was accessibility, thinking, well, we're great at all these things,</span> <span data-start="115.159" data-end="118.89">maybe we're great at accessibility, too, just magically.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="118.89" data-end="126.24">But unlike performance and security, we hadn't really put a collective effort into accessibility</span> <span data-start="126.24" data-end="128.58">so no surprise, we weren't very good.</span> <span data-start="128.58" data-end="133.92">And well, since this talk is about the lessons we learned, that was really our first lesson.</span> <span data-start="133.92" data-end="139.94">Accessibility doesn't just happen; you have to make it happen.</span> <span data-start="139.94" data-end="141.47">So my name is Laura Carahal.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="141.47" data-end="150.61">And I work at the Financial Times.</span> <span data-start="150.61" data-end="154.3">And today I want to tell you about the lessons we learned once we realized we had built this</span> <span data-start="154.3" data-end="158.5">beautiful performant thing that couldn't really be used by everyone.</span> <span data-start="158.5" data-end="164.19">And so today, if you're in that clays you're wondering if accessibility applies to your</span> <span data-start="164.19" data-end="171.12">project, I hope you walk away convinced that it does and that's really easy to get started.</span> <span data-start="171.12" data-end="173.32">So what is accessibility?</span> <span data-start="173.32" data-end="177.61">Many definition out there but there's one that I really, really like because it strips</span> <span data-start="177.61" data-end="179.09">it down to its core.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="179.09" data-end="184.13">It says: Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the web.</span> <span data-start="184.13" data-end="185.13">That's it.</span> <span data-start="185.13" data-end="190.7">It just boils it down to not denying anyone access to the thing that you're building.</span> <span data-start="190.7" data-end="194.08">To go beyond this a little bit, I want to tell you a quick story.</span> <span data-start="194.08" data-end="198.68">I was in that shopping mall with my daughter a few weeks back.</span> <span data-start="198.68" data-end="204.22">It's a modern shopping mall in London, Wimbley, and we were going down that escalator down</span> <span data-start="204.22" data-end="205.22">there.</span> <span data-start="205.22" data-end="210.69">And she asked me, while we were going up, how does someone in a wheelchair get to do</span> <span data-start="210.69" data-end="211.69">what we're doing?</span> <span data-start="211.69" data-end="217.2">And I told her, there's an elevator somewhere, and as we're going up, she says, where is</span> <span data-start="217.2" data-end="218.2">it?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="218.2" data-end="219.76">And to be honest, I couldn't see it.</span> <span data-start="219.76" data-end="225.27">It was only when we got to the top, that I could see at the very long end of that hallway,</span> <span data-start="225.27" data-end="227.19">I pointed it out.</span> <span data-start="227.19" data-end="231.45">And she said, well, a person in a wheelchair would have to go all the way there, and back,</span> <span data-start="231.45" data-end="234.59">that's not fair.</span> <span data-start="234.59" data-end="237.76">And children have a way of seeing things for the way they are.</span> <span data-start="237.76" data-end="244.04">And so even though I explained regulations and minimum things that you have to comply</span> <span data-start="244.04" data-end="247.19">with, she was totally not buying it, it was not fair.</span> <span data-start="247.19" data-end="248.19">And that's the truth.</span> <span data-start="248.19" data-end="252.66">I mean, this was a modern building that met all the requirements but you had that unfair</span> <span data-start="252.66" data-end="254.14">situation there.</span> <span data-start="254.14" data-end="260.07">So I'd like to say that accessibility goes beyond not denying access; it's about ensuring</span> <span data-start="260.07" data-end="264.45">that the access that you provide is fair for everyone and I'm giving my daughter full credit</span> <span data-start="264.45" data-end="266.88">for that quote.</span> <span data-start="266.88" data-end="270.75">So we've covered what accessibility is.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="270.75" data-end="277.03">In terms of disability, it can be divided into four categories: Physical, visual, hearing,</span> <span data-start="277.03" data-end="278.54">or cognitive.</span> <span data-start="278.54" data-end="285.22">These could be permanent disabilities but we also have temporary and situational disabilities.</span> <span data-start="285.22" data-end="291.93">So, for example, if a permanent disability is deaf and hard of hearing, a temporary disability</span> <span data-start="291.93" data-end="296.18">could be, in the dotted orange box there, having an inner ear infection.</span> <span data-start="296.18" data-end="302.21">So for a period of time, you can't hear very well, or a situational disability is, you're</span> <span data-start="302.21" data-end="307.43">in a noisy place, and you can't hear things because there's noise preventing you from</span> <span data-start="307.43" data-end="308.44">hearing.</span> <span data-start="308.44" data-end="316.42">So we designed something for someone deaf in mind by adding, for example, closed captioning</span> <span data-start="316.42" data-end="322.26">to your videos, that benefits anyone else that falls anywhere on that spectrum.</span> <span data-start="322.26" data-end="327.2">So getting back to permanent disabilities, as far as permanent disabilities go, there's</span> <span data-start="327.2" data-end="337.41">about 1 billion people in the world with disabilities, and when you factor in your own userbase and</span> <span data-start="337.41" data-end="342.05">their demographics, you can get a clearer picture of what that number looks like for</span> <span data-start="342.05" data-end="343.67">your business.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="343.67" data-end="348.389">So we did that at the Financial Times and that worked out to be about 20% of our users</span> <span data-start="348.389" data-end="355.26">because when you factor in the age distribution of our readership, that tends to skew a little</span> <span data-start="355.26" data-end="356.26">bit older.</span> <span data-start="356.26" data-end="358.169">So we got a higher number there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="358.169" data-end="362.46">So if you're anything like the FD, they have a wide audience, consuming the products and</span> <span data-start="362.46" data-end="363.8">the services that you put out.</span> <span data-start="363.8" data-end="368.66">You probably go through great lengths, too, to support all the members of that audience.</span> <span data-start="368.66" data-end="374.919">So, for example, you have people on IE 8 and that only makes up about 5% of your userbase,</span> <span data-start="374.919" data-end="378.37">you're probably making sure that they get a good experience, or at least an acceptable</span> <span data-start="378.37" data-end="384.41">experience so all of a sudden, we have about 20% of our userbase that we're ignoring.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="384.41" data-end="388.139">And that tends to get things moving.</span> <span data-start="388.139" data-end="392.88">So that's a good motivation to get things started.</span> <span data-start="392.88" data-end="397.9">So let's say I've convinced you now and you were gonna do this.</span> <span data-start="397.9" data-end="403.4">You're determined to get accessibility into your project, and it's hard, and it's overwhelming,</span> <span data-start="403.4" data-end="405.32">and you don't really know where to start.</span> <span data-start="405.32" data-end="409.4">Our suggestion is to just start small.</span> <span data-start="409.4" data-end="412.56">For us, starting small meant doing that.</span> <span data-start="412.56" data-end="414.93">We installed pa11y into our project.</span> <span data-start="414.93" data-end="422.49">Pa11y is an open source tool that will check your markup against some regulations I'll</span> <span data-start="422.49" data-end="426.57">show you in a little bit and it can detect some accessibility errors.</span> <span data-start="426.57" data-end="430.61">It doesn't detect everything but it's a good place to start.</span> <span data-start="430.61" data-end="435.86">There are other open source tools that do the same thing but we've found pa11y to be</span> <span data-start="435.86" data-end="442.9">a great thing for our project, and it has a great community of members and developers</span> <span data-start="442.9" data-end="443.9">around it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="443.9" data-end="447.15">So this was the way that we started.</span> <span data-start="447.15" data-end="454.15">So the way pa11y works is it goes through the web content accessibility guidelines.</span> <span data-start="454.15" data-end="458.19">We won't go very deep into this today but you can go and check it out.</span> <span data-start="458.19" data-end="462.62">It's a list of criteria that your site should meet if it is to be accessible.</span> <span data-start="462.62" data-end="467.01">So it checks your markup against that, and then it gives you a report of what's broken.</span> <span data-start="467.01" data-end="473.59">And so we ran pa11y against ft.com, and we got a whole list of errors that was a lot</span> <span data-start="473.59" data-end="475.64">more than two at the time.</span> <span data-start="475.64" data-end="480.84">And at that moment, we could just go and fix the errors, and run this every now and then</span> <span data-start="480.84" data-end="486.291">manually, and then fix things that come up, but unless we had something that we could</span> <span data-start="486.291" data-end="490.05">automate into our build process, this wasn't going to be very efficient.</span> <span data-start="490.05" data-end="496.979">So pa11y has sort of a wrapper that's called pa11y-ci, that just helps you to wrap pa11y</span> <span data-start="496.979" data-end="500.74">into your continual process.</span> <span data-start="500.74" data-end="503.229">So this is what we did in FT.</span> <span data-start="503.229" data-end="511.3">This is an overall simplified version of our Node process.</span> <span data-start="511.3" data-end="515.659">So one app would be the opportunity page, or the article page, or sign-up pages.</span> <span data-start="515.659" data-end="518.349">And those apps live on GitHub.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="518.349" data-end="524.509">Every time we push to a branch in GitHub, that kicks off a CircleCI build, and if it's</span> <span data-start="524.509" data-end="530.24">a master branch, then it goes to Heroku and it's off to production.</span> <span data-start="530.24" data-end="535.8">So pa11y kicks in here, in the continuous integration step.</span> <span data-start="535.8" data-end="541.04">So it would run for every push for every branch for your project and it would tell you what</span> <span data-start="541.04" data-end="542.54">accessibility errors you have.</span> <span data-start="542.54" data-end="551.79">So to do that, we just need it to add one line to our existing build process which is</span> <span data-start="551.79" data-end="553.41">.make pa11y.</span> <span data-start="553.41" data-end="559.269">And really, what that does is run pa11y-ci and it's highly customizable.</span> <span data-start="559.269" data-end="567.389">And so in our case, every branch generates a dynamic app with a dynamic name and so we</span> <span data-start="567.389" data-end="568.92">run pa11y-ci against that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="568.92" data-end="572.779">And the interesting thing here is the threshold amount.</span> <span data-start="572.779" data-end="580.29">So, at the time, we've had dozens of apps making up ft.com and we had hundreds of errors.</span> <span data-start="580.29" data-end="584.829">So we couldn't just, one day, break every build, and hold production and say, hey, we</span> <span data-start="584.829" data-end="587.149">need to fix all these errors.</span> <span data-start="587.149" data-end="592.92">So what that allows you to do is integrate pa11y to not break your builds, and so your</span> <span data-start="592.92" data-end="595.029">builds will pass.</span> <span data-start="595.029" data-end="599.66">So you initially set that value to something very high.</span> <span data-start="599.66" data-end="605.399">You'll still have builds pass, and no one will have builds failing because of it.</span> <span data-start="605.399" data-end="611.329">But you'll have a report now of the accessibility errors that you have.</span> <span data-start="611.329" data-end="621.769">So once we did that, we went, app-by-app, cleaning up the errors, and then we would</span> <span data-start="621.769" data-end="623.32">remove the threshold argument.</span> <span data-start="623.32" data-end="629.11">So for that moment, if a new branch included a new accessibility error, then that branch</span> <span data-start="629.11" data-end="630.11">wouldn't pass.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="630.11" data-end="632.209">And so that was sort of our ultimate goal.</span> <span data-start="632.209" data-end="635.069">So it would look like that.</span> <span data-start="635.069" data-end="640.649">So now you've reached kind of like a zero-error level, and now that has a new branch, it has</span> <span data-start="640.649" data-end="644.129">a new error and you can't push that to production.</span> <span data-start="644.129" data-end="649.449">So that was a big achievement and we were getting to the point where all of our apps</span> <span data-start="649.449" data-end="650.449">had this.</span> <span data-start="650.449" data-end="653.629">They all had zero errors and they were preventing making new errors into production.</span> <span data-start="653.629" data-end="655.389">And that was a big deal.</span> <span data-start="655.389" data-end="658.019">We felt like winners.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="658.019" data-end="662.059">No accessibility errors would ever make it to production.</span> <span data-start="662.059" data-end="668.48">But we realized that even though everyone was for accessibility, they all liked the</span> <span data-start="668.48" data-end="673.69">idea of pa11y, they even liked having the idea of having pa11y break their build.</span> <span data-start="673.69" data-end="679.369">We didn't really do a great job of explaining what once you got that list of errors, or</span> <span data-start="679.369" data-end="681.499">what that meant, or what you were supposed to do.</span> <span data-start="681.499" data-end="684.029">So that was a lesson learned.</span> <span data-start="684.029" data-end="691.089">So before you set a project on fire, train people.</span> <span data-start="691.089" data-end="700.379">So a good place to start is this free Udacity course.</span> <span data-start="700.379" data-end="704.459">But this is a great tutorial that you can at your own pace and this is where we started</span> <span data-start="704.459" data-end="710.35">our own training.</span> <span data-start="710.35" data-end="715.699">So we've reached that level where you have zero errors in your app, or in all your apps.</span> <span data-start="715.699" data-end="720.259">You've removed that threshold argument and nothing's going to make it into production.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="720.259" data-end="725.709">So now we've talked about errors that you can detect automatically in pa11y.</span> <span data-start="725.709" data-end="733.999">So that's about 20-35% of all the errors that you can and at least needs to be checked manually.</span> <span data-start="733.999" data-end="738.989">And so to do that is you can do some things.</span> <span data-start="738.989" data-end="745.939">One of them is getting an external audit where a third party with experience in accessibility</span> <span data-start="745.939" data-end="750.779">checks your site and tells you  —  gives you a report of what's broken, or certifies you</span> <span data-start="750.779" data-end="753.7">that you have no errors and that you are accessible.</span> <span data-start="753.7" data-end="758.68">Something else that you can do is have customer research or do user testing and the third</span> <span data-start="758.68" data-end="765.149">one is learning how to use assistive tech yourself so you can test your own site and</span> <span data-start="765.149" data-end="766.269">spot some of these errors.</span> <span data-start="766.269" data-end="770.13">These are not mutually exclusive, and ideally you should be doing all of them.</span> <span data-start="770.13" data-end="774.149">So I'm going to go through each of these.</span> <span data-start="774.149" data-end="780.22">In our case, the external audit was conducted by the Digital Accessibility Center, and I'm</span> <span data-start="780.22" data-end="788.11">going to show you a little video of what they did.</span> <span data-start="788.11" data-end="794.229"Audience member: My name is Jebec Morgan, and I have cerebral palsy.</span> <span data-start="794.229" data-end="798.069"Audience member: Choose three.</span> <span data-start="798.069" data-end="801.909"Audience member: Click button.</span> <span data-start="801.909" data-end="807.899"Audience member: It controls the videos.</span> <span data-start="807.899" data-end="811.109"Audience member: My name is James Herkain, and I'm the color contrast and disability analyst at  — </span> <span data-start="811.109" data-end="818.369"Audience member: On the home page, I encountered some text displayed on top of images.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="922.649" data-end="926.429"><span class="speaker">Laura</span>: Yeah, so that's some of the work that they did.</span> <span data-start="926.429" data-end="931.149">This is only two minutes long but I was lucky enough to be able to spend a day  —  a full</span> <span data-start="931.149" data-end="933.569">day  —  with them while they were doing the testing.</span> <span data-start="933.569" data-end="937.199">And if you have a chance to do this for the product that you're building, I highly recommend</span> <span data-start="937.199" data-end="942.249">it because it will change your perspective on the work that you do forever.</span> <span data-start="942.249" data-end="949.61">So after that, all of that testing, we got a report back with about  —  it was, like,</span> <span data-start="949.61" data-end="954.449">a 200-page report giving us all the errors that we had  —  all the stuff that they had</span> <span data-start="954.449" data-end="955.73">to detect manually.</span> <span data-start="955.73" data-end="957.489">So we went about fixing all of those.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="957.489" data-end="960.559">It took us a couple of months.</span> <span data-start="960.559" data-end="965.019">And just very recently we got an accreditation saying that this website is accessible to</span> <span data-start="965.019" data-end="970.41">this level of conformance and we were very glad to get it because it was very hard work</span> <span data-start="970.41" data-end="977.859">and we were also very glad to be the first site in our industry to get it, but this is</span> <span data-start="977.859" data-end="980.42">not a title that we want to hold alone.</span> <span data-start="980.42" data-end="985.319">So we encourage people from The Guardian, and The Post, and The Times, to get on this</span> <span data-start="985.319" data-end="992.879">because this is one metric that we should all be trying to outdo each other on.</span> <span data-start="992.879" data-end="1001.6">So another problem is customer research.</span> <span data-start="1001.6" data-end="1007.3">But if you want your new features to make sense, they should probably be tested by actual</span> <span data-start="1007.3" data-end="1011.57">users, or you could end up, you know, building something that looks good on paper but still</span> <span data-start="1011.57" data-end="1015.37">get it very, very wrong.</span> <span data-start="1015.37" data-end="1021.629">So lastly, here I wanted to talk a little bit about how we went about learning how to</span> <span data-start="1021.629" data-end="1023.699">use assistive tech ourselves.</span> <span data-start="1023.699" data-end="1025.939">We had never done that before as a team.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1025.939" data-end="1029.69">So this is one thing that you can do for free and I would highly encourage it.</span> <span data-start="1029.69" data-end="1031.11">This is some of the tools we use.</span> <span data-start="1031.11" data-end="1033.699">You can get them all for free if you have a Mac.</span> <span data-start="1033.699" data-end="1040.139">We used VoiceOver for screenreader.</span> <span data-start="1040.139" data-end="1044.549">And we used the zoom capabilities of the Mac.</span> <span data-start="1044.549" data-end="1047.76">We tested a little bit on Windows as well because they have this high-contrast mode</span> <span data-start="1047.76" data-end="1049.429">that just breaks everything.</span> <span data-start="1049.429" data-end="1054.049">So it's a lot worse than the Mac one, and by worse I mean a lot better because it finds</span> <span data-start="1054.049" data-end="1059.159">more errors so if you have access to Windows, I would highly recommend looking at what you're</span> <span data-start="1059.159" data-end="1061.882">looking at with that build on that mode.</span> <span data-start="1061.882" data-end="1068.52">So one thing that really helped us a lot was testing keyboard only.</span> <span data-start="1068.52" data-end="1073.37">So initially we would just go to ft.com and just test the site using the keyboard and</span> <span data-start="1073.37" data-end="1077.169">then go about our lives and using our mouse, or our trackpad.</span> <span data-start="1077.169" data-end="1081.799">But what really made a difference was going keyboard only all the time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1081.799" data-end="1089.52">So one thing you learn is you can use keyboard only on sites because they are good with keyboard</span> <span data-start="1089.52" data-end="1090.52">accessibility.</span> <span data-start="1090.52" data-end="1096.12">But there are some sites that are impossible to use, and that becomes evident very quickly</span> <span data-start="1096.12" data-end="1101.35">once you give up your house or your trackpad.</span> <span data-start="1101.35" data-end="1107.649">So to be able to make the transition easier from using a trackpad, to a keyboard is by</span> <span data-start="1107.649" data-end="1110.62">using mouse keys.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1110.62" data-end="1117.06">So what that can do is disable your trackpad but it gives you the possibility to control</span> <span data-start="1117.06" data-end="1119.649">your pointer with your number keys.</span> <span data-start="1119.649" data-end="1121.69">So you can use that in an emergency.</span> <span data-start="1121.69" data-end="1127.179">So if you have a site that has particularly bad accessibility, and you don't have a mouse,</span> <span data-start="1127.179" data-end="1134.18">instead of using the mouse or a trackpad, you can  —  so it's really annoying.</span> <span data-start="1134.18" data-end="1139.33">And really only want to use it when there's no other way.</span> <span data-start="1139.33" data-end="1145.62">So one thing we realize is convenient before you go keyboard only is printing out some</span> <span data-start="1145.62" data-end="1147.279">of the shortcuts for your top apps.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1147.279" data-end="1149.929">This was my setup around November.</span> <span data-start="1149.929" data-end="1155.389">But once you do this for a while, and you just memorize the shortcuts by using them,</span> <span data-start="1155.389" data-end="1159.139">and all that paper goes away.</span> <span data-start="1159.139" data-end="1162.26">Sometimes I don't have an external keyboard when I take my laptop home, for example.</span> <span data-start="1162.26" data-end="1166.9">So what I've done is I've made my trackpad really, really slow and I've removed all the</span> <span data-start="1166.9" data-end="1172.139">goodies that Apple gave me so that when I do have to use it, it's uncomfortable so it</span> <span data-start="1172.139" data-end="1175.59">reminds me to go back and use the keyboard.</span> <span data-start="1175.59" data-end="1179.99">So that's lesson number three: Throw away your mouse.</span> <span data-start="1179.99" data-end="1185.97">So going back to that list of things that you have to fix, you've learned to use all</span> <span data-start="1185.97" data-end="1186.97">these tools.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1186.97" data-end="1187.97">You have your keyboard set up.</span> <span data-start="1187.97" data-end="1192.82">It's really tempting to just roll up your sleeves and try to fix everything yourself,</span> <span data-start="1192.82" data-end="1197.96">but if you're building a large site, I'd recommend you don't do that.</span> <span data-start="1197.96" data-end="1201.24">So it's  —  wait, let's go back to Jim Carrey for a minute.</span> <span data-start="1201.24" data-end="1206.84">So one thing that we learned  —  or that I learned  —  it wasn't that quickly, it took</span> <span data-start="1206.84" data-end="1213.75">a while, was that if you try and take on everything yourself, it's not efficient, it's not the</span> <span data-start="1213.75" data-end="1214.89">right answer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1214.89" data-end="1220.34">You end up burning out, errors keep coming back in faster than you can clean it up and</span> <span data-start="1220.34" data-end="1224.169">you really do a disservice to your team by becoming a bottleneck.</span> <span data-start="1224.169" data-end="1229.779">So what you can do here is just get everyone involved.</span> <span data-start="1229.779" data-end="1235.78">A lot of people  —  almost everyone  —  everyone I know really wants to be a part of this,</span> <span data-start="1235.78" data-end="1240.429">and wants to help, and they can only do that if you let them know that you need to help,</span> <span data-start="1240.429" data-end="1242.46">that you're doing this, and how they can help.</span> <span data-start="1242.46" data-end="1245.09">Just give them tools to do this.</span> <span data-start="1245.09" data-end="1251.23">So if you do have some time, just spend some of it training your team and getting them</span> <span data-start="1251.23" data-end="1254.93">involved rather than just trying to fix everything yourself.</span> <span data-start="1254.93" data-end="1257.88">Also make it part of your recruitment process if you can.</span> <span data-start="1257.88" data-end="1261.87">Make it part of your job description, of your online tests, just put it out there.</span> <span data-start="1261.87" data-end="1269.58">So that was lesson number four for us: Don't take it all out on yourself.</span> <span data-start="1269.58" data-end="1272.33">Another good way to spread the word is making an event out of it.</span> <span data-start="1272.33" data-end="1277.22">We put together a road show in the office where we set some laptops in the middle of</span> <span data-start="1277.22" data-end="1283.44">the office and we invited everyone to just try to complete a form using a screenreader.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1283.44" data-end="1286.07">And we offered an Amazon gift card as a prize.</span> <span data-start="1286.07" data-end="1290.22">So it was, like, a $20 Amazon gift card but people love Amazon so everyone stopped by.</span> <span data-start="1290.22" data-end="1294.75">So this was a form that you had to fill out.</span> <span data-start="1294.75" data-end="1298.46">So you can't really easy that much, and you're forced on using the screenreader to do it.</span> <span data-start="1298.46" data-end="1301.87">And a lot of people who stopped by, this was the first time of of them using a screenreader.</span> <span data-start="1301.87" data-end="1305.34">Some of them didn't even know what a screenreader was.</span> <span data-start="1305.34" data-end="1309.89">So this was a great way to expose a lot of people at the same time to accessibility.</span> <span data-start="1309.89" data-end="1311.88">So that's what the form is.</span> <span data-start="1311.88" data-end="1317.49">It's a very simple form with some annoying menu items if you don't skip them properly.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1317.49" data-end="1320.12">And it had some accessibility built in.</span> <span data-start="1320.12" data-end="1325.44">And the way that we did that was just very crudely blurred things, and disabling clicks,</span> <span data-start="1325.44" data-end="1329.19">and discouraging people, saying not to cheat.</span> <span data-start="1329.19" data-end="1337.601">But this event that we held was probably a highlight in my 15 years of doing this.</span> <span data-start="1337.601" data-end="1338.601">Is this moment.</span> <span data-start="1338.601" data-end="1350.259">That's Patrick Hammond, you probably know him, a seasoned developer, and Patrick, I</span> <span data-start="1350.259" data-end="1355.639">apologize, I'm going to use that for the rest of the year as I talk about this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1355.639" data-end="1360.02">We got that type of reaction from a lot of people, and it was really great because we</span> <span data-start="1360.02" data-end="1365.61">managed to create a space of collective empathy within these 20 minutes or so that people</span> <span data-start="1365.61" data-end="1367.53">did this.</span> <span data-start="1367.53" data-end="1371.82">We had all these people just stepping into someone else's shoes for a minute or two at</span> <span data-start="1371.82" data-end="1377.98">a time but everyone walked away with a new perspective on how people really use the product</span> <span data-start="1377.98" data-end="1380.33">that they were building.</span> <span data-start="1380.33" data-end="1384.809">So that was lesson number five: Talk about it a lot.</span> <span data-start="1384.809" data-end="1385.809">Make sure you spread the word.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1385.809" data-end="1389.84">You never know who's listening and you're probably inspiring more people than you think</span> <span data-start="1389.84" data-end="1392.14">you are.</span> <span data-start="1392.14" data-end="1396.2">Before we finish, I wanted to take you back to how they really all got started for us</span> <span data-start="1396.2" data-end="1398.2">at the FT.</span> <span data-start="1398.2" data-end="1403.411">I was in book duty one day and I noticed this card on our JIRA board for bug duty.</span> <span data-start="1403.411" data-end="1411.51">Bug duty is the only place on our JIRA board.</span> <span data-start="1411.51" data-end="1412.89">It said integrate pa11y.</span> <span data-start="1412.89" data-end="1414.49">I didn't know what pa11y was.</span> <span data-start="1414.49" data-end="1420.29">And when I picked up that card expect and when saw the card, I noticed that it had been</span> <span data-start="1420.29" data-end="1426.98">sitting around for a long time, I saw that Ben Fletcher created it.</span> <span data-start="1426.98" data-end="1436.659">And he's a developer who's deaf-blind and he just made us aware that that is something</span> <span data-start="1436.659" data-end="1439.48">that we should be looking at.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1439.48" data-end="1448.7">So that's the next point, diversity will improve the team, it will improve you.</span> <span data-start="1448.7" data-end="1455.73">Ben's actions really snowballed into us building a better product.</span> <span data-start="1455.73" data-end="1461.529">Our team learned about accessibility and got a new perspective, and just grew as a team.</span> <span data-start="1461.529" data-end="1466.409">And it led to me standing in front of you all here today.</span> <span data-start="1466.409" data-end="1472.08">So to recap, just the things that you learned, and probably some things that you can do tonight</span> <span data-start="1472.08" data-end="1473.6">in half an hour.</span> <span data-start="1473.6" data-end="1476.169">Accessibility doesn't just happen.</span> <span data-start="1476.169" data-end="1481">You can do that in one minute in your project, if you make pa11y-ci as a part of your build</span> <span data-start="1481" data-end="1486.269">process with a high threshold, and start getting reports of your accessibility errors.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1486.269" data-end="1488.44">Number two, train your people.</span> <span data-start="1488.44" data-end="1494.98">One good way is you could share that Udacity course with your colleagues, that's very quick.</span> <span data-start="1494.98" data-end="1500.549">Throw away your mouse but I do suggest printing out shortcuts beforehand.</span> <span data-start="1500.549" data-end="1505.409">Don't throw it to yourself.</span> <span data-start="1505.409" data-end="1508.91">Get people, get designers, QA, get product involved.</span> <span data-start="1508.91" data-end="1509.91">Talk about it.</span> <span data-start="1509.91" data-end="1510.91">Go on Twitter.</span> <span data-start="1510.91" data-end="1514.799">There's a lot of fantastic people out there with great insights on accessibility.</span> <span data-start="1514.799" data-end="1518.73">I'll share some links at the end of this talk.</span> <span data-start="1518.73" data-end="1522.899">So, yeah, just go over the Twitter feeds and see what they're talking about.</span> <span data-start="1522.899" data-end="1525.799">Retweet that you find interesting, something that inspires you.</span> <span data-start="1525.799" data-end="1527.39">That can be done very quickly.</span> <span data-start="1527.39" data-end="1531.361">And the last one, I unfortunately, don't have a magic silver bullet but you can do it in</span> <span data-start="1531.361" data-end="1534.73">30 seconds in your work.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1534.73" data-end="1543.22">But if you're involved in hiring, try to prioritize it, and if not, make it a thing that you talk</span> <span data-start="1543.22" data-end="1550.2">about it, but it really benefits all those things that we just talked about.</span> <span data-start="1550.2" data-end="1556.299">A while back, it was probably normal to have this be the only entrance to a public building</span> <span data-start="1556.299" data-end="1557.61">somewhere.</span> <span data-start="1557.61" data-end="1560.54">Now it would be unthinkable to have this.</span> <span data-start="1560.54" data-end="1565.44">But don't wait until it becomes unthinkable to have inaccessible websites.</span> <span data-start="1565.44" data-end="1568.72">The time to make your website accessible is today.</span> <span data-start="1568.72" data-end="1569.72">So just do it.</span> <span data-start="1569.72" data-end="1570.72">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="1570.72" data-end="1571.72"Audience member: Thank you so much.</span> <span data-start="1571.72" data-end="1572.72">That was an excellent talk on why accessibility is so important.</span> <span data-start="1572.72" data-end="1573.72">Also how blind we are to how other people might be using the web.</span> <span data-start="1573.72" data-end="1574.72">It's a super important space to work in and, yeah, thank you, again, to Laura.</span> <span data-start="1574.72" data-end="1575.72">We will be moving on to the next talk by Ruth.</span> <span data-start="1575.72" data-end="1576.72">And as y'all know there's also a second track.</span> <span data-start="1576.72" data-end="1577.72">We have talk by Jessica Tran, Hacking My Anxiety with Open Source Technology.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1577.72" data-end="1578.72">So if you're interested in that, that's going to be starting in five minutes, as well.</span> <span data-start="1578.72" data-end="1579.72">So who's interested in making an interactive visual cool stuff happen with the web?</span> <span data-start="1579.72" data-end="1580.72">People into this.</span> <span data-start="1580.72" data-end="1581.72">Yeah, absolutely!</span> <span data-start="1581.72" data-end="1582.72">We're doing a lot of visual stuff that people can access visually, and there's a lot of</span> <span data-start="1582.72" data-end="1583.72">space in the web area to do that.</span> <span data-start="1583.72" data-end="1584.72">And as a warning, there are going to be flashing lights in this presentation, so anybody sensitive</span> <span data-start="1584.72" data-end="1585.72">to that, just to be aware.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1585.72" data-end="1586.72">And there's also going to be some sound playing.</span> <span data-start="1586.72" data-end="1587.72">And also with the accessibility talk, I really like the term "spaces of empathy."</span> <span data-start="1587.72" data-end="1588.72">I think this is a really great term to talk about being empathic with people and creating</span> <span data-start="1588.72" data-end="1589.72">a situation in which you can be empathic because it's easy to lose that.</span> <span data-start="1589.72" data-end="1590.72">Do we have any, like, audio-visual artists out there attending?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1590.72" data-end="1591.72">The setup looks really exciting.</span> <span data-start="1591.72" data-end="1592.72">I can't wait to see it.</span> <span data-start="1592.72" data-end="1593.72">Also, I'll bring this up again, but in the Community Lounge, there's going to be talks</span> <span data-start="1593.72" data-end="1594.72">during the break, and also some of our sponsors have workshops going on.</span> <span data-start="1594.72" data-end="1595.72">For example, I know the Mozilla table is going to have a rust workshop if anybody is into</span> <span data-start="1595.72" data-end="1596.72">that, and later on, another one.</span> </p>
