<p><span data-start="45.33" data-end="51.08">So, quickly, I mean, I realise that I saw a speaker yesterday, and she kind of like</span> <span data-start="51.08" data-end="56.01">matched her slides with her outfit, so I thought I might do the same.</span> <span data-start="56.01" data-end="61.76">And so, if everything goes right, I'm going to disappear!</span> <span data-start="61.76" data-end="63.69">And I'm going to re-appear again.</span> <span data-start="63.69" data-end="65.68">It's like camouflage!</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="237.529" data-end="239.519">All right, that's enough!</span> <span data-start="239.519" data-end="241.17">I'm going to get jealous!</span> <span data-start="241.17" data-end="245.76">So, they've been around ten years, and I was thinking to myself, like, you know, I was</span> <span data-start="245.76" data-end="248.87">kind of writing this talk up, adding some notes, ten years.</span> <span data-start="248.87" data-end="250.76">Where was I ten years ago?</span> <span data-start="250.76" data-end="252.439">Like I said, I came from music.</span> <span data-start="252.439" data-end="255.769">I was able to pull this photo out.</span> <span data-start="255.769" data-end="260.1">I used to do lectures with the Red Bull Music Academy which is actually based out of Germany,</span> <span data-start="260.1" data-end="265.69">and I was doing a lecture here with Flying Lotus, a big deal for me at the time, ten</span> <span data-start="265.69" data-end="268.07">years a week from today.</span> <span data-start="268.07" data-end="271.25">It's pretty on point and on brand.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="271.25" data-end="272.94">But the web.</span> <span data-start="272.94" data-end="276.2">The web's actually 30 years old.</span> <span data-start="276.2" data-end="281.95">And I was thinking to myself, like, man, 30 years old, that's kind of like a long time.</span> <span data-start="281.95" data-end="287.78">And I don't know where you were 30 years ago, but I remember when I first accessed the web,</span> <span data-start="287.78" data-end="291.51">the first thing I thought of was this.</span> <span data-start="291.51" data-end="295.38">And I don't know how many of you were able to sort of like be around this time where</span> <span data-start="295.38" data-end="300.53">you had to get a modem, and you made those telephone sounds, and that stuff, just to</span> <span data-start="300.53" data-end="302.22">get on the internet?</span> <span data-start="302.22" data-end="305.47">But it was great because I discovered a lot of things, and there was one place I used</span> <span data-start="305.47" data-end="310.54">to hang out — who remembers newsgroups here?</span> <span data-start="310.54" data-end="311.54">There we go.</span> <span data-start="311.54" data-end="317.34">This is where I hung out a lot, rec.hipohop and yes, I'm going to talk about hip-hop with</span> <span data-start="317.34" data-end="319.7">people I don't know.</span> <span data-start="319.7" data-end="325.63">This is the first time you start to connect with people from all parts of the world who</span> <span data-start="325.63" data-end="328.26">had access to the net.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="328.26" data-end="333.1">Another thing that I did, as I had more and more access, I used to use search engines,</span> <span data-start="333.1" data-end="336.75">like everyone else, and who remembers Alta Vista.</span> <span data-start="336.75" data-end="337.75">There we go.</span> <span data-start="337.75" data-end="339.56">I was a big fan.</span> <span data-start="339.56" data-end="342.89">When that vanished, I was so sad.</span> <span data-start="342.89" data-end="350.06">But, what I also did was I started to surf the web, and I was a big Netscape Navigator</span> <span data-start="350.06" data-end="353.51">and Communicator fan.</span> <span data-start="353.51" data-end="359.86">Actually, there were a few browsers around thereafter, but this is the one that I was</span> <span data-start="359.86" data-end="364.211">using, and the big part about this one is when it was released, this is what one of</span> <span data-start="364.211" data-end="369.86">the early quotes from Andriesson himself, "This software is going to to change everything."</span> <span data-start="369.86" data-end="372.93">And it did.</span> <span data-start="372.93" data-end="383.09">Another quote came, things started exploding with the invention of the browser because</span> <span data-start="383.09" data-end="386.86">suddenly the internet was accessible to the average person.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="386.86" data-end="391.87">And I mean, average, we will say sort of like model-class person who had a computer and</span> <span data-start="391.87" data-end="395.11">a modem, but it definitely opened things up.</span> <span data-start="395.11" data-end="401.21">You started to have that delight and discovery that I like to talk about.</span> <span data-start="401.21" data-end="407.151">When Netscape came out, it was extremely popular, 65 million users in 18 months, and part of</span> <span data-start="407.151" data-end="414.67">the reason was the fact that as much as the early web was, like, text, it was very academic,</span> <span data-start="414.67" data-end="420.45">they were actually able to bring images into the fold here, and what then happened is that</span> <span data-start="420.45" data-end="425.1">when we were surfing the net, we were accustomed to the lay-out text, images.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="425.1" data-end="428.24">It was reading the paper.</span> <span data-start="428.24" data-end="432.11">And believe it or not, there was debate as to whether or not they were going to bring</span> <span data-start="432.11" data-end="435.34">images on to the web.</span> <span data-start="435.34" data-end="440.53">Some mild arguments, and the belief was that if they brought images on, there would be</span> <span data-start="440.53" data-end="444.38">like this onslaught of pornography.</span> <span data-start="444.38" data-end="448">And I'm here to say that they were absolutely wrong.</span> <span data-start="448" data-end="449.44">Right?</span> <span data-start="449.44" data-end="457.46">But, the fact is, for real, though, they believe that by opening it up, adding some images,</span> <span data-start="457.46" data-end="462.58">and letting people sort of expert, it was going to drive the web forward, and it actually</span> <span data-start="462.58" data-end="463.58">did.</span> <span data-start="463.58" data-end="468.43">Now, today, we are 4.3 billion users online.</span> <span data-start="468.43" data-end="472.52">I think that's phenomenal, but believe it or not, there's still room to grow.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="472.52" data-end="477.01">And, you know, you might wonder that's an explosive growth.</span> <span data-start="477.01" data-end="479.4">What sort of drove that?</span> <span data-start="479.4" data-end="483.35">Well, this is kind of it right here.</span> <span data-start="483.35" data-end="485.57">This young lady's on a mobile phone.</span> <span data-start="485.57" data-end="490.08">I believe this is nothing that the they expected to see at the time.</span> <span data-start="490.08" data-end="491.46">This is like mid-1990s.</span> <span data-start="491.46" data-end="496.56">Who thought you were going to have a mobile device and be able to surf the web just as</span> <span data-start="496.56" data-end="499.43">powerfully as they did back then?</span> <span data-start="499.43" data-end="504.51">So this has allowed us to do a lot of different things.</span> <span data-start="504.51" data-end="508.46">We've been able to be very productive in life.</span> <span data-start="508.46" data-end="512.07">So what have we been able to do with sort of like little friction?</span> <span data-start="512.07" data-end="514.03">Pretty much everything.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="514.03" data-end="521.21">I mean, we can make money, we manage money online, we can go on a date, we can go buy</span> <span data-start="521.21" data-end="522.77">clothes.</span> <span data-start="522.77" data-end="528.28">We can actually go rent a car to take your date out.</span> <span data-start="528.28" data-end="534.71">We can order fish, we can listen to one of my favourite songs called Fish, and we could</span> <span data-start="534.71" data-end="540.7">actually get phishing emails from African Princes, right?</span> <span data-start="540.7" data-end="549.15">But all jokes aside, man, we can actually read comics and make them accessible, comic</span> <span data-start="549.15" data-end="551.74">books, shot-out to Jessica.</span> <span data-start="551.74" data-end="553.27">[Applause].</span> <span data-start="553.27" data-end="556.33">No doubt.</span> <span data-start="556.33" data-end="562.25">For all the people that were trying to bring online, we could actually go offline.</span> <span data-start="562.25" data-end="565.24">This is what technology has allowed us to do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="565.24" data-end="566.44">Which is absolutely needed.</span> <span data-start="566.44" data-end="571.68">By the way, I downloaded the offline map for Berlin because I was not going to pay those</span> <span data-start="571.68" data-end="572.68">fees.</span> <span data-start="572.68" data-end="576.07">But we could actually create music in the browser as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="576.07" data-end="582.16">Shout-out to Live :JS in the building!</span> <span data-start="582.16" data-end="587.61">This is what the technology has allowed us to do, very important.</span> <span data-start="587.61" data-end="592.49">This is the shape of the web as we see it growing right before our eyes.</span> <span data-start="592.49" data-end="599.48">So, the technology has been extremely important in getting these sort of things done.</span> <span data-start="599.48" data-end="605.74">And this is where we are going to sort of like see even more technology allow us to</span> <span data-start="605.74" data-end="607.86">do greater things thereafter.</span> <span data-start="607.86" data-end="612">Now, what about the technologist?</span> <span data-start="612" data-end="618.38">We may have been playing some amazing chords on some of the devices that we've seen out</span> <span data-start="618.38" data-end="623.38">there, you know, from keyboards to the MIDI controllers, but, unfortunately, there's been</span> <span data-start="623.38" data-end="629.01">a little bit of discord as well, and we're going to get into a few items that have been</span> <span data-start="629.01" data-end="631.26">bothering me a little.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="631.26" data-end="634.93">Let's talk about technology.</span> <span data-start="634.93" data-end="640.61">There's an ongoing refrain, we know exactly what is going on, and it saddens me.</span> <span data-start="640.61" data-end="647.46">I mean, you just need to open up Twitter and wait five seconds before it hits you, and</span> <span data-start="647.46" data-end="650.08">I think that's sad.</span> <span data-start="650.08" data-end="657.42">It's been long discussed, you know, what needs to be done to retain talent, to attract talent,</span> <span data-start="657.42" data-end="661.32">and we still go out and sort of like trip over some of the main issues.</span> </p>
