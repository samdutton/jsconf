<p><span data-start="26.599" data-end="33.84">The web as a contender, what a provocative title for a JavaScript conference, I trust</span> <span data-start="33.84" data-end="41.329">you all members in the church of Tim Berners-Lee, any way who is the guy on stage, this is me,</span> <span data-start="41.329" data-end="49.539">Surma, I wrote with the Chrome team for Google in London, I do webby stuff I enjoy a lot,</span> <span data-start="49.539" data-end="54.149">I'm kind of here to talk about new things that are coming up on the web and some of</span> <span data-start="54.149" data-end="56.879">them are actually already there.</span> <span data-start="56.879" data-end="61.329">The first thing I want to show to you is the home screen experience, it's something that</span> <span data-start="61.329" data-end="65.17">is actually not on the web really, it's something, if you are on the home screen or you have</span> <span data-start="65.17" data-end="71.89">an icon on the home screen you expect the app to open up and do it's job even off line,</span> <span data-start="71.89" data-end="78.76">I went into aeroplane mode and I can save a voice memo, to the phone or disc rather,</span> <span data-start="78.76" data-end="86.44">I an even kill the app and reopen it and everything will be there, all the status there, data</span> <span data-start="86.44" data-end="93.13">there, this is kind of what we expect when something is on the home screen, this is also</span> <span data-start="93.13" data-end="100.299">something that so far it wasn't really plausible on the web, this is a web app that a colleague</span> <span data-start="100.299" data-end="106.92">of mine wrote, Paul Lewis and so some of you may have known the app or may have known that</span> <span data-start="106.92" data-end="111.75">this was possible, but I want to get everyone on the same level and also clear up a few</span> <span data-start="111.75" data-end="116.92">misconceptions about the current state of what is possible and what is not.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="116.92" data-end="123.219">So let's start with a few numbers first, when you look at Chrome, and I mean Chrome alone,</span> <span data-start="123.219" data-end="131.87">Chrome has over million users right now, that is a lot and just, as a side note, 25 million</span> <span data-start="131.87" data-end="138.8">of these one billion users open DevTools every week, not only do we have this huge amount</span> <span data-start="138.8" data-end="144.14">of users, you also, apparently, have you huge developer user base who try to go through</span> <span data-start="144.14" data-end="150.12">the same experience as you too and you should probably try and connect with them.</span> <span data-start="150.12" data-end="155.949">That was Chrome alone, if you add up all the popular browsers and few unpopular browsers</span> <span data-start="155.949" data-end="168.6">you end up with a huge number of people on the web, there is usually no way as you as</span> <span data-start="168.6" data-end="174.63">an indie developer to publish something there, but they too give you a web browser, suddenly</span> <span data-start="174.63" data-end="180.919">you have a way to do something on this device, with all these possibilities for people to</span> <span data-start="180.919" data-end="187.14">go on to the web, you actually find that the biggest strength is reach, if it's the, the</span> <span data-start="187.14" data-end="194">web is everywhere, on phones, on computers on Nintendo DS, in cars, even the ones without</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="194" data-end="201.29">Android auto, for the user really it's the most generic platform, if you know something</span> <span data-start="201.29" data-end="207.95">is on the web you will pretty surely find a way to access that thing, one way or the</span> <span data-start="207.95" data-end="209.82">other.</span> <span data-start="209.82" data-end="214.1">With all these possibilities you actually end up with a most impressive number, that</span> <span data-start="214.1" data-end="225.06">is that the average user uses over 100 websites a month, I've been assured by statisticians</span> <span data-start="225.06" data-end="231.579">this is a legit number, I hope they're right, compare that to the corresponding native number</span> <span data-start="231.579" data-end="238.65">which is that that average user uses about, between 12 and 20 native apps per month, so</span> <span data-start="238.65" data-end="239.65">there</span> <span data-start="239.65" data-end="243.78">is, native apps per month, there is a huge difference, another strength of the web jumping</span> <span data-start="243.78" data-end="251.84">to several different apps in few seconds is completely normal, try to imagine that experience</span> <span data-start="251.84" data-end="254.22">in the native format.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="254.22" data-end="261.35">Then recently, a kind of older article by bencher bead resurfaced and got a lot of attention</span> <span data-start="261.35" data-end="271.66">the headline read this: "The mobile war is over and the app has won", I was like what!</span> <span data-start="271.66" data-end="279.69">It was such a weird thing to say to me, for the first time I feel like the web can compete</span> <span data-start="279.69" data-end="287.18">in terms of performance technology features with the what native already have, secondly</span> <span data-start="287.18" data-end="293.03">did you hear the numbers I just said, how can they possibly justify making that statement</span> <span data-start="293.03" data-end="299.97">and of course in the article they justify it and it's this: the time you spend in native</span> <span data-start="299.97" data-end="307.59">apps takes up, up to 80% of your total time spent on a mobile device, so web is dead,</span> <span data-start="307.59" data-end="309.56">right, we're done.</span> <span data-start="309.56" data-end="314.13">Then again, once again you can take a closer look and you kind of realise it's not that</span> <span data-start="314.13" data-end="327.13">simple, of this 80%, 32% is for gaming, 80% for Facebook alone and 20% entertainment,</span> <span data-start="327.13" data-end="335.91">these are activities really time intensive, entertainment has something like Netflix,</span> <span data-start="335.91" data-end="341.68">an app open for 30 minutes, an episode of a series but you don't interact with it really,</span> <span data-start="341.68" data-end="347.54">you have games that you obviously do interact with and games is something that the web can't</span> <span data-start="347.54" data-end="349.57">really compete with in the long run.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="349.57" data-end="356.9">If again you remove â€” let's just call them special like corner cases, if you remove them</span> <span data-start="356.9" data-end="363.81">the landscape gets different and it's kind of a 50/50 thing between the web and native.</span> <span data-start="363.81" data-end="369.3">Also very important, the statistics that these graphs are based on, are actually based on</span> <span data-start="369.3" data-end="376.76">data from April 2013, so a lot of things have changed on the web since then, these numbers</span> <span data-start="376.76" data-end="381.45">might have shifted and if they have not, the things that I'm going to talk about, hopefully</span> <span data-start="381.45" data-end="384.77">and pretty surely will.</span> <span data-start="384.77" data-end="392.06">So yeah, let's talk about the things that going to change, before that Peter Paul Koch</span> <span data-start="392.06" data-end="398.93">suggested a short while ago a one year moratorium idea for the web, he was basically saying</span> <span data-start="398.93" data-end="404.65">the web is moving too fast and the browsers can't keep up and we should just stop for</span> <span data-start="404.65" data-end="415.4">an entire year and give the browsers chance to fix up, Jan Gruber, inventor, wrote a counter</span> <span data-start="415.4" data-end="420.83">of answer to that, I don't agree with everything he said this,-said this, "Native apps can't</span> <span data-start="420.83" data-end="430.76">out web the web", native and web seem very similar they have very different fundamental</span> <span data-start="430.76" data-end="437.35">assumptions at their core, so we should not try to just nail every feature that native</span> <span data-start="437.35" data-end="442.23">has on to the web, at least not and specially not in the same way, that's something to keep</span> <span data-start="442.23" data-end="443.23">in mind.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="443.23" data-end="449.669">An example for this would be, does every web site get access to my webcam, on both native</span> <span data-start="449.669" data-end="455.56">and web you would say, of course not, you would ask for permission just in time or for</span> <span data-start="455.56" data-end="462.41">native you can do a batch grant thing at install time, right, does every website get background</span> <span data-start="462.41" data-end="467.889">sync, probably not, but do you want to bug your user about it every time you want to</span> <span data-start="467.889" data-end="477.93">do back time sync, we don't have an installation dialogue for batch granting or central authority</span> <span data-start="477.93" data-end="483.29">to check if the things that app is doing are actually saying, everybody can publish on</span> <span data-start="483.29" data-end="489.8">the web, you see how this is like a really big UI and UX challenge for the browser vendors</span> <span data-start="489.8" data-end="495.889">to face, they want to make it secure for the users but give you the developers as much</span> <span data-start="495.889" data-end="499.12">capabilities as possible.</span> <span data-start="499.12" data-end="504.84">So just to make the app metaphor work even better on the web, think about this way, the</span> <span data-start="504.84" data-end="511.4">phone has all the apps installed, once you open them they actually get installed, downloaded</span> <span data-start="511.4" data-end="513.69">on the fly, this is how we can</span> <span data-start="513.69" data-end="518.99">think about web apps, the thing is right now, we don't expect web apps to really work off</span> <span data-start="518.99" data-end="524.81">line not to have an address bar or be on the home screen, these are the things I want to</span> <span data-start="524.81" data-end="526.56">address today.</span> <span data-start="526.56" data-end="531.899">Let's start with the fact that web apps are usually hard to reach, you have to type in</span> <span data-start="531.899" data-end="537.769">a URL on your tiny, tiny keyboard or phone, or you have a big one.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="537.769" data-end="542.47">You can add them to your home scene, you actually could have done that for a long time now,</span> <span data-start="542.47" data-end="549.26">but the feature is hidden, kind of like hidden in the menu and therefore it's hardly used.</span> <span data-start="549.26" data-end="555.839">That's something that needs to change, what has been proposed is app install banners,</span> <span data-start="555.839" data-end="562.83">basically if the user for fills certain criteria and right now users your web app twice in</span> <span data-start="562.83" data-end="569.11">a timeframe of two weeks, this app, this banner will be proposed to him and he can, with one</span> <span data-start="569.11" data-end="573.879">click, move it to his home screen and suddenly you have combined the reach of the web with</span> <span data-start="573.879" data-end="578.949">like stickiness of native apps, because it's now on your home screen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="578.949" data-end="585.93">On your side you have to fulfil things as well, you have to have web manifest, it looks</span> <span data-start="585.93" data-end="593.58">something like this, a name, icon, a colour, you have an entry URL, in this case I also</span> <span data-start="593.58" data-end="602.029">added a query path to the URL, so I can check if people are using this, icon I defined in</span> <span data-start="602.029" data-end="609.509">the icon area, will be on my home screen in distinguishable from the native apps.</span> <span data-start="609.509" data-end="614.959">Since I said in the gene beginning it comes with certain expectations from the user, you</span> <span data-start="614.959" data-end="621.589">have to HTTPS, that the banner is shown in the first place.</span> <span data-start="621.589" data-end="628.779">It's a kind of way for us to incentivise keeping the whole home screen expectation thing a</span> <span data-start="628.779" data-end="631.79">solid thing.</span> <span data-start="631.79" data-end="637.29">Also by the way, just as a side remark, you can delay the prompt, but there is no way</span> <span data-start="637.29" data-end="641.889">for you to prompt earlier for it, this just something, otherwise spam sites will pop it</span> <span data-start="641.889" data-end="646.509">over hand over of you, it will just be annoying right, so that's something to keep in work.</span> <span data-start="646.509" data-end="649.8">Let's talk about service worker, I've talked about it twice.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="649.8" data-end="656.249">Service worker, are kind of a silver bullet.</span> <span data-start="656.249" data-end="662.8">By themselves they don't really address any shortcomings that we have, versus native.</span> <span data-start="662.8" data-end="667.38">So, they however give us the way that the work, give us a common entry point or even</span> <span data-start="667.38" data-end="674.769">some API to all the apps, so they are really a new concept in the framework of web apps.</span> <span data-start="674.769" data-end="680.459">So what they are really is just a background process, a JavaScript background process that</span> <span data-start="680.459" data-end="686.47">decoupled from your apps main thread, it's actually running separately, however it is</span> <span data-start="686.47" data-end="692.89">connected to every instance of your app that you can think of that to every tap that is</span> <span data-start="692.89" data-end="696.639">currently open that is part of your app.</span> <span data-start="696.639" data-end="701.79">They are a background process but they are not really long running, they're more available</span> <span data-start="701.79" data-end="708.1">and they are bound to a life cycle events, foreground events and background events.</span> <span data-start="708.1" data-end="715.67">There is some communication going on, but you don't do like long running work really.</span> <span data-start="715.67" data-end="720.839">Also the cool thing about this concept is that they are progressive enhancement, so</span> <span data-start="720.839" data-end="726.11">if the browser doesn't support service worker, everything will work as before, if the browser</span> <span data-start="726.11" data-end="731.459">does support them a whole new extended experience is offered to the user.</span> <span data-start="731.459" data-end="737.31">A colleague of mine Jake Archibald wrote this website, which is called is service worker</span> <span data-start="737.31" data-end="743.959">ready, it comes witness a lot of APIs and I'll only be able to cover a few of these</span> <span data-start="743.959" data-end="751.26">in this talk, he has basically a listing of all the service worker APIs, short tests for</span> <span data-start="751.26" data-end="756.889">them so you can see if your browser supports this feature and a little bit of demo code</span> <span data-start="756.889" data-end="763.36">to see if you can use it or links to the official specification obviously.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="763.36" data-end="767.009">So let's start using service worker, it's actually kind of simple, the first thing I</span> <span data-start="767.009" data-end="773.019">do is use feature detection I check if the object is a call to service worker, I have</span> <span data-start="773.019" data-end="778.329">been it does I can ensure that service worker is supported, then I call register with a</span> <span data-start="778.329" data-end="784.019">link to file, literally downloaded and executed inside the service worker, that returns a</span> <span data-start="784.019" data-end="789.949">promise and once installation has been completed and completed successfully, this promise will</span> <span data-start="789.949" data-end="791.199">resolve.</span> <span data-start="791.199" data-end="796.749">This service worker will be scoped to your current website and the current path, you</span> <span data-start="796.749" data-end="802.04">can make the path narrower, so you are scoping yourself to an even longer path but you can't</span> <span data-start="802.04" data-end="805.88">go upwards, it's just kind of a security feature.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="805.88" data-end="812.009">So now we have the service worker running, what do we too next?</span> <span data-start="812.009" data-end="817.259">They are a kind of network proxy for all the requests that your site is doing.</span> <span data-start="817.259" data-end="824.779">So this let's you too like very sophisticated caching and complex off line experiences,</span> <span data-start="824.779" data-end="829.41">even for the data from other origins, for example in this graphic I hinted the image</span> <span data-start="829.41" data-end="837.309">is hosted on G plus, you can actually cache the response, since another origin you can't</span> <span data-start="837.309" data-end="841.47">expect it, it's called an opaque response, you know there is something in there, you</span> <span data-start="841.47" data-end="847.269">don't know anything about it but you can put it into a cache, if it's your own data you</span> <span data-start="847.269" data-end="849.949">can manipulate the request and the response.</span> </p>
