<p><span data-start="8.41" data-end="11.389">okay i want to start with the demo right</span> <span data-start="11.389" data-end="15.41">away this is an app called paper cube by</span> <span data-start="15.41" data-end="18.439">Peter Bergstrom and here to here it is</span> <span data-start="18.439" data-end="21.109">it's a this is an experimental tool to</span> <span data-start="21.109" data-end="23.029">help you navigate through when you like</span> <span data-start="23.029" data-end="24.949">find the relationships between research</span> <span data-start="24.949" data-end="28.58">papers which have oh we're oh there we</span> <span data-start="28.58" data-end="36.01">go that's because I'm about that what</span> <span data-start="36.01" data-end="41.67">totally all right here's what we'll do</span> <span data-start="41.68" data-end="44.89">I'm going to spin myself around okay so</span> <span data-start="44.89" data-end="50.15">I this is a tool for exploring academic</span> <span data-start="50.15" data-end="52.73">papers as you know papers with their</span> <span data-start="52.73" data-end="55.1">citations and the author's it has a real</span> <span data-start="55.1" data-end="57.11">it's a really interesting problem space</span> <span data-start="57.11" data-end="59.54">because the documents have such rich</span> <span data-start="59.54" data-end="61.64">metadata about connections to other</span> <span data-start="61.64" data-end="64.4">documents so Peter made this tool using</span> <span data-start="64.4" data-end="65.449">the framework I'm going to talk to you</span> <span data-start="65.449" data-end="67.49">about called called sprout core all</span> <span data-start="67.49" data-end="70.25">right so I already did a search of by</span> <span data-start="70.25" data-end="73.13">author name which the app is cached here</span> <span data-start="73.13" data-end="74.929">just in case there was a network lag but</span> <span data-start="74.929" data-end="77.6">so I looked for an all the authors whose</span> <span data-start="77.6" data-end="81.759">last name is Smith and you can see this</span> <span data-start="81.759" data-end="86.81">second one here this paper has got four</span> <span data-start="86.81" data-end="89.24">authors and it's been cited 78 x so this</span> <span data-start="89.24" data-end="90.979">is a really good one just to show off</span> <span data-start="90.979" data-end="93.229">what this tool could do so you can see</span> <span data-start="93.229" data-end="95.659">right away as soon as I made that</span> <span data-start="95.659" data-end="99.2">selection whatever data this app already</span> <span data-start="99.2" data-end="101.45">knows about starts loading you know I</span> <span data-start="101.45" data-end="104.03">have a kind of a slow connection here</span> <span data-start="104.03" data-end="106.88">which under normal demo circumstances</span> <span data-start="106.88" data-end="108.829">would be like kind of a bummer but it's</span> <span data-start="108.829" data-end="110.689">actually totally perfect for want to</span> <span data-start="110.689" data-end="111.679">talk to you about as far as I'm</span> <span data-start="111.679" data-end="114.109">concerned this could take like five more</span> <span data-start="114.109" data-end="116.06">minutes to load but we can move on from</span> <span data-start="116.06" data-end="118.7">here okay so it's right away you got to</span> <span data-start="118.7" data-end="120.59">see whatever your the local app knew</span> <span data-start="120.59" data-end="122.659">about and then the rest under the covers</span> <span data-start="122.659" data-end="124.969">the app is going back to the server to</span> <span data-start="124.969" data-end="127.549">get as much data as there is to know</span> <span data-start="127.549" data-end="130.76">about about this object and you know we</span> <span data-start="130.76" data-end="132.32">don't have the source code for this I</span> <span data-start="132.32" data-end="132.98">mean we</span> <span data-start="132.98" data-end="134.81">we could look and you know use an</span> <span data-start="134.81" data-end="135.98">inspector we don't have it all nicely</span> <span data-start="135.98" data-end="137.569">formatted but I mean I bet you'd be</span> <span data-start="137.569" data-end="140.42">really shocked at how little work the</span> <span data-start="140.42" data-end="142.549">developer needed to do to make all this</span> <span data-start="142.549" data-end="144.44">kind of work but based on my experiences</span> <span data-start="144.44" data-end="146.45">with it so that's that's pretty cool i</span> <span data-start="146.45" data-end="148.43">think everyone can see that applies to</span> <span data-start="148.43" data-end="149.42">some of the problems you're trying to</span> <span data-start="149.42" data-end="152.03">solve but it's got some other pretty</span> <span data-start="152.03" data-end="154.73">interesting feature so let's look at a</span> <span data-start="154.73" data-end="157.87">graph you all right that's pretty cool</span> <span data-start="157.87" data-end="161.03">but this is only showing me one level of</span> <span data-start="161.03" data-end="163.549">connection let's let's dial it up a</span> <span data-start="163.549" data-end="165.11">little bit show me three levels of</span> <span data-start="165.11" data-end="168.14">connections so it's cool going back to</span> <span data-start="168.14" data-end="170.92">server getting getting more objects I</span> <span data-start="170.92" data-end="177.76">want to Texas too much we can zoom in I</span> <span data-start="177.76" data-end="180.95">think we even have like we want to save</span> <span data-start="180.95" data-end="183.5">it for later I don't want to do too much</span> <span data-start="183.5" data-end="184.97">as I don't know all the commands I want</span> <span data-start="184.97" data-end="186.349">to break something everybody that's a</span> <span data-start="186.349" data-end="188.15">pretty noisy graph so let's say I don't</span> <span data-start="188.15" data-end="189.53">know I don't care about papers that have</span> <span data-start="189.53" data-end="190.879">been only want to see things have been</span> <span data-start="190.879" data-end="194.66">cited more than you know ten times so</span> <span data-start="194.66" data-end="199.25">that's pretty cool okay so that's why</span> <span data-start="199.25" data-end="201.139">what I wanted to start off with here it</span> <span data-start="201.139" data-end="205">looks like a lost keynote no problem</span> <span data-start="205" data-end="208.22">okay so while I'm waiting for my slides</span> <span data-start="208.22" data-end="212.209">to load back up oh well I wanted to</span> <span data-start="212.209" data-end="213.799">point i wanted to point out a couple of</span> <span data-start="213.799" data-end="217.28">things about that at here we go it's</span> <span data-start="217.28" data-end="222.889">coming back this whole display here is</span> <span data-start="222.889" data-end="224.84">very it was very fast and fluid you</span> <span data-start="224.84" data-end="230.209">notice that oh man I've angered the demo</span> <span data-start="230.209" data-end="232.31">gods I'm really sorry I'm telling you</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="232.31" data-end="234.59">I'm actually yeah I'm we're gonna get</span> <span data-start="234.59" data-end="236.769">this back on track here all right</span> <span data-start="236.769" data-end="240.459">awesome so what the things I that I</span> <span data-start="240.459" data-end="244.16">really like about this this application</span> <span data-start="244.16" data-end="246.59">why I wanted to show it to you first of</span> <span data-start="246.59" data-end="248.239">all it's very fast and fluid I mean</span> <span data-start="248.239" data-end="251.12">there was it just had a very native feel</span> <span data-start="251.12" data-end="253.129">to it didn't feel like I was using a</span> <span data-start="253.129" data-end="255.919">traditional web app like him from it was</span> <span data-start="255.919" data-end="257.419">on very much on the far right of the</span> <span data-start="257.419" data-end="259.25">spectrum that Francisco drew for us</span> <span data-start="259.25" data-end="261.919">yesterday it's clearly like the exact</span> <span data-start="261.919" data-end="263.24">kind of thing we've been talking about</span> <span data-start="263.24" data-end="265.52">for two days here so I don't usually I</span> <span data-start="265.52" data-end="266.78">spend some more time explain</span> <span data-start="266.78" data-end="268.49">why it's a good idea to use javascript</span> <span data-start="268.49" data-end="270.2">for this how it's the future but you</span> <span data-start="270.2" data-end="271.67">guys already are totally up to speed on</span> <span data-start="271.67" data-end="274.19">that its web native there's no plugins</span> <span data-start="274.19" data-end="276.56">involved with that to make that appt</span> <span data-start="276.56" data-end="280.13">work it's all HTML Javascript CSS and</span> <span data-start="280.13" data-end="284">like SVG and the another thing that's</span> <span data-start="284" data-end="285.71">great about it what kind of makes it all</span> <span data-start="285.71" data-end="287.18">work is that the client has a lot of</span> <span data-start="287.18" data-end="289.91">local agency it's not going the servers</span> <span data-start="289.91" data-end="292.46">at rendering HTML or really does the</span> <span data-start="292.46" data-end="293.72">server doesn't care at all what the</span> <span data-start="293.72" data-end="294.95">clients displaying to mean there's</span> <span data-start="294.95" data-end="298.07">actually no reason in fact the server is</span> <span data-start="298.07" data-end="300.02">not worried about the UI in any way the</span> <span data-start="300.02" data-end="302.9">server is providing a service it's just</span> <span data-start="302.9" data-end="305.18">returning JSON I just ran a sniff around</span> <span data-start="305.18" data-end="307.19">here so there's nothing to stop any of</span> <span data-start="307.19" data-end="310.34">us from writing a completely different</span> <span data-start="310.34" data-end="312.89">client for the different framework to do</span> <span data-start="312.89" data-end="315.44">other things with this data and is it</span> <span data-start="315.44" data-end="317.12">does it won't bother Peter in the</span> <span data-start="317.12" data-end="319.7">slightest effect to borrow a code</span> <span data-start="319.7" data-end="322.28">snippet from my product from other inbox</span> <span data-start="322.28" data-end="325.88">like we have a little bit more lines of</span> <span data-start="325.88" data-end="327.86">code here but this I have action that's</span> <span data-start="327.86" data-end="329.45">basically the entire core of our</span> <span data-start="329.45" data-end="331.22">applicant if something broke with this</span> <span data-start="331.22" data-end="333.41">it would cause a whole lot of problems</span> <span data-start="333.41" data-end="336.26">for our clients i'm just i just have a</span> <span data-start="336.26" data-end="338.18">class that absorb i initialize a class</span> <span data-start="338.18" data-end="339.83">with some parameters that the user has</span> <span data-start="339.83" data-end="342.289">passed and when I turn into a hash that</span> <span data-start="342.289" data-end="345.2">gives you back an object graph which I</span> <span data-start="345.2" data-end="347.3">then converting to JSON so of course the</span> <span data-start="347.3" data-end="349.91">big you know epiphany I had here which I</span> <span data-start="349.91" data-end="351.68">you know up a little bit late to the</span> <span data-start="351.68" data-end="353.33">party or really late to the party is</span> <span data-start="353.33" data-end="354.5">like well we're going to all this</span> <span data-start="354.5" data-end="356.45">trouble what am i doing I'm constructing</span> <span data-start="356.45" data-end="358.49">a document I'm just converting to Jason</span> <span data-start="358.49" data-end="359.78">well I should probably be finding some</span> <span data-start="359.78" data-end="361.94">way to just all have this JSON already</span> <span data-start="361.94" data-end="363.169">and kind of cut out the middleman of it</span> <span data-start="363.169" data-end="365">that's a completely separate talk the</span> <span data-start="365" data-end="367.13">fact is it's just this is just really</span> <span data-start="367.13" data-end="368.57">clean-looking I think we can all see the</span> <span data-start="368.57" data-end="371.18">appeal of this and it's a million times</span> <span data-start="371.18" data-end="373.61">better than what I had before when I was</span> <span data-start="373.61" data-end="375.169">trying to make one of those apps on the</span> <span data-start="375.169" data-end="377.39">far right of you know the really rich</span> <span data-start="377.39" data-end="378.83">interactive app but I was using the</span> <span data-start="378.83" data-end="380.03">techniques or something in the middle of</span> <span data-start="380.03" data-end="381.71">that spectrum like out I was just using</span> <span data-start="381.71" data-end="383.96">partial page updates I had you told this</span> <span data-start="383.96" data-end="385.789">glue code I had a million different</span> <span data-start="385.789" data-end="388.16">controller actions and custom JavaScript</span> <span data-start="388.16" data-end="390.35">mixed with rjs and it was just really a</span> <span data-start="390.35" data-end="393.88">bear to maintain and users hated it so</span> <span data-start="393.88" data-end="396.77">my name is mike c Belski i'm here to</span> <span data-start="396.77" data-end="399.98">give you a reduction to sprout core</span> </p>

so</span> <span data-start="909.47" data-end="912.2">finding this its really three different</span> <span data-start="912.2" data-end="914.46">components in one that make this work</span> <span data-start="914.46" data-end="917.28">its key value coding key value</span> <span data-start="917.28" data-end="920.76">observation and bindings alright so the</span> <span data-start="920.76" data-end="922.71">reason why these are big deal is because</span> <span data-start="922.71" data-end="925.38">they're what help you avoid glue code to</span> <span data-start="925.38"

so here's</span> <span data-start="960.12" data-end="962.43">here's how it saves you time saves you</span> <span data-start="962.43" data-end="964.53">from writing all that awful code key</span> <span data-start="964.53" data-end="966.75">value coding it just means from now on</span> <span data-start="966.75" data-end="970.14">anytime you want to access a property or</span> <span

data-end="985.71">ill-advised to do it because by using</span> <span data-start="985.71" data-end="989.25">key value coding it gives you a chance</span> <span data-start="989.25" data-end="992.31">to

data-end="2206.4">bugs me ok so the album controller it's</span> <span data-start="2206.4" data-end="2209.22">bound to whichever you know this you</span> <span data-start="2209.22" data-end="2212.4">have a photos master controller I mean</span> <span data-start="2212.4" data-end="2214.29">that looks very familiar that's exactly</span> <span data-start="2214.29" data-end="2215.52">the same pattern now that we've already</span> <span data-start="2215.52" data-end="2218.7">seen so let me close up some of these</span> <span data-start="2218.7" data-end="2228.24">windows here okay I things get a little</span> <span data-start="2228.24" data-end="2229.8">more interesting in the details</span> <span data-start="2229.8" data-end="2232.62">controller right so you have another</span> <span data-start="2232.62" data-end="2236.73">content binding that now now we have we</span> <span data-start="2236.73"

we need to recompute count label</span> <span data-start="2256.5" data-end="2259.71">so that's the code that recompute sit</span> <span data-start="2259.71" data-end="2261.81">well you know you always are using key</span> <span data-start="2261.81" data-end="2263.67">value coding even if you're accessing</span> <span data-start="2263.67" data-end="2267.72">your own properties and that's all</span> <span data-start="2267.72" data-end="2270.45">that's pretty straightforward here this</span> <span data-start="2270.45" data-end="2273.99">that slider the resize of things it's</span> <span

data-start="2287.43" data-end="2289.2">down here so this is all the code you</span> <span data-start="2289.2" data-end="2291.96">need to turn on that slider you give it</span> <span

data-start="2300.03" data-end="2301.55">basically it and then you can have</span> <span data-start="2301.55" data-end="2304.44">somewhere else in here we'll find</span> <span data-start="2304.44" data-end="2306.9">somebody else who like probably that</span> <span data-start="2306.9" data-end="2309.03">whatever the controller is that are the</span> <span data-start="2309.03"

data-end="2315.06">you're asking to be notified of changes</span> <span data-start="2315.06" data-end="2317.099">to photo size and so then they resize</span> <span data-start="2317.099" data-end="2319.17">them fact why don't I just show you that</span> <span data-start="2319.17" data-end="2326.04">see if we can find that so there it's</span> <span data-start="2326.04" data-end="2327.27">not there maybe there's somewhere else</span> <span data-start="2327.27" data-end="2330.869">in here I don't want to anger the demo</span> <span data-start="2330.869"
