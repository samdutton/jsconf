<p><span data-start="17.119" data-end="18.619">Hello everybody.</span> <span data-start="18.619" data-end="21.619">My name is Michele with one L.</span> <span data-start="21.619" data-end="26.16">This is my talk "It takes a village to make a programmer".</span> <span data-start="26.16" data-end="28">It's a talk in 2 parts.</span> <span data-start="28" data-end="33.5">The first part is my story and the second part is a bunch of suggestions for you, for</span> <span data-start="33.5" data-end="35.3">how you can help in your own village.</span> <span data-start="35.3" data-end="40.97">To start my story..</span> <span data-start="40.97" data-end="45.879">I went to school for teaching and I unfortunately graduated at the height of the recession in</span> <span data-start="45.879" data-end="47.12">the United States.</span> <span data-start="47.12" data-end="51.609">So I ended up not getting a teaching job and I was just substitute teaching, which I think</span> <span data-start="51.609" data-end="55.21">is the most demoralizing job in the world.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="55.21" data-end="58.989">I was really unhappy for awhile.</span> <span data-start="58.989" data-end="63.82">I realized I would have to move to get a job and I thought: if I'm going to move away for</span> <span data-start="63.82" data-end="66.89">a job, I'm going to move far, far away.</span> <span data-start="66.89" data-end="71.54">After 2 years of substitute teaching, I moved to Germany.</span> <span data-start="71.54" data-end="78.22">When I got here, I got a random office job that wasn't going to be permanent.</span> <span data-start="78.22" data-end="80.74">I realized I had a big decision to make.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="80.74" data-end="84.479">There were lots of different directions my professional career could go.</span> <span data-start="84.479" data-end="89.06">I had thrown around the idea of maybe becoming a UX designer.</span> <span data-start="89.06" data-end="91.8">I could teach English as a foreign language.</span> <span data-start="91.8" data-end="93.929">I could try to go back to teaching.</span> <span data-start="93.929" data-end="97.86">I could keep this office job if I really wanted to.</span> <span data-start="97.86" data-end="100.7">Or I could do something totally different.</span> <span data-start="100.7" data-end="106.53">So, one day at my office job  —  I was an office manager for a tour operator for people who</span> <span data-start="106.53" data-end="111.05">went on cruises  —  we got a bill from our programmers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="111.05" data-end="113.77">The bill was really outrageous.</span> <span data-start="113.77" data-end="120.08">It was for this really simple customer feedback form that we asked them to create for us.</span> <span data-start="120.08" data-end="125.55">I had written back and forth to them about 10 times with all these little things that</span> <span data-start="125.55" data-end="128.38">they could have done to make it better.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="128.38" data-end="132.91">I was taking German courses at the time and afterwards I had gone out with my classmates.</span> <span data-start="132.91" data-end="138.6">I was so angry and so upset about this, I was raving to them about how I could do it</span> <span data-start="138.6" data-end="139.6">better..</span> <span data-start="139.6" data-end="141.93">I should be a programmer..</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="141.93" data-end="143.8">I could do this..</span> <span data-start="143.8" data-end="150.069">I didn't take myself very seriously, but one of my classmates did.</span> <span data-start="150.069" data-end="153.909">She emailed me about a course that was going to be offered in Berlin called "Front-end</span> <span data-start="153.909" data-end="157.599">web development for beginners".</span> <span data-start="157.599" data-end="163.15">It was really expensive, so I sent an email to my brother saying "Hey, there's this course.</span> <span data-start="163.15" data-end="164.64">Wanna sponsor me?</span> <span data-start="164.64" data-end="165.64">LOL"</span> <span data-start="165.64" data-end="169.349">I got the loving response from him of: nothing.</span> <span data-start="169.349" data-end="171.76">I wrote to him a second time, "No, seriously.</span> <span data-start="171.76" data-end="173.269">What do you think?</span> <span data-start="173.269" data-end="175.569">Will you help me out?"</span> <span data-start="175.569" data-end="179.349">He said yes, so I took the course.</span> <span data-start="179.349" data-end="184.499">Halfway through the course, one of the people working for General Assembly  —  the company</span> <span data-start="184.499" data-end="189.15">where I took it  —  was also running a group here in Berlin called "Berlin Geekettes".</span> <span data-start="189.15" data-end="191.589">I found out they were offering a hackathon.</span> <span data-start="191.589" data-end="199.04">So after 6 weeks with just knowledge of HTML and CSS, I participated in my first hackathon.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="199.04" data-end="200.9">This was where I had my "Holy.</span> <span data-start="200.9" data-end="202.459">Shit." moment.</span> <span data-start="202.459" data-end="204.959">I was like, "Oh my god!"</span> <span data-start="204.959" data-end="208.739">The energy that you could feel in the room, when everybody was just getting together and</span> <span data-start="208.739" data-end="212.739">hashing out their ideas and forming teams and working together..</span> <span data-start="212.739" data-end="214.38">The energy was electric.</span> <span data-start="214.38" data-end="219.079">I looked around and I just saw amazing things happening.</span> <span data-start="219.079" data-end="223.62">People were taking ideas that just existed inside of their own head, and using nothing</span> <span data-start="223.62" data-end="228.65">but their computer and their hands and people around them they were taking this idea and</span> <span data-start="228.65" data-end="232.829">making it into something that other people could do and use and interact with.</span> <span data-start="232.829" data-end="234.779">I thought that was amazing.</span> <span data-start="234.779" data-end="238.06">I thought: I want to do that and I want to do that and I want to do that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="238.06" data-end="241.519">I want to be able to do everything.</span> <span data-start="241.519" data-end="244.51">I ended up quitting my office job.</span> <span data-start="244.51" data-end="247.5">I finally realized what I wanted to do.</span> <span data-start="247.5" data-end="249.53">And I thought, OK I am going to do it.</span> <span data-start="249.53" data-end="255.969">Berlin is the city where you can take some time off and afford it, so I decided to do</span> <span data-start="255.969" data-end="257.639">this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="257.639" data-end="262.889">I had a lot of free time on my hands once I was unemployed and I heard about a conference</span> <span data-start="262.889" data-end="264.14">called Eurocamp.</span> <span data-start="264.14" data-end="267.34">It's a Ruby conference that happens here in Berlin.</span> <span data-start="267.34" data-end="270.56">I'd never heard about anything like a tech conference before.</span> <span data-start="270.56" data-end="273.25">It was never something really on my radar.</span> <span data-start="273.25" data-end="277.71">I thought, cool, an event where everybody is interested in the same thing and they go</span> <span data-start="277.71" data-end="279.12">there and hang out?</span> <span data-start="279.12" data-end="280.59">I want to go!</span> <span data-start="280.59" data-end="284.87">A couple of people I knew had gotten tickets through Rails Girls.</span> <span data-start="284.87" data-end="288.819">They'd gotten them for free through a diversity outreach program.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="288.819" data-end="290.65">But there were no tickets left.</span> <span data-start="290.65" data-end="294.84">I couldn't afford go myself, being unemployed.</span> <span data-start="294.84" data-end="299.52">They said "follow the Twitter account and maybe somebody will sell theirs for free,</span> <span data-start="299.52" data-end="302.71">or get rid of it for a cheap price!"</span> <span data-start="302.71" data-end="307.49">I started following the account and I saw this guy, Bruno and he tweeted: So, I have</span> <span data-start="307.49" data-end="310.56">my Eurocamp ticket and unfortunately I can't go.</span> <span data-start="310.56" data-end="311.59">Let's make it count.</span> <span data-start="311.59" data-end="314.25">Give me a good reason and it's free.</span> <span data-start="314.25" data-end="315.48">#givesomethingback</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="315.48" data-end="319.81">I tweeted at him right away and I wasn't sure if I could get the ticket  —  I didn't know</span> <span data-start="319.81" data-end="324.08">what other people I was competing with and what reasons they had  —  but I said: I'm really</span> <span data-start="324.08" data-end="327.58">passionate, please give me a chance.</span> <span data-start="327.58" data-end="330.419">And I did get the ticket.</span> <span data-start="330.419" data-end="332.83">I got the ticket with several stipulations.</span> <span data-start="332.83" data-end="335.949">He said: OK, you can have the ticket, but I have three rules.</span> <span data-start="335.949" data-end="338.199">Number 1: You have to have fun.</span> <span data-start="338.199" data-end="339.3">You have to have a lot of fun.</span> <span data-start="339.3" data-end="341.34">I said I can do that.</span> <span data-start="341.34" data-end="344.862">Number 2: Find my friend Justine, she is giving a talk, give her a hug.</span> <span data-start="344.862" data-end="347.97">I said I can do that, too.</span> <span data-start="347.97" data-end="351.52">Number 3: I don't care what you do, what it is.</span> <span data-start="351.52" data-end="354.59">Somehow you need to give back to the community.</span> <span data-start="354.59" data-end="356.74">I said: OK, I can do that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="356.74" data-end="360.44">So that's part of what I'm here doing today: hoping that I can inspire you to give back</span> <span data-start="360.44" data-end="362.95">to your communities as well.</span> <span data-start="362.95" data-end="369.07">I went to the conference and it was way more impactful in my life than I ever could have</span> <span data-start="369.07" data-end="370.07">imagined.</span> <span data-start="370.07" data-end="376.669">It was where I took my first Rails Girls workshop and I decided I did not want to start programming</span> <span data-start="376.669" data-end="379.139">by learning Rails.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="379.139" data-end="383.379">One of the girls I attended with went on to become one of my best friends.</span> <span data-start="383.379" data-end="387.96">I was exposed to the idea of lightning talks for the first time and that was the first</span> <span data-start="387.96" data-end="391.389">time I thought to myself: maybe I can be a speaker too.</span> <span data-start="391.389" data-end="392.389">Five minutes?</span> <span data-start="392.389" data-end="394.55">I can do that!</span> <span data-start="394.55" data-end="400.039">Probably the most important thing was this talk that was given at the Rails Girls workshop</span> <span data-start="400.039" data-end="405.47">by another woman who had changed careers one year after her first Rails Girls workshop.</span> <span data-start="405.47" data-end="410">I don't remember a single thing about her talk, because I just sat there the whole time</span> <span data-start="410" data-end="414.74">after she had been introduced, thinking to myself: I'm going to do that, and I'm going</span> <span data-start="414.74" data-end="418.31">to do it faster and I'm going to do it better.</span> <span data-start="418.31" data-end="422.699">Since then, she has actually seen me give this talk and we have spoken about it.</span> <span data-start="422.699" data-end="427.16">She is cool with it, because you want your talk to impact people and how effective is</span> <span data-start="427.16" data-end="433.35">your talk if you don't even have to give it for it to have such a profound inspiration?</span> <span data-start="433.35" data-end="440.039">So, I attended this wonderful conference and was back to my unemployed life.</span> <span data-start="440.039" data-end="443.28">I had 5 really good days.</span> <span data-start="443.28" data-end="449.539">5 great days where I was working from the moment I woke up until a reasonable hour in</span> <span data-start="449.539" data-end="450.539">the evening.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="450.539" data-end="456.539">Keeping track of what I was doing, how much time I spent learning each thing..</span> <span data-start="456.539" data-end="459.32">It was really productive first week.</span> <span data-start="459.32" data-end="461.78">After that everything went downhill.</span> <span data-start="461.78" data-end="467.47">I don't know how much you have tried to do completely on your own, but it is not easy.</span> <span data-start="467.47" data-end="470.53">After that it became a big struggle.</span> <span data-start="470.53" data-end="475.84">Luckily at the same time I met another guy, named Franks, who also quit his job.</span> <span data-start="475.84" data-end="481.99">We had these really symbiotic interests, where he was interested in learning more about teaching,</span> <span data-start="481.99" data-end="487.11">I was interested in learning more about programming and those were both our respective careers,</span> <span data-start="487.11" data-end="488.969">so we teamed up.</span> <span data-start="488.969" data-end="491.77">He became a real huge mentor for me.</span> <span data-start="491.77" data-end="494.4">He would hang out with me and pair program.</span> <span data-start="494.4" data-end="499.271">He would whip up a gist and explain a concept if I was getting trouble getting it and we</span> <span data-start="499.271" data-end="501.039">weren't together.</span> <span data-start="501.039" data-end="503.389">He wrote homework assignments for me.</span> <span data-start="503.389" data-end="507.74">He really pushed my learning forward and helped me to have somebody to rely on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="507.74" data-end="514.9">Somebody I could trust and ask questions and help me improve and expand my knowledge.</span> <span data-start="514.9" data-end="521.76">Soon after this  —  because relying on Franks wouldn't have been enough  —  I found about</span> <span data-start="521.76" data-end="526.18">a program that was being piloted in Berlin called Hackership.</span> <span data-start="526.18" data-end="530.69">It's based on the Hackerschool in New York, if you're familiar with that.</span> <span data-start="530.69" data-end="537.94">It is a full time learning program for programmers of all levels of experience.</span> <span data-start="537.94" data-end="545.41">Basically, what you do is come together full time and just working on learning whatever</span> <span data-start="545.41" data-end="547.889">you are interested in.</span> <span data-start="547.889" data-end="553.99">Not only do you have mentors provided for you, but you're working alongside other people,</span> <span data-start="553.99" data-end="556.47">so it's like a real academic setting.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="556.47" data-end="561.88">It helps you have somewhere to go and you get to put on workshops yourself.</span> <span data-start="561.88" data-end="567.209">One of the best parts was, at the end of every week we had to give presentations to the whole</span> <span data-start="567.209" data-end="572.72">group, so I got to practice my public speaking and got to share what I was working on during</span> <span data-start="572.72" data-end="578.48">these six weeks, which was a web application that I was building in Ruby without any frameworks</span> <span data-start="578.48" data-end="583.07">or any libraries except for the crypto stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="583.07" data-end="588.41">The thing I was most proud of was the user authentication system I wrote.</span> <span data-start="588.41" data-end="590.12">That was really cool.</span> <span data-start="590.12" data-end="594.19">That was for 6 weeks and that really pushed my learning forward.</span> <span data-start="594.19" data-end="597.32">Just to recap on the timeline of the situation..</span> <span data-start="597.32" data-end="603.89">January 22, 2013  —  last year  —  that was when I wrote my first "Hello world" at this</span> <span data-start="603.89" data-end="606.7">front-end web development course.</span> <span data-start="606.7" data-end="615.56">And January 21st of this year  —  2014  —  I got not one, but two junior developer job</span> <span data-start="615.56" data-end="616.84">offers.</span> <span data-start="616.84" data-end="622.51">Once I finally got over the fear of looking for a job.</span> <span data-start="622.51" data-end="625.98">(applause)</span> <span data-start="625.98" data-end="630.529">So, some really exciting news.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="630.529" data-end="631.95">I work for Sociomantic.</span> <span data-start="631.95" data-end="637.04">The team I started on was doing the CSS for ad banners.</span> <span data-start="637.04" data-end="642.16">So I have been doing CSS exclusively for the last six months, but I just found out this</span> <span data-start="642.16" data-end="649.81">week I got accepted to a new team where I will be doing native JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="649.81" data-end="653.63">(applause)</span> <span data-start="653.63" data-end="658.32">I got this job offer and I accepted it but because of some legal issues I had to wait</span> <span data-start="658.32" data-end="661.699">about a month-and-a-half before I could start working.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="661.699" data-end="667.38">Again I had some more free time, so I decided to apply to speak at my first conferences.</span> <span data-start="667.38" data-end="670.06">I got accepted to speak at my first conference.</span> <span data-start="670.06" data-end="673.03">It was another Ruby conference in Uruguay.</span> <span data-start="673.03" data-end="676.279">Uruguay is pretty far away from Berlin.</span> </p>
