<p><span data-start="283.55" data-end="286.94">That was usually event driven.</span> <span data-start="286.94" data-end="292.01">When the browser sees something happen, do these things.</span> <span data-start="292.01" data-end="298.66">In the state driven world, you instead say this is how I want the user to see this is</span> <span data-start="298.66" data-end="301.29">what I want the user to see for a given state.</span> <span data-start="301.29" data-end="304.57">And you tell that to the framework and the framework communicates with the browser on</span> <span data-start="304.57" data-end="306.31">your behalf.</span> <span data-start="306.31" data-end="309.91">This is a very director and performant way of updating the DOM.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1062.79" data-end="1068.97">With a traditional framework, the smallest chunk is at least as large as the framework</span> <span data-start="1068.97" data-end="1073.27">and the other dependencies that you're using and svelte doesn't have that problem.</span> <span data-start="1073.27" data-end="1077.38">As it happens, we can solve this problem.</span> <span data-start="1077.38" data-end="1084.88">Conduit is an application that is part of the real-world project which is an endeavor</span> <span data-start="1084.88" data-end="1091.09">to get different frameworks to build the same app to see how they compare at a real use</span> <span data-start="1091.09" data-end="1092.09">case.</span> <span data-start="1092.09" data-end="1094.07">It's basically a medium frame.</span> <span data-start="1094.07" data-end="1103.7">And according to a recent article, it just svelte is down here in the middle next to</span> <span data-start="1103.7" data-end="1106.22">Apron and 2.</span> <span data-start="1106.22" data-end="1109.66">This is the initial payload size.</span> <span data-start="1109.66" data-end="1113.46">This is the React implementation.</span> <span data-start="1113.46" data-end="1117.37">It's not entirely fair, this isn't using code splitting and svelte is.</span> <span data-start="1117.37" data-end="1123.95">But adding all the JavaScript assets, svelte is about 40% of the size of the React one.</span> <span data-start="1123.95" data-end="1124.95">It definitely does scale.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1124.95" data-end="1130.19">And we can see the effect in the startup metrics.</span> <span data-start="1130.19" data-end="1134.34">This is 3 seconds, time to first meaningful paint, and the other version is about a second</span> <span data-start="1134.34" data-end="1137.54">and a half.</span> <span data-start="1137.54" data-end="1142.25">There's another important metric, which is lines of code.</span> <span data-start="1142.25" data-end="1145.82">Svelte has about half the number of lines of code that the React version does.</span> <span data-start="1145.82" data-end="1146.82">And that's not an aberration.</span> <span data-start="1146.82" data-end="1149.14">That's something that we see all the time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1149.14" data-end="1153.16">Because it turns out that you can express UI concepts much more cleanly and succinctly</span> <span data-start="1153.16" data-end="1156.78">if you're using a language that's designed for that task.</span> <span data-start="1156.78" data-end="1160.02">A few lines of code is good.</span> <span data-start="1160.02" data-end="1164.97">You can write the lines quicker, but the app is more maintainable.</span> <span data-start="1164.97" data-end="1165.97">Fewer bugs.</span> <span data-start="1165.97" data-end="1171.55">Svelte is reasonably flexible and powerful, but you need something more if you're going</span> <span data-start="1171.55" data-end="1172.66">to build ambition apps.</span> <span data-start="1172.66" data-end="1176.63">And in the React world, we have a project called Next.</span> <span data-start="1176.63" data-end="1180.22">The idea is each page is a comment.</span> <span data-start="1180.22" data-end="1189.179">And you get the server and client rendered versions, so the navigation is instantaneous.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1189.179" data-end="1196.51">And could we take the same svelte philosophy of compilers and apply it to that problem?</span> <span data-start="1196.51" data-end="1198.23">Yes, we can.</span> <span data-start="1198.23" data-end="1201.34">Where has my mouse gone?</span> <span data-start="1201.34" data-end="1208.32">So, I'm going to create a new sample project.</span> <span data-start="1208.32" data-end="1210.04">Short for svelte app maker.</span> <span data-start="1210.04" data-end="1218.82">Here's one I made earlier so we don't need to wait for dependencies to install.</span> <span data-start="1218.82" data-end="1225.2">And if I build my app, then this is the basic start to template.</span> <span data-start="1225.2" data-end="1230.6">And you can see as before, we've got the client-side rendering, nice and slick.</span> <span data-start="1230.6" data-end="1232.28">It's very fast.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1232.28" data-end="1238.39">But if we look at the actual workup that you get from the server, it's server rendered.</span> <span data-start="1238.39" data-end="1244.87">You get that fast initial load.</span> <span data-start="1244.87" data-end="1266.32">If I were to build this, then we can have a look at production stats for this.</span> <span data-start="1266.32" data-end="1269.08">And you can see that it's less than 7 kilobytes.</span> <span data-start="1269.08" data-end="1270.77">You can't see.</span> <span data-start="1270.77" data-end="1271.77">It's quite small.</span> <span data-start="1271.77" data-end="1273.52">Less than 7 kilobytes of JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1273.52" data-end="1277.27">Which is more than necessary, but it's a good start.</span> <span data-start="1277.27" data-end="1289.69">For reference, if we look at the same app built using Next, then it's well over 200</span> <span data-start="1289.69" data-end="1290.71">kilobytes.</span> <span data-start="1290.71" data-end="1298.8">Which is frankly too much for an app that doesn't yet do a great deal.</span> <span data-start="1298.8" data-end="1302.669">I have some numbers on the server side rendering performance.</span> <span data-start="1302.669" data-end="1306.24">So, I don't want to get too high up in the performance stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1306.24" data-end="1310.86">I want to promote the idea that we should be comparing frameworks along interesting</span> <span data-start="1310.86" data-end="1311.86">dimension.</span> <span data-start="1311.86" data-end="1316.63">Such as does this frame work help me build a more accessible web?</span> <span data-start="1316.63" data-end="1323.039">Svelte will warn you if you build if you use things that aren't accessible.</span> <span data-start="1323.039" data-end="1325.4">Does it help us build slick user interfaces?</span> <span data-start="1325.4" data-end="1328.89">Does it help us write fewer lines of code?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1328.89" data-end="1334.039">And can we write tools that are more sophisticated than stuff that's based on the command line.</span> <span data-start="1334.039" data-end="1335.8">I have been inspired by these two projects.</span> <span data-start="1335.8" data-end="1342.45">In the remaining 60 seconds, I'm going to try to show you what I have been working on.</span> <span data-start="1342.45" data-end="1351.6">This is a graphical user interface for building apps.</span> <span data-start="1351.6" data-end="1355.83">And you can do some pretty cool stuff if you have tools that are deeply integrated with</span> <span data-start="1355.83" data-end="1357.25">the frameworks that they serve.</span> <span data-start="1357.25" data-end="1362.289">I can open and I can go straight to the page that I'm currently on.</span> <span data-start="1362.289" data-end="1367.86">If I want to look at a particular element and edit that, then I can click the cross</span> <span data-start="1367.86" data-end="1368.86">hairs.</span> <span data-start="1368.86" data-end="1373.27">But go straight to the source code to go ahead and edit it.</span> <span data-start="1373.27" data-end="1377">I have been building apps like this for a short while and it's transformed how quickly</span> <span data-start="1377" data-end="1379.169">I'm able to build stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1379.169" data-end="1387.62">In summary, the first era, homesteaders tended to code bases my hand.</span> <span data-start="1387.62" data-end="1392.95">And the second era was the industrial age when we started to use machines for everything</span> <span data-start="1392.95" data-end="1394.669">and people wrote a little bit about the pollution.</span> <span data-start="1394.669" data-end="1398.9">But we can't deny that it have a transformative effect on productivity.</span> <span data-start="1398.9" data-end="1401.8">The third age is the information age.</span> <span data-start="1401.8" data-end="1405.23">Machines are becoming intelligent.</span> <span data-start="1405.23" data-end="1411.82">How can computers, helpers, fulfill our potential as creative professionals?</span> <span data-start="1411.82" data-end="1417.25">I think this is some largely unexplored territory.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1417.25" data-end="1419">Doesn't just apply to user interface.</span> <span data-start="1419" data-end="1422.16">It also applies to tools and everything else that we work on.</span> <span data-start="1422.16" data-end="1425.28">So, I hope that you will come and explore it with me.</span> </p>
