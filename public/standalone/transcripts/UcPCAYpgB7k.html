<p><span data-start="20.6" data-end="25.03">Right hi everyone, as Lindsay said my name is Bryan Hughes, I am a front-end</span> <span data-start="25.03" data-end="30.06">developer at Rdio a music streaming company in San Francisco. I am also the lead organiser</span> <span data-start="30.06" data-end="35.65">for Meetup group in San Francisco, a member of 2 node.js working group, a somewhat regular</span> <span data-start="35.65" data-end="41.51">speaker at conferences and a popular open source project. You could say I am pretty</span> <span data-start="41.51" data-end="47.78">involved these days. Today I am going to talk about how to get involved yourself.</span> <span data-start="47.78" data-end="51.37">Most developers tend to go to work and come home each day, that’s the extent of their</span> <span data-start="51.37" data-end="56.32">involvement in tech this is perfectly ok too, I was one of these developers for the first</span> <span data-start="56.32" data-end="60.93">3 years of my career. There's a lot more out there though, there are conferences such as</span> <span data-start="60.93" data-end="67.11">this one, there's meetups, open source projects, logging and more. As Cate Hutson talked about</span> <span data-start="67.11" data-end="71.84">on Friday, getting involved in the community outside of work can be highly rewarding and</span> <span data-start="71.84" data-end="77.25">sometimes even necessary but also entails risks especially for people from under-represented</span> <span data-start="77.25" data-end="82.74">groups. I want to tell my story of how I got involved in the node.js communities and the</span> <span data-start="82.74" data-end="86.5">lessons I learned along the way.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="86.5" data-end="92.759">My journey started one summer at a resort in Florida in the US. I was at J conference</span> <span data-start="92.759" data-end="97.56">2013 at the recommendation of friend and I was forever changed. It was there that I first</span> <span data-start="97.56" data-end="103.259">learned about NodeBots and I was hooked immediately. Of course I was hooked, why not? It's JavaScript</span> <span data-start="103.259" data-end="108.03">and robots, what's not to love about that? But more importantly though, this where I</span> <span data-start="108.03" data-end="117.009">first met Raquel Valez, AKA a truly amazing person. I wouldn't be here today or be involved</span> <span data-start="117.009" data-end="123.979">in robotics if it wasn't for her. I was first inspired to speak at a conference myself.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="123.979" data-end="127.46">Soon after the conference one of the speakers there wrote a blog post titled ‘You Should</span> <span data-start="127.46" data-end="132.72">Speak at JSConf.’ Still coming off the high of the conference I thought you know maybe</span> <span data-start="132.72" data-end="137.83">he's right, maybe I could do this too. So full of excitement and energy I submitted</span> <span data-start="137.83" data-end="144.87">a top proposal for JSConf2014 and it was rejected probably with a fiery burning passion because</span> <span data-start="144.87" data-end="150.95">my proposal was pretty terrible. That's ok. We always suck the first time we try to do</span> <span data-start="150.95" data-end="155.72">something new. No-one rides a bike perfectly the first time, why should public speaking</span> <span data-start="155.72" data-end="162.67">be any different. It takes time and practice but like riding a bike it's a lot of fun it</span> <span data-start="162.67" data-end="167.39">helps if you have someone teaching you how to ride though.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="167.39" data-end="173.07">After JSConf I followed Raquel on Twitter I soon found out about NodeBots.sf a JavaScript</span> <span data-start="173.07" data-end="181.85">meetup in San Fran. I attended my first meetup, it was incredible. I met many more awesome</span> <span data-start="181.85" data-end="190.05">people there so by then my course was set. At a new favourite meetup I found my community.</span> <span data-start="190.05" data-end="194.55">I didn't let my first talk rejection get to me too much I realised my first proposal was</span> <span data-start="194.55" data-end="198.7">terrible I scrapped that entire idea and came up with a new one. I had been</span> <span data-start="198.7" data-end="202.58">working with raspberrypi, like I thought that a lot of people might want to hear about it</span> <span data-start="202.58" data-end="210.45">too I wrote a new proposal for Cascadia.js 2014, it was also pretty bad. It was an improvement</span> <span data-start="210.45" data-end="216.68">over my previous one but certainly still wasn't good and so it was rejected too. Now in this</span> <span data-start="216.68" data-end="222.45">proposal which was public, I made a mention of Johnny-five, a JavaScript robotics library.</span> <span data-start="222.45" data-end="226.95">This attracted the attention of the project's creator as part of our back and forth online</span> <span data-start="226.95" data-end="232.28">he mentioned we should get raspberry pi support into Johnny-five I never worked on an open</span> <span data-start="232.28" data-end="237.33">source project that wasn't Java related before, the thought had not even crossed my mind but</span> <span data-start="237.33" data-end="245.01">now I was intrigued. I wrote a quick plug-in for Johnny-five and submitted a pull request,</span> <span data-start="245.01" data-end="251.76">this request was also, it was slow, missing support for pretty much everything, had no</span> <span data-start="251.76" data-end="257.979">unit test or any documentation. This is also ok. Because the first version of new software</span> <span data-start="257.979" data-end="263.09">are usually really incomplete, they get better over time. Since I have rewritten the entire</span> <span data-start="263.09" data-end="268.16">library I have given it a lot of love it's actually pretty good now. It implements all</span> <span data-start="268.16" data-end="273.55">the features it needs to be pretty optimised, has really good documentation to it, but there's</span> <span data-start="273.55" data-end="277.89">still a lot I want to do with it, a lot, the least of which is unit tests that are still</span> <span data-start="277.89" data-end="283.85">missing to this day. Getting involved is an ongoing process, its ok when you don't get</span> <span data-start="283.85" data-end="288.62">everything right the first time. There's plenty of time for that later. You know I am still</span> <span data-start="288.62" data-end="293.1">very glad I wrote this plug-in, knowing that other people are using my software to create</span> <span data-start="293.1" data-end="298.89">amazing art is immensely gratifying. I also learned that you never know where opportunities</span> <span data-start="298.89" data-end="304.57">is going to come from, so always be open to new experiences.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="304.57" data-end="309.37">I still wasn't up to public speaking after my Cascadia.js rejection, I think I set my</span> <span data-start="309.37" data-end="315.28">sights a bit high. I decided to try something a bit smaller. In the middle of 2014 some</span> <span data-start="315.28" data-end="321.87">friends I knew started a new conference called forward.js, playing round with ECMAScript</span> <span data-start="321.87" data-end="328.01">6. I decided to submit a proposal for a short 15 minute talk on some odds this proposal</span> <span data-start="328.01" data-end="332.82">actually wasn't developed, in fact it was kind of decent, I submitted this proposal</span> <span data-start="332.82" data-end="337.61">and this time it was accepted. So it was the first time I had given a talk at a conference</span> <span data-start="337.61" data-end="343.6">and it went pretty well, it wasn't great, but pretty well. At the time I was really</span> <span data-start="343.6" data-end="348.28">worried that someone would ask me questions about ES6 that I didn't know the answer to,</span> <span data-start="348.28" data-end="353.55">but at the time there was actually quite bit about ES6 I didn't know. My fears were completely</span> <span data-start="353.55" data-end="359.139">unfounded, there was one question I couldn't answer, and even that wasn't a big deal. I</span> <span data-start="359.139" data-end="363.18">have since learned that you don't have to be an expert on a topic to speak about that</span> <span data-start="363.18" data-end="370.57">topic and conference organisers want you to talk and they want to help you be awesome.</span> <span data-start="370.57" data-end="375.389">When you see someone speaking at a conference or organising an event or leading a popular</span> <span data-start="375.389" data-end="380.58">open source project it's easy to think they are naturally gifted, they were somehow born</span> <span data-start="380.58" data-end="388.04">for it. We tend to put experts on a pedestal we think they are expert in everything, just</span> <span data-start="388.04" data-end="392.44">because they are pretty knowledgeable about this one thing. What you often don't see is</span> <span data-start="392.44" data-end="397.44">how much we actually don't know, how much we have failed along the way and all the other</span> <span data-start="397.44" data-end="403.65">people that helped get us on this stage. Those of us speaking here at JSConfEU, we have failed</span> <span data-start="403.65" data-end="409.18">a lot. We weren't born for it, we don't really know what we're doing, and you know we're</span> <span data-start="409.18" data-end="414.28">not experts at least not in the sense that most people assume we are. We're just regular</span> <span data-start="414.28" data-end="419.06">people who decide to take a risk one day.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="419.06" data-end="423.09">Around the same time I submitted my forward.js proposal I was at an all day NodeBot access</span> <span data-start="423.09" data-end="430.68">hacka events. Raquel casually mentioned to me maybe I should organise the meeting. I</span> <span data-start="430.68" data-end="435.09">had not given organising a second thought at this point, surely organisers have tons</span> <span data-start="435.09" data-end="439.34">of experience being organising for forever, how could I possibly help organise, I am so</span> <span data-start="439.34" data-end="446.56">new I just screw it up they wouldn't want me anyway. Round and round my head went. Raquel</span> <span data-start="446.56" data-end="452.01">made me think otherwise. I reached out to her and Dan Shaw, the other lead organiser.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="452.01" data-end="455.99">As it turned out the timing couldn't have been better, the current organisers were working</span> <span data-start="455.99" data-end="459.91">on some awesome new things and they didn't have as much time to devote to NodeBots.sf</span> <span data-start="459.91" data-end="466.68">as they once did. This is when I got to know Dan Shaw better, he's been so helpful I knew</span> <span data-start="466.68" data-end="475.69">nothing about organising going in. That's ok. We all start at nothing, but we don't</span> <span data-start="475.69" data-end="480.19">have to do it alone. There are other people willing to help you if you are willing to</span> <span data-start="480.19" data-end="486.449">take the risk and try it. Dan Shaw along with a few others were ones that help me. We don't</span> <span data-start="486.449" data-end="490.979">become speakers or organisers or project leaders because we’re innately more talented than</span> <span data-start="490.979" data-end="496.37">other people, we're not. We get involved because other people came before us and they were</span> <span data-start="496.37" data-end="500.979">supportive enough, and generous enough and welcoming enough, to give us a chance and</span> <span data-start="500.979" data-end="503.229">help us succeed.</span> <span data-start="503.229" data-end="509.46">It's our responsibility to pay it forward too. One day earlier this year I was hanging</span> <span data-start="509.46" data-end="514.339">out in the Johnny-five chap room someone dropped a link to a node.js that recommend we start</span> <span data-start="514.339" data-end="520">node.js hardware working group. My other experience so far had taught me to jump on opportunities</span> <span data-start="520" data-end="526.42">presented to me even I don't think I am qualified I thought sure what the hell. Now I am the</span> <span data-start="526.42" data-end="535.339">de facto lead for the node.js hardware working group, not sure how that happened exactly</span> <span data-start="535.339" data-end="541.73">definitely working out how to lead in online group but things are happening. Then no conference</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="541.73" data-end="548.17">US happened there were a number of discussions about diversity and the node.js collaborators</span> <span data-start="548.17" data-end="553.809">in particular. One of discussion was the node.js diversity working group I am also a member</span> <span data-start="553.809" data-end="560.389">of it. This group is still very new we're still figuring our what our mission is exactly.</span> <span data-start="560.389" data-end="564.42">There have been some very tough challenges for this group to solve as well, I am excited</span> <span data-start="564.42" data-end="569.389">but still nervous to see where it goes. I hope I am able to bring some value to this</span> <span data-start="569.389" data-end="574.829">working group although I constantly question my abilities of being able to do so. One point</span> <span data-start="574.829" data-end="580.49">I actually thought about quitting the group altogether because the challenges seemed insurmountable.</span> <span data-start="580.49" data-end="585.129">Then someone I have never met before, commented on a PR I had open someone whose affected</span> <span data-start="585.129" data-end="589.879">by the lack of diversity in the node.js collaborators. Their comments and kind words gave me the</span> <span data-start="589.879" data-end="596.22">determination that I lacked until then. I might have quit without them.</span> <span data-start="596.22" data-end="601.009">People don't just help us get into a community, they are the reason that we stay. When I think</span> <span data-start="601.009" data-end="605.16">of everything that important in my life in the end it's all about people. That's what</span> <span data-start="605.16" data-end="613.41">motivates me the people, and I think that's what motivates most everyone else too.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="613.41" data-end="620.93">Looking back across the years I realise I suffer from imposter syndrome, I am simply</span> <span data-start="620.93" data-end="625.679">going to read this definition to you. “Imposter syndrome is a situation where someone feels</span> <span data-start="625.679" data-end="630.709">like an imposter or fraud, they feel their accomplishments are nowhere near as good as</span> <span data-start="630.709" data-end="631.449">those of the people</span> <span data-start="631.449" data-end="636.149">round them. Usually their accomplishments are just as good and the person is applying</span> <span data-start="636.149" data-end="641.619">a unfairly high standard to themselves and not to others.”</span> <span data-start="641.619" data-end="646.589">You know, I think this is something we're all prone to, it's human nature, but it's</span> <span data-start="646.589" data-end="650.199">important that we recognise it for what it is though, a trick that our minds play on</span> <span data-start="650.199" data-end="655.059">us, I sincerely believe that every single one of you in the audience is capable of speaking</span> <span data-start="655.059" data-end="660.24">at an conference of contributing to an open source project of writing blog posts we're</span> <span data-start="660.24" data-end="665.499">not going to be great at all of these things, very few people are but everyone has talent</span> <span data-start="665.499" data-end="668.119">at something.</span> <span data-start="668.119" data-end="673.569">I realise that the title of this talk is the risks and rewards of getting involved in how</span> <span data-start="673.569" data-end="679.009">to do, I have not talked about the risk or how to do it have I, let me address the how</span> <span data-start="679.009" data-end="681.139">to do it first.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="681.139" data-end="686.67">If I have not made it obvious already, it's not as hard as people through it's not some</span> <span data-start="686.67" data-end="691.829">drama we put you through, nor do we only accept the best of the best of the best. If you are</span> <span data-start="691.829" data-end="698.529">willing to put yourself out there we'll help you on your journey. If you feel motivated</span> <span data-start="698.529" data-end="704.189">to do something, commit to that motivation, then reach out to others already doing it.</span> <span data-start="704.189" data-end="711.069">Yep that's it, that's the secret to getting involved. Commit to doing, it then ask for</span> <span data-start="711.069" data-end="712.879">help.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="712.879" data-end="717.459">When you feel motivated or the thing is though the process is easier for some people than</span> <span data-start="717.459" data-end="722.779">it is for others. Exclusion, marginalisation and existing lack of diversity are very real</span> <span data-start="722.779" data-end="726.589">problems conspire to keep under represented people out of our development communities.</span> <span data-start="726.589" data-end="732.809">I am going to switch gears and we're going to talk about this. I am going to start as</span> <span data-start="732.809" data-end="736.259">I have everything else with a story.</span> <span data-start="736.259" data-end="743.889">So, I grew up in a conservative part of Texas in the United States I'm also a liberal, bisexual,</span> <span data-start="743.889" data-end="751.179">atheist, among other things, I did not belong in Texas, San Francisco seemed like a paradise,</span> <span data-start="751.179" data-end="760.709">it was far from the reason I moved there, I thought San Francisco was better, companies</span> <span data-start="760.709" data-end="770.019">were diverse and welcoming. it wasn't the cesspool of disablist, racist, xenophobic</span> <span data-start="770.019" data-end="779.29">assholes that it is! \{Laughter\}</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="779.29" data-end="791.019">As a — I encountered bigotry, I was more or less used to it, I was also an out back fan,</span> <span data-start="791.019" data-end="797.86">there is that too. I didn't view myself as part of the problem, I mean, I never hit on</span> <span data-start="797.86" data-end="803.329">women or men at professional events, I never said anything overtly misogynistic online</span> <span data-start="803.329" data-end="810.989">or indulge in harassing behaviour, surely I was one of the good guys right, well no,</span> <span data-start="810.989" data-end="819.11">I wasn't. I was contributing to the problem in my own way, I see that now.</span> <span data-start="819.11" data-end="825.939">Back then I had no idea what microaggressions were, what intersectionality was, that being</span> <span data-start="825.939" data-end="834.23">silent maintained the status quo and the status quo was pretty terrible. Here is the truth</span> <span data-start="834.23" data-end="844.72">of the matter, the tech industry card deck is stacked, you white, white, American white</span> <span data-start="844.72" data-end="851.019">male straight, you are automatically at a disadvantage, our industry is fundamentally</span> <span data-start="851.019" data-end="856.899">broken and we are all implicit not standing against the current status quo is to support</span> <span data-start="856.899" data-end="866.91">it, it's to condone harassment and abuse, sitting comfortably in your own situation,</span> <span data-start="866.91" data-end="872.92">ignoring those around you suffering, is to say, "Fuck you, I've got mine", if you</span> <span data-start="872.92" data-end="879.699">aren't contributing to make are industry better you are contributing to making it worse. Me,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="879.699" data-end="886.869">I was part of the problem, I was contributing to making it worse. I still am to some extent,</span> <span data-start="886.869" data-end="891.519">but, now I'm trying to be part of the solution too.</span> <span data-start="891.519" data-end="903.009">So, what changed? I started listening. I started believing women, people of colour, LGBT, disabled,</span> <span data-start="903.009" data-end="908.149">when they say there is a problem. To be clear I'm not an expert on this stuff, not even</span> <span data-start="908.149" data-end="918.009">close, I don't think I ever can be. I still screw up. That's ok too, as long as I catch</span> <span data-start="918.009" data-end="926.22">myself or have someone call me out on it apologise promptly and take steps not to do it again,</span> <span data-start="926.22" data-end="932.119">these last steps are critical, making mistakes are own, we're only human and we're going</span> <span data-start="932.119" data-end="937.48">to make mistakes, but not learning from those mistakes and repeating them over hand over</span> <span data-start="937.48" data-end="948.189">hand over again, that is real harm. So, a few years ago, I was really unhappy at a previous</span> <span data-start="948.189" data-end="955.6">job. At the time it was difficult for me to put my finger on exactly why it was unhappy,</span> <span data-start="955.6" data-end="960.379">later on I came to realise it was because this company was pretty typical for Silicon</span> <span data-start="960.379" data-end="967.359">Valley, misogynistic and homophobic and on and on and on, the culture of this company</span> <span data-start="967.359" data-end="973.959">was the antithesis of inclusivity, shouting attacks, poor reports from meetings, home</span> <span data-start="973.959" data-end="980.069">phobic slurs used frequently by everybody up and down the power chain, social justice</span> <span data-start="980.069" data-end="989.48">voyeurs and the PC police, stories and rumours of much, much worse. There is a reason that</span> <span data-start="989.48" data-end="994.47">there are only two women engineers in a team of 60 and both of them were brought in through</span> <span data-start="994.47" data-end="999.629">acquisitions, the company didn't care about hiring women and if they did there was a hostile</span> <span data-start="999.629" data-end="1006.069">work environment for any woman unlucky enough to enter. For me, I didn't feel comfortable</span> <span data-start="1006.069" data-end="1013.589">being myself there, I didn't come out to a single co-worker, I was scared to come out,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1013.589" data-end="1018.399">I didn't feel I would be accepted for who I was and would face a wave of harassment</span> <span data-start="1018.399" data-end="1030.549">if I did, so I quit, it was the single best thing I did for my entire career. I'm picking</span> <span data-start="1030.549" data-end="1040.01">on this company, not because they are noteworthy, but because they are average, that's a problem.</span> <span data-start="1040.01" data-end="1045.99">When I went looking for a new job my number one requirement was a not terrible culture,</span> <span data-start="1045.99" data-end="1052.99">everything else was secondary. I found Rdio, it's made up of some pretty amazing people,</span> <span data-start="1052.99" data-end="1057.139">we're not perfect and we still have some work to do to make the culture better and increase</span> <span data-start="1057.139" data-end="1064.08">diversity, I'm actually optimistic we can do it, I'm comfortable being myself there.</span> <span data-start="1064.08" data-end="1070.63">So, what does this all have to do with community? Well, my experiences of life and work taught</span> <span data-start="1070.63" data-end="1079.73">me something crucially important, what I learned is this: the reason many people get involved,</span> <span data-start="1079.73" data-end="1085.649">or stay involved, or leave the community or quit a job is directly related to how comfortable</span> <span data-start="1085.649" data-end="1091.85">they're being themselves, this is true whether it's an employer, a communicate, a circle</span> <span data-start="1091.85" data-end="1097.98">of friends or a family. You know, we have to be kind to one another, we have to be,</span> <span data-start="1097.98" data-end="1103.84">all of us. Even if you are not an organiser a regular speaker or attendee even, we are</span> <span data-start="1103.84" data-end="1112.039">all responsible, organisers are the ones that set the initial culture for the community</span> <span data-start="1112.039" data-end="1117.32">and they have to take disciplinary action when needed, but you know we can't be everywhere</span> <span data-start="1117.32" data-end="1123.72">at once, we are not privy between very conversation or interaction, we have to change it to where</span> <span data-start="1123.72" data-end="1130.84">entitled people are sensitive to not saying bigoted things, but where people say thing</span> <span data-start="1130.84" data-end="1142.08">irregardless of sexual orientation, race gender or anything else.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1142.08" data-end="1149.62">I was at a robotics conference last year, amazing speakers, code of conduct and organisers</span> <span data-start="1149.62" data-end="1159.62">that genuinely care about the community, one of my best friends, was there as an invited</span> <span data-start="1159.62" data-end="1162.75">expert, hanging out at a booth with</span> <span data-start="1162.75" data-end="1171.139">her hardware, this guy asks her point-blank, "Did you bad build this?" In a single sentence</span> <span data-start="1171.139" data-end="1176.33">he managed to dismiss her abilities and make her feel excluded, I was there as an invited</span> <span data-start="1176.33" data-end="1182.029">expert to, no one said that to me or any of the other invited experts that were men, whether</span> <span data-start="1182.029" data-end="1188.5">it was in intentional or not, it happened because she was a woman. These kinds of incidents</span> <span data-start="1188.5" data-end="1193.32">happen all the time too, there have been probably been at least 100 similar incidents happening</span> <span data-start="1193.32" data-end="1201.299">here too, organisers can't be everywhere at once, we need your help.</span> <span data-start="1201.299" data-end="1209.289">So, how can you help? Well, the first step is knowing what to look for. We tend to know</span> <span data-start="1209.289" data-end="1214.94">our own worlds well, what people similar to us are going through, the key is being able</span> <span data-start="1214.94" data-end="1220.85">to cull activate a basic understanding of people not like us are going through, it takes</span> <span data-start="1220.85" data-end="1226.59">a considered effort to learn and requires a lot of practice, it's really hard, it's</span> <span data-start="1226.59" data-end="1232.21">also really necessary. So, start learning about social justice, you know, understand</span> <span data-start="1232.21" data-end="1238.24">what privilege is and how it manifests itself. Listen to and believe when, people of colour,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1238.24" data-end="1243.47">LGBT, the disabled and others when they speak about harassment and exclusion. When someone</span> <span data-start="1243.47" data-end="1249.059">calls you out on your inappropriate behaviour, apologise properly, think about what you did</span> <span data-start="1249.059" data-end="1254.48">and change your behaviour. Call out others when they are acting inappropriately and do</span> <span data-start="1254.48" data-end="1260.85">it in the moment, if it's safe to do so. It may be scary and awkward, it may make others</span> <span data-start="1260.85" data-end="1267.58">uncomfortable, but that's actually the point. Making people uncomfortable and upset is how</span> <span data-start="1267.58" data-end="1273.789">we affect change. If you are more involved already, recognise you have a responsibility</span> <span data-start="1273.789" data-end="1277.72">to the rest of the community, don't speak or attend conferences that don't have a code</span> <span data-start="1277.72" data-end="1284.909">of conduct or are known for a hostile environment, make it known publicly why you are not attending.</span> <span data-start="1284.909" data-end="1290.75">For people in positions of power, make sure you are building a good community, make inclusivity</span> <span data-start="1290.75" data-end="1294.47">a central pillar of every last thing that you do.</span> <span data-start="1294.47" data-end="1301.279">You know, don't just let it be an after thought. How you treat people, in the community that</span> <span data-start="1301.279" data-end="1307">you build, are the only things that matter in the end. Don't know where to start, the</span> <span data-start="1307" data-end="1311.73">Geek Feminism Wiki, model view culture who's links are in here in the slide are excellent</span> <span data-start="1311.73" data-end="1318.86">resources and I encourage you all to view them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1318.86" data-end="1324.5">The Johnny-Five community is good so far as communities go, we're not perfect, no one</span> <span data-start="1324.5" data-end="1330.61">is there are lot of caring and empathetic people in the community, others communities</span> <span data-start="1330.61" data-end="1338.399">can be like this too, not just communities, our work places can be better as well. Bosses</span> <span data-start="1338.399" data-end="1342.179">aren't the only ones responsible for creating safe spaces even if they share the bulk of</span> <span data-start="1342.179" data-end="1348.09">the burden, we all play a part in making our own work places better.</span> <span data-start="1348.09" data-end="1354.019">When it comes to people, the tech industry is broken, it's the new Wall Street, we suffer</span> <span data-start="1354.019" data-end="1359.07">from a severe lack of diversity and diversity is actually getting worse, not better. Lack</span> <span data-start="1359.07" data-end="1365.84">of diversity hurts business. It hurts productivity, it hurts creativity.

It hurts are brothers and sisters, fuck the</span> <span data-start="1387.779" data-end="1391.029">business case, this is about people and dignity and respect</span> <span data-start="1391.029" data-end="1398.009">and making the world a better place, not just for a few, but for everyone. Our industry</span> <span data-start="1398.009" data-end="1403.49">doesn't have to be terrible. We can actually be the sources of hope and change we so often</span> <span data-start="1403.49" data-end="1409.22">like to pretend that we are.
