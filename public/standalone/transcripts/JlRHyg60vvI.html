<p><span data-start="18.13" data-end="21.13">I'm Ray.</span> <span data-start="21.13" data-end="24.019">The room has emptied out a little bit, so I don't have to be so nervous.</span> <span data-start="24.019" data-end="30.619">I will not show you much Javascript.</span> <span data-start="30.619" data-end="38">If you want to see a lot of Javascript from Toyota, you should go to the next room.</span> <span data-start="38" data-end="46.37">I'll start about something that we have been working on as a company for the last years.</span> <span data-start="46.37" data-end="47.789">That is these things.</span> <span data-start="47.789" data-end="49.46">The cars.</span> <span data-start="49.46" data-end="55.87">This is the one example, which might impress Javascript developers.</span> <span data-start="55.87" data-end="63.35">Most car companies, equipment manufacturers, most people in the manufacturing world think</span> <span data-start="63.35" data-end="64.86">about this kind of thing.</span> <span data-start="64.86" data-end="66.61">Which is a product.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="66.61" data-end="68.96">This product doesn't have anybody in it.</span> <span data-start="68.96" data-end="71.06">If you can notice this.</span> <span data-start="71.06" data-end="78.05">Most of the manufacturing brochures is without people.</span> <span data-start="78.05" data-end="83.909">Most manufacturers really care about the product.</span> <span data-start="83.909" data-end="89.74">Once it goes outside the factory it goes to a distribution network, other people deal</span> <span data-start="89.74" data-end="95.159">with the people who drive the cars.</span> <span data-start="95.159" data-end="97.729">We can see a nice lady in the car.</span> <span data-start="97.729" data-end="99.229">That's good.</span> <span data-start="99.229" data-end="101.39">Some people into cars.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="101.39" data-end="103.11">We know that is happening.</span> <span data-start="103.11" data-end="104.7">In the dealership somewhere.</span> <span data-start="104.7" data-end="108.469">But we don't really know much beyond that.</span> <span data-start="108.469" data-end="112.82">Something about this picture you recognize.</span> <span data-start="112.82" data-end="121.799">We have concentrated mostly on the steeringwheels and dashboards and engines and that stuff.</span> <span data-start="121.799" data-end="124.59">Now we have these new things in the cars.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="124.59" data-end="133.59">Will allow us to serve the customer a lot better and track, understand what they are</span> <span data-start="133.59" data-end="136.19">doing in a better way.</span> <span data-start="136.19" data-end="140.989">This actually changes the game for car manufacturers.</span> <span data-start="140.989" data-end="147.069">We have had an engine, steering wheels, cars on the road.</span> <span data-start="147.069" data-end="149.15">We don't know what has been going on.</span> <span data-start="149.15" data-end="151.73">Until recently.</span> <span data-start="151.73" data-end="154.54">Like with the maps.</span> <span data-start="154.54" data-end="161.97">We want to connect the vehicles to the customers driving the vehicles.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="161.97" data-end="169.14">This is the beginning actually of a culture shift that was mentioned earlier on.</span> <span data-start="169.14" data-end="177.82">Because all of the systems inside Toyota, Ford, all of these manufacturers, are all</span> <span data-start="177.82" data-end="180.1">geared around producing stuff.</span> <span data-start="180.1" data-end="185.5">Not linking the people to the things that we produce.</span> <span data-start="185.5" data-end="189.09">And, that's an opportunity for us.</span> <span data-start="189.09" data-end="193.599">Because as architects we benefit from opportunities and crises.</span> <span data-start="193.599" data-end="199.43">In this case we want to connect to the cloud, a lot of people out there.</span> <span data-start="199.43" data-end="201.4">We can't control that.</span> <span data-start="201.4" data-end="206.299">All of the on site technology that we have, that we have been used to.</span> <span data-start="206.299" data-end="212.24">Where there is a kind of understood limit to how much activity can go on.</span> <span data-start="212.24" data-end="214.209">Suddenly becomes challenges.</span> <span data-start="214.209" data-end="219.3">We have an opportunity to go to the cloud.</span> <span data-start="219.3" data-end="222.87">In manufacturing companies.</span> <span data-start="222.87" data-end="225.57">A split of things.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="225.57" data-end="227.939">We have R&D, manufacturing, distribution.</span> <span data-start="227.939" data-end="232.59">Supply chain.</span> <span data-start="232.59" data-end="242.959">I want to discuss the fact, from a software side, R&D looks like software development</span> <span data-start="242.959" data-end="245.299">to me.</span> <span data-start="245.299" data-end="250.519">That is not where all the lean manufacturing stuff comes.</span> <span data-start="250.519" data-end="252.879">All the agile stuff comes from.</span> <span data-start="252.879" data-end="255.49">That is undiscovered.</span> <span data-start="255.49" data-end="257.57">Like most software development.</span> <span data-start="257.57" data-end="259.14">It is hard stuff.</span> <span data-start="259.14" data-end="261.97">That has to be done and is not repeatable.</span> <span data-start="261.97" data-end="265.13">Not simple.</span> <span data-start="265.13" data-end="269.29">So, that's where we are mostly on the left.</span> <span data-start="269.29" data-end="271.08">Research and development.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="271.08" data-end="274.58">We have supply chains.</span> <span data-start="274.58" data-end="281.07">For us, supply chains are things like, software as a service.</span> <span data-start="281.07" data-end="283.58">Or software libraries.</span> <span data-start="283.58" data-end="287.1">Like we use databases or commercial libraries.</span> <span data-start="287.1" data-end="289.33">Open source frameworks.</span> <span data-start="289.33" data-end="290.55">We have manufacturing.</span> <span data-start="290.55" data-end="298.28">And manufacturing in software, in my opinion tends about the deployment.</span> <span data-start="298.28" data-end="301.72">The datacenter is a thing under pressure.</span> <span data-start="301.72" data-end="306.62">We want to potentially change that manufacturing from a local data center.</span> <span data-start="306.62" data-end="314.7">The distribution is the internet or network.</span> <span data-start="314.7" data-end="317.22">These guys do their exercises in the morning.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="317.22" data-end="321.55">They are not changing things here.</span> <span data-start="321.55" data-end="325.14">What factories do is they repeat things.</span> <span data-start="325.14" data-end="327.38">We have the ideas in the software world.</span> <span data-start="327.38" data-end="334.06">And factories go through a process, manage it, make sure it is repeatable and make sure</span> <span data-start="334.06" data-end="336.47">it works.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="336.47" data-end="338.46">That's good.</span> <span data-start="338.46" data-end="346.44">One of the problems with this is, this doesn't work very well if it is not repeatable, scalable.</span> <span data-start="346.44" data-end="353.43">If I have to go to the factory workers and explain how to build that car, it is not good.</span> <span data-start="353.43" data-end="360.75">We were taking 2 days to deploy stuff in the existing system.</span> <span data-start="360.75" data-end="363.02">I have drawings here.</span> <span data-start="363.02" data-end="364.41">Some pictures on the lefthandside.</span> <span data-start="364.41" data-end="367.81">This guy is making bricks by hand.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="367.81" data-end="371.24">That is find.</span> <span data-start="371.24" data-end="372.24">Everyone is happy.</span> <span data-start="372.24" data-end="374.41">He has a job.</span> <span data-start="374.41" data-end="377.53">But I would like that..</span> <span data-start="377.53" data-end="380.4">Perhaps controversially.</span> <span data-start="380.4" data-end="382.56">Technologies on the righthandside.</span> <span data-start="382.56" data-end="385.09">The stuff we were using before this.</span> <span data-start="385.09" data-end="386.09">Very manual.</span> <span data-start="386.09" data-end="387.09">Dot net.</span> <span data-start="387.09" data-end="388.09">Xml.</span> <span data-start="388.09" data-end="391.47">File systems.</span> <span data-start="391.47" data-end="392.63">Management system.</span> <span data-start="392.63" data-end="394.65">Everything was manually deployed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="394.65" data-end="399.75">Not to test it.</span> <span data-start="399.75" data-end="402.69">But deploy it into production.</span> <span data-start="402.69" data-end="412.54">And then we use monitoring tools on a per server basis.</span> <span data-start="412.54" data-end="413.98">We decided to change that.</span> <span data-start="413.98" data-end="417.1">To a different stack.</span> <span data-start="417.1" data-end="421.56">We wanted to, architect for the factory.</span> <span data-start="421.56" data-end="424.61">Architect for something that is scalable.</span> <span data-start="424.61" data-end="427.23">Which is automatible.</span> <span data-start="427.23" data-end="432.09">Simple and visible to understand.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="432.09" data-end="436.49">What we did there was we moved everything.</span> <span data-start="436.49" data-end="438.31">We didn't do competitions.</span> <span data-start="438.31" data-end="442.13">Like.Net use this many Cpu cycles.</span> <span data-start="442.13" data-end="447.09">This Java is more friendly.</span> <span data-start="447.09" data-end="453.49">I have like the other guy a background in Java and non Java script stuff.</span> <span data-start="453.49" data-end="457.38">I sat with Node, did development.</span> <span data-start="457.38" data-end="462.56">I like to touch stuff and workable.</span> <span data-start="462.56" data-end="467.66">And what do what they say.</span> <span data-start="467.66" data-end="473.97">I have been with Node.</span> <span data-start="473.97" data-end="477.68">I can write a few scripts.</span> <span data-start="477.68" data-end="481.37">What I found with Node was interesting.</span> <span data-start="481.37" data-end="486.78">You could run it, you know this, incredibly small environments.</span> <span data-start="486.78" data-end="493.89">What you don't want to do is rely on a big fat operating system.</span> <span data-start="493.89" data-end="500.4">If I want to have 10 Nodes, i don't want 10 instances of Windows.</span> <span data-start="500.4" data-end="507.81">Or 10 instances of Linux either.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="507.81" data-end="509.97">We realise it is lightware.</span> <span data-start="509.97" data-end="514.159">To spin up a lot of instances.</span> <span data-start="514.159" data-end="521.58">We didn't want to go with something depending on high cost operating systems.</span> <span data-start="521.58" data-end="525.05">And I think Windows is that.</span> <span data-start="525.05" data-end="526.57">Microsoft realises that.</span> <span data-start="526.57" data-end="534.06">They are getting involved in all kinds of Linux environments.</span> <span data-start="534.06" data-end="539.46">But Windows is for us if we are going to get ready for the factory, I don't like to look</span> <span data-start="539.46" data-end="541.54">at their factory.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="541.54" data-end="547.46">It is cluncy to start things up.</span> <span data-start="547.46" data-end="552.23">We want to drop Windows.</span> <span data-start="552.23" data-end="555.34">We were using Xml as part of the content management system.</span> <span data-start="555.34" data-end="560.16">It was burning a lot of Cpu's.</span> <span data-start="560.16" data-end="563.18">We didn't benchmark this.</span> <span data-start="563.18" data-end="567.83">The Cpu's, on the existing websites were always at 100%.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="567.83" data-end="569.83">I don't need to benchmark that.</span> <span data-start="569.83" data-end="571.75">It is terrible.</span> <span data-start="571.75" data-end="576.81">It is easy for us to say, let's just stop parsing stuff.</span> <span data-start="576.81" data-end="580.07">If we use Json.</span> <span data-start="580.07" data-end="591.25">I didn't like to move from disk.</span> <span data-start="591.25" data-end="595.07">We are getting disks full on weekly basis.</span> <span data-start="595.07" data-end="599.94">It was an easy sell.</span> <span data-start="599.94" data-end="605.72">Moving from subversion to Git was a headache.</span> <span data-start="605.72" data-end="608.83">They didn't understand the benefits.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="608.83" data-end="613.37">But we worked with developers.</span> <span data-start="613.37" data-end="619.19">Pull requests and the Ps system was a lot more powerful.</span> <span data-start="619.19" data-end="623.55">Than the subversion they had at the time.</span> <span data-start="623.55" data-end="626.47">And we went from manual deploy to automated deploy.</span> <span data-start="626.47" data-end="630.58">We use a stack from Alasian.</span> <span data-start="630.58" data-end="633.74">Some might know.</span> <span data-start="633.74" data-end="641.18">They also have a built system called Bamboo and Stash.</span> <span data-start="641.18" data-end="648.83">The Stash, because we are a big manufacturer and scared of secrets of the world.</span> <span data-start="648.83" data-end="651.8">Then we have to have everything behind the firewall.</span> <span data-start="651.8" data-end="657.38">Our code and built systems are behind the firewall at the moment.</span> <span data-start="657.38" data-end="662.8">And we use that, the Bamboo and Stash to do that.</span> <span data-start="662.8" data-end="664.36">Which is very nice.</span> <span data-start="664.36" data-end="668.05">You get a lot of visibility in the code quality.</span> <span data-start="668.05" data-end="673.48">Then we move from the individual systems out to things like New Relic.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="673.48" data-end="677.19">A lot of add ons to understand what is going on.</span> <span data-start="677.19" data-end="683.13">We have eyes on the system that we didn't have before.</span> <span data-start="683.13" data-end="694.32">That's being moved from that sluggy stuff to the more automated environment.</span> <span data-start="694.32" data-end="697.29">Where do we build the factory?</span> <span data-start="697.29" data-end="702.51">We build factories in the real world where there is a lot of water, energy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="702.51" data-end="704.2">Available labor.</span> <span data-start="704.2" data-end="710.39">Where do we build the factory on the cloud?</span> <span data-start="710.39" data-end="712.47">Do we build it on the cloud?</span> <span data-start="712.47" data-end="713.56">First question of course.</span> <span data-start="713.56" data-end="719.34">A lot of people are thinking, let's take a stack and do it internally.</span> <span data-start="719.34" data-end="724.81">The problem was that we wanted to say, we are going to go strategically.</span> <span data-start="724.81" data-end="731.32">Unfortunately, or fortunately, with Toyota we have to build concensus.</span> <span data-start="731.32" data-end="732.59">That's good.</span> <span data-start="732.59" data-end="737.63">If you are doing things together you do things in a strong way.</span> <span data-start="737.63" data-end="743.82">That means that, to do it on premise properly, it requires a lot of inquestment.</span> <span data-start="743.82" data-end="748.55">Making an internal cloud is expensive.</span> <span data-start="748.55" data-end="754.6">A lot of hardware.</span> <span data-start="754.6" data-end="758.72">Invest in training people to run the cloud.</span> <span data-start="758.72" data-end="765.8">Actually, it turns out from a timeline, we couldn't afford to do it for this project.</span> <span data-start="765.8" data-end="768.67">Something we are considering for the future.</span> </p>
