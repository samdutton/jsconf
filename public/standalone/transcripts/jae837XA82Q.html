<p><span data-start="23.15" data-end="36.059"Audience member: JSConf EU\h JavaScript and the microphone. And control it and do some analysis. As a result, of the icon\h and because of\h I had\h
I find there are amazing people interested</span> <span data-start="36.059" data-end="45.399">in stuff. And so many of them created a group like live: JS. Thank you, JSConf EU, for giving</span> <span data-start="45.399" data-end="52.609">me the power to believe in myself. To speak in front of people. To see that failure is</span> <span data-start="52.609" data-end="67.49">something and only exists to let me grow. Thank you for being you.</span> <span data-start="67.49" data-end="119.81">[Orchestra music playing] Weâ€™ve come so far, and we've reached so</span> <span data-start="119.81" data-end="148.36">high And we want to stay</span> <span data-start="148.36" data-end="191.17">[Synth keyboard playing over drum beats] [It's very catchy]</span> <span data-start="191.17" data-end="210.19">[The music stopped!] [ Applause ]</span> <span data-start="210.19" data-end="227.12"Audience member: You might wonder how we ended up in this situation.</span> <span data-start="227.12" data-end="235.72"Audience member: So, yeah. Hello\h hello JSConf. We\h >> Woohoo!</span> <span data-start="235.72" data-end="241.9"Audience member: We want to show you how this stage was built. And I would love to get the slides</span> <span data-start="241.9" data-end="253.18">now, please. As everything is working. So, yeah, there should be slides. And the title</span> <span data-start="253.18" data-end="267">of this talk is how\h no\h making of the stage. And yeah. The second slide says</span> <span data-start="267" data-end="273.52">[ Laughter ] Oh, there it is. Thank you.</span> <span data-start="273.52" data-end="278.51">[ Applause ] Yeah, you see? We don't practice anything.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="278.51" data-end="289.72">We just do everything live. Oh, so the clicker is also not working. Yeah. So, we have live:js.</span> <span data-start="289.72" data-end="299.01">We consistent of, yeah, different people. The core team consists of Jan, Martin, Matt,</span> <span data-start="299.01" data-end="309.88">Ruth, Sam, and myself. And we would like to explain how all of this is working or not</span> <span data-start="309.88" data-end="317.139">in a small presentation. And I will give the microphone now to Zach. Actually, the clicker.</span> <span data-start="317.139" data-end="331.02"Audience member: Thank you. Hello. So, we prepared a very easy to understand overview for you about</span> <span data-start="331.02" data-end="339.31">what has happened since about November. We were like planning this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="339.31" data-end="347.71">So, basic this is what you know. You see this is kind of the stage. And you might remember</span> <span data-start="347.71" data-end="353.66">the beautiful presentation of the curators you saw today. A nice keynote. And the keynote</span> <span data-start="353.66" data-end="359.82">didn't work because, you know, keynote restricts the width to something like 4,000 pixels.</span> <span data-start="359.82" data-end="368.86">We needed to take something else. Keynote, please. Obviously not PowerPoint. So, we took</span> <span data-start="368.86" data-end="379.02">Google Slides. They allowed us to get the 8,204 pixels that we needed. And basically,</span> <span data-start="379.02" data-end="386.85">that was our first little hurdle that we overcame. So, in this presentation you might remember</span> <span data-start="386.85" data-end="394.57">many people have already worked on this presentation. Including me doing some background graphics</span> <span data-start="394.57" data-end="401.18">for that. Which also was quite a pain because, you know, if you put in Google Slides, SVG</span> <span data-start="401.18" data-end="405.99">wouldn't work so you have to go over the EMF files, which is a vector form of very old</span> <span data-start="405.99" data-end="411.23">time and so on and so on. That was already a little bit complicated but actually worked</span> <span data-start="411.23" data-end="416.79">out fine. And, of course, in such an intro, you want an opening title. We asked our beautiful</span> <span data-start="416.79" data-end="426.931">friends to prepare some animation for us for which they needed Illustrator files and they</span> <span data-start="426.931" data-end="432.26">did some after effects magic with it. And the after effects magic went into like the</span> <span data-start="432.26" data-end="438.22">moving, and the JSON files. And the JSON files were exported to SVG files and that's what</span> <span data-start="438.22" data-end="448.84">you basically saw in JS. And you also saw a beautiful live video from Ruth and Sam that</span> <span data-start="448.84" data-end="457">went in and you will see and enjoy today some more. That is Canvas and WebGL.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="457" data-end="462.84">And all of this\h including all the slides\h to make it work in the browser because that</span> <span data-start="462.84" data-end="472.86">was what we aimed for. And that was our concept. And then you heard also beautiful music also</span> <span data-start="472.86" data-end="479.82">made for the browser with web audio from Jan and Matt. And this music actually came from</span> <span data-start="479.82" data-end="491.199">Sam. Thank you, Sam. And everything is here lighted in color theme and rhythm item with</span> <span data-start="491.199" data-end="501.9">his custom interface that he did using DMX. Thank you, Sam. And, yeah. That's about it.</span> <span data-start="501.9" data-end="509.19">Then we also saw a wonderful beautiful image, because what is JSConf without the opening</span> <span data-start="509.19" data-end="514.889">of the audience's programming and for the tenth\hanniversary we had something very special</span> <span data-start="514.889" data-end="522.979">going on here. That was made with WebGL and a beautiful also live WebGL presentation in</span> <span data-start="522.979" data-end="527.629">order, well, you're guessing it, to work in the browser.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="527.629" data-end="535.43">Yeah. And somebody had to pull all of this together, thank you, Martin. So, somebody</span> <span data-start="535.43" data-end="541.62">has to take all that stuff and bring it into the browser and switch between stuff. Doesn't</span> <span data-start="541.62" data-end="552.29">always work fine. But it was a sweaty job, Martin did it. And we had help from Paul who</span> <span data-start="552.29" data-end="559.47">went up the stage and checked our performance. We actually succeeded in doing a good job.</span> <span data-start="559.47" data-end="566.85">Thank you, Paul. But then Paul broke our browser. But that's okay. Happens sometimes. So that</span> <span data-start="566.85" data-end="574.41">was basically in short very easy to understand a nonchaotic overview about what has to happen</span> <span data-start="574.41" data-end="580.05">to do this. Thank you. [ Applause ]</span> <span data-start="580.05" data-end="589.869"Audience member: Yes. So, this was kind of an overview. So, now we want to explain the\h all the small</span> <span data-start="589.869" data-end="600.019">moving parts. So, what we got from JSConf was a song that you heard. And, yeah, we should</span> <span data-start="600.019" data-end="607.269">make a cover out of this. And the only one doing this stuff in our group is usually Sam</span> <span data-start="607.269" data-end="614.319">with his Game Boys. So, what he did is he created the remix using this framework you</span> <span data-start="614.319" data-end="620.42">can actually see on the screen. And, yeah, you heard it also.</span> <span data-start="620.42" data-end="631.329">And this is not enough. So, we also met or Monday evening this week to actually have</span> <span data-start="631.329" data-end="640.61">tech week with the whole crew. And in the end, we had like kind of this scrum board</span> <span data-start="640.61" data-end="647.959">with many, many tasks and hopefully the most important parts are done. And one of the focus</span> <span data-start="647.959" data-end="654.949">things across was the intro. So, we actually created some kind of timeline and to be sure</span> <span data-start="654.949" data-end="663.98">what we wanted to do. And we also wanted to do more remixes because we have two more musicians</span> <span data-start="663.98" data-end="671.58">in our group, and they all want to play with the music. And first of all, it's Matt. And</span> <span data-start="671.58" data-end="676.5">the second of all is them and they want to talk about the stem cells.</span> <span data-start="676.5" data-end="686.449"Audience member: Hey, I'm Matt. And the reason I'm here with live:js and at this festival is because</span> <span data-start="686.449" data-end="697.369">in 2015 I was invited to talk about my web audio and electronbased sequences sampler</span> <span data-start="697.369" data-end="706.619">and synthesizer that I made for my own personal use. And gave a big talk in the Singapore</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="706.619" data-end="711.889">JavaScript conference. And then I met all these wonderful people here. And we have been</span> <span data-start="711.889" data-end="719.879">hanging since. But in the meantime, I've actually stopped using my software with WAV audio and</span> <span data-start="719.879" data-end="725.079">I've switched to using actual synthesizers, samplers and drum machines. Because it turns</span> <span data-start="725.079" data-end="731.3">out that actual things are better than virtual things. But, hey.</span> <span data-start="731.3" data-end="740.85">But for a JavaScript conference here, the last JSConf EU, me and Jan thought that it</span> <span data-start="740.85" data-end="748.259">would be wonderful if we actually made a full thing in WAV audio instead of just using our</span> <span data-start="748.259" data-end="756.729">hardware. One last time for you people. And Jan's going to tell you all about that.</span> <span data-start="756.729" data-end="764.74"Audience member: Okay. So, yeah. You can\h this is all open source now. So, you can go there. You can</span> <span data-start="764.74" data-end="770.85">take a look. It's currently it's a little bit hard to play. But we hope that we can</span> <span data-start="770.85" data-end="776.069">fix that at some point so you can just open the website and play that. So, the brief was</span> <span data-start="776.069" data-end="783.759">to basically create a remix from that song from Sam. And we, as musicians we have certain</span> <span data-start="783.759" data-end="789.009">softwares that we like to use. One of them is able live, a professional like musicmaking</span> <span data-start="789.009" data-end="794.929">software and it was really easy. It's like an IDE for song writing, basically. So, it</span> <span data-start="794.929" data-end="800.949">was really easy to do sketches. Much easier than programming something. And so, we did</span> <span data-start="800.949" data-end="805.91">sketches in there. You can pull in the remix, you can pull in audio, you can do all kinds</span> <span data-start="805.91" data-end="812.41">of things. But at some point, we had to, you know, get this somehow in the browser. And</span> <span data-start="812.41" data-end="819.449">the main language that music tours speak still is Midi. And Midi is not ring tones or something</span> <span data-start="819.449" data-end="829.239">for those that remember ring tones. It is a very old protocol from 1983 which allows</span> <span data-start="829.239" data-end="832.95">musical instruments to talk to each other. And it's still in wide use. You can see it</span> <span data-start="832.95" data-end="840.339">here on stage. It's great. It's reliable, it's old, it's robust. Much different than,</span> <span data-start="840.339" data-end="848.579">for example, getusermedia or something. And, yeah. And for some reason\h and I still haven't</span> <span data-start="848.579" data-end="854.679">understood why\h we now have web midi which allows us to talk to midi instrument from</span> <span data-start="854.679" data-end="860.029">the browser. And so, what we could do is still keep all of our arrangement enabled live and</span> <span data-start="860.029" data-end="867.549">send this to the thing that we've built over the last four days or, so which is a combination</span> <span data-start="867.549" data-end="875.02">of different modules. It's a sampler. It's a synthesizer. It's a playback device. It</span> <span data-start="875.02" data-end="881.239">has lots of effects. A whole bunch of things you can take a look at. And all of this is</span> <span data-start="881.239" data-end="890.129">driven by Ableton live. And it's wonderful because it also allows you to set cue points</span> <span data-start="890.129" data-end="895.29">and everything. So, we were able to switch between different scenes of the intro and</span> <span data-start="895.29" data-end="901.47">we could also send synchronization data to Martin's computer who would then play certain</span> <span data-start="901.47" data-end="909.989">videos or, you know, not videos. Not actual videos but, you know, animations and 3D animations</span> <span data-start="909.989" data-end="913.66">and stuff like that. So, yeah. That's how we built this. Take a</span> <span data-start="913.66" data-end="918.269">look at it. Yeah. And we hope we can give you something so that you can play it back</span> <span data-start="918.269" data-end="928.989">on your own. >> Okay. So, now let's come to the actual</span> <span data-start="928.989" data-end="933.47">setup on the stage. And this is where Martin should come and say something.</span> <span data-start="933.47" data-end="941.929"Audience member: Yeah. But I think I would just give you some basic facts about the stage. As you can</span> <span data-start="941.929" data-end="951.819">see, it is big. The main screen is something around 40 meters wide and 5 meters high. And</span> <span data-start="951.819" data-end="959.06">yeah. Okay. Doesn't work so well. So, we have five projectors. They are perfectly aligned</span> <span data-start="959.06" data-end="971.61">to create one continuous image. And this one image is 8,000 x1,000 round about pixels wide.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="971.61" data-end="980.339">We run this from a single PC that has three dual HD outputs. And so, it outputs like 11,000.</span> <span data-start="980.339" data-end="987.259">But we only have the browser window a little bit smaller than that.</span> <span data-start="987.259" data-end="995.429">So, additionally to this big screen and the projectors we have all these light panels</span> <span data-start="995.429" data-end="1007.779">around here. 34 of them which are controlled by software. And finally, we have this nice</span> <span data-start="1007.779" data-end="1013.839">little X over there which has an interesting story behind it. Originally it was supposed</span> <span data-start="1013.839" data-end="1020.459">to be canvas and projected on. But then it turned\hus that projectors have sort of a</span> <span data-start="1020.459" data-end="1023.379">focus. So, we couldn't really project anything sharp on it.</span> <span data-start="1023.379" data-end="1031.36">So, Matt had the idea to put it full of LEDs. And we were almost ordering 200 meters of</span> <span data-start="1031.36" data-end="1039.399">these LED strips in order to make it work. Until suddenly someone who would have been</span> <span data-start="1039.399" data-end="1046.049">responsible for soldering it all together was like, wait. We have these\h these professional</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1046.049" data-end="1049.5">LED panels lying around and maybe you just use them.</span> <span data-start="1049.5" data-end="1063.659">So, these are 17 panels. Each of 192x192 pixels. So, in total, much more than we could have</span> <span data-start="1063.659" data-end="1073.889">bought with LED strips. And it's controlled with a single\h full HD signal which is the</span> <span data-start="1073.889" data-end="1079.84">full screen browser window as you might have guessed. And those are the specs that we received</span> <span data-start="1079.84" data-end="1084.019">for this. And it works surprisingly well. If you want</span> <span data-start="1084.019" data-end="1090.471">to create content for it, there is a CodePen somewhere if you check Twitter, JSConf, you</span> <span data-start="1090.471" data-end="1097.28">should be able to find it. Where all of these positions are already\h yeah\h hardcoded and</span> <span data-start="1097.28" data-end="1105.83">you can just like start doing that. We'll probably show some of these at least tomorrow.</span> <span data-start="1105.83" data-end="1115.669">Yeah. And I guess that's it for me. Yeah. [ Applause ]</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1115.669" data-end="1118.71">Yeah. Yes, Ruth. >> Yeah, sorry, the slide. It's not here.</span> <span data-start="1118.71" data-end="1125.95">So, next thing is\h this is Ruth. >> Yeah, we'll just mention. She did do all</span> <span data-start="1125.95" data-end="1133.34">the design for everything as well as everything else, by the way. So, yeah.</span> <span data-start="1133.34" data-end="1139.85">[ Applause ] So, yeah. My software. So, I started building</span> <span data-start="1139.85" data-end="1145.7">a piece of audiovisualization software approximately five years ago, I think? This was very much</span> <span data-start="1145.7" data-end="1150.809">an experiment. Like we got the web audio API about seven years ago and I started analyzing</span> <span data-start="1150.809" data-end="1156.69">it and moving stuff around the DOM. I started playing with SVGs. And this is a great idea</span> <span data-start="1156.69" data-end="1161.23">until you chuck about a hundred SVGs at the DOM and analyze audio at the same time and</span> <span data-start="1161.23" data-end="1167.19">try to move them around. I quickly moved to Canvas. But the software which I built, and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1167.19" data-end="1174.96">I have been building it for five year was a tangled spaghetti code. And I was gigging</span> <span data-start="1174.96" data-end="1181.679">with it, mixing video to the beat, mixing Canvas shades and crashing every five minutes.</span> <span data-start="1181.679" data-end="1187.02">It was a great experiment and I had a really great time making it. But I came to this year,</span> <span data-start="1187.02" data-end="1193.86">it's probably a good time to start naught, naught, point naught, one instead of naught</span> <span data-start="1193.86" data-end="1200.6">point naught, naught, naught version. And it would be good to do one thing.</span> <span data-start="1200.6" data-end="1205.69">So, I started this year, and for the past couple of weeks, especially during this hack</span> <span data-start="1205.69" data-end="1210.77">week, I have been basically been trying to get it to a stage to use it for circumstantials.</span> <span data-start="1210.77" data-end="1219.12">Sam is doing visuals with me. It's got four moving parts. And it's doing one thing. And</span> <span data-start="1219.12" data-end="1226.639">focus on my style as an artist. It's generative. It basically just chucks some Canvas with</span> <span data-start="1226.639" data-end="1233.51">some parameters. I'm analyzing audio and using midi as well. And it just generates visuals.</span> <span data-start="1233.51" data-end="1242.21">That's what I want it to do. No more video or mixing, just visuals. And four moving parts,</span> <span data-start="1242.21" data-end="1248.26">colors, turn into palettes. I've got vectors and turn into grids. I put some physics in,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1248.26" data-end="1257.85">I'm looking forward to that. And shapes. Shapes are going make sprites. And when it came to</span> <span data-start="1257.85" data-end="1266.84">the X, Martin mapped the X to use the normal screen. We knew where the positions were.</span> <span data-start="1266.84" data-end="1272.47">I made a CodePen with the coordinates of where these positions were. For me, I was pretty</span> <span data-start="1272.47" data-end="1277.87">okay. She had made a grid system. I could make a custom grid, just map the coordinates</span> <span data-start="1277.87" data-end="1283.38">of the X, right? So, if we take a look at that. There's a great contentious with my</span> <span data-start="1283.38" data-end="1287.87">software. All I have to do\h this is a normal visualization</span> <span data-start="1287.87" data-end="1292.46">going on. I can't see what's going on. >> Yeah, it's working.</span> <span data-start="1292.46" data-end="1299.009"Audience member: I just pipe in the coordinates and map nice little squares like we saw for the opening</span> <span data-start="1299.009" data-end="1306.21">which actually didn't take too much effort in the end. So, yeah. This is available on</span> <span data-start="1306.21" data-end="1312.69">GitHub. The URL is there. It is in a state of getting it working for this conference.</span> <span data-start="1312.69" data-end="1314.72">But yeah. That's Bizra. [ Applause ]</span> <span data-start="1314.72" data-end="1330.889"Audience member: Yeah. So, that's powering the O and the X. And we also have a software which is powering</span> <span data-start="1330.889" data-end="1335.519">the whole stage behind me. And Sam will talk about that.</span> <span data-start="1335.519" data-end="1340.049"Audience member: Indeed. Hello. So, yeah, I'm just going to quickly run you through modV. And if all</span> <span data-start="1340.049" data-end="1345.32">goes well, you should be able to see my desktop in modV in the center. The X is kind of in</span> <span data-start="1345.32" data-end="1353.27">the way. But never mind, hey. Hey, there we go. Perfect. Thank you. So, yeah, this is</span> <span data-start="1353.27" data-end="1360.299">modV. Wow. This is a screenshot, the X is in the way. But modV is an environment that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1360.299" data-end="1366.419">I have been building in the browser for I think it's six years this year now. It's Canvas,</span> <span data-start="1366.419" data-end="1372.289">WebGL. It's all audio reactive. It's got a whole module system which you can kind of</span> <span data-start="1372.289" data-end="1378.45">just drop in new modules. So, like if we just did everything that's going on. We can just</span> <span data-start="1378.45" data-end="1384.25">kind of drop in, I don't know, some sound calls.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1384.25" data-end="1392.5">And then if we just give it some signal through the microphone. Yeah. So, you can kind of</span> <span data-start="1392.5" data-end="1396.679">see it going there. But then you can stack this, and it's got a whole UI and you can</span> <span data-start="1396.679" data-end="1403.049">build modules for it. Yeah. To get this working because modV has a plugin system, Martin sent</span> <span data-start="1403.049" data-end="1408.19">me the specs for the wide screen. So, this whole wide screen is actually a 1080 signal</span> <span data-start="1408.19" data-end="1415.799">split into two sections. The top section is the lefthand side of the screen, and the bottom</span> <span data-start="1415.799" data-end="1422.049">signal is the righthand side of the screen. And with the plugins I could hook into the</span> <span data-start="1422.049" data-end="1428.659">plugin and spawn a new output window and that's just actually running on another desktop here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1428.659" data-end="1435.809">If I swipe, that's my desktop background. So, yeah, this is just another browser window</span> <span data-start="1435.809" data-end="1443.919">for the software that I just kind of am tinkering away at in my free time. It's all open source.</span> <span data-start="1443.919" data-end="1451.949">Go to modV.JS.org. It's all there. But, yeah. That's a quick run through, really.</span> <span data-start="1451.949" data-end="1459.85">[ Applause ] >> Yeah. So, now we are switching to the software</span> <span data-start="1459.85" data-end="1466.289">I'm creating, I have been doing this also for five years now. And I'm controlling the</span> <span data-start="1466.289" data-end="1474.5">lights. And this is how my software looks like. And it's\h it's getting its databased</span> <span data-start="1474.5" data-end="1481.58">on what we use as projecting. And you can see in the top I have a grid of colors which</span> <span data-start="1481.58" data-end="1487.7">I get from modV and I'm mapping them to the actual lights that you can see in the venue.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1487.7" data-end="1492.919">And now we'll just go over to my PC to actually make sense of what I'm saying so that you</span> <span data-start="1492.919" data-end="1509.45">can see that the lights are working. So, yeah. This is all\h also controllable by a midi</span> <span data-start="1509.45" data-end="1518.269">controller and I can just add kind of different\h yeah. Visuals in modV and this is presented</span> <span data-start="1518.269" data-end="1527.909">live on the lights. Yeah. Which is pretty cool. I think. And all of this is connected</span> <span data-start="1527.909" data-end="1537.519">to the XPort using a custom created web use, and there's a controller. As you can see it</span> <span data-start="1537.519" data-end="1544.309">here, using an Arduino. And this is everything in the browser. There's no server running</span> <span data-start="1544.309" data-end="1551.159">at all. Yeah. So, you can control lights that are actual everywhere just with the browser</span> <span data-start="1551.159" data-end="1557.85">window which is cool. I think. [ Applause ]</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1557.85" data-end="1566.049">Yeah. And that's like how we built the stage and how we worked together to actually get</span> <span data-start="1566.049" data-end="1573">you this live show. And you see there are a lot of moving parts which could go wrong.</span> <span data-start="1573" data-end="1578.22">Especially if you're just using everything in the browser. And to debate get you some</span> <span data-start="1578.22" data-end="1586.48">kind of goody, we released the song that Sam created on Sound Cloud. You can find it on</span> <span data-start="1586.48" data-end="1600.97">his sound Cloud if you want to. Yes. And that's it from the talk perspective. We will do now</span> <span data-start="1600.97" data-end="1639.96">the remixes and</span> <span data-start="1639.96" data-end="1775.019">the show again. So, have fun.
