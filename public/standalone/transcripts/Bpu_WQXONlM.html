<p><span data-start="9.31" data-end="13.75">Whoa.</span> <span data-start="13.75" data-end="14.83">So many people.</span> <span data-start="14.83" data-end="17.99">Did you see Jessica's talk about comics?</span> <span data-start="17.99" data-end="19.19">Did you like it?</span> <span data-start="19.19" data-end="20.19">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="20.19" data-end="21.28">I like comics as well.</span> <span data-start="21.28" data-end="22.34">And a lot of cartoons.</span> <span data-start="22.34" data-end="26.91">They are company for me for almost my entire life.</span> <span data-start="26.91" data-end="31.93">When I was a kid, I was sitting at the TV every Sunday morning and watching cartoons</span> <span data-start="31.93" data-end="33.36">for hours.</span> <span data-start="33.36" data-end="37.05">My parents didn't like it, but I loved the cartoons.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="37.05" data-end="45.87">Later on, when I went to school, I started drawing little characters in my math books</span> <span data-start="45.87" data-end="46.87">in the corner.</span> <span data-start="46.87" data-end="50.239">And every time you flip the page your characters came to life.</span> <span data-start="50.239" data-end="52.239">It was really amazing.</span> <span data-start="52.239" data-end="54.35">So, my name is Martin.</span> <span data-start="54.35" data-end="56.91">I'm a principal project engineer.</span> <span data-start="56.91" data-end="64.79">I organize a conference based around Angular.</span> <span data-start="64.79" data-end="70.42">I later on used my math books for the original purpose and studied math.</span> <span data-start="70.42" data-end="75.19">I love math and the possibilities.</span> <span data-start="75.19" data-end="76.78">I and love cats.</span> <span data-start="76.78" data-end="82.64">That's probably the reason why all over the Internet my cat's face is my avatar for Twitter,</span> <span data-start="82.64" data-end="84.38">GitHub, everything.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="84.38" data-end="89.77">And my cat's nickname, Chaos Monster became my Twitter handle.</span> <span data-start="89.77" data-end="94.74">If you see a cat like this, it's probably me.</span> <span data-start="94.74" data-end="97.42">I started as a backend developer.</span> <span data-start="97.42" data-end="103.96">And at some time in the last ten years I switched to the frontend and became a JavaScript developer.</span> <span data-start="103.96" data-end="109.509">I did that because I was passionate about the UX possibilities that you can have.</span> <span data-start="109.509" data-end="116.14">All the user interaction is most possible in the browser when AngularJS 1.0.7 came out</span> <span data-start="116.14" data-end="117.14">years ago.</span> <span data-start="117.14" data-end="118.78">And I was like, yes!</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="118.78" data-end="123.13">I want to do everything in the browser because I want to be close to the user.</span> <span data-start="123.13" data-end="125.439">I want to have interaction with them.</span> <span data-start="125.439" data-end="129.299">But I was really, really afraid of animations.</span> <span data-start="129.299" data-end="133.279">Every time my product owner came to me and said something like, hey, can you move that</span> <span data-start="133.279" data-end="134.569">from the left to the right?</span> <span data-start="134.569" data-end="138.93">I was like, don't you think it would be better if it suddenly pops up on the right side of</span> <span data-start="138.93" data-end="139.93">the screen!</span> <span data-start="139.93" data-end="145.12">It's way better, it's way better and I don't have to do animations.</span> <span data-start="145.12" data-end="158.019">The time passed by and I watched documentation by Studio Ghibli, creating the moving castle.</span> <span data-start="158.019" data-end="167.569">And this was about how they made walking animations a smooth and natural experience for everyone.</span> <span data-start="167.569" data-end="174.4">And I was like, all the time I learned from different domains from other professions.</span> <span data-start="174.4" data-end="180.779">Why don't I look at cartoons and can see what I can learn about animations from watching</span> <span data-start="180.779" data-end="183.799">cartoons and learning how they do it?</span> <span data-start="183.799" data-end="189.95">So, if you do a little bit of research in field, you are not able to get around this</span> <span data-start="189.95" data-end="192.769">book, called the illusion of life.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="192.769" data-end="194.989">It's by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnson.</span> <span data-start="194.989" data-end="199.4">Both are animators at Disney.</span> <span data-start="199.4" data-end="204.59">And in the '80s when they released that book, they boiled down all the knowledge that Disney</span> <span data-start="204.59" data-end="209.799">acquired in the last not 50 decades five decades.</span> <span data-start="209.799" data-end="215.37">They did the amazing animation movies to 12 principles of animation.</span> <span data-start="215.37" data-end="219.499">And I thought to myself, after read them, they are really amazing.</span> <span data-start="219.499" data-end="224.349">I have a lot that I learned from that and boiled it down to the eight principles of</span> <span data-start="224.349" data-end="227.01">web animation.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="227.01" data-end="230.159">Starting with squash and stretch.</span> <span data-start="230.159" data-end="233.699">If you think about a ball, a tennis ball, for example.</span> <span data-start="233.699" data-end="238.719">And if you think how a tennis ball would behave if you throw it on the floor and how it would</span> <span data-start="238.719" data-end="241.219">bounce back into the air.</span> <span data-start="241.219" data-end="248.069">You think about it, it wouldn't really change its form, its shape.</span> <span data-start="248.069" data-end="251.319">It would look something like this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="251.319" data-end="253.489">But that doesn't feel really good.</span> <span data-start="253.489" data-end="255.859">Because you can't feel the speed of the ball.</span> <span data-start="255.859" data-end="262.43">You can't feel the impact of the ball on the floor and you can't feel how the ball falls</span> <span data-start="262.43" data-end="263.81">jumps back into the air.</span> <span data-start="263.81" data-end="269.24">So, what you can do instead is doing stretch and squash.</span> <span data-start="269.24" data-end="272.34">You use stretch to show speed.</span> <span data-start="272.34" data-end="275.389">To show how the ball gets accelerated.</span> <span data-start="275.389" data-end="282.61">And you use squash to show how the ball gets pulled and pushed into the floor.</span> <span data-start="282.61" data-end="287.129">And how the energy goes back into speed afterwards.</span> <span data-start="287.129" data-end="293.629">And you cannot only use that to create a ball that bounces off a floor, but you can also</span> <span data-start="293.629" data-end="297.5">use it to create a feeling for material.</span> <span data-start="297.5" data-end="302.169">This box that is created with key frames in CSS feels really squashy.</span> <span data-start="302.169" data-end="305.039">It feels like bouncy.</span> <span data-start="305.039" data-end="307.15">It gets adjectives.</span> <span data-start="307.15" data-end="308.84">It's not just a box.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="308.84" data-end="312.639">So, you have to keep a few things in mind when you do that.</span> <span data-start="312.639" data-end="315.169">For example, you have to think about the volume.</span> <span data-start="315.169" data-end="320.439">The volume of the object should not change because your brain recognizes if you're just</span> <span data-start="320.439" data-end="324.43">changing the volume of the object by squashing or stretching it.</span> <span data-start="324.43" data-end="326.82">And it feels really off if you do that.</span> <span data-start="326.82" data-end="333.439">And you can use squash and stretch to give objects weight and a feeling of speed.</span> <span data-start="333.439" data-end="336.11">And also, to give them material.</span> <span data-start="336.11" data-end="340.03">The feeling on how the material works.</span> <span data-start="340.03" data-end="345.02">The second principle is anticipation.</span> <span data-start="345.02" data-end="350.34">If you look at this stick figure, you would think, okay, what happens next?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="350.34" data-end="355.3">You would not expect it to just fly off in the air like this.</span> <span data-start="355.3" data-end="358.499">It doesn't feel right, right?</span> <span data-start="358.499" data-end="362.909">What you actually want to do is you want it to bend the knees and then go up.</span> <span data-start="362.909" data-end="369.699">Because with that, you give the view of this animation, the feeling that something will</span> <span data-start="369.699" data-end="370.699">happen.</span> <span data-start="370.699" data-end="372.65">The user can anticipate what happens next.</span> <span data-start="372.65" data-end="378.639">If I'm going down and I'm jumping up, you will expect me to jump up because you've seen</span> <span data-start="378.639" data-end="381.759">me going to the floor and you expect something to happen here.</span> <span data-start="381.759" data-end="390.03">And you can use the same in the browser when you do some animations before you do a bigger</span> <span data-start="390.03" data-end="391.03">animation.</span> <span data-start="391.03" data-end="393.11">Before you show that you can drag and drop it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="393.11" data-end="398.6">Also, really important what I did not do here, but what can be really important for anticipation</span> <span data-start="398.6" data-end="399.699">is the timing.</span> <span data-start="399.699" data-end="407.78">So, if you slowly start winding up before you do a really fast throw of a ball, this</span> <span data-start="407.78" data-end="408.879">is also important.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="408.879" data-end="409.95">Not only the winding up.</span> <span data-start="409.95" data-end="413.039">But also, the speed of how I do it.</span> <span data-start="413.039" data-end="417.729">The third principle is staging.</span> <span data-start="417.729" data-end="420.46">Frank and Ollie talked said it's like that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="420.46" data-end="425.189">If you have a presentation of an idea, it should be completely and unmistakably clear</span> <span data-start="425.189" data-end="428.569">what you want to do.</span> <span data-start="428.569" data-end="435.669">Don't irritate your user or viewer by pointing them in a certain direction and then doing</span> <span data-start="435.669" data-end="439.919">something totally different.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="439.919" data-end="442.009">Look at the stage and all those arrows.</span> <span data-start="442.009" data-end="448.15">I focus you on one point of the screen.</span> <span data-start="448.15" data-end="453.939">Doesn't have to be the center of the screen but focus your view on one point of the screen</span> <span data-start="453.939" data-end="460.039">and you expect something to happen here like a character appearing like a magician.</span> <span data-start="460.039" data-end="462.9">And use that technique wherever you do it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="462.9" data-end="468.419">If it's on the left or on the right, just use it to make it clear for the user where</span> <span data-start="468.419" data-end="471.249">something will appear, or something will happen.</span> <span data-start="471.249" data-end="474.58">The same goes for when we are in the western culture.</span> <span data-start="474.58" data-end="479.389">We expect something that comes from the left to the right to appear on stage.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="479.389" data-end="484.699">If it goes from the center to the right, we think it disappears from stage and you would</span> <span data-start="484.699" data-end="488.749">drop it down to the bottom of the stage.</span> <span data-start="488.749" data-end="490.88">You think it will never come back.</span> <span data-start="490.88" data-end="493.93">Keep those things in mind because they are part of staging.</span> <span data-start="493.93" data-end="498.09">When you look at this green diff.</span> <span data-start="498.09" data-end="502.4">And I want you to focus on that diff.</span> <span data-start="502.4" data-end="504.99">Now I told you to focus on the diff.</span> <span data-start="504.99" data-end="509.43">Imagine you're a user and you're in a browser and I want you as a developer to focus on</span> <span data-start="509.43" data-end="510.43">the diff.</span> <span data-start="510.43" data-end="515.949">What I can do is I can make the background opaque and do a little bit of animation to</span> <span data-start="515.949" data-end="518.59">focus on the green diff.</span> <span data-start="518.59" data-end="519.59">Maybe it's a greet button.</span> <span data-start="519.59" data-end="525.56">Maybe I want you to save that form because otherwise all your data will be gone.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="525.56" data-end="528.72">Number four.</span> <span data-start="528.72" data-end="533.851">I have a little bit of a problem with that because in animation this is a really, really</span> <span data-start="533.851" data-end="536.38">important thing to do.</span> <span data-start="536.38" data-end="544.73">But I wasn't sure how to translate it to the web browser.</span> <span data-start="544.73" data-end="546.839">Let's go a little bit back.</span> <span data-start="546.839" data-end="554.82">If you have a motion in a movie or an anime, you have a lot of pictures and those pictures</span> <span data-start="554.82" data-end="557.98">slightly change from frame to frame.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="557.98" data-end="561.87">Normally we talk about 12 to 24 frames per second.</span> <span data-start="561.87" data-end="566.34">If you're a gamer, you want to run on 60 frames per second.</span> <span data-start="566.34" data-end="573.32">Meaning you want to have so many images that slightly differentiate to each other in each</span> <span data-start="573.32" data-end="574.82">second.</span> <span data-start="574.82" data-end="582.37">And back in the days, in the 1980s and before that, before this was a thing, all of those</span> <span data-start="582.37" data-end="585.589">frames, all of those images, had to be drawn by hand.</span> <span data-start="585.589" data-end="591.88">So, people were sitting there and drawing the same image over and over again and just</span> <span data-start="591.88" data-end="595.49">slightly make a change to the previous one.</span> <span data-start="595.49" data-end="599.72">And here comes the technique of straight ahead.</span> <span data-start="599.72" data-end="607.72">If you just change the image just slightly without any concept or any story about it,</span> <span data-start="607.72" data-end="612.94">you just create something that is randomly moving like fire or rain or explosions.</span> <span data-start="612.94" data-end="615.97">This is a really great technique to do that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="615.97" data-end="621.779">But if you want to tell a story, you need a concept, a story board behind that.</span> <span data-start="621.779" data-end="626.149">And for that you think about, what is my first pose?</span> <span data-start="626.149" data-end="629.04">And then you think about will be my last pose?</span> <span data-start="629.04" data-end="635.199">And you think about, what poses are in between those two poses that are important for me</span> <span data-start="635.199" data-end="636.68">to show my audience?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="636.68" data-end="640.949">So, the audience gets an understanding of the movement we want to have.</span> <span data-start="640.949" data-end="646.76">And then you create those key frames and afterwards you just add more and more frames by using</span> <span data-start="646.76" data-end="648.69">the straight-ahead technique.</span> <span data-start="648.69" data-end="652.019">And then at the end you have a movement.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="652.019" data-end="658.329">And with CSS we have CSS Transform, we have scale, rotate, you name it.</span> <span data-start="658.329" data-end="661.73">And we also have CSS keyframes.</span> <span data-start="661.73" data-end="664.17">And this is where my mind just popped.</span> <span data-start="664.17" data-end="665.699">I have those poses.</span> <span data-start="665.699" data-end="666.79">Those are key frames.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="982.36" data-end="987.899">And with that I'm coming to the eighth principle called appealing.</span> <span data-start="987.899" data-end="991.769">Frank and Ollie just said, "Make your animations appeal.</span> <span data-start="991.769" data-end="996.22">Make the viewer feel like I love this character.</span> <span data-start="996.22" data-end="999.379">I totally dig this character, how it works and moves."</span> <span data-start="999.379" data-end="1003.56">And I want to make that my conclusion as well.</span> <span data-start="1003.56" data-end="1010.519">So, here's my conclusion of looking at the 12 principles of animation by Frank and Ollie.</span> <span data-start="1010.519" data-end="1014.12">And how to translate them to the web.</span> <span data-start="1014.12" data-end="1017.899">First, use animations to improve your user experience.</span> <span data-start="1017.899" data-end="1021.23">Because motion can tell a story.</span> <span data-start="1021.23" data-end="1023.839">And to tell a story, you need a storybook.</span> <span data-start="1023.839" data-end="1028.94">Make yourself comfortable with the idea to think about, where does my animation start?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1028.94" data-end="1030.95">What is in between of my animation?</span> <span data-start="1030.95" data-end="1032.59">And where does my animation stop?</span> <span data-start="1032.59" data-end="1037.36">Make this concept, not only for one animation, but for the entirety of your website.</span> <span data-start="1037.36" data-end="1041.15">Think about how all the animations can work together.</span> <span data-start="1041.15" data-end="1048.38">And please, don't overdo your animations because if you do too much, and it doesn't feel really</span> <span data-start="1048.38" data-end="1049.38">right.</span> <span data-start="1049.38" data-end="1052.92">And last but not least, have fun.</span> <span data-start="1052.92" data-end="1056">Have fun with doing animations because animations are great.</span> <span data-start="1056" data-end="1058.23">And don't be afraid as I was.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1058.23" data-end="1062.34">Because there's so much content about how to do animations.</span> <span data-start="1062.34" data-end="1069.85">Look at 12 principles of animations and learn from over a century of animations on how to</span> <span data-start="1069.85" data-end="1072.87">really do great animations.</span> <span data-start="1072.87" data-end="1073.87">Thank you for listening to me.</span> </p>
