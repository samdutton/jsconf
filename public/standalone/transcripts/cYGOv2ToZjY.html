data-start="938.8" data-end="943.329">become a candidate recommendation and</span> <span data-start="943.329" data-end="945.129">what that means is the spec has moved on</span> <span

to</span> <span data-start="967.3" data-end="970.42">be the spec and we need to have two</span> <span data-start="970.42" data-end="973.089">independent interoperable implementation</span> <span data-start="973.089" data-end="975.939">of all of the features so that means</span> <span data-start="975.939" data-end="978.04">that we need to have two browsers really</span> <span

data-end="1451.55">to come up with us or the use case as</span> <span data-start="1451.55" data-end="1454.01">opposed to proposing syntax actually the</span> <span data-start="1454.01" data-end="1455.72">syntax or sense is very very hard to</span> <span data-start="1455.72" data-end="1457.13">kind of work out because it has to cope</span> <span data-start="1457.13" data-end="1457.46">with all</span> <span data-start="1457.46" data-end="1460.039">old stuff and legacy stuff and quite</span> <span data-start="1460.039" data-end="1461.6">often we go round and round on names</span> <span data-start="1461.6" data-end="1463.49">quite a few times before it's decided</span> <span data-start="1463.49" data-end="1466.22">what it's going to be but the use case</span> <span data-start="1466.22" data-end="1468.62">is the important thing now what problem</span> <span data-start="1468.62" data-end="1470.48">are you trying to solve with this CSS</span> <span data-start="1470.48" data-end="1473.419">and our authors already working around</span> <span data-start="1473.419" data-end="1475.19">this in some way a lot of the time</span> <span data-start="1475.19" data-end="1476.77">people are doing things in JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1476.77" data-end="1478.909">that would make a lot of sense to be</span> <span data-start="1478.909" data-end="1481.039">able to do in CSS what if we've got that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1481.039" data-end="1483.71">JavaScript implementation then that's a</span> <span data-start="1483.71" data-end="1485.659">really good test case for well hey know</span> <span data-start="1485.659" data-end="1487.549">how do we actually do this in native CSS</span> <span data-start="1487.549" data-end="1490.34">so that's really useful and if using you</span> <span data-start="1490.34" data-end="1491.899">know using javascript to do things isn't</span> <span data-start="1491.899" data-end="1494.57">a bad thing and but are there problems</span> <span data-start="1494.57" data-end="1496.22">because of that use of JavaScript you</span> <span data-start="1496.22" data-end="1497.57">know is it creating a performance issue</span> <span data-start="1497.57" data-end="1499.25">that perhaps we could solve that it was</span> <span data-start="1499.25" data-end="1502.01">part of CSS so that sort of stuff if you</span> <span data-start="1502.01" data-end="1503.929">can bring that into an issue on github</span> <span data-start="1503.929" data-end="1505.61">if people are going to look at that and</span> <span data-start="1505.61" data-end="1507.35">then they talk about it you know we</span> <span data-start="1507.35" data-end="1508.97">bring up these things in working group</span> <span data-start="1508.97" data-end="1510.98">meetings and talk about them and try and</span> <span data-start="1510.98" data-end="1512.12">see if there is a way that they could be</span> <span data-start="1512.12" data-end="1517.309">solved so as an example you can go and</span> <span data-start="1517.309" data-end="1519.08">have a look at one of the things that</span> <span data-start="1519.08" data-end="1521.029">happens people start to look at CSS grid</span> <span data-start="1521.029" data-end="1523.399">and they say oh you know can I just</span> <span data-start="1523.399" data-end="1526.309">style the backgrounds of grid areas can</span> <span data-start="1526.309" data-end="1528.23">i style column tracks can i add borders</span> <span data-start="1528.23" data-end="1529.64">to them and the answer the moment is no</span> <span data-start="1529.64" data-end="1531.049">you have to put an element in there to</span> <span data-start="1531.049" data-end="1532.789">style them and it's kind of creating</span> <span data-start="1532.789" data-end="1535.039">containers for elements so we need some</span> <span data-start="1535.039" data-end="1537.44">kind of grid cell pseudo element in</span> <span data-start="1537.44" data-end="1539.419">order that you can style the backgrounds</span> <span data-start="1539.419" data-end="1541.399">and borders absolutely a lot of people</span> <span data-start="1541.399" data-end="1542.899">have asked for so it's something that</span> <span data-start="1542.899" data-end="1544.97">has been put in as an issue and quite a</span> <span data-start="1544.97" data-end="1545.96">lot of people have commented on that</span> <span data-start="1545.96" data-end="1547.85">thread this thing you're interested in</span> <span data-start="1547.85" data-end="1549.08">you can always go and read and see if</span> <span data-start="1549.08" data-end="1551.45">you've got anything else to share so</span> <span data-start="1551.45" data-end="1553.94">this is how new CSS is happening if</span> <span data-start="1553.94" data-end="1556.25">people are asking for things and we're</span> <span data-start="1556.25" data-end="1557.539">talking about them and trying to work</span> <span data-start="1557.539" data-end="1559.909">out the best way of doing that so that</span> <span data-start="1559.909" data-end="1561.23">would probably that'd be a level two</span> <span data-start="1561.23" data-end="1563.299">feature now you can see it's got a CSS</span> <span data-start="1563.299" data-end="1566">grid to a flight tag on it so that we</span> <span data-start="1566" data-end="1568.01">can sort of keep track on it as we start</span> <span data-start="1568.01" data-end="1570.169">to look at the level to a CSS grid</span> <span data-start="1570.169" data-end="1574.309">layout now it's not just about new</span> <span data-start="1574.309" data-end="1575.929">features there are bugs in</span> <span data-start="1575.929" data-end="1578.809">specifications and you know the CSS</span> <span data-start="1578.809" data-end="1580.1">effects so it can be very long and</span> <span data-start="1580.1" data-end="1581.48">complex and they can end up with bugs</span> <span data-start="1581.48" data-end="1583.07">then if you spot something that's an</span> <span data-start="1583.07" data-end="1585.47">issue come and raise it if it turns out</span> <span data-start="1585.47" data-end="1586.82">it's not an issue it might just be that</span> <span data-start="1586.82" data-end="1589.34">we need to clarify that bit of respect</span> <span data-start="1589.34" data-end="1590.99">there because someone thinks that what's</span> <span data-start="1590.99" data-end="1592.73">said in the spec is actually wrong so</span> <span data-start="1592.73" data-end="1594.11">that's actually a bug as well to what</span> <span data-start="1594.11" data-end="1595.909">the specs to be clear so common log</span> <span data-start="1595.909" data-end="1601.909">issues against respects and web browsers</span> <span data-start="1601.909" data-end="1603.2">they'll be very happy to hear about your</span> <span data-start="1603.2" data-end="1605.779">interrupts issues too you can go and you</span> <span data-start="1605.779" data-end="1607.909">can log bugs and any browser if you find</span> <span data-start="1607.909" data-end="1609.409">saying that it's not working in a</span> <span data-start="1609.409" data-end="1611.57">browser go and tell them about it</span> <span data-start="1611.57" data-end="1614.029">because quite often it's when people get</span> <span data-start="1614.029" data-end="1615.95">their hands on new CSS they start using</span> <span data-start="1615.95" data-end="1617.6">it with some other CSS they start using</span> <span data-start="1617.6" data-end="1619.34">it with some JavaScript or in</span> <span data-start="1619.34" data-end="1620.779">conjunction with a framework and that</span> <span data-start="1620.779" data-end="1622.49">shows that bugs that no one spotted</span> <span data-start="1622.49" data-end="1624.649">before if you find them go and log them</span> <span data-start="1624.649" data-end="1627.98">that helps everybody and you learn this</span> <span data-start="1627.98" data-end="1630.769">great thing when you log bugs you learn</span> <span data-start="1630.769" data-end="1633.259">how to make reduce test cases which I</span> <span data-start="1633.259" data-end="1635.69">believe is a web development superpower</span> <span data-start="1635.69" data-end="1637.279">and not enough people are good enough at</span> <span data-start="1637.279" data-end="1639.529">doing this it makes your life a lot</span> <span data-start="1639.529" data-end="1641.869">easier if you learn how to make a reduce</span>
