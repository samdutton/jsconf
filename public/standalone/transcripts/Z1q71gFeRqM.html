<p><span data-start="45.97" data-end="50.65">If you think about color palettes  —  math == art is pretty</span> <span data-start="50.65" data-end="51.65">great.</span> <span data-start="51.65" data-end="56.41">There's a lot of math inside of art and a lot of math made of art.</span> <span data-start="56.41" data-end="57.42">Color palettes.</span> <span data-start="57.42" data-end="61.13">If you want to make something visually pleasing, you</span> <span data-start="61.13" data-end="67.32">usually have to follow a mathematical principle for a split complementary</span> <span data-start="67.32" data-end="73.67">or compound or triads  —  there's a lot of math that goes into just color.</span> <span data-start="73.67" data-end="74.67">And you think about music.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="74.67" data-end="75.67">Music is really amazing.</span> <span data-start="75.67" data-end="79.01">It can make you feel sorrowful or triumphant.</span> <span data-start="79.01" data-end="81.25">But when you get down to it, it's just data.</span> <span data-start="81.25" data-end="86.06">It's a time signature and a scale and it's points on that scale, which are</span> <span data-start="86.06" data-end="88.36">data points or notes.</span> <span data-start="88.36" data-end="90.66">Gang a bunch of those up, and you have a chord.</span> <span data-start="90.66" data-end="91.77">And you can give that to everybody.</span> <span data-start="91.77" data-end="96.59">And if they can render that, i.e.. play an instrument, they get to actually recreate</span> <span data-start="96.59" data-end="98.69">that music anywhere.</span> <span data-start="98.69" data-end="100.95">And it's the same thing with code art.</span> <span data-start="100.95" data-end="106.1">You can make it in JavaScript, share it with the world, 7 billion people can look at it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="106.1" data-end="108.64">Different medium, but same general principle.</span> <span data-start="108.64" data-end="110.79">Hello, everybody.</span> <span data-start="110.79" data-end="112.22">It's echo-y.</span> <span data-start="112.22" data-end="117.24">I'm John Brown and I'm from Portland, Oregon, about as far away as you can get on the continental</span> <span data-start="117.24" data-end="118.24">United States.</span> <span data-start="118.24" data-end="121.52">So I've had a long plane ride.</span> <span data-start="121.52" data-end="131.86">I work with a firm that works on tech in interesting ways and interacting retail experiences.</span> <span data-start="131.86" data-end="133.62">I do a lot of stuff.</span> <span data-start="133.62" data-end="137.31">Front end, back end, hardware, software, and I do a lot of cool</span> <span data-start="137.31" data-end="140.76">stuff, and more and more I'm doing it with just JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="140.76" data-end="144.01">And I'm going to talk to you guys about a few projects that</span> <span data-start="144.01" data-end="148.17">are essentially 100% JavaScript that I think are really rad and I'm really</span> <span data-start="148.17" data-end="149.17">proud of.</span> <span data-start="149.17" data-end="153.849">But at night, I work with a group in Portland that does all kinds</span> <span data-start="153.849" data-end="156.09">of code art and generative art.</span> <span data-start="156.09" data-end="161.73">And I'm one of the leaders of that community that put on events that are</span> <span data-start="161.73" data-end="168.01">community art projects, I take part in those, I put on smaller projects,</span> <span data-start="168.01" data-end="169.29">and I'm a digital artist.</span> <span data-start="169.29" data-end="170.68">And I'm really proud to say that.</span> <span data-start="170.68" data-end="172.129">And I have the pedigree.</span> <span data-start="172.129" data-end="174.68">I really feel like I can say this.</span> <span data-start="174.68" data-end="176.84">Because like all great artists, I dropped out of</span> <span data-start="176.84" data-end="178.34">art school.</span> <span data-start="178.34" data-end="181.09">Two times.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="181.09" data-end="183.91">My mom is not happy with that slide.</span> <span data-start="183.91" data-end="187.959">So these are a few selected math works  —  I play a lot with</span> <span data-start="187.959" data-end="188.959">math.</span> <span data-start="188.959" data-end="194.59">And this is an exploration of sine and cosine, perfectly said.</span> <span data-start="194.59" data-end="202.43">It's rotation, circular movement, and you can create amazing things just by layering.</span> <span data-start="202.43" data-end="206.18">And I'm actually really proud to be here today.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="206.18" data-end="208.2">I'm kind of bummed that I'm not in Portland right now,</span> <span data-start="208.2" data-end="212.63">because there's an art show going on, Visions of Tomorrows.</span> <span data-start="212.63" data-end="214.349">It actually starts tomorrow.</span> <span data-start="214.349" data-end="216.709">But I have a piece in there, and it's a generative art</span> <span data-start="216.709" data-end="217.879">piece.</span> <span data-start="217.879" data-end="225.08">And it's hanging up alongside sculptures, oil paintings, mixed media.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="225.08" data-end="229">I just wanted to point it out, because a lot of times people think digital</span> <span data-start="229" data-end="231.87">art is not true art, but it really is.</span> <span data-start="231.87" data-end="236.08">It's recognized by all the important people, in my opinion.</span> <span data-start="236.08" data-end="239.709">So why am I here, at a JavaScript conference, talking about art?</span> <span data-start="239.709" data-end="240.98">It seems a little weird.</span> <span data-start="240.98" data-end="245.58">Well, if we go back to the title of the talk, we talked a little bit about</span> <span data-start="245.58" data-end="246.58">math and art.</span> <span data-start="246.58" data-end="247.97">Art and code.</span> <span data-start="247.97" data-end="250.38">I feel like these two things are very intertwined.</span> <span data-start="250.38" data-end="253.129">If you want to explore them, if you want to try being an artist</span> <span data-start="253.129" data-end="255.76">or if you are an artist.</span> <span data-start="255.76" data-end="257.829">Learning is way more fun if you're making art.</span> <span data-start="257.829" data-end="260.97">If you think about  —  if you have a dream in</span> <span data-start="260.97" data-end="264.81">the middle of the night and you want to create it, and it involves web sockets,</span> <span data-start="264.81" data-end="266.09">it's this rad artistic..</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="266.09" data-end="271.55">Project, and you think  —  I should use web sockets for this  —  unlike at work,</span> <span data-start="271.55" data-end="277.629">where it's a mandate, like  —  now we're using web sockets, and you have to</span> <span data-start="277.629" data-end="278.629">learn those.</span> <span data-start="278.629" data-end="280.61">You have to go read tech docs, you have to read some</span> <span data-start="280.61" data-end="281.61">tutorials.</span> <span data-start="281.61" data-end="284.28">Now you get to explore and try a bunch of new things.</span> <span data-start="284.28" data-end="286.479">And the outcome doesn't really matter, because it's</span> <span data-start="286.479" data-end="288.36">your project, and you're just trying things.</span> <span data-start="288.36" data-end="290.919">And even along the way, even if things are broken, just a</span> <span data-start="290.919" data-end="295.349">glitchy screen  —  you can still create beautiful things with art.</span> <span data-start="295.349" data-end="298.31">So that leads me to also  —  freedom of personal projects.</span> <span data-start="298.31" data-end="300.71">If you're making art, you're very rarely, unfortunately, going</span> <span data-start="300.71" data-end="303.469">to be making it for a paying client.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="303.469" data-end="304.99">So you get to do anything you want.</span> <span data-start="304.99" data-end="308.199">Anything you can dream, you can try and recreate.</span> <span data-start="308.199" data-end="311.119">There's any kind of analog from the fine art world or</span> <span data-start="311.119" data-end="315.99">the traditional art world in digital art, you can do 3D printing for</span> <span data-start="315.99" data-end="321.259">sculptures, watercolor light canvas work, and then there's things that you</span> <span data-start="321.259" data-end="329.78">can't do in the fine art traditional world that you can do in digital art.</span> <span data-start="329.78" data-end="334.879">There's also a lot of new problems that come up, when you're making things</span> <span data-start="334.879" data-end="335.96">creatively.</span> <span data-start="335.96" data-end="343.369">And one really rad, like, segment of that is that when you go to work  —  and</span> <span data-start="343.369" data-end="344.409">let's take a different example.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="344.409" data-end="347.349">Let's say you're working on an ecommerce platform.</span> <span data-start="347.349" data-end="350.52">If the payment goes through the payment portal, cool.</span> <span data-start="350.52" data-end="351.52">Done.</span> <span data-start="351.52" data-end="353.509">If it doesn't, that's the other answer.</span> <span data-start="353.509" data-end="354.509">It's binary.</span> <span data-start="354.509" data-end="357.539">But if you're making art, you can explore and try all kinds of different</span> <span data-start="357.539" data-end="358.539">things.</span> <span data-start="358.539" data-end="360.43">Is the line weight good?</span> <span data-start="360.43" data-end="361.659">How do the colors make me feel?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="361.659" data-end="364.02">Are there too many color particles on this stage?</span> <span data-start="364.02" data-end="368.349">It's a problem you have to solve and use a different part of your</span> <span data-start="368.349" data-end="369.349">brain.</span> <span data-start="369.349" data-end="371.879">I don't buy into the left brain, right brain idea.</span> <span data-start="371.879" data-end="376.55">That's been debunked, but you definitely get to flex creative</span> <span data-start="376.55" data-end="380.149">skills and problem solving when you're making art.</span> <span data-start="380.149" data-end="383.639">So I want to walk you through a few projects.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="383.639" data-end="386.069">This first one..</span> <span data-start="386.069" data-end="387.069">Real nervous about this.</span> <span data-start="387.069" data-end="392.279">Anyone who's seen me talk knows I go a little bit overboard on demos.</span> <span data-start="392.279" data-end="398.31">So this is the 7th thing I have plugged into my computer right now.</span> <span data-start="398.31" data-end="399.31">And it's upside down.</span> <span data-start="399.31" data-end="401.069">It's not even USB, either.</span> <span data-start="401.069" data-end="405.219">So here's what we're going to do.</span> <span data-start="405.219" data-end="408.33">Work in progress, number 233.</span> <span data-start="408.33" data-end="414.689">Deep breath, everybody.</span> <span data-start="414.689" data-end="418.929">Mostly me.</span> <span data-start="418.929" data-end="425.279">There it is.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="425.279" data-end="427.399">Okay.</span> <span data-start="427.399" data-end="431.639">All right.</span> <span data-start="431.639" data-end="436.33">If we look up yonder, look up here, as I'm going over this</span> <span data-start="436.33" data-end="439.99">color palette, right, we're getting different things on here.</span> <span data-start="439.99" data-end="441.899">And you probably can't see them very well.</span> <span data-start="441.899" data-end="442.979">But here's the thing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="442.979" data-end="445.939">I'm running around in this  —  this is a node project.</span> <span data-start="445.939" data-end="449.21">Node server, node client, it's picking up what pixels I'm sort of</span> <span data-start="449.21" data-end="450.419">going over with my mouse.</span> <span data-start="450.419" data-end="454.459">Think of this as a really weird aspect ratio screen.</span> <span data-start="454.459" data-end="458.259">But then if I go outside of the browser, it's still working.</span> <span data-start="458.259" data-end="460.77">And that's the power of node, man.</span> <span data-start="460.77" data-end="462.399">It's amazing.</span> <span data-start="462.399" data-end="469.159">You can run it on the lowest server in operations on your computer.</span> <span data-start="469.159" data-end="471.909">So the reason why I want to do this is because I actually  —  don't tell anybody</span> <span data-start="471.909" data-end="476.189">from my work  —  but I want to take this, I want to hang it up at work</span> <span data-start="476.189" data-end="481.099">over the weekend, and give everybody on my team the client software for</span> <span data-start="481.099" data-end="482.099">this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="482.099" data-end="486.119">So hopefully it'll look a little something like this.</span> <span data-start="486.119" data-end="493.229">Again, some fingers crossed.</span> <span data-start="493.229" data-end="495.009">Okay.</span> <span data-start="495.009" data-end="497.289">So this is like five..</span> <span data-start="497.289" data-end="499.62">This is a recording session of like five different mouse points.</span> <span data-start="499.62" data-end="501.669">I knew that wasn't going to work.</span> <span data-start="501.669" data-end="506.319">You son of a bee.</span> <span data-start="506.319" data-end="508.369">So imagine a lot of different..</span> <span data-start="508.369" data-end="511.029">Oh, I'm up on stage.</span> <span data-start="511.029" data-end="512.029">Whoa.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="512.029" data-end="514.729">Imagine all these flying around, and this really amazing</span> <span data-start="514.729" data-end="519.469">piece of art that's being created accidentally in the background over time that</span> <span data-start="519.469" data-end="521.2">nobody is really..</span> <span data-start="521.2" data-end="524.67">Working towards, but there's an amazing..</span> <span data-start="524.67" data-end="527.67">There's an amazing piece of art that's going on in the background, and it's community-driven.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="527.67" data-end="528.69">Okay.</span> <span data-start="528.69" data-end="536.91">Going to start unplugging some of these things.</span> <span data-start="536.91" data-end="537.91">So here's the thing.</span> <span data-start="537.91" data-end="538.91">This is a work in progress.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="917.75" data-end="920.449">I also learned about buffers and actually how to make</span> <span data-start="920.449" data-end="921.52">animated GIFs.</span> <span data-start="921.52" data-end="925.899">So this is something I learned since then.</span> <span data-start="925.899" data-end="929.309">It's part of the process of doing something fun and being</span> <span data-start="929.309" data-end="932.819">excited about it and using it going forward.</span> <span data-start="932.819" data-end="936">Chris learned how to make bots.</span> <span data-start="936" data-end="938.16">He had done a little bit of creative coding but never had done anything</span> <span data-start="938.16" data-end="941.47">that sat there and waited and responded based on input.</span> <span data-start="941.47" data-end="943.43">It was a fun thing to do.</span> <span data-start="943.43" data-end="945.069">And then we took these learnings.</span> <span data-start="945.069" data-end="947.259">We flipped it.</span> <span data-start="947.259" data-end="948.73">We turned it to a teachable moment.</span> <span data-start="948.73" data-end="952.72">So we went to a local meetup and talked about the project.</span> </p>
