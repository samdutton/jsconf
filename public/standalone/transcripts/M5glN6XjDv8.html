<p><span data-start="12.379" data-end="15.629">thank you guys I was here last year</span> <span data-start="15.629" data-end="18.599">giving my first ever talk a lightning</span> <span data-start="18.599" data-end="21.72">talks around last J Hong Kong so I'm</span> <span data-start="21.72" data-end="24.39">really glad that I can be here again</span> <span data-start="24.39" data-end="26.13">this year and give this talk to you guys</span> <span data-start="26.13" data-end="29.49">and yeah I'm late to the gym no party</span> <span data-start="29.49" data-end="34.29">I'm going concluding this party today so</span> <span data-start="34.29" data-end="37.98">let's start that's me I'm a developer</span> <span data-start="37.98" data-end="41.19">Jim do I am NOT a machine learning</span> <span data-start="41.19" data-end="43.89">expert or a data scientist data engineer</span> <span data-start="43.89" data-end="47.51">I'm neither of those I just did that</span> <span data-start="47.51" data-end="50.369">project in my free time because I wanted</span> <span data-start="50.369" data-end="52.83">to so if you have specific machine</span> <span data-start="52.83" data-end="54.18">learning questions please don't direct</span> <span data-start="54.18" data-end="57.32">them to me ask your local data engineer</span> <span data-start="57.32" data-end="61.14">you can also reach me on twitter at</span> <span data-start="61.14" data-end="65.339">jimmy 40 to get up and if anyone's still</span> <span data-start="65.339" data-end="68.07">on Google+ just check if I'm there too I</span> <span data-start="68.07" data-end="72.09">think so okay so let's start with a</span> <span data-start="72.09" data-end="74.91">funny quote this is actually a former</span> <span data-start="74.91" data-end="77.37">football player and he said I never</span> <span data-start="77.37" data-end="81.24">predict anything and I never will so</span> <span data-start="81.24" data-end="84.21">neither am i I already put the</span> <span data-start="84.21" data-end="86.87">predictions up for this match today</span> <span data-start="86.87" data-end="91.77">today tomorrow yesterday I put them on</span> <span data-start="91.77" data-end="94.53">the back side of this wall I think and I</span> <span data-start="94.53" data-end="96.72">will be updating the results as they</span> <span data-start="96.72" data-end="98.76">come in I think the game will start in</span> <span data-start="98.76" data-end="103.05">15 minutes so let's see how well my</span> <span data-start="103.05" data-end="106.92">neural network actually does things okay</span> <span data-start="106.92" data-end="109.59">so first things first we have to</span> <span data-start="109.59" data-end="111.69">understand neural networks and this will</span> <span data-start="111.69" data-end="114.9">conclude some math but I hope that most</span> <span data-start="114.9" data-end="116.76">of you will get it because it's really</span> <span data-start="116.76" data-end="117.42">not that hard</span> <span data-start="117.42" data-end="120.72">but let's look at neurons first those</span> <span data-start="120.72" data-end="123.86">are naturally occurring neurons â€” and</span> <span data-start="123.86" data-end="127.17">the sneaky fuzzy stuff to the left are</span> <span data-start="127.17" data-end="129.959">dendrites dendrites received the input</span> <span data-start="129.959" data-end="133.47">then the neuron does stuff with it sends</span> <span data-start="133.47" data-end="135.569">a signal to the next dendrite via the</span> <span data-start="135.569" data-end="137.969">axon and then the whole thing is done</span> <span data-start="137.969" data-end="140.79">again and the very interesting thing</span> <span data-start="140.79" data-end="142.06">about a neuron</span> <span data-start="142.06" data-end="144.849">is that neurons could do which to one</span> <span data-start="144.849" data-end="146.8">thing can learn to do another thing so</span> <span data-start="146.8" data-end="148.54">let's say those are neurons for seeing</span> <span data-start="148.54" data-end="151.72">and then the person gets blind for some</span> <span data-start="151.72" data-end="154.03">reason so those neurons aren't useless</span> <span data-start="154.03" data-end="156.64">now because they can learn to hear for</span> <span data-start="156.64" data-end="159.31">example and they will just get some</span> <span data-start="159.31" data-end="162.22">input do some stuff and then just send</span> <span data-start="162.22" data-end="163.959">another signal to the next neuron and it</span> <span data-start="163.959" data-end="166.17">doesn't matter really what the signal is</span> <span data-start="166.17" data-end="169.93">so the thing how it how neurons do that</span> <span data-start="169.93" data-end="172.42">is by experience so they they get a lot</span> <span data-start="172.42" data-end="174.73">of input over time and they there's a</span> <span data-start="174.73" data-end="176.83">lot of repetition and iteration and by</span> <span data-start="176.83" data-end="180.22">by that neurons learn to see the pattern</span> <span data-start="180.22" data-end="183.18">or the logic behind things</span> <span data-start="183.18" data-end="186.4">so what neurons do need is a variety of</span> <span data-start="186.4" data-end="189.4">training training examples and that's</span> <span data-start="189.4" data-end="193.239">the most important thing so let's look</span> <span data-start="193.239" data-end="195.67">at an artificial Network that is a</span> <span data-start="195.67" data-end="198.519">simple multi-layer network we have three</span> <span data-start="198.519" data-end="201.45">layers here the first is the input layer</span> <span data-start="201.45" data-end="204.7">that's where we receive our input then</span> <span data-start="204.7" data-end="207.88">we have a hidden layer I just chose to</span> <span data-start="207.88" data-end="209.35">have one hidden layer it doesn't really</span> <span data-start="209.35" data-end="211.989">matter or you can just try it out what</span> <span data-start="211.989" data-end="214.57">works for you and then we have an output</span> <span data-start="214.57" data-end="218.29">layer so in in this graph the arrows</span> <span data-start="218.29" data-end="220.93">would be our dendrites or more axons and</span> <span data-start="220.93" data-end="225.549">the circles would be our neurons okay so</span> <span data-start="225.549" data-end="229.6">let's look at it more closely so in the</span> <span data-start="229.6" data-end="231.22">first layer we get our input like I said</span> <span data-start="231.22" data-end="234.069">we call those X for the purpose of</span> <span data-start="234.069" data-end="235.87">things so we have three different inputs</span> <span data-start="235.87" data-end="241.09">two different features X 1 2 X 3 and if</span> <span data-start="241.09" data-end="242.769">we look at the first neuron or the first</span> <span data-start="242.769" data-end="246.489">layer we see that it puts out 3</span> <span data-start="246.489" data-end="250.75">different values from the neuron so this</span> <span data-start="250.75" data-end="252.85">is the math part I was talking about I</span> <span data-start="252.85" data-end="255.16">put a legend to the side so you remember</span> <span data-start="255.16" data-end="257.049">what I'm talking about so X 1 would be</span> <span data-start="257.049" data-end="260.65">our input and theta 1 1 1 is just a</span> <span data-start="260.65" data-end="262.93">weight so theta in this case is a matrix</span> <span data-start="262.93" data-end="265.18">if you don't know what a matrix is just</span> <span data-start="265.18" data-end="266.86">imagine it as being some kind of</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="266.86" data-end="269.71">JavaScript object and the 1 1 1 would be</span> <span data-start="269.71" data-end="272.169">the keys to access the value behind so I</span> <span data-start="272.169" data-end="275.02">could just say x1 times</span> <span data-start="275.02" data-end="280.569">or whatever pony unicorn and so then we</span> <span data-start="280.569" data-end="282.97">send another signal x1 times another</span> <span data-start="282.97" data-end="286.36">wait and then another and the way that</span> <span data-start="286.36" data-end="289">we choose theta here the weight is</span> <span data-start="289" data-end="291.819">actually that for our initial run for</span> <span data-start="291.819" data-end="293.44">the first iteration we just choose it</span> <span data-start="293.44" data-end="296.349">randomly just we don't know what the way</span> <span data-start="296.349" data-end="298.78">it would be and we just initiated</span> <span data-start="298.78" data-end="302.38">randomly okay so if we look at the first</span> <span data-start="302.38" data-end="304">neuron the hidden layer and the second</span> <span data-start="304" data-end="306.94">layer then we see we get three different</span> <span data-start="306.94" data-end="309.16">features multiplied with three different</span> <span data-start="309.16" data-end="313.21">weights so we get X 1 times something X</span> <span data-start="313.21" data-end="315.55">2 times something and X 3 times</span> <span data-start="315.55" data-end="317.65">something so this neuron actually gets</span> <span data-start="317.65" data-end="320.919">all the input with some weight and then</span> <span data-start="320.919" data-end="324.55">it just sums it all up so it just adds</span> <span data-start="324.55" data-end="327.789">the three input values and then it does</span> <span data-start="327.789" data-end="328.479">something</span> <span data-start="328.479" data-end="330.58">activate there's in fact of an</span> <span data-start="330.58" data-end="332.83">activation function and that is the</span> <span data-start="332.83" data-end="334.479">magic that's happening so there are</span> <span data-start="334.479" data-end="336.97">different activation functions I won't</span> <span data-start="336.97" data-end="338.44">go into them because that takes a lot of</span> <span data-start="338.44" data-end="341.77">math important to know it's just that we</span> <span data-start="341.77" data-end="344.68">sum up all the input and then do stuff</span> <span data-start="344.68" data-end="347.889">with it and then get to our new value</span> <span data-start="347.889" data-end="351.25">which would be a 1/2 but again this is</span> <span data-start="351.25" data-end="352.99">just a value in a matrix doesn't really</span> <span data-start="352.99" data-end="357.099">matter what it says so the same thing</span> <span data-start="357.099" data-end="359.32">actually also happens in our last layer</span> <span data-start="359.32" data-end="360.37">now output layer</span> <span data-start="360.37" data-end="363.31">we receive our input so we get now have</span> <span data-start="363.31" data-end="367.539">a 1 to a 2 2 and a 3 2 and then again</span> <span data-start="367.539" data-end="370.83">some Thetas again initially random</span> <span data-start="370.83" data-end="375.28">randomly initialized and then we get our</span> <span data-start="375.28" data-end="379.93">last value a 1 3 which is just the sum</span> <span data-start="379.93" data-end="381.759">of everything we have and then we</span> <span data-start="381.759" data-end="386.139">activate it with something ok so what we</span> <span data-start="386.139" data-end="388.81">have in the end is we have values we do</span> <span data-start="388.81" data-end="391.06">stuff with it get new values to do stuff</span> <span data-start="391.06" data-end="393.82">again then get a third value that is the</span> <span data-start="393.82" data-end="396.49">result of our hypothesis so our</span> <span data-start="396.49" data-end="399.19">hypothesis is kind of like the model</span> <span data-start="399.19" data-end="402.789">that we try to build to represent the</span> <span data-start="402.789" data-end="404.5">logic or the pattern we're trying to</span> <span data-start="404.5" data-end="408.2">learn and so what age theta of X</span> <span data-start="408.2" data-end="411.8">means is like you put excess in like X 1</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="411.8" data-end="416.15">X 2 X 3 would be 3 values in a vector or</span> <span data-start="416.15" data-end="419.36">an array if you want and then so the</span> <span data-start="419.36" data-end="422.48">function says this is the logic that I</span> <span data-start="422.48" data-end="425.27">think it's gonna be and then we get our</span> <span data-start="425.27" data-end="427.76">result this would be a numerical value</span> <span data-start="427.76" data-end="430.34">probably and it's ideally really close</span> <span data-start="430.34" data-end="433.28">to the reality and the reality is called</span> <span data-start="433.28" data-end="437.75">Y in this case ok so there was really a</span> <span data-start="437.75" data-end="440.2">lot so let's pause with a funny quote</span> <span data-start="440.2" data-end="443.42">this is by George EP box and he says all</span> <span data-start="443.42" data-end="445.67">models are wrong but some of them are</span> <span data-start="445.67" data-end="454.64">useful ok so let's say we did all that</span> <span data-start="454.64" data-end="456.89">stuff with our neurons and become fewer</span> <span data-start="456.89" data-end="459.38">all that those things with their magic</span> <span data-start="459.38" data-end="462.89">activation function and now we have a</span> <span data-start="462.89" data-end="465.11">result but the result is actually</span> <span data-start="465.11" data-end="467.39">probably not that good probably not that</span> <span data-start="467.39" data-end="470.39">close to reality because we initialize</span> <span data-start="470.39" data-end="472.34">data randomly so we just said just to</span> <span data-start="472.34" data-end="479.54">random stuff whether for this case which</span> <span data-start="479.54" data-end="481.4">is called supervised learning because we</span> <span data-start="481.4" data-end="486.02">have we have a output that we know is</span> <span data-start="486.02" data-end="486.53">the truth</span> <span data-start="486.53" data-end="489.59">so we supervise our machine while it</span> <span data-start="489.59" data-end="492.47">learns and supervised learning is used</span> <span data-start="492.47" data-end="495.05">for for example quota for betting places</span> <span data-start="495.05" data-end="497.36">the P win quota there is one where there</span> <span data-start="497.36" data-end="500.27">are supervised learning and also that is</span> <span data-start="500.27" data-end="504.05">a really nice example as housing price</span> <span data-start="504.05" data-end="507.83">predictions where you say this is the</span> <span data-start="507.83" data-end="509.99">square meters and this is a number of</span> <span data-start="509.99" data-end="512.21">rooms and this is the price amount of</span> <span data-start="512.21" data-end="515.06">money that I have to pay for and so you</span> <span data-start="515.06" data-end="517.55">train your neural network with stuff</span> <span data-start="517.55" data-end="520.04">that you know is the truth</span> <span data-start="520.04" data-end="523.61">there's also unsupervised learning that</span> <span data-start="523.61" data-end="525.58">is for example the Netflix</span> <span data-start="525.58" data-end="528.2">recommendation system so there is no</span> <span data-start="528.2" data-end="531.11">real answer that we the people who build</span> <span data-start="531.11" data-end="534.5">it know about we just say probably</span> <span data-start="534.5" data-end="536.03">there's some pattern here maybe you can</span> <span data-start="536.03" data-end="539.72">try to figure it out and clustering is</span> <span data-start="539.72" data-end="542.14">one of the most often used</span> <span data-start="542.14" data-end="545.51">methods to do unsupervised learning but</span> </p>

data-start="551.24" data-end="552.95">so like I said we initialize data</span> <span data-start="552.95" data-end="557">randomly and this could be an example of</span> <span data-start="557" data-end="559.07">our training data so we have four</span> <span data-start="559.07" data-end="563">training examples let's just say this is</span> <span data-start="563" data-end="566.66">housing prices so x1 would be the number</span> <span data-start="566.66" data-end="569.54">of I don't know square meters and the</span> <span data-start="569.54" data-end="571.13">other one would be the number of rooms</span> <span data-start="571.13" data-end="573.35">which is weird but doesn't matter</span> <span data-start="573.35" data-end="577.399">so XS are the inputs Y is the result</span> <span data-start="577.399" data-end="579.77">that we know it is and H of X would be</span> <span data-start="579.77" data-end="581.66">the result that our neural network just</span> <span

data-end="589.85">and the question now becomes is how do</span> <span data-start="589.85" data-end="593.089">we actually learn the correct patterns</span> <span data-start="593.089" data-end="598.36">or the correct weights for our theta so</span> <span data-start="598.36" data-end="602.18">what we can do is calculate the cost so</span> <span data-start="602.18" data-end="606.86">we have our output 60 and our y which is</span> <span data-start="606.86" data-end="610.339">43 and the cost would be the difference</span> <span data-start="610.339" data-end="613.79">between those two and this cost is also</span> <span data-start="613.79" data-end="615.68">described described by another function</span> <span data-start="615.68"

calculates the difference between</span> <span data-start="622.61" data-end="626.3">our result and the actual thing that the</span> <span data-start="626.3" data-end="630.98">reality okay so what we do now is we use</span> <span data-start="630.98" data-end="633.05">a very complicated mathematical function</span> <span data-start="633.05" data-end="636.56">and then we take our cost and then</span> <span data-start="636.56" data-end="638.029">propagate back through our network</span> <span data-start="638.029" data-end="641.18">that's called back propagation and try</span> <span data-start="641.18" data-end="644.45">to change the values for theta in a way</span> <span data-start="644.45" data-end="646.339">that minimizes the cost because we</span> <span data-start="646.339" data-end="649.1">wanted the error to be small as small as</span> <span data-start="649.1" data-end="651.17">possible so we try to minimize J of</span> <span data-start="651.17" data-end="655.76">theta and the way that we do that with</span> <span data-start="655.76" data-end="658.1">synaptic it's called gradient descent</span> <span data-start="658.1" data-end="660.92">there are other ways and other functions</span> <span data-start="660.92" data-end="663.649">to actually do that but I will only talk</span> <span data-start="663.649" data-end="666.8">about gradient descent for now so this</span> <span data-start="666.8" data-end="668.75">is very complicated so I'm trying to</span> <span data-start="668.75" data-end="669.57">make</span> <span data-start="669.57" data-end="672.24">in a very basic way so let's say this is</span> <span data-start="672.24" data-end="674.339">a graphical representation of our cost</span> <span data-start="674.339" data-end="676.829">function we have theta 1 we have theta 2</span> <span data-start="676.829" data-end="680.1">and then we have a circle which is stay</span> <span data-start="680.1" data-end="683.399">of theta so what that means is that all</span> <span data-start="683.399" data-end="685.41">the combinations of theta 1 and theta 2</span> <span data-start="685.41" data-end="688.98">that are on the circle have the same</span> <span data-start="688.98" data-end="691.829">value for theta J of theta so let's say</span> <span data-start="691.829" data-end="696.47">the the the the bottom dot there is</span> <span data-start="696.47" data-end="700.92">theta 1 2 and theta 2 1 that's not a</span> <span data-start="700.92" data-end="703.079">very good example but so there those</span> <span data-start="703.079" data-end="704.459">will have the same value for J of theta</span> <span data-start="704.459" data-end="706.86">or like the upper point where theta 1</span> <span data-start="706.86" data-end="710.72">would be 2 and theta 2 would be 4 maybe</span> <span data-start="710.72" data-end="713.579">okay and then if we calculate J of theta</span> <span data-start="713.579" data-end="716.61">4 a lot of combinations of theta 1 and</span> <span data-start="716.61" data-end="719.1">theta 2 we have something that looks</span> <span data-start="719.1" data-end="721.079">like this and the way you have to look</span> <span data-start="721.079" data-end="723.18">at it is actually that there is a third</span> <span data-start="723.18" data-end="725.94">dimension going into the back which is</span> <span data-start="725.94" data-end="728.22">there of theta so the value of J of</span> <span data-start="728.22" data-end="730.769">theta becomes smaller to the back so</span> <span data-start="730.769" data-end="734.51">imagine you're looking into a funnel now</span> <span data-start="734.51" data-end="737.88">we can see here that where the Red Dot</span> <span data-start="737.88" data-end="740.459">is that would represent the minimum so</span> <span data-start="740.459" data-end="742.019">where J of theta would be the smallest</span> <span data-start="742.019" data-end="744.769">and this is what we want to reach and</span> <span data-start="744.769" data-end="747.75">what gradient descent does is now that</span> <span data-start="747.75" data-end="750.36">let's say the gray dot I hope you can</span> <span data-start="750.36" data-end="752.61">see it yes and the way dot is where we</span> <span data-start="752.61" data-end="755.16">come out initially and we understand</span> <span data-start="755.16" data-end="758.91">basically checks for the values of theta</span> <span data-start="758.91" data-end="761.61">1 and theta 2 that will get us closer to</span> <span data-start="761.61" data-end="763.62">the minimum doesn't have to go there</span> <span data-start="763.62" data-end="765.779">directly sometimes it will wander around</span> <span data-start="765.779" data-end="769.86">a little bit but eventually it will try</span> <span data-start="769.86" data-end="772.019">to reach the global minimum it doesn't</span> <span data-start="772.019" data-end="773.699">happen all the time sometimes we just</span> <span data-start="773.699" data-end="777.389">wander around it but you you will reach</span> <span data-start="777.389" data-end="781.05">the vicinity of it and the size of the</span> <span data-start="781.05" data-end="783.12">steps actually is called the learning</span> <span data-start="783.12" data-end="785.01">rate you can change that rate you can</span> <span data-start="785.01" data-end="786.99">make the size as bigger or smaller and</span> <span data-start="786.99" data-end="789">usually the learning rate gets smaller</span> <span data-start="789" data-end="791.04">the closer you are to the minimum so</span> <span data-start="791.04" data-end="792.689">what you can't really see here is that</span> <span data-start="792.689" data-end="795.899">the steps will get smaller the more you</span> <span data-start="795.899" data-end="801.3">approach the red dot okay</span> <span data-start="801.31" data-end="804.62">that was a lot of theory so let's</span> <span data-start="804.62" data-end="806.03">implement something and you will see</span> <span data-start="806.03" data-end="809.45">it's really not that hard so I use</span> <span data-start="809.45" data-end="811.97">synaptic because synaptic does all that</span> <span data-start="811.97" data-end="813.86">stuff that I showed you already and I</span> <span data-start="813.86" data-end="815.21">don't really have to care about it it's</span> <span data-start="815.21" data-end="818.99">a framework to do exactly â€” then do</span> <span data-start="818.99" data-end="821.69">stuff with the neural network and it</span> <span data-start="821.69" data-end="823.4">gives us everything we need to build a</span> <span data-start="823.4" data-end="825.77">simple

data-start="1274.73" data-end="1277.58">tell you later why and also you can see</span> <span data-start="1277.58" data-end="1279.35">that it doesn't continuously go down it</span> <span data-start="1279.35" data-end="1283.22">just seems to hover around 44% but i</span> <span data-start="1283.22" data-end="1287.06">still thought this really wasn't telling</span> <span data-start="1287.06" data-end="1288.92">me how well my algorithm algorithm</span> <span data-start="1288.92" data-end="1291.41">performs because i make those</span> <span data-start="1291.41" data-end="1292.97">predictions with the training set so i</span> <span data-start="1292.97" data-end="1296.09">already know about the data that i get</span> <span data-start="1296.09" data-end="1297.62">in and then i make a prediction from it</span> <span data-start="1297.62" data-end="1299.69">doesn't tell me anything about how well</span> <span data-start="1299.69" data-end="1301.94">my algorithm performs for future</span> <span data-start="1301.94" data-end="1305.24">predictions so then i came up with a</span> <span data-start="1305.24" data-end="1307.31">thing called the cross-validation error</span> <span data-start="1307.31" data-end="1311.15">and what i do there is actually first</span> <span data-start="1311.15" data-end="1314.99">split the data set into a training set</span> <span data-start="1314.99" data-end="1318.11">and then a cross validation set and the</span> <span data-start="1318.11" data-end="1320.21">reason i do that is because i want the</span> <span data-start="1320.21" data-end="1322.52">training data to only train my neural</span> <span data-start="1322.52" data-end="1324.59">network and then I take the cross</span> <span data-start="1324.59" data-end="1327.32">rotation data I act like it would be the</span> <span data-start="1327.32" data-end="1329.72">future and then check how well</span> <span data-start="1329.72" data-end="1333.2">algorithm performs so I'm doing the</span> <span data-start="1333.2" data-end="1335.69">exact same thing as I did before just I</span> <span data-start="1335.69" data-end="1337.07">make the predictions on the</span> <span data-start="1337.07" data-end="1338.69">cross-validation set and not on the</span> <span data-start="1338.69" data-end="1343.4">training set okay so this is the output</span> <span data-start="1343.4" data-end="1347.93">and you can see that it seemed to</span> <span data-start="1347.93" data-end="1350.45">perform even worse a little bit but also</span> <span data-start="1350.45" data-end="1351.89">this is something that I already</span> <span data-start="1351.89" data-end="1356">suspected would happen and what's weird</span> <span data-start="1356" data-end="1358.34">is that it seems like the error rate</span> <span data-start="1358.34" data-end="1360.14">goes up for at first and then goes down</span> <span data-start="1360.14" data-end="1362.9">and then up again just like the arrow we</span> <span data-start="1362.9" data-end="1369.55">saw before so the question now becomes</span> <span data-start="1369.55" data-end="1372.35">why what what does this mean what what</span> <span data-start="1372.35" data-end="1373.61">do these arrow rates</span> <span data-start="1373.61" data-end="1377.78">tell me actually so the thing is if we</span> <span data-start="1377.78" data-end="1380.3">have one example where our result would</span> <span data-start="1380.3" data-end="1382.67">be this probability distribution and</span> <span data-start="1382.67" data-end="1384.98">then we have the actual result which</span> <span data-start="1384.98" data-end="1388.78">would be this 0 0 1 so they're waiting 1</span> <span data-start="1388.78" data-end="1392.27">what the data error gives us is called</span> <span data-start="1392.27" data-end="1396.17">the mean squared error and the squared</span> <span data-start="1396.17" data-end="1400.91">error is this so what this means is the</span> <span data-start="1400.91" data-end="1402.59">probability distribution would be a</span> <span data-start="1402.59" data-end="1404.66">vector and we measure the we get the</span> <span data-start="1404.66" data-end="1408.56">length of the vector and then to the</span> <span data-start="1408.56" data-end="1412.01">power of 2 which would come up to 0.98</span> <span data-start="1412.01" data-end="1415.94">about 0.9 and then the mean means we</span> <span data-start="1415.94" data-end="1418.1">take all training examples not just the</span> <span data-start="1418.1" data-end="1420.02">one and then calculate the average</span> <span data-start="1420.02" data-end="1423.23">squared error so probably the average</span> <span data-start="1423.23" data-end="1426.95">would be somewhere close to 0.98</span> <span data-start="1426.95" data-end="1430.31">let's say it's that now for a</span> <span data-start="1430.31" data-end="1434.29">classification error we only have one</span> <span data-start="1434.29" data-end="1439.58">because you can either be a hundred</span> <span data-start="1439.58" data-end="1441.65">percent wrong or a hundred percent right</span> <span data-start="1441.65" data-end="1443">there's no in between there's no</span> <span data-start="1443" data-end="1445.1">probabilities so in this case our error</span> <span data-start="1445.1" data-end="1447.41">would be just one and also for a</span> <span data-start="1447.41" data-end="1449.54">cross-validation error it would be one</span> <span data-start="1449.54" data-end="1453.32">but still it's it's logical that our</span> <span data-start="1453.32" data-end="1455.99">would perform worse with data it doesn't</span> <span data-start="1455.99" data-end="1457.72">know about it's just not in the</span> <span data-start="1457.72" data-end="1464.21">experienced realm of the algorithm okay</span> <span data-start="1464.21" data-end="1467.54">so what does it actually mean when my</span> <span data-start="1467.54" data-end="1469.79">cross-validation error is bigger or</span> <span data-start="1469.79" data-end="1472.61">greater than my classification error so</span> <span data-start="1472.61" data-end="1475.46">that could mean that we have over fitted</span> <span data-start="1475.46" data-end="1478.79">or model or have high variance and I'm</span> <span data-start="1478.79" data-end="1482.78">trying to explain that let's say this is</span> <span data-start="1482.78" data-end="1486.29">our training data so this one is X 1 and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1486.29" data-end="1489.53">X 2 we have two features and this is our</span> <span data-start="1489.53" data-end="1492.53">training data and now our model is the</span> <span data-start="1492.53" data-end="1495.68">line there so the model describes the</span> <span data-start="1495.68" data-end="1498.86">training data pretty good but maybe it's</span> <span data-start="1498.86" data-end="1500.78">not that good for future predictions</span> <span data-start="1500.78" data-end="1503.44">because it's really it just follows this</span> <span data-start="1503.44" data-end="1506.51">exact model and it doesn't really</span> <span data-start="1506.51" data-end="1510.95">generalize very well and that is called</span> <span data-start="1510.95" data-end="1513.2">overhead over fit or high variance and</span> <span data-start="1513.2" data-end="1516.38">the other thing the other extreme would</span> <span data-start="1516.38" data-end="1518.77">be if you have the same training set and</span> <span data-start="1518.77" data-end="1521.99">this would be a model it's a straight</span> <span data-start="1521.99" data-end="1524.81">line it's it doesn't fit so well on the</span> <span data-start="1524.81" data-end="1527.24">existing training data but it might</span> <span data-start="1527.24" data-end="1529.52">perform better with future predictions</span> <span data-start="1529.52" data-end="1532.43">than the one on the left and that is</span> <span data-start="1532.43" data-end="1537.62">called under fit or high bias so what we</span> <span data-start="1537.62" data-end="1541.58">maybe can do is try to get more data or</span> <span data-start="1541.58" data-end="1544.04">more features so either get more</span> <span data-start="1544.04" data-end="1547.13">historical data go to the last year the</span> <span data-start="1547.13" data-end="1549.11">year before that also get the data from</span> </p>

as small or big as</span> <span data-start="1589.24" data-end="1591.58">possible it depends really on what you</span> <span data-start="1591.58" data-end="1593.65">value you choose for your regularization</span> <span data-start="1593.65" data-end="1598.27">parameter if you think about the model I</span> <span data-start="1598.27" data-end="1599.53">showed you before</span> <span

data-end="1611.07">overfitting or underfitting</span> <span data-start="1611.07" data-end="1614.679">and also the hovering that we saw before</span> <span data-start="1614.679" data-end="1616.24">that the error rate seemed to hover</span> <span data-start="1616.24" data-end="1618.91">around a number but never seem to get</span> <span data-start="1618.91" data-end="1621.4">anywhere could could mean

<span data-start="1625.99" data-end="1627.82">just we're not that we didn't describe</span> <span data-start="1627.82" data-end="1631.72">our feature pretty good pretty well so</span> <span data-start="1631.72" data-end="1639.25">hmm sorry what I actually did is I chose</span> <span data-start="1639.25" data-end="1642.34">to go with more features and I want to</span> <span

data-start="1670.9" data-end="1673.36">the variation in numbers is just too</span> <span data-start="1673.36" data-end="1675.429">little to really read anything into it</span> <span

data-start="1680.559" data-end="1682.96">money in getting more features might not</span> <span data-start="1682.96" data-end="1684.49">be that beneficial because it just</span> <span
