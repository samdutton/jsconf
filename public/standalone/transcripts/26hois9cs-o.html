<p><span data-start="9.38" data-end="46.24"Audience member: Hello, everyone. My name is Michael. I'm a 13-year-old boy and I enjoy all things Pokémon,</span> <span data-start="46.24" data-end="51.55">Lego, Star Wars, and now play video games and VR all day if you'll let me!</span> <span data-start="51.55" data-end="57.81"Audience member: My name's Jason, his dad, CEO of a company called Codeup in the States, and we teach</span> <span data-start="57.81" data-end="68.24">adults how to code. I know a little bit about Pokémon, and video games are all right. Before</span> <span data-start="68.24" data-end="73.229">teaching kids to code and giving you tools to go back home? And teach kids to code. , let's</span> <span data-start="73.229" data-end="79.52">talk about why teach kids to code? I think most people in the audience have some opinions</span> <span data-start="79.52" data-end="84.039">about that, but I wanted to find out from a kid. Michael, why do you think kids should</span> <span data-start="84.039" data-end="87.399">code? >> Kids need a better understanding of technology.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="87.399" data-end="97.229">Most kids think technology is Google, YouTube, and Fornite. There's a not close to the possibilities.</span> <span data-start="97.229" data-end="103.39">Coding makes you creative and makes you want to do amazing stuff, integrate and teach children</span> <span data-start="103.39" data-end="109.17">logic, like if something happens, do something else. You also learn how things work. You</span> <span data-start="109.17" data-end="115.149">can learn how to send an mail, or learn how a computer works. It's cool to build Lego</span> <span data-start="115.149" data-end="124.6">and play games. It's cool and awesome to programme things. It's also really fun. I do on a daily</span> <span data-start="124.6" data-end="127.819">basis. >> Awesome. So before we get into the right</span> <span data-start="127.819" data-end="131.51">way to teach kids how to code, we figured we would go over a few of the things we think</span> <span data-start="131.51" data-end="136.26">are the wrong way to do it, and last summer, Michael was super excited to go to a camp</span> <span data-start="136.26" data-end="141.43">where they were going to teach Minecraft mods learning Java and we learned a few things</span> <span data-start="141.43" data-end="146.31">that are the things to avoid when trying to teach a code.</span> <span data-start="146.31" data-end="151.99"Audience member: First thing to start with is a hard language, Java or C. During that camp, I used Java,</span> <span data-start="151.99" data-end="160.17">and it was not fun. I don't know how it works to date. All I know is like C — I don't know.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="160.17" data-end="172.71">Make them learn to type. I still use my four fingers, and using complicated tools like</span> <span data-start="172.71" data-end="177.33">Eclipse. I have no idea how to go back to my previous projects. I have no idea how that</span> <span data-start="177.33" data-end="180.02">even works. Vocabulary, like conkat .. >> Concatenation?</span> <span data-start="180.02" data-end="189.62"Audience member: I don't even know what that means. And they need you to learn maths first — a terrible</span> <span data-start="189.62" data-end="195.09">way to start. >> If you want to teach a kid a musical instrument,</span> <span data-start="195.09" data-end="200.62">you would probably teach him a strong before you made them learn music theory or read music.</span> <span data-start="200.62" data-end="205.48">I found as parent once Michael was out creating video games, all of the things in the slide</span> <span data-start="205.48" data-end="210.88">he became more interested in. If this is where we start, then it's really heart to get them</span> <span data-start="210.88" data-end="216.67">excited about writing code. That being side, we want to know what kids want to do?</span> <span data-start="216.67" data-end="220.1"Audience member: This picture definitely shows what I want to do all day, every day.</span> <span data-start="220.1" data-end="224"Audience member: All day long if I let him. Michael, what do you think the kids want to do when they</span> <span data-start="224" data-end="229.961">are learning to codes? >> They want to see results. They don't want</span> <span data-start="229.961" data-end="234.24">to wait ten seconds — >> You're telling me kids aren't patient?</span> <span data-start="234.24" data-end="239.77"Audience member: I've been waiting for you to say that. And they like to create things that are fun,</span> <span data-start="239.77" data-end="246.84">like game or Lego. They like to create things that they are interested in. And sharing that</span> <span data-start="246.84" data-end="252.45">creation, again back to logo, they love to show it after they build the set, even I do,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="252.45" data-end="257.291">I like to show it to my parents showing what I'm capable of. To make new graphics, like</span> <span data-start="257.291" data-end="263.039">doing artwork, or fan art, or anything like that, they love to do that, and building things</span> <span data-start="263.039" data-end="268.54">that they love once again, Legos. They love them, but last but not least, they like to</span> <span data-start="268.54" data-end="273.59">play with the results. Guess what? Lego. They love to play with Lego before they put it</span> <span data-start="273.59" data-end="280.22">on the shelf before letting it dust and rot. >> Awesome. So, we've talked a little bit</span> <span data-start="280.22" data-end="284.33">about the wrong way and why kids want to do it, and what kids are into, so we would like</span> <span data-start="284.33" data-end="290.97">to present what we think is a great solution for teaching kids to code, and, in this solution</span> <span data-start="290.97" data-end="294.35">that we want to show you, do you have to learn how to type?</span> <span data-start="294.35" data-end="297.949"Audience member: No, it is drag and drop. >> Took weeks?</span> <span data-start="297.949" data-end="303.06"Audience member: No, it was easy learn, and I learned how make a game in the first day.</span> <span data-start="303.06" data-end="307.07"Audience member: You're only a few of you online doing that? >> There is a ginormous humungous community</span> <span data-start="307.07" data-end="310.87">of users. >> Why don't you write us a piece of software</span> <span data-start="310.87" data-end="314.38">that you think you're being punished? >> Almost fun to use, almost close to video</span> <span data-start="314.38" data-end="317.389">games. >> Was anybody able to help you?</span> <span data-start="317.389" data-end="321.43"Audience member: Yes, it's pretty easy to learn, but if you do need help, anyone can help.</span> <span data-start="321.43" data-end="324.46"Audience member: What about downloading games? Did you have to create special stuff?</span> <span data-start="324.46" data-end="328.19"Audience member: No, I created one in the first hour without downloading.</span> <span data-start="328.19" data-end="332.33"Audience member: What if you want graphics in there? >> Graphic designs are included.</span> <span data-start="332.33" data-end="337.77"Audience member: Awesome. We would like to show you the solution that's worked for us, and that scratch</span> <span data-start="337.77" data-end="341.921">by MIT, it's super cool! Miming, tell us what is Scratch?</span> <span data-start="341.921" data-end="349.66"Audience member: It's a programming language developed by MIT in 2003, it's for ages eight and up. I</span> <span data-start="349.66" data-end="354.81">started around seven or eight. Right now, it has over 22 million users, and roughly</span> <span data-start="354.81" data-end="359.34">around 25,000 new members join every day. >> Wow.</span> <span data-start="359.34" data-end="364.56"Audience member: And guess what? It's in German, it's in Spanish, it's in Japanese. There are over</span> <span data-start="364.56" data-end="370.34">70 languages it uses. And it only requires internet access, and, because of the recent</span> <span data-start="370.34" data-end="378.28">3.0 update, no Flash! [Applause]. >> Thank you, JavaScript community for saving</span> <span data-start="378.28" data-end="386.26">us. Awesome. To get Scratch, it's super simple. You point your browser to scratch.mit.edu,</span> <span data-start="386.26" data-end="396.11">and you're created with an IDE that looks like this. In the top-right corner is the</span> <span data-start="396.11" data-end="399.639">stage. >> That's where everything is going to happen</span> <span data-start="399.639" data-end="406.02">where Sprites are going to be moving and changing president they are the objects on the stage</span> <span data-start="406.02" data-end="411.86">that, as I said, they're going to change, move, do something. Those are the backdrops.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="411.86" data-end="417.07">Those are the stages of the stage — play on words there — and it changes, it can write</span> <span data-start="417.07" data-end="422.36">the code, all that. In the middle, there's the coding area. That's where you're going</span> <span data-start="422.36" data-end="428.24">to be putting your code to make either the Sprites stage change. Next to that are the</span> <span data-start="428.24" data-end="432.52">blocks. Those are the chunks of code that we are going to be sticking together and making</span> <span data-start="432.52" data-end="439.37">your thing work. Above that are the tabs. Pretty simple code. I just told you what that</span> <span data-start="439.37" data-end="454.12">was. Costumes is where either Sprites or backdrops can change, and sounds describes itself.</span> <span data-start="454.12" data-end="461.331"Audience member: So what we would like to do is a typical Hello, World using Scratch. Michael will come</span> <span data-start="461.331" data-end="468.479">over and do live coding for you today in Berlin. Scratch Cat is the Sprite that is default.</span> <span data-start="468.479" data-end="479.24">How about you show us a hello world script. >> First, we go to events and grab the winflag.</span> <span data-start="479.24" data-end="486.759">You need this for every piece of code we do. Then we go to looks. Grab a hell. Make that</span> <span data-start="486.759" data-end="498.699">a simple hello, world. Still using my pointy fingers. Going over to motion with ten steps.</span> <span data-start="498.699" data-end="507.99"Audience member: Let's blow it up and hit play. That kid that you're trying to kitchen to code can</span> <span data-start="507.99" data-end="513.209">have the hello world script not learning how to type or having all of those things that</span> <span data-start="513.209" data-end="517.349">kind of get in the way, so the next what we would like to do is create a game for you</span> <span data-start="517.349" data-end="522.46">live, right here, and Michael already went to the background and used the graphic tools,</span> <span data-start="522.46" data-end="527.52">created all of us own graphics and what we see there is Jeff staying at an airport holding</span> <span data-start="527.52" data-end="534.64">a beer. Tell us the premise of the gale, Michael? >> So Jeff is German dude, and I'm not going</span> <span data-start="534.64" data-end="540.17">to do anything weird. He is there, and he's going to be throwing wiener schnitzel off</span> <span data-start="540.17" data-end="548.12">bearded dads coming off 48 aeroplanes with only three hours of sleep, and he's going</span> <span data-start="548.12" data-end="557.5">to be super angry. He has to throw beers and schnitzel to make him happy. Angry bearded</span> <span data-start="557.5" data-end="560.83">glasses dads. >> Where did you get this idea?</span> <span data-start="560.83" data-end="566.67"Audience member: With Grey Beard. >> We want Jeff our main character moving</span> <span data-start="566.67" data-end="572.35">around. Show us how we can make Jeff move left when you hit the left arrow button?</span> <span data-start="572.35" data-end="578.649"Audience member: First, of course, we have to go events and grab the click block. Again, you're always</span> <span data-start="578.649" data-end="584.98">going to need this. Go to control and grab a forever and an if. It's forever going to</span> <span data-start="584.98" data-end="591.07">be asking the question: if something happens, then do whatever is in the loop. The thing</span> <span data-start="591.07" data-end="596.399">we are going to be asking is going to be keyspace press, but it's not going to be left, it's</span> <span data-start="596.399" data-end="605.24">going to be left arrow. Go to motion. We are going to point in the direction left, which</span> <span data-start="605.24" data-end="611.8">is negative 90. And then move ten steps. >> All right, so we hit the flag. We hit the</span> <span data-start="611.8" data-end="620.87">left arrow button. >> Wait, wait. There's something wrong.</span> <span data-start="620.87" data-end="625.07"Audience member: Do we have internet? >> Do we have internet?</span> <span data-start="625.07" data-end="639.07"Audience member: Okay. What's going on here? >> I'm on the wrong Sprite.</span> <span data-start="639.07" data-end="646.089"Audience member: Live coding is always fun! Every Sprite is its own object. We headed in the wrong</span> <span data-start="646.089" data-end="651.511">piece of code. Now Jeff moves left! All right, good job! Thank you.</span> <span data-start="651.511" data-end="654.7"Audience member: Thank you very much. >> So now we've got Jeff moving left but I</span> <span data-start="654.7" data-end="658.279">think he needs to move right as well. How do we go in there and make him move right?</span> <span data-start="658.279" data-end="664.29"Audience member: Easy. You right-click and duplicate, something amazing about Scratch. You go right arrow</span> <span data-start="664.29" data-end="668.17">and make that right. >> Perfect.</span> <span data-start="668.17" data-end="672.39"Audience member: Zoom. >> And so we've got moonwalking Jeff.</span> <span data-start="672.39" data-end="677.78"Audience member: Yes, Michael Jefferson! >> Let's make him move in the other direction,</span> <span data-start="677.78" data-end="679.54">pointing in the direction he's supposed to be moving.</span> <span data-start="679.54" data-end="684.33"Audience member: Before that, I would like to show you the costumes. I have a right and a left costume.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="684.33" data-end="692.74">These will be important to make it move. We go back to code. You go to "looks". We go</span> <span data-start="692.74" data-end="699.339">down here and switch costume to right. Put that there as well, with this left. It's in</span> <span data-start="699.339" data-end="701.47">place. >> So that when he moves left and right, he</span> <span data-start="701.47" data-end="706.24">will be facing that direction. Jeff can't move up and down. How hard would it be to</span> <span data-start="706.24" data-end="711.31">add that? >> Not very. Just expand, and right-click.</span> <span data-start="711.31" data-end="716.5">Boom! There we go. >> Duplicate two more if statements, so four</span> <span data-start="716.5" data-end="721.31">nested if statements in there checking to see if it's going up, down, left, or right.</span> <span data-start="721.31" data-end="724.93">Michael's going to get all of those set up. We will remove the Switch costume for the</span> <span data-start="724.93" data-end="736.12">up and down. Accept the directions to down and up. And when we click Play, we should</span> <span data-start="736.12" data-end="741.61">have a fully moving Jeff. He moves everywhere, even diagonal. Check that out. In a few minutes,</span> <span data-start="741.61" data-end="746.45">you're able to get the basics of a 2D game going but right now, it's just Jeff running</span> <span data-start="746.45" data-end="751.43">around on a stage. Let's bring in one of the aeroplanes and see if we can't get some of</span> <span data-start="751.43" data-end="756.06">the angry dads to come off. >> "Aeroplane Michael coming in for landing".</span> <span data-start="756.06" data-end="763.27"Audience member: All right. Now we have another Sprite, this is the aeroplane Sprite, its own object.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="763.27" data-end="767.99">Michael will start having angry dads coming off the plane and chase down Jeff trying to</span> <span data-start="767.99" data-end="772.6">get that beer and schnitzel. >> Of course, go over to events, when the</span> <span data-start="772.6" data-end="784.23">flag is clicked. Go to control, do "forever". Wait one second. And so it's going to wait</span> <span data-start="784.23" data-end="786.91">one second and then create a clone of myself. >> That's quick.</span> <span data-start="786.91" data-end="790.699"Audience member: It's a bit too short. >> Let's make that a little more random.</span> <span data-start="790.699" data-end="798.87"Audience member: Let's go to operators, pick random one to ten. Expand. Make it 2, 2, 6.</span> <span data-start="798.87" data-end="804.23"Audience member: Every to two six seconds, this Sprite will create a clone of itself and Michael will</span> <span data-start="804.23" data-end="808.97">show you what we can do with that clone. >> When I start the clone, and you're also</span> <span data-start="808.97" data-end="819.89">going to grab a "repeat until", go to motion, you're going to point towards a Jeff. And</span> <span data-start="819.89" data-end="825.79">move ten steps. There you about. >> So let's see what happens here. And we</span> <span data-start="825.79" data-end="830.61">wait two to six seconds randomly, and angry dad!</span> <span data-start="830.61" data-end="834.03"Audience member: Dad! >> That's another aeroplane! All right. So</span> <span data-start="834.03" data-end="838.23">how can we fix that? Instead of aeroplanes coming out of aeroplanes, we have angry dads.</span> <span data-start="838.23" data-end="843.17"Audience member: First, I like the costumes. There is plain and there is Jason.</span> <span data-start="843.17" data-end="850.33"Audience member: He looks a little familiar. So let's find a way to get him off the plane.</span> <span data-start="850.33" data-end="856.47"Audience member: So go back to code. Go to looks. The plane is not going to be plane.</span> <span data-start="856.47" data-end="863.399"Audience member: Every time a clone is created, it should of angry dad. Jeff's going to run around.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="863.399" data-end="867.63">Here they come. Angry dads coming off the aeroplane, chasing down Jeff. I have never</span> <span data-start="867.63" data-end="871.53">run that fast in my life? You can't convince me that was based on me.</span> <span data-start="871.53" data-end="876.93"Audience member: Let's make it six, then. >> We will make him run a little slower. When</span> <span data-start="876.93" data-end="882.8">they are catching Jeff, should they not disappear? >> If you want.</span> <span data-start="882.8" data-end="887.79"Audience member: Let's show how we could do that? >> Okay, fine. Go over to sensing and do touching</span> <span data-start="887.79" data-end="895.41">mouse pointer, change that to touching Jeff. >> How we have a until loop like a "do while".</span> <span data-start="895.41" data-end="901.529">Go to .. >> Go to control again. Delete this clone.</span> <span data-start="901.529" data-end="905.56"Audience member: So once that loop completes, the clone will be deleted.</span> <span data-start="905.56" data-end="912.5"Audience member: Yes. So now let's go back in. >> All right, so Jeff's out running around</span> <span data-start="912.5" data-end="917.85">the airport. Every two to six seconds, there comes angry dads off the plane. When they</span> <span data-start="917.85" data-end="922.68">click Jeff, they go away. Wouldn't it be great if we could get them beer and schnitzel before</span> <span data-start="922.68" data-end="926.39">they caught Jeff? >> Indeed. Let's go to food and drink. We</span> <span data-start="926.39" data-end="931.42">have a beer. We have a schnitzel. I like the beer better than the schnitzel!</span> <span data-start="931.42" data-end="936.04"Audience member: When we click on this third Sprite now, we see there's no code there for that object.</span> <span data-start="936.04" data-end="940.36">We say whenever the game starts. >> When the flag is clicked, whenever the</span> <span data-start="940.36" data-end="951.35">game starts, we are going to go to control. Forever. If also grab while we are here. Then</span> <span data-start="951.35" data-end="959.399">we go to our sensing. We keep it there. Go back to control, grab it here.</span> <span data-start="959.399" data-end="963.49"Audience member: We are creating a clone every time the space bar key is pressed.</span> <span data-start="963.49" data-end="970.55"Audience member: Then we go to random position and we go to Jeff, and then — grabbing so much stuff</span> <span data-start="970.55" data-end="977.67">while I was here. "Repeat until", and then we are going to have the motion, move ten</span> <span data-start="977.67" data-end="982.75">steps. There you go. >> So now every time he hit the space bar,</span> <span data-start="982.75" data-end="987.69">a clone should be made of the food object and it should start moving ten steps from</span> <span data-start="987.69" data-end="995.28">where it originates. >> Like CSS you have show and hide for your</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="995.28" data-end="1004.279">Sprites. Now we need to show. Perfect. Awesome. Wait! But that's like an endless supply of</span> <span data-start="1004.279" data-end="1008.55">schnitzel, and they're sticking to the end. Let's make it where you have to let go of</span> <span data-start="1008.55" data-end="1012.639">the space bar in between? >> I want you -</span> <span data-start="1012.639" data-end="1021.95"Audience member: Let's clean that up a little bit. >> There come the angry Jasons. Shall we fix</span> <span data-start="1021.95" data-end="1026.179">first machine-gun? >> Let's make it where you don't have machine-gun</span> <span data-start="1026.179" data-end="1032.089">schnitzel. >> Okay. So we go over to Control, wait until,</span> <span data-start="1032.089" data-end="1042.11">putting on the operators. Grab a "not duplicate this" so now it's going to repeat saying if</span> <span data-start="1042.11" data-end="1047.949">the key space is pressed, make clone but you can't repeat until the key space pressed is</span> <span data-start="1047.949" data-end="1051.35">not being pressed. >> You've got to let go of the space bar every</span> <span data-start="1051.35" data-end="1057.07">time. Let's see how that is working? >> I'm holding it.</span> <span data-start="1057.07" data-end="1062.18"Audience member: Perfect. But they are sticking to the edge of the screen there. We should probably make</span> <span data-start="1062.18" data-end="1065.98">them disappear when they get to the edge of the stage.</span> <span data-start="1065.98" data-end="1072.73"Audience member: So we are making it, we are touching the edge. We are going to make it where it deletes</span> <span data-start="1072.73" data-end="1075.32">the clone. >> So, when it falls out of the repeat loop,</span> <span data-start="1075.32" data-end="1080.48">the while loop, they won't stick to the sides. That's perfect, but what I what I noticed</span> <span data-start="1080.48" data-end="1087.11">is when the angry dads come off the aeroplane, they keep coming, so we should make that angry</span> <span data-start="1087.11" data-end="1089.85">dad disappear as soon as he gets that beer and schnitzel.</span> <span data-start="1089.85" data-end="1099.22"Audience member: Let's go back to plane one. We're going to operators. Grab an or. Duplicate Jeff.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1099.22" data-end="1102.71">And boop. >> So it's going to repeat until it's either</span> <span data-start="1102.71" data-end="1107.15">touching the food and drink Sprite or the Jeff Sprite, and then they should disappear,</span> <span data-start="1107.15" data-end="1111.5">and we should have angry dads coming off, getting ready to get that German beer and</span> <span data-start="1111.5" data-end="1116.239">schnitzel, and there it is. Able to feed them and make them happy. [Applause].</span> <span data-start="1116.239" data-end="1120.42"Audience member: But, it's only schnitzel coming out. >> Yes, the game's a little easy right now.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1120.42" data-end="1126.47">You can stand in front of the plane and spam angry dads. What if we had a expected plane?</span> <span data-start="1126.47" data-end="1132.029"Audience member: Easy. So you cannot just copy code, you can also duplicate Sprites.</span> <span data-start="1132.029" data-end="1137.95"Audience member: If you notice, when he duplicated the Sprite, all the code duplicated as well. When you</span> <span data-start="1137.95" data-end="1142.659">hit play, we have a video game that is twice as hard and fast.</span> <span data-start="1142.659" data-end="1152.27"Audience member: I forgot something: aeroplane Michael coming into landing.</span> <span data-start="1152.27" data-end="1160.14"Audience member: It's only shooting schnitzels to the left. >> We need a variable. If you don't know what</span> <span data-start="1160.14" data-end="1171.1">they are, you're at the wrong talk! >> It's going to be our direction variables.</span> <span data-start="1171.1" data-end="1178.66">It's variables in Scratch or global. Any Variable you create can be accessed from another Sprite.</span> <span data-start="1178.66" data-end="1183.149">Michael's going to set those variables to whatever Jeff is pointing left or right.</span> <span data-start="1183.149" data-end="1187.3"Audience member: It's either negative 90 or 90. Right or left.</span> <span data-start="1187.3" data-end="1191.95"Audience member: You can see for debugging that the variable is visible on the stage but you can uncheck</span> <span data-start="1191.95" data-end="1195.34">it if you don't want it to be there. >> Real quick drag a dir.</span> <span data-start="1195.34" data-end="1203.6"Audience member: So we are back on the food and drink Sprite. >> So point direction dir.</span> <span data-start="1203.6" data-end="1207.9"Audience member: Choosing that variable, whichever way Jeff is pointed, that's the way the schnitzels</span> <span data-start="1207.9" data-end="1215.85">are coming. I thought we said beer and schnitzels? >> I can fix that. There you go. Now we go</span> <span data-start="1215.85" data-end="1222.63">on to looks. And do switch costume to beer, and to the beer, we are going to go to the</span> <span data-start="1222.63" data-end="1227.09">operators, and switch it to pick random one to two. If you look in the costumes, it's</span> <span data-start="1227.09" data-end="1237.46">numbered one and two, so if I do this, — >> So now randomly shooting beer and schnitzels.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1237.46" data-end="1241.47">They want to get that beer from Jeff but he's able to deliver one for them before they get</span> <span data-start="1241.47" data-end="1248.44">to him. We have the basics of a 2D video game in about 15 minutes, written by a 13-year-old.</span> <span data-start="1248.44" data-end="1253.84">This is something you can all go home and do! [Cheering and applause]. Thank you. If</span> <span data-start="1253.84" data-end="1260.6">you give him 30 or 45 minutes, he can build out a fleshed-out video game. I want now to</span> <span data-start="1260.6" data-end="1267.86">show you the final version of angry dad and Jeff. On the bottom right-hand corner, it</span> <span data-start="1267.86" data-end="1274.22">will be the beer mug, the life of Jeff. Let's watch him play around. So it's the same game</span> <span data-start="1274.22" data-end="1278.99">that you saw, except this time when angry dads come off and they drink Jeff's beer from</span> <span data-start="1278.99" data-end="1283.169">him, he starts running out, and so we can see that when they do catch him, his life</span> <span data-start="1283.169" data-end="1287.94">meter goes down — >> But there is a keg which refills your beer</span> <span data-start="1287.94" data-end="1292.539">meter. >> As long as he is shooting beers at other</span> <span data-start="1292.539" data-end="1300.69">people, they stay unhappy. They drink all of his beer! Game over!</span> <span data-start="1300.69" data-end="1312.76"Audience member: It didn't go to End Screen. That's what we were looking for. Thank you.</span> <span data-start="1312.76" data-end="1322.11"Audience member: We would love you to get in touch with us. You can contact me on Twitter.</span> <span data-start="1322.11" data-end="1328.34"Audience member: Thank you all for coming to our talk! >> Good job.</span> </p>
