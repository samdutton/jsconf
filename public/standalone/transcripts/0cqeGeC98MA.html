<p><span data-start="54.899" data-end="57.12">Mike talked about that this button can</span> <span data-start="57.12" data-end="59.16">be in so we have to consider what</span> <span data-start="59.16" data-end="61.289">happens if you hover the button what</span> <span data-start="61.289" data-end="64.14">happens if the button is active and what</span> <span data-start="64.14" data-end="65.85">happens that the button is disabled so</span> <span data-start="65.85" data-end="68.34">you might be thinking we're done here</span> <span data-start="68.34" data-end="70.47">but we have to also think about the</span> <span data-start="70.47" data-end="72.84">application states that this button can</span> <span data-start="72.84" data-end="75.09">be into for example if we're fetching</span> <span data-start="75.09" data-end="77.52">data we might want to fade it out if</span> <span data-start="77.52" data-end="80.79">it's a success we might want to have it</span> <span data-start="80.79" data-end="83.009">be green and say hey we've got your data</span> <span data-start="83.009" data-end="85.83">or if it's an error you might want it to</span> <span data-start="85.83" data-end="90.689">be a different variants such as red but</span> <span data-start="90.689" data-end="92.97">looking at application behavior and</span> <span data-start="92.97" data-end="95.61">component Styles this way is very</span> <span data-start="95.61" data-end="97.89">limited because we also have to think</span> <span data-start="97.89" data-end="99.84">about how we transition between these</span> <span data-start="99.84" data-end="101.759">states to illustrate this problem let's</span> <span data-start="101.759" data-end="103.409">say we have this fetch button user</span> <span data-start="103.409" data-end="106.079">clicks it we're waiting for data and we</span> <span data-start="106.079" data-end="107.46">eventually get it that's great</span> <span data-start="107.46" data-end="109.47">but what happens if the data takes a</span> <span data-start="109.47" data-end="112.2">long time to load then maybe we want to</span> <span data-start="112.2" data-end="115.409">show a spinner and eventually we get our</span> <span data-start="115.409" data-end="119.969">data but if you're like me then you'll</span> <span data-start="119.969" data-end="122.61">get frustrated after a while and start</span> <span data-start="122.61" data-end="124.38">clicking this button a few times and</span> <span data-start="124.38" data-end="126.149">this is gonna make a lot of unnecessary</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="126.149" data-end="129.09">API requests until you finally get your</span> <span data-start="129.09" data-end="132.239">data but you're a developer and you're</span> <span data-start="132.239" data-end="134.38">smart you think you know what</span> <span data-start="134.38" data-end="136.54">I'm going to disable the button and that</span> <span data-start="136.54" data-end="138.79">way they could only click it once they</span> <span data-start="138.79" data-end="140.62">have to wait for the data and then it</span> <span data-start="140.62" data-end="143.14">comes back successfully but guess what</span> <span data-start="143.14" data-end="145.6">I'm a developer too I know chrome dev</span> <span data-start="145.6" data-end="148.03">tools so I could just go in under Sabol</span> <span data-start="148.03" data-end="150.16">that button and make as many requests as</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="150.16" data-end="153.76">I want so I ran into this problem a lot</span> <span data-start="153.76" data-end="156.1">of times and I wasn't always good at</span> <span data-start="156.1" data-end="158.5">JavaScript which is why at the very</span> <span data-start="158.5" data-end="161.08">beginning I decided to see how much I</span> <span data-start="161.08" data-end="164.2">could do with just HTML and CSS this was</span> <span data-start="164.2" data-end="165.82">one of the very first code pens that I</span> <span data-start="165.82" data-end="168.43">made using hover States to just go</span> <span data-start="168.43" data-end="170.65">between the days and recreate this</span> <span data-start="170.65" data-end="174.61">dribble by 2bic studio as well as this</span> <span data-start="174.61" data-end="178.24">one now to do to do complex animations</span> <span data-start="178.24" data-end="180.85">like this you sort of have to use a few</span> <span data-start="180.85" data-end="183.01">hacks if you're not going to use</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="183.01" data-end="185.41">JavaScript and so that's exactly what I</span> <span data-start="185.41" data-end="187.81">did just like was talked about in the</span> <span data-start="187.81" data-end="190.75">very first talk I used check boxes</span> <span data-start="190.75" data-end="193.54">because check boxes can represent States</span> <span data-start="193.54" data-end="196.81">and radio buttons as well so what I did</span> <span data-start="196.81" data-end="199.54">here was if you have a checkbox and it</span> <span data-start="199.54" data-end="201.46">sort of lives outside the app you could</span> <span data-start="201.46" data-end="203.14">use the squiggly selector a tilde</span> <span data-start="203.14" data-end="205.39">selector which is more formally known as</span> <span data-start="205.39" data-end="207.43">the adjutant sibling selector but I mean</span> <span data-start="207.43" data-end="209.65">no one's gonna remember that and you</span> <span data-start="209.65" data-end="212.38">could apply a label inside the app that</span> <span data-start="212.38" data-end="214.9">labels are great because they magically</span> <span data-start="214.9" data-end="219.79">map the the check box over to the label</span> <span data-start="219.79" data-end="221.26">in your app so when you click the label</span> <span data-start="221.26" data-end="223.57">it doesn't matter where it is it will</span> <span data-start="223.57" data-end="225.76">check that checkbox and so what happens</span> <span data-start="225.76" data-end="227.29">is when you click that label which could</span> <span data-start="227.29" data-end="229.93">be a button or anything else then that</span> <span data-start="229.93" data-end="231.61">check box is going to be checked you</span> <span data-start="231.61" data-end="233.14">could use the squiggly selector and</span> <span data-start="233.14" data-end="236.02">select that box and make it change</span> <span data-start="236.02" data-end="237.73">styles and you could also do this with</span> <span data-start="237.73" data-end="240.19">more than one check box which gives you</span> <span data-start="240.19" data-end="241.84">sort of that dynamic behavior and</span> <span data-start="241.84" data-end="244.81">dynamic styling now like I mentioned you</span> <span data-start="244.81" data-end="246.43">could do this with both check boxes and</span> <span data-start="246.43" data-end="249.52">radios with one distinction with check</span> <span data-start="249.52" data-end="251.59">boxes you could have zero or more check</span> <span data-start="251.59" data-end="253.63">boxes checked but while I found myself</span> <span data-start="253.63" data-end="255.91">using more and more for radio buttons</span> <span data-start="255.91" data-end="258.13">because it enforced the idea that you</span> <span data-start="258.13" data-end="260.41">could have only one of them checked at a</span> <span data-start="260.41" data-end="263.74">time so I was playing around with this</span> <span data-start="263.74" data-end="265.33">and I was playing around with crazier</span> <span data-start="265.33" data-end="267.7">things like this CSS only dog animation</span> <span data-start="267.7" data-end="268.03">that I</span> <span data-start="268.03" data-end="270.76">showed at the very first CSS company the</span> <span data-start="270.76" data-end="276.37">pest that I was at and I decided to go</span> <span data-start="276.37" data-end="278.56">with my friends sha and we do this</span> <span data-start="278.56" data-end="280.72">weekly livestream called the key framers</span> <span data-start="280.72" data-end="282.61">in which we bring imaginative user</span> <span data-start="282.61" data-end="285.76">interfaces to like using HTML CSS and a</span> <span data-start="285.76" data-end="288.1">little bit of JavaScript so what we do</span> <span data-start="288.1" data-end="291.22">is we take these really complex</span> <span data-start="291.22" data-end="293.86">animations from Tribble and we try to</span> <span data-start="293.86" data-end="296.41">recreate them live on the air in under</span> <span data-start="296.41" data-end="298.51">two hours but what we found ourselves</span> <span data-start="298.51" data-end="300.73">seeing more and more is that a lot of</span> <span data-start="300.73" data-end="302.83">these animations are States based and</span> <span data-start="302.83" data-end="304.81">not just two states so we can't use a</span> <span data-start="304.81" data-end="307.75">checkbox but three states where you</span> <span data-start="307.75" data-end="310.54">click and you know you might go back or</span> <span data-start="310.54" data-end="312.46">you might have this play button and then</span> <span data-start="312.46" data-end="318.16">you go to something else so that's more</span> <span data-start="318.16" data-end="320.919">easily illustrated here because we have</span> <span data-start="320.919" data-end="323.47">this plateless state at the top which</span> <span data-start="323.47" data-end="325.9">shows what state our app is in and you</span> <span data-start="325.9" data-end="327.81">could scroll through these albums and</span> <span data-start="327.81" data-end="330.46">this is another recreation of a dribble</span> <span data-start="330.46" data-end="332.5">and so you could drag back and forth and</span> <span data-start="332.5" data-end="335.05">you could see that the state of our</span> <span data-start="335.05" data-end="338.05">entire application changes as the user</span> <span data-start="338.05" data-end="341.229">interacts with this application so you</span> <span data-start="341.229" data-end="346.419">could see those moving side to side so</span> <span data-start="346.419" data-end="348.1">this sort of illustrates the problem</span> <span data-start="348.1" data-end="350.26">that we have with our currents design</span> <span data-start="350.26" data-end="351.85">systems in the current way that we</span> <span data-start="351.85" data-end="355.3">develop is that a designer might present</span> <span data-start="355.3" data-end="359.38">you a very high fidelity mock-up or you</span> <span data-start="359.38" data-end="361.96">know just like a simple prototype but</span> <span data-start="361.96" data-end="365.52">that mock-up represents only one of</span> <span data-start="365.52" data-end="368.229">potentially many if not hundreds</span> <span data-start="368.229" data-end="370.69">thousands of possible states that your</span> <span data-start="370.69" data-end="373.39">app of your components can be in and so</span> <span data-start="373.39" data-end="375.16">the problem I'm sorry the problem is</span> <span data-start="375.16" data-end="377.65">that this Ireson cycle is a bit slow</span> <span data-start="377.65" data-end="380.68">because not only does a designer have to</span> <span data-start="380.68" data-end="383.11">make all of those changes in all of</span> <span data-start="383.11" data-end="385.87">those different screens but if the logic</span> <span data-start="385.87" data-end="387.94">changes of the design changes you have</span> <span data-start="387.94" data-end="389.32">to go through all of those possible</span> <span data-start="389.32" data-end="391.63">changes or all those possible screens</span> <span data-start="391.63" data-end="397.539">and apply those changes so what what we</span> <span data-start="397.539" data-end="399.729">do currently today and I'm sure most of</span> <span data-start="399.729" data-end="401.229">you are guilty of this I know I was</span> <span data-start="401.229" data-end="401.8">guilty of the</span> <span data-start="401.8" data-end="404.229">for the longest time is we apply classes</span> <span data-start="404.229" data-end="406.27">we're like okay if this button is in the</span> <span data-start="406.27" data-end="408.34">loading state then we have a class of</span> <span data-start="408.34" data-end="411.55">loading of course so we could do the</span> <span data-start="411.55" data-end="413.979">same with success but the problem with</span> <span data-start="413.979" data-end="416.289">classes we can't enforce that we only</span> <span data-start="416.289" data-end="419.409">have one possible value so we might have</span> <span data-start="419.409" data-end="422.08">a button that shows loading and success</span> <span data-start="422.08" data-end="424.419">and some of you might think like I'm I'm</span> <span data-start="424.419" data-end="427.24">smart enough not to do this I have class</span> <span data-start="427.24" data-end="429.159">list I could remove the loading class</span> <span data-start="429.159" data-end="431.919">and then at the success class by this</span> <span data-start="431.919" data-end="434.05">many of you know this does happen in the</span> <span data-start="434.05" data-end="437.11">real world and this is something that we</span> <span data-start="437.11" data-end="440.53">wants to avoid so is there a better way</span> <span data-start="440.53" data-end="442.78">that we could model the state for our</span> <span data-start="442.78" data-end="445.629">dynamic UI's and have it in a way that</span> <span data-start="445.629" data-end="448.659">we could visualize it and easily see all</span> <span data-start="448.659" data-end="451.36">these possible states and be able to</span> <span data-start="451.36" data-end="454.479">know how states change from one state to</span> <span data-start="454.479" data-end="456.969">another in our app and can we do it in a</span> <span data-start="456.969" data-end="458.71">more formal way that designers and</span> <span data-start="458.71" data-end="461.469">developers can understand equally so I</span> <span data-start="461.469" data-end="463.09">looked at a lot of different prototyping</span> <span data-start="463.09" data-end="466.779">apps like origami design envision app</span> <span data-start="466.779" data-end="469">which you define each of the different</span> <span data-start="469" data-end="471.069">states in it smoothly transitions</span> <span data-start="471.069" data-end="473.65">between each of them prototype does the</span> <span data-start="473.65" data-end="476.319">same thing where it's sort of like magic</span> <span data-start="476.319" data-end="478.15">move for designers because you could</span> <span data-start="478.15" data-end="480.4">define shapes and it will magically</span> <span data-start="480.4" data-end="483.669">transform then scale them translate them</span> <span data-start="483.669" data-end="485.469">into the shape that they're supposed to</span> <span data-start="485.469" data-end="487.63">be and you could add triggers and then</span> <span data-start="487.63" data-end="490.779">there's more formal user flow tools such</span> <span data-start="490.779" data-end="493.3">as overflowed IO in which you could</span> <span data-start="493.3" data-end="495.279">design each of these screens and add</span> <span data-start="495.279" data-end="498.789">these custom triggers so what I realized</span> <span data-start="498.789" data-end="500.65">was common between all of these tools</span> <span data-start="500.65" data-end="503.469">and more is that user flows are these</span> <span data-start="503.469" data-end="505.539">transitions between these user interface</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="505.539" data-end="507.759">States and these transitions could be</span> <span data-start="507.759" data-end="510.43">caused based on either user events or</span> <span data-start="510.43" data-end="513.13">other external events such as a timer an</span> <span data-start="513.13" data-end="516.82">API requests coming in etc and so this</span> <span data-start="516.82" data-end="519.279">brings me to the topic of finite state</span> <span data-start="519.279" data-end="521.529">machines and state charts which I mean</span> <span data-start="521.529" data-end="523.12">if you know me long enough you know that</span> <span data-start="523.12" data-end="524.98">this is what I talked about you could</span> <span

data-start="529.39" data-end="531.25">just my thing one of my favorite</span> <span data-start="531.25" data-end="533.44">definitions of the states is</span> <span data-start="533.44" data-end="535.42">actually in the Aria guidelines in the</span> <span data-start="535.42" data-end="538.24">w3.org website where a States is a</span> <span data-start="538.24"
