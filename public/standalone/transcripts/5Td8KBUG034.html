<span data-start="696.65" data-end="699.44">and the big guys are gonna jump super</span> <span data-start="699.44" data-end="702.68">far and have a lot of momentum and then</span> <span data-start="702.68" data-end="703.94">there's a sense of randomness as well</span> <span data-start="703.94" data-end="705.41">it's kind of hard to predict you know</span> <span data-start="705.41"

we have some order complexity you</span> <span data-start="709.85" data-end="711.62">can generally tell how they're gonna</span> <span data-start="711.62" data-end="716.6">move and then there's a flocking</span> <span data-start="716.6" data-end="717.26">simulation</span> <span data-start="717.26" data-end="719.72">all right so flocking got a lot of</span> <span data-start="719.72"

<p><span data-start="739.64" data-end="742.43">Animal Planet because yeah they</span> <span data-start="742.43" data-end="744.26">differentiate between like goofy animals</span> <span
