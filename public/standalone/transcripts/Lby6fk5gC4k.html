<p><span data-start="87.07" data-end="88.99">I think I kind of just did that.</span> <span data-start="88.99" data-end="91.09">So, hi, I'm Ruth.</span> <span data-start="91.09" data-end="96.74">I'm here today to talk to you about how to be a web AV artist.</span> <span data-start="96.74" data-end="97.74">Yeah..</span> <span data-start="97.74" data-end="98.89">I know.</span> <span data-start="100.32" data-end="105.2">To be honest with you, I struggled with the practicality of this talk.</span> <span data-start="105.2" data-end="111.579">I'm going to be talking about WebAudio API, and MIDI API and I don't know how many of</span> <span data-start="111.579" data-end="119.28">you are going to go back to work on Monday and put the word "MIDI API" into a website.</span> <span data-start="119.28" data-end="128.229">So I kind of thought to myself when I saw this about six months ago, that I should take</span> <span data-start="128.229" data-end="129.61">it literally.</span> <span data-start="129.61" data-end="130.7">This is a Venn diagram.</span> <span data-start="130.7" data-end="135.9">This is a Venn diagram about practical talks at conferences.</span> <span data-start="135.9" data-end="140.152">And on the left-hand side, you've got what people actually talk about, and you've got</span> <span data-start="140.152" data-end="145.44">on the right-hand side, what attendees want you to talk about.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="145.44" data-end="151.79">So I made two lists just to make sure that this is a really useful talk, by the way,</span> <span data-start="151.79" data-end="155.12">I made two lists.</span> <span data-start="155.12" data-end="160.871">One list is things that I have to avoid talking about, and the other list is things that I</span> <span data-start="160.871" data-end="163.59">have to include in this talk.</span> <span data-start="163.59" data-end="167.52">And then it would be really, really useful for all of you, and my talk anxiety will go</span> <span data-start="167.52" data-end="169.099">away.</span> <span data-start="169.099" data-end="175.66">So I have to avoid analytics, operational excellence, chat ops, orchestration.</span> <span data-start="175.66" data-end="177.07">That's fine.</span> <span data-start="177.07" data-end="181.67">I think I can totally avoid these things.</span> <span data-start="181.67" data-end="188.5">I have to include duct tape, workarounds, bike shedding, and coffee, and tea.</span> <span data-start="188.5" data-end="191.15">Easy things to include for a developer.</span> <span data-start="191.15" data-end="192.15">Great.</span> <span data-start="192.15" data-end="195.65">Now that I've got that out of the way, let's begin.</span> <span data-start="195.65" data-end="198.58">So what is an AV artist?</span> <span data-start="198.58" data-end="200.7">AV stands for audio- visual.</span> <span data-start="200.7" data-end="206.64">So as an audio-visual artist, it's just taking some audio and making visualizations from</span> <span data-start="206.64" data-end="208.97">that audio.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="208.97" data-end="211.63">Another name for this is a VJ.</span> <span data-start="211.63" data-end="213.62">There's not a lot of making the audio.</span> <span data-start="213.62" data-end="219.239">We're just taking what other people are making and using the data from it.</span> <span data-start="219.239" data-end="222.5">Who, out there, remembers this?</span> <span data-start="222.5" data-end="223.5"Audience member: Winamp!</span> <span data-start="223.5" data-end="227.989">It really whips the llama's ass!</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="227.989" data-end="233.36"><span class="speaker">Ruth</span>: For those of you who don't remember, because there are going to be a few people</span> <span data-start="233.36" data-end="238.87">who don't remember, this is the best mp3 player of all the time.</span> <span data-start="238.87" data-end="245.5">It's lightweight, and easy to install and quick, and free, but it actually played music</span> <span data-start="245.5" data-end="247.709">that you had on your hard drive.</span> <span data-start="247.709" data-end="249.11">It's amazing.</span> <span data-start="249.11" data-end="251.489">But that was not the best thing about Winamp.</span> <span data-start="251.489" data-end="258.489">This was the best thing about Winamp.</span> <span data-start="258.489" data-end="263.69">So you could whip up these visuals and they would go in time to the music and you could</span> <span data-start="263.69" data-end="266.92">just sit and watch for hours.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="266.92" data-end="272.52">This was probably the most influential thing of any VJ of my generation and this is kind</span> <span data-start="272.52" data-end="273.61">of what got me into it.</span> <span data-start="273.61" data-end="275.35">I said, I want to make this!</span> <span data-start="275.35" data-end="277">This is great!</span> <span data-start="277" data-end="282.53">So the first thing that we need to make things like this is audio and that's good.</span> <span data-start="282.53" data-end="285.73">We have a Web Audio API.</span> <span data-start="285.73" data-end="286.81">And that gets us audio.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="286.81" data-end="287.81">That's great.</span> <span data-start="287.81" data-end="289.55">There's four main ways that you can do it with the Web Audio API.</span> <span data-start="289.55" data-end="291.31">I'm sure you've come across most of these.</span> <span data-start="291.31" data-end="292.93">So you can create sound yourself.</span> <span data-start="292.93" data-end="300.65">And so you instigate an oscillator, and you can grab elements from the DOM.</span> <span data-start="300.65" data-end="308.66">If you have audio-video element in the DOM, you can pipe it from that.</span> <span data-start="308.66" data-end="312.94">You can stream it, and that's usually taking it from the camera, or the microphone from</span> <span data-start="312.94" data-end="319.41">your laptop and you can stream it into the audio API, or you can go get a sound file</span> <span data-start="319.41" data-end="321.34">and buffer the data from that sound file.</span> <span data-start="321.34" data-end="325.54">So what you're doing is taking the data and putting it in sort of a container that the</span> <span data-start="325.54" data-end="329.12">audio API has, and then you can use the data.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="329.12" data-end="334.8">I'm using the Fetch API as an example here to go and get my sound file.</span> <span data-start="334.8" data-end="337.21">So a couple of examples.</span> <span data-start="337.21" data-end="341.97">This one, I'll taking the sound from a sound file.</span> <span data-start="341.97" data-end="348.27">I'm just piping it in and it's analyzing that.</span> <span data-start="348.27" data-end="350.68">And this one is actually picking up on my voice.</span> <span data-start="350.68" data-end="354.9">So it's picking up the microphone from my laptop, and streaming it into the audio API.</span> <span data-start="354.9" data-end="358.46">This is my preferred method for the moment because I don't know where I'm going to be</span> <span data-start="358.46" data-end="361.281">doing the visualizations.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="361.281" data-end="367.66">And so we need to be able to analyze the sound.</span> <span data-start="367.66" data-end="369.13">Oh, okay.</span> <span data-start="369.13" data-end="373.72">I'm not allowed to say "analytics."</span> <span data-start="373.72" data-end="377.06">That was a  —  thank you very much, Turk.</span> <span data-start="377.06" data-end="382.74">It's going to trip me every single time whenever this is said.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="382.74" data-end="384.96">But I'm talking about analytics.</span> <span data-start="384.96" data-end="389.5">So to analyze sound, we can do it at the Web Audio API level, as well, and we can do that</span> <span data-start="389.5" data-end="396.55">with the analyzer node and we can use the sound that we created, or got with the audio</span> <span data-start="396.55" data-end="404.11">API and it would give us analyzed data back, and what it gives us is something like this,</span> <span data-start="404.11" data-end="406.05">which is an array of frequency velocities.</span> <span data-start="406.05" data-end="410.98">For those of you who don't know what that means, frequency is sound levels.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="410.98" data-end="414.01">It's like low sounds to high sounds.</span> <span data-start="414.01" data-end="421.47">And what we're actually scanning for here is naught hertz to 30,000 kilohertz, that's</span> <span data-start="421.47" data-end="423.7">very, very high.</span> <span data-start="423.7" data-end="431.96">And that's higher a resolution than we can actually detect and the velocity of the volume</span> <span data-start="431.96" data-end="438.68">is just the frequency of that volume at any given point and it's just a number and then</span> <span data-start="438.68" data-end="442.52">we can just use those numbers, which is exactly what's going on here.</span> <span data-start="442.52" data-end="448.37">This is just a bunch of i-elements and I'm taking that data value, that velocity value,</span> <span data-start="448.37" data-end="451.59">and I'm making it the height of those i-elements.</span> <span data-start="451.59" data-end="452.99">It's really rather straightforward.</span> <span data-start="452.99" data-end="458.28">Just loop through these, great.</span> <span data-start="458.28" data-end="463.79">We can all make visuals and my talk is over and we can go for an early lunch.</span> <span data-start="463.79" data-end="465.33">We could actually do some more complicated stuff.</span> <span data-start="465.33" data-end="469.62">But it is relatively easy and we're just using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, actually just to</span> <span data-start="469.62" data-end="472.93">do something really cool.</span> <span data-start="472.93" data-end="477.71">So I wondered how far could we really take this with just these technologies and I started</span> <span data-start="477.71" data-end="479.45">a bunch of experiments.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="479.45" data-end="484.4">And everybody knows when you start experimenting, you need some inspiration.</span> <span data-start="484.4" data-end="485.94">So this was my first inspiration.</span> <span data-start="485.94" data-end="488.58">This is Bridget Riley, she's a super cool artist.</span> <span data-start="488.58" data-end="490.13">It said so on the slides.</span> <span data-start="490.13" data-end="498.09">I actually discovered her at ScotlandJS there, and she had an exhibition at Edinborough,</span> <span data-start="498.09" data-end="510.74">and it was really, really great and I said, I'm going to visualize paintings.</span> <span data-start="510.74" data-end="516.55">And these are all divs, and I'm just using Flexbox, and I'm getting the data back.</span> <span data-start="516.55" data-end="517.55">It's just really simple.</span> <span data-start="517.55" data-end="527.86">And this one is another one showing some triangles based on that data.</span> <span data-start="527.86" data-end="533.74">And this is just simply stuff in the DOM.</span> <span data-start="533.74" data-end="540.23">And, of course, if we're using things in the DOM, we can try and instigate some lovely</span> <span data-start="540.23" data-end="543.88">CSS because I'm at a JavaScript conference, so I thought I would bring in some CSS, I</span> <span data-start="543.88" data-end="545.78">thought that would be a really, really good idea.</span> <span data-start="545.78" data-end="548.17">Transforms are cool.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="548.17" data-end="553.3">With visualizations, I really feel like you could do some symmetry.</span> <span data-start="553.3" data-end="559.12">If I could take whatever's in the DOM and replicate it, and rotate it around with just</span> <span data-start="559.12" data-end="562.49">the function, then I could do whatever I have in the DOM.</span> <span data-start="562.49" data-end="563.86">That would be really great.</span> <span data-start="563.86" data-end="565.65">That would let me do whatever I want to do the set.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="565.65" data-end="570.44">So I did that, and so I've got literally one-quarter of the screen.</span> <span data-start="570.44" data-end="578.3">And I thought, well, we could put anything in the DOM.</span> <span data-start="578.3" data-end="584.56">And that's a good thing, as well because you want to be able to use videos and imagery,</span> <span data-start="584.56" data-end="590.5">so I thought, wouldn't it be cool if we could just drop a gif in one of these quarters and</span> <span data-start="590.5" data-end="592.83">reflect and rotate that around?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="592.83" data-end="594.58">And you can do that, as well.</span> <span data-start="594.58" data-end="596.43">This is a My Little Pony gif.</span> <span data-start="596.43" data-end="600.33">My favorite kind of gif.</span> <span data-start="600.33" data-end="606.49">And so on and so forth of the lovely CSS things we have are blends and filters.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="606.49" data-end="611.57">So the visualization that we have at the top of the show, we can just add some blend modes</span> <span data-start="611.57" data-end="617.24">to that, and we've got a much nicer visualization  —  well, I think the first one was pretty</span> <span data-start="617.24" data-end="618.24">good.</span> <span data-start="618.24" data-end="619.65">But this one has just got some blend modes on.</span> <span data-start="619.65" data-end="623.86">So each element is just fighting for the next element.</span> <span data-start="623.86" data-end="629.38">Top tips for you, filters, filters, if you're unaware in CSS of things like saturation,</span> <span data-start="629.38" data-end="635.94">inversion, and things like that, work on video, so if you are playing video clips in your</span> <span data-start="635.94" data-end="642.17">set, you can invert with literally just a CSS property which works really, really well.</span> <span data-start="642.17" data-end="644.89">It's really good.</span> <span data-start="644.89" data-end="649.01">One CSS thing which is actually really, really interesting, and something that was great</span> <span data-start="649.01" data-end="652.87">to experiment with was custom properties.</span> <span data-start="652.87" data-end="657.02">Now we've got a lot of data and we've got a lot of data in our JavaScript but we might</span> <span data-start="657.02" data-end="659.64">be styling with CSS.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="659.64" data-end="664.67">So it's almost like, well, okay, we can change styles in JavaScript, that's fine.</span> <span data-start="664.67" data-end="667.55">But this is an interesting one.</span> <span data-start="667.55" data-end="671.71">I'm sure everybody has seen this but I am just going to go over it.</span> <span data-start="671.71" data-end="676.5">If you've ever used a CSS preprocessor, so SASS, or LESS, or something like that, you</span> <span data-start="676.5" data-end="679.64">probably have come across variables.</span> <span data-start="679.64" data-end="682.85">This is almost the same idea in spec.</span> <span data-start="682.85" data-end="689.13">So at the top there, we've got some CSS, and you declare whatever you want your variable</span> <span data-start="689.13" data-end="692.29">in the root element, with a dash, dash and then whatever you want.</span> <span data-start="692.29" data-end="698.69">This level that I have in mind is going to reflect the frequency data which I'm getting</span> <span data-start="698.69" data-end="703.32">from the analyzer node and then all I'm doing is changing the width and the height later</span> <span data-start="703.32" data-end="706.15">on in the CSS.</span> <span data-start="706.15" data-end="712.6">And then in the JavaScript, I could parse that frequency data back to my CSS.</span> </p>
