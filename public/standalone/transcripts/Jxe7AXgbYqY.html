workers</span> <span data-start="1181.07" data-end="1182.45">right now we have service workers and</span> <span data-start="1182.45" data-end="1184.25">page workers and shared workers and</span> <span

data-start="1196.159" data-end="1198.35">these extension API so we uh we actually</span> <span data-start="1198.35" data-end="1200.539">had the concept of pages versus workers</span> <span

data-end="1211.19">it's just sort of virtual webpage that</span> <span data-start="1211.19" data-end="1213.8">has a bunch of script tags in it the</span> <span data-start="1213.8" data-end="1215.06">advantage of this is you get access to</span> <span data-start="1215.06" data-end="1217.25">every single Dom API right so which is</span> <span data-start="1217.25" data-end="1218.63">very very valuable you know you have</span> <span data-start="1218.63" data-end="1220.46">access to fetch how you can assume that</span> <span data-start="1220.46" data-end="1221.84">if you can do it from a webpage you can</span> <span data-start="1221.84" data-end="1224.12">do it from an extension the downside is</span> <span data-start="1224.12" data-end="1226.52">it's a little clumsy err you have to</span> <span data-start="1226.52" data-end="1228.32">worry about the overhead of knowing you</span> <span data-start="1228.32" data-end="1230.96">know that you share this shared global</span> <span data-start="1230.96" data-end="1232.99">window object and things like that</span> <span data-start="1232.99" data-end="1235.52">so you know in a manifest you might see</span> <span data-start="1235.52" data-end="1237.23">something that looks like this where you</span> <span data-start="1237.23" data-end="1240.74">say polyfill background or you can</span> <span data-start="1240.74" data-end="1242.69">actually define just say hey you'll use</span> <span data-start="1242.69" data-end="1245.81">this page and a page effectively looks</span> <span data-start="1245.81" data-end="1248.39">like this it's a very very short stub a</span> <span data-start="1248.39" data-end="1250.37">lot of times you just see script tags</span> <span data-start="1250.37" data-end="1252.08">people omit everything else because I</span> <span data-start="1252.08" data-end="1254.42">don't actually care and you get these</span> <span data-start="1254.42" data-end="1256.91">scripts loaded</span> <span data-start="1256.91" data-end="1259.12">this doesn't look

<span data-start="1263.48" data-end="1265.85">do so in the intervening time we now</span> <span data-start="1265.85" data-end="1268.82">have es6 modules right and if you're</span> <span data-start="1268.82" data-end="1270.56">building a browser extension you know</span> <span data-start="1270.56" data-end="1272.21">what's gonna run in a browser and you</span> <span

data-start="1275.62" data-end="1279.68">you can load a polyfill and you can load</span> <span data-start="1279.68" data-end="1281.36">a Dom library maybe jQuery maybe</span> <span data-start="1281.36" data-end="1282.68">something else and you can actually do</span> <span data-start="1282.68" data-end="1284.84">some computation on some Dom object</span> <span data-start="1284.84"

data-end="1290.24">information and you can use es6 modules</span> <span data-start="1290.24" data-end="1292.7">right so this way you can say as opposed</span> <span data-start="1292.7" data-end="1293.96">to just loading a static background</span> <span data-start="1293.96" data-end="1296.75">script pretend it's a sweet no actually</span> <span data-start="1296.75"
