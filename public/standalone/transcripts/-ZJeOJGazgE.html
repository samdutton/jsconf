data-end="980.23">map the syntax is basically you have to</span> <span data-start="980.23" data-end="983.319">have parentheses and then it's comma</span> <span data-start="983.319"

data-end="1006.569">be a color etc from there you can now</span> <span data-start="1006.569" data-end="1009.99">have a map and you can use that map to</span> <span data-start="1009.99" data-end="1012.269">store information you can pass that</span> <span data-start="1012.269" data-end="1015.3">around and so here's an example of me</span> <span data-start="1015.3"

data-start="1178.8" data-end="1181.11">like they want to take a variable and</span> <span data-start="1181.11" data-end="1184.4">then interpolate it so they'll say like</span> <span data-start="1184.4" data-end="1189.96">can I just do like theme so they have</span> <span data-start="1189.96" data-end="1195.24">their theme name somewhere and then then</span> <span data-start="1195.24" data-end="1201.42">they have something like and they'll</span> <span data-start="1201.42" data-end="1207.24">want to do this to get to get the value</span> <span data-start="1207.24" data-end="1209.01">like it and create an association that</span> <span data-start="1209.01" data-end="1211.92">way and we just felt this was ugly and</span> <span data-start="1211.92" data-end="1215.04">unreadable and a little confusing and so</span> <span data-start="1215.04" data-end="1217.05">maps are basically our answer to the</span> <span data-start="1217.05" data-end="1227.62">request for variable interpolation</span> <span data-start="1227.63" data-end="1230.13">let's get that example for right now any</span> <span data-start="1230.13" data-end="1235.29">more questions about maps all right</span> <span data-start="1235.29" data-end="1241.029">moving on</span> <span data-start="1241.039" data-end="1261.88">yes</span> <span data-start="1261.89" data-end="1266.36">so here the map has key function returns</span> <span data-start="1266.36" data-end="1269.049">false because nope doesn't exist but</span> <span data-start="1269.049" data-end="1274.9">basecolor does so now it returns true</span> <span data-start="1274.9" data-end="1277.88">and that's pretty useful too I think I</span> <span data-start="1277.88" data-end="1285.26">use that actually no later example is</span> <span data-start="1285.26" data-end="1287.39">there limits to how deep the map merging</span> <span data-start="1287.39" data-end="1289.309">can go so basically every time you merge</span> <span data-start="1289.309" data-end="1293.179">a map you get a new map so in in fast</span> <span data-start="1293.179" data-end="1295.61">every data type is every piece of data</span> <span data-start="1295.61" data-end="1297.169">is immutable so we always just make a</span> <span data-start="1297.169" data-end="1299.66">copy and give you a copy back so there's</span> <span data-start="1299.66" data-end="1301.28">no limit to how many merges but if you</span> <span data-start="1301.28" data-end="1303.86">did a lot you're gonna probably make a</span> <span data-start="1303.86" data-end="1306.5">lot of garbage along the way so some</span> <span data-start="1306.5" data-end="1308.69">performance aspect to think about you</span> <span data-start="1308.69" data-end="1310.52">can embed Maps within other maps as well</span> <span data-start="1310.52" data-end="1314">like nested as a value and you just</span> <span data-start="1314" data-end="1316.07">would just put more parentheses and just</span> <span data-start="1316.07" data-end="1324.31">repeat the next map there all right</span> <span data-start="1324.32" data-end="1326.78">so meta scripting again another feature</span> <span data-start="1326.78" data-end="1328.79">that the framework developers have been</span> <span data-start="1328.79" data-end="1331.04">asking for over and over again probably</span> <span data-start="1331.04" data-end="1332.299">you're not gonna need them in your style</span> <span data-start="1332.299" data-end="1335.33">sheets but the goal is so if we give</span> <span data-start="1335.33" data-end="1337.94">great tools to the framework makers the</span> <span data-start="1337.94" data-end="1339.62">framework makers give you amazing tools</span> <span data-start="1339.62" data-end="1343.7">that make your life even better so</span> <span data-start="1343.7" data-end="1346.73">here's the the call function so if</span> <span data-start="1346.73" data-end="1348.169">there's a function defined either you've</span> <span data-start="1348.169" data-end="1350.12">defined it or Sasa's defined it or even</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1350.12" data-end="1353.27">CSS is defined it you can pass that</span> <span data-start="1353.27" data-end="1355.19">function name to call and it will get</span> <span data-start="1355.19" data-end="1360.41">invoked and so by this we can now say</span> <span data-start="1360.41" data-end="1364.28">hey like what is the function like user</span> <span data-start="1364.28" data-end="1365.87">of my framework what is the function</span> <span data-start="1365.87" data-end="1368.57">that you need that's gonna tell me how</span> <span

data-start="1376.4" data-end="1378.38">code can pass the framework the the name</span> <span data-start="1378.38" data-end="1380.03">of the function and it can call it for</span> <span

data-end="1386.24">inversion of control now and that's</span> <span data-start="1386.24" data-end="1391.88">super handy so here's an example that I</span> <span data-start="1391.88" data-end="1396.92">made this kind of doing that</span> <span data-start="1396.93" data-end="1400.45">so basically this this theme is hoping</span> <span data-start="1400.45" data-end="1402.19">for a for a function that tells it how</span> <span data-start="1402.19" data-end="1407.08">to compute colors and we're able to pass</span> <span data-start="1407.08" data-end="1409.33">in the background function is called my</span> <span data-start="1409.33" data-end="1413.29">theme background and I've defined it</span> <span data-start="1413.29" data-end="1415.63">right here and all it does is just</span> <span data-start="1415.63" data-end="1420.37">lighten the color a little bit and then</span> <span data-start="1420.37" data-end="1421.69">the theme when it's doing all of its</span> <span data-start="1421.69" data-end="1423.94">hard work to set things up ends up</span> <span data-start="1423.94" data-end="1425.92">calling that function for us and then we</span> <span data-start="1425.92" data-end="1429.31">get a lighter color of red so basically</span> <span data-start="1429.31" data-end="1430.69">it took the base color here and</span> <span data-start="1430.69" data-end="1432.27">lightened it for us if it had been blue</span> <span data-start="1432.27" data-end="1437.5">it'd get different output so it should</span> <span data-start="1437.5" data-end="1438.67">be some neat stuff that comes our way</span> <span data-start="1438.67" data-end="1441.76">from from this the other meta stuff that</span> <span data-start="1441.76" data-end="1444.28">we are added is the ability to check</span> <span data-start="1444.28" data-end="1446.71">existence of various things within your</span> <span data-start="1446.71" data-end="1450.46">stylesheet so for instance we can now</span> <span data-start="1450.46" data-end="1458.14">check if a function exists so ask if</span> <span data-start="1458.14" data-end="1462.55">some function named in begin exists so</span> <span data-start="1462.55" data-end="1464.65">that will return true here</span> <span data-start="1464.65" data-end="1466.48">lightin is built in by sass that's gonna</span> <span data-start="1466.48" data-end="1469.69">return true we can ask if a mixin exists</span> <span data-start="1469.69" data-end="1472.24">and because it was defined here we will</span> <span data-start="1472.24" data-end="1474.34">get the true from there we can check</span> <span data-start="1474.34" data-end="1478.78">about global variables and if you've</span> <span data-start="1478.78" data-end="1480.52">defined a local than you then you can</span> <span data-start="1480.52" data-end="1482.26">just check if the normal variable exists</span> <span data-start="1482.26" data-end="1485.62">so there's a bunch of of stuff that will</span> <span data-start="1485.62" data-end="1489.46">allow inspection of kind of the context</span> <span data-start="1489.46" data-end="1492.34">and avoid making mistakes and where this</span> <span data-start="1492.34" data-end="1495.55">gets really handy is in upgrading</span> <span data-start="1495.55" data-end="1497.46">frameworks from version to version</span> <span data-start="1497.46" data-end="1503.83">so somebody adds a new sweet feature but</span> <span data-start="1503.83" data-end="1505.39">they want to support an older version of</span> <span data-start="1505.39" data-end="1507.28">the same library and so now what they</span> <span data-start="1507.28" data-end="1508.57">can do is kind of figure out what's</span> <span data-start="1508.57" data-end="1510.46">going on by saying does that does that</span> <span data-start="1510.46" data-end="1512.2">mix it even exists and if not I'm gonna</span> <span data-start="1512.2" data-end="1514.84">do something different here let's</span> <span data-start="1514.84" data-end="1520.63">question</span> <span data-start="1520.64" data-end="1522.75">right so these will just return true or</span> <span data-start="1522.75" data-end="1525.06">false but then you can combine these</span> <span data-start="1525.06" data-end="1532.38">with an if statement if you want to like</span> <span data-start="1532.38" data-end="1534.06">do something on the other side so</span> <span data-start="1534.06" data-end="1535.35">there's if you guys don't know there's</span> <span data-start="1535.35" data-end="1536.61">two kinds of if statements in SAS</span> <span data-start="1536.61" data-end="1539.37">there's a block level if that's at if</span> <span data-start="1539.37" data-end="1547.03">there's also an inline level if which</span> <span data-start="1547.04" data-end="1551.16">maybe that's on the next page no I was a</span> <span data-start="1551.16" data-end="1552.54">show to you real quick so it used to be</span> <span data-start="1552.54" data-end="1554.66">in SAS that if you wrote and if an if</span> <span data-start="1554.66" data-end="1558.48">function you would get an error if one</span> <span data-start="1558.48" data-end="1561.74">of the conditions was was basically</span> <span data-start="1561.74" data-end="1564.93">invalid but oftentimes you wanted to</span> <span data-start="1564.93" data-end="1566.4">branch on the condition because it would</span> <span data-start="1566.4" data-end="1568.02">have been invalid if you just but don't</span> <span data-start="1568.02" data-end="1570.66">evaluate that and that was the case for</span> <span data-start="1570.66" data-end="1572.46">the block level if statement but for the</span> <span data-start="1572.46" data-end="1575.25">function level if statement that wasn't</span> <span data-start="1575.25" data-end="1577.95">true so we fixed that so we can do this</span> <span data-start="1577.95" data-end="1587.239">like</span> <span data-start="1587.249" data-end="1590.499">so if true and then the true value will</span> <span data-start="1590.499" data-end="1594.73">be green and the false value will be ten</span> <span data-start="1594.73" data-end="1599.649">divided by zero so we get green but if</span> <span data-start="1599.649" data-end="1603.549">we change this to false it will assess</span> <span data-start="1603.549" data-end="1615.999">you're so smart know what's something</span> <span data-start="1615.999" data-end="1618.33">else that's invalid let's do divided by</span> <span data-start="1618.33" data-end="1621.789">nothing that exists all right so that</span> <span data-start="1621.789" data-end="1625.149">this this variable doesn't exist but if</span> <span

data-start="1641.649" data-end="1646.509">been dying for for so long and this is</span> <span data-start="1646.509" data-end="1648.61">one that you guys are gonna really find</span> <span data-start="1648.61" data-end="1650.679">a lot of value and I think and this the</span> <span data-start="1650.679" data-end="1654.46">ability to move the parent selector into</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1654.46" data-end="1661.119">SAS script so basically the idea is you</span> <span data-start="1661.119" data-end="1663.19">like you've been able to use ampersand</span> <span data-start="1663.19" data-end="1670.389">inside selectors you know that works</span> <span data-start="1670.389" data-end="1676.21">fine or you could do whatever or if it's</span> <span data-start="1676.21" data-end="1680.769">a class etc and and so that works great</span> <span data-start="1680.769" data-end="1684.159">but the second you need to kind of do</span> <span data-start="1684.159" data-end="1685.36">some manipulation or you wanna do</span> <span data-start="1685.36" data-end="1686.95">something fancy all of a sudden you</span> <span data-start="1686.95" data-end="1689.259">start to see the limitations of this as</span> <span data-start="1689.259" data-end="1693.22">being a proper selector abstraction and</span> <span data-start="1693.22" data-end="1697.629">not something you can fiddle with and in</span> <span data-start="1697.629" data-end="1699.58">particular the way people really wanted</span> <span data-start="1699.58" data-end="1702.669">to do this was by doing names doing like</span> <span data-start="1702.669" data-end="1706.539">modules like BEM style or smack style or</span> <span data-start="1706.539" data-end="1709.539">oo CSS style of modules and so this is</span> <span data-start="1709.539" data-end="1710.98">an example of how you will define a</span> <span data-start="1710.98" data-end="1714.399">module here so this is just my module</span> <span data-start="1714.399" data-end="1716.32">what this really appears to be in sass</span> <span data-start="1716.32" data-end="1718.48">is actually an element name there's no</span> <span data-start="1718.48" data-end="1721.29">such element</span> <span data-start="1721.3" data-end="1723.94">and so this gets passed in and we're</span> <span data-start="1723.94" data-end="1725.74">using interpolation to generate a</span> <span data-start="1725.74" data-end="1729.28">selector and and so the output comes out</span> <span data-start="1729.28" data-end="1735.73">very nicely with the kind of more Oh CSS</span> <span data-start="1735.73" data-end="1739.69">friendly style class names that are</span> <span data-start="1739.69" data-end="1741.25">named spaced instead of adding more</span> <span data-start="1741.25" data-end="1745.12">specificity through context where</span> <span data-start="1745.12" data-end="1752.75">sniffle</span> <span data-start="1752.76" data-end="1756.99">so that's obviously really huge but and</span> <span data-start="1756.99" data-end="1759.58">so like people wanted the ability to</span> <span data-start="1759.58" data-end="1763.03">basically just to do this but we had a</span> <span data-start="1763.03" data-end="1764.8">really specific reason of to do that</span> <span data-start="1764.8" data-end="1767.02">which is it what it allows you to make</span> <span data-start="1767.02" data-end="1769.33">invalid selectors and we really wanted</span> <span

data-start="1780.43" data-end="1782.89">can go and do more crazy things and we</span> <span data-start="1782.89" data-end="1785.1">love to find a solution to a fairly</span> <span data-start="1785.1" data-end="1787.87">simple problem that then pays off in</span> <span data-start="1787.87" data-end="1790.21">these other ways to do things that are</span> <span data-start="1790.21" data-end="1796.41">even more crazy and mind-blowing so I</span> <span data-start="1796.41" data-end="1804.24">made a little Nixon called inject parent</span> <span data-start="1804.24" data-end="1807.73">and so what this mixin is going to do is</span> <span data-start="1807.73" data-end="1810.37">it's gonna cuz ampersand only works you</span> <span data-start="1810.37" data-end="1811.72">can like add something to the start of</span> <span data-start="1811.72" data-end="1812.89">your selector you can add something to</span> <span data-start="1812.89" data-end="1814.96">the end but you're kind of that's what</span> <span data-start="1814.96" data-end="1817">you got so now we want to be able to say</span> <span data-start="1817" data-end="1820.06">go up one selector component and insert</span> <span data-start="1820.06" data-end="1823.09">something right there and so now we can</span> <span data-start="1823.09" data-end="1825.91">do that so inject parent is a mixin that</span> <span data-start="1825.91" data-end="1827.92">uses the content directive to place its</span> <span data-start="1827.92" data-end="1833.92">content and basically allows us to go in</span> <span data-start="1833.92" data-end="1835.87">using list manipulation functions and</span> <span data-start="1835.87" data-end="1837.91">things like this so the selector gets</span> <span data-start="1837.91" data-end="1839.56">returned to you as a comma delimited</span> <span data-start="1839.56"

as their own component and so we're</span> <span data-start="1858.79" data-end="1862.45">gonna put that all together down here so</span> <span data-start="1862.45" data-end="1864.04">this was kind of like the old way and</span> <span data-start="1864.04" data-end="1866.02">you you were frustrated you couldn't</span> <span data-start="1866.02" data-end="1872.53">really make it work</span> <span data-start="1872.54" data-end="1875.15">and in the new way what we're adding</span> <span data-start="1875.15" data-end="1878.63">here is we're gonna inject the parent</span> <span data-start="1878.63" data-end="1883.58">for the main the main element into the</span> <span data-start="1883.58" data-end="1885.41">selector that's in our current context</span> <span data-start="1885.41" data-end="1888.74">and so the output we get is basically</span> <span data-start="1888.74" data-end="1891.32">this main gets injected just into the</span> <span data-start="1891.32" data-end="1901.28">middle of the selector yay and then you</span> <span data-start="1901.28" data-end="1902.36">know starting to see how the mixin</span> <span data-start="1902.36" data-end="1905.6">content from sas3 to combined with now</span> <span data-start="1905.6" data-end="1907.46">new selector manipulation it's all</span> <span data-start="1907.46" data-end="1908.929">starting to pay some really awesome</span> <span data-start="1908.929" data-end="1911.419">dividends in terms of what we can do</span> <span data-start="1911.419" data-end="1914.63">here so here's another interesting thing</span> <span data-start="1914.63" data-end="1917.66">for people who love specificity a person</span> <span data-start="1917.66" data-end="1920.69">wrote in to the fast issue tracker</span> <span data-start="1920.69" data-end="1921.98">they're like I really want to do this</span> <span data-start="1921.98" data-end="1924.32">thing where I want to double up my class</span> <span data-start="1924.32" data-end="1926.27">name to add just a little bit of</span> <span data-start="1926.27" data-end="1927.47">specificity I don't want to add</span> <span data-start="1927.47" data-end="1928.85">important that's too much</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1928.85" data-end="1932.799">I just want to dink it up a tad I'm like</span> <span data-start="1932.799" data-end="1937.97">okay we can do that now and so this is a</span> <span data-start="1937.97" data-end="1942.41">really crazy function I wrote that can</span> <span data-start="1942.41" data-end="1944.6">find the last class in a selector so</span> <span data-start="1944.6" data-end="1945.94">this is a function that goes through</span> <span data-start="1945.94" data-end="1950.63">your selector finds the last class this</span> <span data-start="1950.63" data-end="1951.89">is a function I think I'm gonna add to</span> <span data-start="1951.89" data-end="1953.63">sass cuz I have to keep defining it in</span> <span data-start="1953.63" data-end="1956">all these examples it just cuts the list</span> <span data-start="1956" data-end="1958.059">up into pieces</span> <span data-start="1958.059" data-end="1960.62">and then we're gonna define a mixin that</span> <span data-start="1960.62" data-end="1963.37">does that increases the specificity so</span> <span data-start="1963.37" data-end="1965.75">basically this is gonna go it's gonna</span> <span data-start="1965.75" data-end="1967.76">find the last class it's gonna say when</span> <span data-start="1967.76" data-end="1969.77">it finds it I'm gonna double it up and</span> <span data-start="1969.77" data-end="1972.11">then keep going so let me show you how</span> <span data-start="1972.11" data-end="1975.26">this would work so here we have this</span> <span data-start="1975.26" data-end="1978.29">selector increased me please and in the</span> <span data-start="1978.29" data-end="1983.57">output we get please please but if the</span> <span data-start="1983.57" data-end="1988.25">last component is not a class it</span> <span data-start="1988.25" data-end="1990.83">wouldn't be okay to do placate the the</span> <span data-start="1990.83" data-end="1993.83">element itself because it's not an</span> <span data-start="1993.83" data-end="1997.34">element and so instead what we do is we</span> <span data-start="1997.34" data-end="1999.23">still refining the last class there and</span> <span data-start="1999.23" data-end="2001.84">bumping that up so some really cool</span> <span data-start="2001.84" data-end="2004.419">things we can do now in selectors go</span> <span data-start="2004.419" data-end="2005.94">crazy</span> <span data-start="2005.94" data-end="2009.73">what is what no I don't know who does</span> <span data-start="2009.73" data-end="2018.74">this but you can that's the point</span> <span data-start="2018.75" data-end="2021.52">um let's find some really cool things</span> <span data-start="2021.52" data-end="2023.44">that are that make sense and and do that</span> <span data-start="2023.44" data-end="2027.64">more than this maybe so I didn't really</span> <span data-start="2027.64" data-end="2029.05">talk about it but you might have been</span> <span data-start="2029.05" data-end="2031.2">seeing this thing called at root</span> <span data-start="2031.2" data-end="2033.52">floating around so let me just real</span> <span data-start="2033.52" data-end="2035.5">quickly describe kind of why we have to</span> <span data-start="2035.5" data-end="2038.62">do that basically once the ampersand</span> <span data-start="2038.62" data-end="2041.38">goes into SAS script we don't know like</span> <span data-start="2041.38" data-end="2043.87">what are you gonna do with that we we</span> <span data-start="2043.87" data-end="2046.05">kind of knew not to repeat the context</span> <span data-start="2046.05" data-end="2048.34">when you put it in your selector but now</span> <span data-start="2048.34" data-end="2049.48">it's in script it could have gotten</span> <span data-start="2049.48" data-end="2051.4">passed to a mixin maybe it got ignored</span> <span data-start="2051.4" data-end="2054.61">maybe it didn't and so we couldn't find</span> <span data-start="2054.61" data-end="2056.02">the good heuristic so we decided that</span> <span data-start="2056.02" data-end="2058.15">you're gonna have to tell us when you</span> <span data-start="2058.15" data-end="2062.32">want your context to be doubled up so if</span> <span data-start="2062.32" data-end="2067.78">you don't have an app root let me just</span> <span data-start="2067.78" data-end="2078.76">show you what it would happen</span> <span data-start="2078.77" data-end="2084.179">let's keep these you get the context</span> <span data-start="2084.179" data-end="2087.3">over again so at root basically says</span> <span data-start="2087.3" data-end="2089.579">take this selector and place it at the</span> <span data-start="2089.579" data-end="2092.909">root of the document and ignore my</span> <span data-start="2092.909" data-end="2095.399">context but keep my context available in</span> <span data-start="2095.399" data-end="2099.089">terms of the the the parent reference</span> <span data-start="2099.089" data-end="2102.78">and so on now I'm basically controlling</span> <span data-start="2102.78" data-end="2104.849">my context and you can use this to</span> <span data-start="2104.849" data-end="2107.579">completely bounce out of your current</span> <span data-start="2107.579" data-end="2109.32">context you don't have to use the</span> <span data-start="2109.32" data-end="2110.79">selector parent anymore you can just</span> <span data-start="2110.79" data-end="2113.099">decide your deeply nested in something</span> <span data-start="2113.099" data-end="2114.48">and it makes sense for you to like pop</span> <span data-start="2114.48" data-end="2116.7">up to the main level now make a new</span> <span data-start="2116.7" data-end="2118.77">selector at the top level go back down</span> <span data-start="2118.77" data-end="2121.17">so there's some interesting things that</span> <span data-start="2121.17" data-end="2126.51">happen here and we we think that a tree</span> <span data-start="2126.51" data-end="2129.39">will have value beyond just there and</span> <span data-start="2129.39" data-end="2131.79">one way that it's gonna pay dividends</span> <span data-start="2131.79" data-end="2133.98">though this isn't implemented just yet</span> <span data-start="2133.98" data-end="2136.23">is you're going to be able to unscoped</span> <span data-start="2136.23" data-end="2139.74">or self from a media block so I don't</span> <span data-start="2139.74" data-end="2140.79">know if you guys have ever tried to do</span> <span data-start="2140.79" data-end="2142.829">an extend within that media block and</span> <span data-start="2142.829" data-end="2144.329">gotten this little message telling you</span> <span data-start="2144.329" data-end="2147.03">that you were making a sin and you've</span> <span data-start="2147.03" data-end="2150.93">made the SAS gods angry did I just call</span> <span data-start="2150.93" data-end="2156.45">myself a guidance yeah so you can't do</span> <span data-start="2156.45" data-end="2157.74">that it doesn't make sense we don't know</span> <span data-start="2157.74" data-end="2159.15">how to apply extend across your entire</span> <span data-start="2159.15" data-end="2162.81">document for a runtime value so we've</span> <span data-start="2162.81" data-end="2165.599">been slapping people's hands but it fits</span> <span data-start="2165.599" data-end="2167.27">makes sense</span> <span data-start="2167.27" data-end="2171.96">you can now basically pop out of your</span> <span data-start="2171.96" data-end="2174.44">media context do your extend and then</span> <span data-start="2174.44" data-end="2176.43">you'll be right back into your media</span> <span data-start="2176.43" data-end="2178.74">context and so the the syntax for that</span> <span data-start="2178.74" data-end="2187.56">is going to be basically a true like</span> <span data-start="2187.56" data-end="2193.859">without media and then anything that's</span> <span data-start="2193.859" data-end="2195.78">inside there will not get this media</span> <span data-start="2195.78" data-end="2198.21">this will also work if you say all it'll</span> <span data-start="2198.21" data-end="2200.79">like bounce you out of all like runtime</span> <span data-start="2200.79" data-end="2204.42">directives so document supports things</span> <span data-start="2204.42" data-end="2208.56">like that so that's going to work soon</span> <span data-start="2208.56" data-end="2212.7">almost ready so we're changing variable</span> <span data-start="2212.7" data-end="2216.63">scoping I'm gonna say something here can</span> <span data-start="2216.63" data-end="2219.24">we keep it between us so this is</span> <span data-start="2219.24" data-end="2223.65">something less got right they scoped</span> <span data-start="2223.65" data-end="2225.87">variables to their block and if you</span> <span data-start="2225.87" data-end="2227.43">defined a variable that was defined</span> <span data-start="2227.43" data-end="2229.59">elsewhere it didn't change the value</span> <span data-start="2229.59" data-end="2233.19">outside that block and we decided that</span> <span data-start="2233.19" data-end="2234.84">you wanted to change the global value</span> <span data-start="2234.84" data-end="2238.8">and I think that was bad so starting in</span> <span data-start="2238.8" data-end="2241.95">3 3 that were deprecating the ability to</span> <span data-start="2241.95" data-end="2245.46">assign to a global value from within a</span> <span data-start="2245.46" data-end="2249.18">local scope unless you provide this bang</span> <span data-start="2249.18" data-end="2253.74">global modifier at the end of your</span> <span data-start="2253.74" data-end="2258.57">assignment then the deprecation warnings</span> <span data-start="2258.57" data-end="2260.97">will go away in the next release we will</span> <span data-start="2260.97" data-end="2265.94">change this behavior in entirety and</span> <span data-start="2265.94"
