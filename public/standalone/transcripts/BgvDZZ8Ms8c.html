data-end="357.17">decorators go today we're going to talk</span> <span data-start="357.17" data-end="359.27">about web components we're gonna focus</span> <span data-start="359.27" data-end="361.85">on shadow DOM and what happens in a</span> <span data-start="361.85" data-end="363.53">screen reader because that's what I was</span> <span data-start="363.53" data-end="365.78">really curious about and then we'll talk</span> <span data-start="365.78" data-end="368.48">about custom elements and how we need to</span> <span data-start="368.48" data-end="372.68">add some antics to those elements why</span> <span data-start="372.68" data-end="374.72">are we excited I mean you may be you</span> <span data-start="374.72" data-end="376.76">have your own reasons but I'm excited</span> <span data-start="376.76" data-end="378.38">about web components because it's a</span> <span data-start="378.38" data-end="381.44">chance to extend the Dom and we have a</span> <span data-start="381.44" data-end="383.18">lot of power with that that's exciting</span> <span data-start="383.18" data-end="385.25">we aren't waiting for browser</span> <span data-start="385.25" data-end="388.13">implementers to give us new elements</span> <span data-start="388.13" data-end="391.16">like the html5 form inputs there's some</span> <span data-start="391.16" data-end="393.41">really cool stuff there but it takes a</span> <span data-start="393.41" data-end="395.12">long time for those standards to roll</span> <span data-start="395.12" data-end="399.05">out

to</span> <span data-start="403.25" data-end="405.41">make sure they're accessible so I'll</span> <span data-start="405.41" data-end="407.57">tell you about how we can make our</span> <span data-start="407.57" data-end="409.46">elements accessible and what we get for</span> <span data-start="409.46" data-end="412.729">free and then lastly we can minimize</span> <span data-start="412.729" data-end="415.82">conflicts by encapsulating part of our</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="415.82" data-end="420.35">HTML and that's where shadow Dom comes</span> <span data-start="420.35" data-end="420.77">in</span> <span data-start="420.77" data-end="424.759">so shadow DOM is spooky sounding but the</span> <span data-start="424.759" data-end="427.28">idea is that you're encapsulating a dom</span> <span data-start="427.28" data-end="430.4">subtree under a

that</span> <span data-start="436.07" data-end="438.08">you're actually inserting your shadow</span> <span data-start="438.08" data-end="440.9">Dom into if you think about the html5</span> <span data-start="440.9" data-end="443.96">video tag and how you only have to drop</span> <span data-start="443.96" data-end="446.3">in a video tag but along with that comes</span> <span data-start="446.3" data-end="448.31">all of the controls the little volume</span> <span data-start="448.31" data-end="453.139">slider there's a playback slider you</span> <span data-start="453.139" data-end="454.639">don't have to actually implement each of</span> <span data-start="454.639" data-end="456.919">those pieces you get those as part of</span> <span data-start="456.919" data-end="460.19">this component so the shadow host is the</span> <span data-start="460.19" data-end="462.849">video tag that's in your regular Dom a</span> <span data-start="462.849" data-end="466.13">shadow tree is the node tree that gets</span> <span data-start="466.13" data-end="468.139">inserted into that shadow Dom so all of</span> <span data-start="468.139" data-end="470.12">those parts in the video tag our shadow</span> <span data-start="470.12" data-end="474.349">tree and then the shadow root is the</span> <span data-start="474.349"

data-end="592.6">screenshot of the WebKit rendering</span> <span data-start="592.6" data-end="595.66">engine flow it's pretty simplified</span> <span data-start="595.66" data-end="597.94">because browsers are actually some of</span> <span data-start="597.94" data-end="600.73">the most complex pieces of software they</span> <span data-start="600.73" data-end="602.86">clean up our messes they fix our broken</span> <span data-start="602.86" data-end="605.65">code they render it anyway</span> <span data-start="605.65" data-end="607.99">it's actually really interesting we give</span> <span data-start="607.99" data-end="610.6">ie a lot of trouble but they clean up a</span> <span data-start="610.6" data-end="612.37">lot of really bad HTML and render it</span> <span data-start="612.37" data-end="615.01">anyway we kind of forget that because</span> <span data-start="615.01" data-end="618.55">chrome is really forgiving but what is</span> <span data-start="618.55" data-end="620.35">really interesting to look at here with</span> <span data-start="620.35" data-end="622.6">this rendering flow is that you start</span> <span data-start="622.6" data-end="625.9">off with your HTML and you can see from</span> <span data-start="625.9" data-end="628.63">this diagram it parses your HTML it</span> <span data-start="628.63" data-end="631.39">token eise's it it creates objects out</span> <span data-start="631.39" data-end="633.37">of your tags and those objects have</span> <span data-start="633.37" data-end="635.41">types those types are really important</span> <span data-start="635.41" data-end="638.08">like in the case of a form when a screen</span> <span data-start="638.08" data-end="641.95">reader encounter it changes modes and it</span> <span data-start="641.95" data-end="643.959">gives the user a different set of</span> <span data-start="643.959" data-end="646.12">options for interacting with it so if</span> <span data-start="646.12" data-end="648.25">you just had a bunch of Dom elements or</span> <span data-start="648.25" data-end="651.55">div elements and you wanted it to</span> <span data-start="651.55" data-end="654.73">actually act like a form that's why you</span> <span data-start="654.73" data-end="656.65">know we use input elements is because a</span> <span data-start="656.65" data-end="658.69">screen reader will be told what to do</span> <span data-start="658.69" data-end="665.03">with the element let's see what else so</span> <span data-start="665.03" data-end="667.49">another thing to mention is that the</span> <span data-start="667.49" data-end="670.16">objects in this rendering process are</span> <span data-start="670.16" data-end="673.79">affected by JavaScript and CSS so in the</span> <span data-start="673.79" data-end="676.76">rendering process we affect our Dom tree</span> <span data-start="676.76" data-end="678.92">with JavaScript we can append elements</span> <span data-start="678.92" data-end="681.29">we can hide them with CSS and that</span> <span data-start="681.29" data-end="683.96">affects the actual tree so elements that</span> <span data-start="683.96" data-end="685.88">are hidden with display:none and CSS</span> <span data-start="685.88" data-end="688.22">don't get rendered and therefore they</span> <span data-start="688.22" data-end="689.99">don't have accessibility objects so</span> <span data-start="689.99" data-end="691.37">they're kept out of a screen reader</span> <span data-start="691.37" data-end="694.28">that's how when you're say for example</span> <span data-start="694.28" data-end="696.35">you had a hover menu and you wanted to</span> <span data-start="696.35" data-end="698.84">keep all of the content when it's closed</span> <span data-start="698.84" data-end="700.67">from actually getting read in a screen</span> <span data-start="700.67" data-end="702.77">reader because if you can't see it with</span> <span data-start="702.77" data-end="704.75">your eyes you shouldn't force a screen</span> <span data-start="704.75" data-end="707">reader or a keyword through it so to</span> <span data-start="707" data-end="708.83">hide that from a screen reader we hit</span> <span data-start="708.83" data-end="711.11">just or we add display:none and the</span> <span data-start="711.11" data-end="712.85">effect that that has is that it doesn't</span> <span data-start="712.85" data-end="715.31">paint it and it doesn't add an object to</span> <span data-start="715.31" data-end="717.68">the accessibility tree so all of these</span> <span data-start="717.68" data-end="719.69">things the CSS and JavaScript they</span> <span data-start="719.69" data-end="722.39">affect this rendering process and what</span> <span data-start="722.39" data-end="726.65">you get in the end is a tree why is this</span> <span data-start="726.65" data-end="729.92">accessible for shadow Dom it's</span> <span data-start="729.92" data-end="732.77">accessible because it the screen reader</span> <span data-start="732.77" data-end="735.05">encounters the tree after rendering and</span> <span data-start="735.05" data-end="737.39">what they call it as rendered and I have</span> <span data-start="737.39" data-end="740.15">a funny you know pun here with Bob Roth</span> <span data-start="740.15" data-end="742.31">saying let's paint a happy little tree</span> <span data-start="742.31" data-end="744.44">because that's what a screen reader gets</span> <span data-start="744.44" data-end="746.93">it gets the tree as rendered and so</span> <span data-start="746.93" data-end="748.76">therefore the shadow Dom is actually</span> <span data-start="748.76" data-end="751.07">accessible which is a huge win super</span> <span data-start="751.07" data-end="753.02">exciting I didn't have to go beat up any</span> <span data-start="753.02" data-end="755.99">browser implementers because these specs</span> <span data-start="755.99" data-end="758.15">are developing and evolving and I</span> <span data-start="758.15" data-end="760.07">thought if there was a problem it we</span> <span data-start="760.07" data-end="762.89">could go
