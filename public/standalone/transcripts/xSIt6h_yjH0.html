<p><span data-start="401.139" data-end="404.97">In web versus native revelopers is 68%.</span> <span data-start="404.97" data-end="410.699">I'm getting the statistics from Github.</span> <span data-start="410.699" data-end="412.849">And I realise it is not exact numbers.</span> <span data-start="412.849" data-end="414.87">Some web apps are in Java.</span> <span data-start="414.87" data-end="418.34">And some are in Python.</span> <span data-start="418.34" data-end="422.569">The difference is why I'm saying it is a webapp.</span> <span data-start="422.569" data-end="426.629">Not using a native.</span> <span data-start="426.629" data-end="430.699">Like QT or something else.</span> <span data-start="430.699" data-end="435.85">There is a lot of deployment options.</span> <span data-start="435.85" data-end="440.62">deploy to your local computer or the server.</span> <span data-start="440.62" data-end="442.75">And access it over the network.</span> <span data-start="442.75" data-end="447.509">As long is it is securely zozer You get a ton of benefits.</span> <span data-start="447.509" data-end="453.569">Your interface can respond and adapt to whatever device.</span> <span data-start="453.569" data-end="455.56">As developers of that.</span> <span data-start="455.56" data-end="458.15">One real interface logic.</span> </p>
