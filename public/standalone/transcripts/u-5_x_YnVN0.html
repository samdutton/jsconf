should be equality about this so</span> <span data-start="217.359" data-end="220.03">far when we think of accessibility how</span> <span data-start="220.03" data-end="221.709">many different kinds of accessibility</span> <span data-start="221.709" data-end="226.05">can we think of physical</span> <span data-start="226.06" data-end="232.01">like when people who cannot walk they</span> <span data-start="232.01" data-end="235.939">need wheelchairs right so this is a form</span> <span data-start="235.939" data-end="237.98">of accessibility that they should have</span> <span data-start="237.98" data-end="240.11">they should be able to go anywhere they</span> <span data-start="240.11" data-end="242.18">should have wheelchair ramps they should</span> <span data-start="242.18" data-end="243.64">have buses that are able to pick them up</span> <span data-start="243.64" data-end="246.319">similarly we have accessibility when it</span> <span data-start="246.319" data-end="248.269">comes to web as well people who cannot</span> <span data-start="248.269" data-end="250.189">see or cannot hear should be able to use</span> <span

data-end="258.229">so that's web accessibility related to</span> <span data-start="258.229" data-end="263.03">web services products and apps web</span> <span data-start="263.03" data-end="264.38">accessibility is governed by a set of</span> <span data-start="264.38" data-end="267.289">features and guidelines that help design</span> <span data-start="267.289"

data-end="273.949">include screen reader support photo</span> <span data-start="273.949" data-end="277.31">captioning and keyboard usability let's</span> <span data-start="277.31" data-end="279.74">look at a few terms that are associated</span> <span data-start="279.74" data-end="284.449">with web accessibility a11y it is</span> <span data-start="284.449" data-end="287.09">pronounced like this a 1:1 by or a 11 by</span> <span data-start="287.09" data-end="289.46">although since I'm a terrible punster I</span> <span data-start="289.46" data-end="292.46">decided to name my talk how to be an</span> <span data-start="292.46" data-end="294.56">ally I like doing that I like hitting</span> <span data-start="294.56" data-end="298">people with puns sometimes all the time</span> <span data-start="298" data-end="301.88">then we have Bach AG WCAG that's web</span> <span data-start="301.88" data-end="304.49">content accessibility guidelines these</span> <span data-start="304.49" data-end="307.51">are the rules set for how we should</span> <span data-start="307.51" data-end="311.51">develop any application so that it is</span> <span data-start="311.51" data-end="313.94">accessible to everyone the third thing</span> <span data-start="313.94" data-end="315.47">that we need to look out for is aria</span> <span data-start="315.47" data-end="317.24">it's accessible rich Internet</span> <span data-start="317.24" data-end="319.58">applications these are features baked</span> <span data-start="319.58" data-end="322.729">into HTML that enable any app to be</span> <span data-start="322.729" data-end="324.88">accessible to people</span> <span data-start="324.88" data-end="329.18">stats 15% of the population has some</span> <span data-start="329.18" data-end="331.43">form of disability if we take a look at</span> <span data-start="331.43" data-end="333.62">it and cold hard numbers that's almost 1</span> <span data-start="333.62" data-end="336.86">billion people that that's how many 15%</span> <span data-start="336.86" data-end="341.03">is now 8% of the population is also</span> <span data-start="341.03" data-end="343.58">color blind just trying to think about</span> <span data-start="343.58" data-end="347.539">all of these numbers if you try to think</span> <span data-start="347.539" data-end="350.69">of exactly how many people are we</span> <span data-start="350.69" data-end="352.49">excluding if we are not making sure that</span> <span data-start="352.49" data-end="356.229">our app is accessible that's 1 billion</span> <span data-start="356.229" data-end="359.3">15% of the population and out of</span> <span data-start="359.3" data-end="364.22">8% being colorblind the monitor is off</span> <span data-start="364.22" data-end="367.46">again if we are excluding 15% of our</span> <span data-start="367.46" data-end="370.069">users then we are failing at our jobs as</span> <span data-start="370.069" data-end="372.229">developers I'm sure some of us have</span> <span data-start="372.229" data-end="376.039">heard this before accessibility is not a</span> <span data-start="376.039" data-end="380.69">feature it is a necessity if by design</span> <span data-start="380.69" data-end="384.08">we are excluding a vast number of our</span> <span data-start="384.08" data-end="386.03">users then we are actively</span> <span data-start="386.03" data-end="388.34">discriminating against them and this is</span> <span data-start="388.34" data-end="390.319">wrong this is unfair it should not</span> <span data-start="390.319" data-end="394.099">happen therefore if we are excluding</span> <span data-start="394.099" data-end="396.08">these many uses we are failing our jobs</span> <span data-start="396.08" data-end="398.919">and this should not happen I'm trying to</span> <span data-start="398.919" data-end="402.05">work on that myself I did not know</span> <span data-start="402.05" data-end="405.469">excessive about accessibility for a long</span> <span data-start="405.469" data-end="409.129">time but now I'm trying to learn so this</span> <span data-start="409.129" data-end="412.759">is what I'm here for today accessibility</span> <span data-start="412.759" data-end="414.5">will ensure that our app is usable by</span> <span data-start="414.5" data-end="416.84">persons with disabilities today's talk</span> <span data-start="416.84" data-end="419.479">is mainly going to focus on screen</span> <span data-start="419.479" data-end="421.759">readers and color blindness not so much</span> <span data-start="421.759" data-end="425.15">about people who are deaf unfortunately</span> <span data-start="425.15" data-end="426.469">we don't have enough time for that but</span> <span data-start="426.469" data-end="430.25">let's see so what kind of issues occur</span> <span data-start="430.25" data-end="433.4">when we are using J's frameworks like</span> <span data-start="433.4" data-end="435.25">frameworks like react they typically use</span> <span data-start="435.25" data-end="440.029">syntactic sugar to create apps syntactic</span> <span data-start="440.029" data-end="442.849">sugars are syntactic sugar means that</span> <span data-start="442.849" data-end="445.46">they are not pure HTML due to this</span> <span data-start="445.46" data-end="446.96">developers sometime end up writing</span> <span data-start="446.96" data-end="450.529">non-semantic HTML now tools like screen</span> <span data-start="450.529" data-end="452.629">readers are not able to parse</span> <span data-start="452.629" data-end="456.289">non semantic content meaningfully what</span> <span data-start="456.289" data-end="458.9">does this mean this means that people</span> <span data-start="458.9" data-end="460.849">who are disabled who are using those</span> <span data-start="460.849" data-end="463.4">screen readers to understand the content</span> <span data-start="463.4" data-end="465.289">on your web page they are not able to</span> <span data-start="465.289" data-end="466.909">get any meaning out of it they are not</span> <span data-start="466.909" data-end="469.49">able to use it your app has become</span> <span data-start="469.49" data-end="472.43">inaccessible let's take a look at how</span> <span data-start="472.43" data-end="473.84">this happens this is something that I'm</span> <span data-start="473.84" data-end="475.46">sure a lot of us are guilty of I know I</span> <span data-start="475.46" data-end="479.599">am 10 times over this piece of code is</span> <span data-start="479.599" data-end="481.94">supposed to be a button made out of a</span> <span data-start="481.94" data-end="486.65">div how many of us have done this quite</span> <span data-start="486.65" data-end="489.74">quite a few of us right so what happens</span> <span data-start="489.74" data-end="491.87">is that when a screen reader encounters</span> <span data-start="491.87" data-end="492.23">this</span> <span data-start="492.23" data-end="495.32">for code it fails to read it out loud as</span> <span data-start="495.32" data-end="496.97">a button because it doesn't understand</span> <span data-start="496.97" data-end="499.36">that it's a button it sees a div and</span> <span data-start="499.36" data-end="501.65">something inside it that's it that's all</span> <span data-start="501.65" data-end="504.08">it sees this way the user is not aware</span> <span data-start="504.08" data-end="507.47">that what they are trying to look at is</span> <span data-start="507.47" data-end="511.1">actually a button so if we try to look</span> <span data-start="511.1" data-end="513.44">at it this way you could say the verdict</span> <span data-start="513.44" data-end="516.46">is that because of JavaScript frameworks</span> <span data-start="516.46" data-end="518.27">these frameworks are killing</span> <span data-start="518.27" data-end="520.94">accessibility but it doesn't have to be</span> <span data-start="520.94" data-end="525.26">like this let's take a pause on that</span> <span data-start="525.26" data-end="527.93">thought and think about how react works</span> <span data-start="527.93" data-end="530.74">react works with dome and virtual dome</span> <span data-start="530.74" data-end="533">changes whatever changes we want to</span> <span data-start="533" data-end="535.13">happen in the app they occur in the</span> <span data-start="535.13" data-end="537.35">virtual dome and the reactor econ Seiler</span> <span data-start="537.35" data-end="538.79">compares the difference between what is</span> <span data-start="538.79" data-end="541.46">already there on the screen and what the</span> <span data-start="541.46" data-end="543.38">changes are supposed to be and updates</span> <span data-start="543.38" data-end="546.58">those differences on the actual dome</span> <span data-start="546.58" data-end="550.37">this is an example of react JSX it looks</span> <span data-start="550.37" data-end="553.28">like HTML but it's not HTML it has a</span> <span data-start="553.28" data-end="555.35">label but then it has certain attributes</span> <span data-start="555.35" data-end="557.69">that are written in camelcase you can</span> <span data-start="557.69" data-end="561.23">pass values to it so this is this looks</span> <span data-start="561.23" data-end="565.34">like HTML might be react GSX is then</span> <span data-start="565.34" data-end="568.01">converted into pure HTML and rendered in</span> <span data-start="568.01" data-end="572.21">the dome just like that so if we try to</span> <span data-start="572.21"
