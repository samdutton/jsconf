<p><span data-start="7.44" data-end="10.94">Good morning everyone, my name is Ali Tabibzadeh from Iran.</span> <span data-start="10.95" data-end="13.65">I'm currently living in Tehran.</span> <span data-start="13.65" data-end="17.74">It is an honor to be among you here virtually.</span> <span data-start="17.74" data-end="25.199">Today I want to share with you a very enlightening journey I had in learning what community and</span> <span data-start="25.199" data-end="28.3">inclusiveness are all about.</span> <span data-start="28.3" data-end="34.02">This journey is by attending this very same conference back in 2014.</span> <span data-start="34.02" data-end="39.57">The time that these concepts didn't really mean anything in my country.</span> <span data-start="39.57" data-end="46.69">And as you can see, I've kept this T shirt which I love very much.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="46.69" data-end="54.26">To give a very brief introduction about myself, I started my career in tech from design.</span> <span data-start="54.26" data-end="57.08">Then doing frontend development for years.</span> <span data-start="57.08" data-end="62.66">But now I have shifted towards the business side of technology.</span> <span data-start="62.66" data-end="70.91">I've had the privilege to experience a lot by curating three tech related ventures with</span> <span data-start="70.91" data-end="73.25">my friends over the past decade.</span> <span data-start="73.25" data-end="79.44">Currently alongside my capable partners and colleagues, I run a little sort of focused</span> <span data-start="79.44" data-end="85.67">on digital transformation products in travel and single finance.</span> <span data-start="85.67" data-end="92.47">The goals I want to achieve from this talk is to give a new point of view on community</span> <span data-start="92.47" data-end="98.21">values from a perspective that has not experienced it before.</span> <span data-start="98.21" data-end="104.82">What valuable impacts and different profits the communities generate within themselves</span> <span data-start="104.82" data-end="108.26">and on their outer ecosystem.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="108.26" data-end="116.26">And most important of all, the openness of technology related communities that makes</span> <span data-start="116.26" data-end="118.57">them for other sectors.</span> <span data-start="118.57" data-end="128.869">It makes us appreciate the efforts more and even do as little as we can for the communities</span> <span data-start="128.869" data-end="130.319">we are in.</span> <span data-start="130.319" data-end="136.9">And one interesting point, if it wasn't for community, this presentation wouldn't be possible</span> <span data-start="136.9" data-end="143.62">as my good friends provided me with a camera, a microphone, and, of course, above all, the</span> <span data-start="143.62" data-end="144.62">support.</span> <span data-start="144.62" data-end="148.24">I will approach this from two sides of the argument.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="148.24" data-end="158.06">First, how I learned about community building for the first time in Berlin four years ago.</span> <span data-start="158.06" data-end="165.569">Important that JSConf EU had taught me and how I witnessed and helped in partially developing</span> <span data-start="165.569" data-end="167.41">communities in my county.</span> <span data-start="167.41" data-end="175.51">Second, with two real life examples I want to proudly say that the synergism and volunteer</span> <span data-start="175.51" data-end="182.27">work in tech related communities should inspire other sectors to take community building more</span> <span data-start="182.27" data-end="186.86">seriously in order to evolve to a more vibrant ecosystem.</span> <span data-start="186.86" data-end="190.86">So, where did this all start?</span> <span data-start="190.86" data-end="195.59">I used to watch JSConf videos for education purposes on YouTube.</span> <span data-start="195.59" data-end="201.21">And once I said so myself, I wish we had something similar in our country.</span> <span data-start="201.21" data-end="207.52">I visited their website and read online that they are open to let us do so.</span> <span data-start="207.52" data-end="212.89">Then, maybe we should run a JSConf in Iran.</span> <span data-start="212.89" data-end="220.79">Unfortunately, back then, and still now, we do not have safe and easy access to international</span> <span data-start="220.79" data-end="221.98">payment methods.</span> <span data-start="221.98" data-end="228.239">And then telling the curator team about it, they surprised me by inviting me to the event.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="228.239" data-end="231.97">They're so loving,aren't they?</span> <span data-start="231.97" data-end="236.349">Attending JSConf EU 2014 is where this journey began.</span> <span data-start="236.349" data-end="243.28">Where I learned how volunteer work benefits everyone in all important aspects of life</span> <span data-start="243.28" data-end="244.64">and business.</span> <span data-start="244.64" data-end="254.35">Because, believe me, if you are not familiar with it, this may look or sound a bit weird.</span> <span data-start="254.35" data-end="258.359">Some words were really bold in the JSConf sphere.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="258.359" data-end="260.689">Which I didn't understand.</span> <span data-start="260.689" data-end="261.979">First was inclusiveness.</span> <span data-start="261.979" data-end="265.129">And I was like, what does it mean?</span> <span data-start="265.129" data-end="268.159">What is inclusiveness?</span> <span data-start="268.159" data-end="272.18">I had only heard about exclusiveness in my country.</span> <span data-start="272.18" data-end="279.319">It was as if everyone was trying so hard to get an exclusive privilege to get ahead.</span> <span data-start="279.319" data-end="285.96">Even most prominent companies and products advertisements showed big, exclusive words</span> <span data-start="285.96" data-end="287.37">attached to them.</span> <span data-start="287.37" data-end="290.719">So, you can see my perspective.</span> <span data-start="290.719" data-end="296.839">Other words that confused me were labor of love and not for profit.</span> <span data-start="296.839" data-end="301.979">I was wondering why someone would run this huge event not for getting direct profit.</span> <span data-start="301.979" data-end="306.8">Because, honestly, it was the other way around in my country.</span> <span data-start="306.8" data-end="313.84">The curators taught me a great deal about their experience curating and running this</span> <span data-start="313.84" data-end="315.169">conference.</span> <span data-start="315.169" data-end="321.289">Explaining the experience and principles of JSConf community and how they would use the</span> <span data-start="321.289" data-end="327.169">sponsors' support to upgrade the conference quality and in all these matters.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="327.169" data-end="331.59">Meanwhile, I was experiencing the conference myself.</span> <span data-start="331.59" data-end="338.039">Meeting wonderful people, exchangeideas, talking about collaboration opportunities</span> <span data-start="338.039" data-end="344.99">and receiving valuable insights and offers from world leading sponsors and many more</span> <span data-start="344.99" data-end="346.69">fulfilling moments.</span> <span data-start="346.69" data-end="350.169">It was starting to make sense.</span> <span data-start="350.169" data-end="352.689">The pieces of the puzzle were coming together.</span> <span data-start="352.689" data-end="355.66">And the last piece was this sentence.</span> <span data-start="355.66" data-end="358.699">It is not just a conference, but a community.</span> <span data-start="358.699" data-end="363.05">You should first build the community, then the conference would mean something.</span> <span data-start="363.05" data-end="369.83">I still remember very vividly the friendly and productive talk I had with Christine that</span> <span data-start="369.83" data-end="378.02">when she was telling me about her experience in creating a running the up front meetup</span> <span data-start="378.02" data-end="382.879">community with her co organizers and the CSSConf.</span> <span data-start="382.879" data-end="386.9">As you may have noticed, I also missed this year.</span> <span data-start="386.9" data-end="392.68">So, I came back very pumped with a crystal clear vision.</span> <span data-start="392.68" data-end="397.619">I gathered a couple of people who I thought would be interested and they were in.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="397.619" data-end="403.809">Back then the Iranian system was at its infancy, the startups, just starting to build one with</span> <span data-start="403.809" data-end="405.869">baby steps.</span> <span data-start="405.869" data-end="412.08">First the Iranian sort of accelerator was founded six months after my return.</span> <span data-start="412.08" data-end="418.93">So, back then we had to approach more to additional entities and venues.</span> <span data-start="418.93" data-end="425.34">Unfortunately, we didn't find much luck and we got some empty promises that were never</span> <span data-start="425.34" data-end="426.34">fulfilled.</span> <span data-start="426.34" data-end="432.03">There was only one tech meetup back then.</span> <span data-start="432.03" data-end="438.669">The Linux user group, which were mostly hosted in software companies.</span> <span data-start="438.669" data-end="444.24">I attended a session right after coming back to Tehran for the first time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="444.24" data-end="447.069">It was quite a lovely community.</span> <span data-start="447.069" data-end="449.419">They had their own benefits and own challenges.</span> <span data-start="449.419" data-end="454.139">But more importantly, a bit far from the web community.</span> <span data-start="454.139" data-end="461.86">So, there was no room for the specific topic of JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="461.86" data-end="467.199">We continued attracting support, explaining the vision and talking about the community</span> <span data-start="467.199" data-end="474.02">which will have the comprehensive conference with the JSConf.</span> <span data-start="474.02" data-end="479.229">We got some interesting answers in return.</span> <span data-start="479.229" data-end="484.429">They were like not for profit conference?</span> <span data-start="484.429" data-end="487.509">What are you talking about?</span> <span data-start="487.509" data-end="495.919">And sometimes they didn't have an answer to that thought.</span> <span data-start="495.919" data-end="505.679">It was our passion, but [audio breaking up] the timing is not right.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="505.679" data-end="509.229">Maybe we should try later in the future.</span> <span data-start="509.229" data-end="516.729">During this time, I was working on my second startup to figure out what to do next.</span> <span data-start="516.729" data-end="522.75">And this they urged me to get back to business.</span> <span data-start="522.75" data-end="524.72">The time passed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="524.72" data-end="529.83">In one and a half years, the Iranian ecosystem grew significantly.</span> <span data-start="529.83" data-end="536.6">Suddenly you would see a number of businesses, accelerators and community events were starting</span> <span data-start="536.6" data-end="539.43">to pop up here and there.</span> <span data-start="539.43" data-end="545.19">When I was so caught up building our new business, I was thrilled to hear that my friends were</span> <span data-start="545.19" data-end="551.91">finally able to do that and curated a community for Tehran called Tehran JS.</span> <span data-start="551.91" data-end="557.09">This wonderful meetup by these three people that you see their pictures.</span> <span data-start="557.09" data-end="564.16">Tehran JS meetup has been held averagely every two weeks since early 2016.</span> <span data-start="564.16" data-end="570.16">It has now almost 1,000 members and new members joining every day.</span> <span data-start="570.16" data-end="575.86">I was glad to see they had the right principles and a lot of good work was being done in this</span> <span data-start="575.86" data-end="576.86">community.</span> <span data-start="576.86" data-end="579.86">And you saw a few pictures of them.</span> <span data-start="579.86" data-end="584.09">This is where the second side of the argument will begin to conclude.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="584.09" data-end="590.08">As we were new in tourism and pursuing niche markets that no one had entered before, we</span> <span data-start="590.08" data-end="595.39">thought that maybe it's best if we created a community for the travel industry to make</span> <span data-start="595.39" data-end="598.44">a positive impact.</span> <span data-start="598.44" data-end="602.61">We wanted to apply the community building principles and create an inclusive platform</span> <span data-start="602.61" data-end="604.62">for everyone to benefit from.</span> <span data-start="604.62" data-end="608.61">So, we started tourism up in August 2016.</span> <span data-start="608.61" data-end="614.01">Here you can see a few pictures of our events.</span> <span data-start="614.01" data-end="617.47">This event was held on a monthly basis.</span> <span data-start="617.47" data-end="623.85">And over the six months we had the pleasure to host more than 300 participants in two</span> <span data-start="623.85" data-end="627.59">chapters in Tehran.</span> <span data-start="627.59" data-end="637">Now, I want to do an honest comparison between these two community building endeavors and</span> <span data-start="637" data-end="640.5">sharing with you what happened to them and why.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="640.5" data-end="643.73">Tehran JS was thriving.</span> <span data-start="643.73" data-end="648.16">It was fulfilling every aspect that the community promises.</span> <span data-start="648.16" data-end="653.32">When I contacted my friends in the organizing team to talk about joining forces for running</span> <span data-start="653.32" data-end="656.89">JSConf together, they were open to any forms of collaboration.</span> <span data-start="656.89" data-end="658.76">So, this is very beautiful.</span> <span data-start="658.76" data-end="661.45">This is where we talk about openness and inclusiveness.</span> <span data-start="661.45" data-end="667.191">In the community side, it was exhilarating to see how people were submitting talks, to</span> <span data-start="667.191" data-end="674.06">volunteer in running the event, offering each other projects and companies were finding</span> <span data-start="674.06" data-end="675.85">talents to hire.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="675.85" data-end="677.58">Benefits for all.</span> <span data-start="677.58" data-end="682.43">This is, indeed, where it is worth the effort to curate the community.</span> <span data-start="682.43" data-end="688.19">On the other hand, despite putting tremendous efforts and resources into this, we couldn't</span> <span data-start="688.19" data-end="690.56">achieve the same thing in tourism app.</span> <span data-start="690.56" data-end="693.12">Where the technology mind set was involved.</span> <span data-start="693.12" data-end="697.06">After a few events, we had to try so hard to find speakers.</span> <span data-start="697.06" data-end="704.11">When creating task forces for joint community projects, people would volunteer, but unfortunately,</span> <span data-start="704.11" data-end="705.36">not deliver.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="705.36" data-end="707.61">We do not blame them at all.</span> <span data-start="707.61" data-end="710.36">We have to accept these as facts.</span> <span data-start="710.36" data-end="717.34">Because, despite Iran's potential in tourism, the industry is not yet advanced.</span> <span data-start="717.34" data-end="721.54">And it is suffering from traditional ways of doing business.</span> <span data-start="721.54" data-end="727.7">People were so occupied with their daily hustle and so under the impression of inclusiveness</span> <span data-start="727.7" data-end="733.54">in projects that they were unable to see the benefits in community.</span> <span data-start="733.54" data-end="737.4">We accepted this failure after six months.</span> <span data-start="737.4" data-end="744.88">And we thought maybe it's best to temporarily shut it down so the industry can evolve and</span> <span data-start="744.88" data-end="747.09">then we can come back.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="747.09" data-end="753.56">When no one could benefit from this community, it was no longer good to waste everyone's</span> <span data-start="753.56" data-end="756.84">resources and time on this.</span> <span data-start="756.84" data-end="765.93">As we went through a comparison between success and failure stories, I think this is the only</span> <span data-start="765.93" data-end="769.19">sentence we can get as the conclusion.</span> <span data-start="769.19" data-end="772.42">Proactive participation by all is key.</span> <span data-start="772.42" data-end="775.87">And technology is built by the very same spirit.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="775.87" data-end="782.98">That is why there is less burden in applying this in technology communities.</span> <span data-start="782.98" data-end="785.43">No single entity can run a community.</span> <span data-start="785.43" data-end="789.12">A community is formed by effort of the many.</span> <span data-start="789.12" data-end="793.75">Last year Whitney Williams said in her speech that leadership in communities are by the</span> <span data-start="793.75" data-end="795.99">many, to the by the few.</span> <span data-start="795.99" data-end="798.51">So true, isn't it?</span> <span data-start="798.51" data-end="804.91">I am proud to say that the JavaScript community is thriving in Iran by many people's contribution.</span> <span data-start="804.91" data-end="809.09">And we are starting to find forward thinking sponsors.</span> <span data-start="809.09" data-end="815.74">We hope to hold the JSConf Iran conference in the next year with the help of its international</span> <span data-start="815.74" data-end="816.74">family.</span> <span data-start="816.74" data-end="822.19">And we strongly hope we can see you here in Tehran someday soon.</span> <span data-start="822.19" data-end="827.45">To wrap this up, we all know that the small actions create big impacts.</span> <span data-start="827.45" data-end="829">This might take time.</span> <span data-start="829" data-end="833.56">So, does every sustainable and long lasting result.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="833.56" data-end="838.44">Our small actions and giving back to the society creates social capital.</span> <span data-start="838.44" data-end="843.7">A meaningful concept that can help us in every aspect of our lives.</span> <span data-start="843.7" data-end="850.28">I believe I am talking in a place that everyone knows and appreciates the values of this.</span> <span data-start="850.28" data-end="855.779">But it is worth sharing this side of the story for more encouragement.</span> <span data-start="855.779" data-end="861.23">This feedback, I believe, are what drives us to be active community players.</span> <span data-start="861.23" data-end="868.54">We all have learned a lot and given back to the open source community.</span> <span data-start="868.54" data-end="874.29">But I think there is more to OSS than open source software.</span> <span data-start="874.29" data-end="877.91">Let's think of it as the open source spirit.</span> <span data-start="877.91" data-end="881.92">This is why we should be proud of ourselves that we are community builders.</span> <span data-start="881.92" data-end="883.779">Not lobbyists.</span> <span data-start="883.779" data-end="890.93">Thank you, everyone, and I hope to reunite with you very soon whether in Iran or at any</span> </p>
