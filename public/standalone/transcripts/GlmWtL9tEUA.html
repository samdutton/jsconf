other</span> <span data-start="171.91" data-end="176.41">applications so this is kind of what's</span> <span data-start="176.41" data-end="178.03">going to be important is to understand</span> <span data-start="178.03" data-end="179.38">the decisions that we've made is to</span> <span data-start="179.38" data-end="180.88">understand the organizational structure</span> <span data-start="180.88" data-end="182.8">so for us our org kind of looks like</span> <span data-start="182.8" data-end="185.17">this we have many different web apps</span> <span data-start="185.17" data-end="187.3">that are all standardized on react and</span> <span data-start="187.3" data-end="190">redux and there's a lot of different</span> <span data-start="190" data-end="192.12">teams and they're basically independent</span> <span data-start="192.12" data-end="195.1">we have to or in the past we've had two</span> <span data-start="195.1" data-end="197.38">mobile developers a native iOS developer</span> <span data-start="197.38" data-end="199.62">and a native Android developer and they</span> <span data-start="199.62" data-end="201.76">try to keep up you can see they're very</span> <span data-start="201.76" data-end="204.61">worried about keeping up with features</span> <span data-start="204.61" data-end="206.53">that are being deployed on the web apps</span> <span data-start="206.53" data-end="209.5">and so what we've done is added a few</span> <span data-start="209.5" data-end="212.14">people like myself who are comfortable</span> <span data-start="212.14" data-end="214.72">with JavaScript also mildly comfortable</span> <span data-start="214.72" data-end="217.45">with doing native stuff and also told</span> <span data-start="217.45" data-end="219.64">the native developers they will be</span> <span data-start="219.64" data-end="221.17">writing JavaScript which you can see</span> <span data-start="221.17" data-end="225.16">they're super excited about so how does</span> <span data-start="225.16" data-end="229.54">this work here's an example here's the</span> <span data-start="229.54" data-end="231.7">web app we're using react and redux that</span> <span data-start="231.7" data-end="233.68">stuff goes through web pack there's a</span> <span data-start="233.68" data-end="235.36">bundle that gets deployed perfect you</span> <span data-start="235.36" data-end="237.85">guys know that part what we chose to do</span> <span data-start="237.85" data-end="241.84">is I'll go in and drop a rollup config</span> <span data-start="241.84" data-end="243.88">in each of those repos and make a</span> <span data-start="243.88" data-end="245.56">separate bundle that's just the stuff</span> <span data-start="245.56" data-end="247.87">that we want to consume so we'll see</span> <span data-start="247.87" data-end="249.19">what's in that bundle is just your your</span> <span data-start="249.19" data-end="251.77">reducers your actions your selectors and</span> <span data-start="251.77" data-end="253.51">there's an asterisk which we'll talk</span> <span data-start="253.51" data-end="259.359">about later so how to make a bundle it</span> <span data-start="259.359" data-end="262.24">looks something like this you create a</span> <span data-start="262.24" data-end="265.15">new entry point and then just import</span> <span data-start="265.15" data-end="267.85">just the things that you need so here</span> <span data-start="267.85" data-end="269.44">we're importing everything from this</span> <span data-start="269.44" data-end="271.21">widget reducer and we're kind of giving</span> <span data-start="271.21" data-end="272.65">ourselves some kind of standard</span> <span data-start="272.65" data-end="274.18">structure for this package is going to</span> <span data-start="274.18" data-end="275.77">export reducers and actions and</span> <span data-start="275.77" data-end="278.02">selectors you can use whatever</span> <span data-start="278.02" data-end="279.58">format organization works for you this</span> <span data-start="279.58" data-end="284.229">is just what we do and you will not want</span> <span data-start="284.229" data-end="286.419">to import everything there's going to be</span> <span data-start="286.419" data-end="287.949">stuff that's web specific like your</span> <span data-start="287.949" data-end="290.55">router reducer if you're doing that</span> <span data-start="290.55" data-end="293.889">things that are web specific that you</span> <span data-start="293.889" data-end="297.46">will not want to import so I want to</span> <span data-start="297.46" data-end="299.53">take a second and talk about why you</span> <span data-start="299.53" data-end="301.96">should bundle or why do that because</span> <span data-start="301.96" data-end="304.539">it's not actually the standard in react</span> <span data-start="304.539" data-end="306.729">native applications to bundle your</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="306.729" data-end="308.56">JavaScript most react native libraries</span> <span data-start="308.56" data-end="312.88">just ship JavaScript source why would</span> <span data-start="312.88" data-end="315.37">you do that that sounds insane it kind</span> <span data-start="315.37" data-end="318.61">of is but the reasons we chose to do a</span> <span data-start="318.61" data-end="320.86">bundle is because hey it provides us a</span> <span data-start="320.86" data-end="323.38">chance to catch things at compile time</span> <span data-start="323.38" data-end="327.19">so these are things like there was one</span> <span data-start="327.19" data-end="329.65">project that had a selector that was</span> <span data-start="329.65" data-end="332.71">returning SPG's based on some state</span> <span data-start="332.71" data-end="334.3">that's obviously not something we can</span> <span data-start="334.3" data-end="336.49">use on mobile so that had to get</span> <span data-start="336.49" data-end="338.83">reflected out into the component and so</span> <span data-start="338.83" data-end="340.449">this you have a chance now to catch</span> <span data-start="340.449" data-end="341.59">things like that that aren't going to</span> <span data-start="341.59" data-end="343.24">work on mobile at compile time</span> <span data-start="343.24" data-end="345.699">the second reason which is really the</span> <span data-start="345.699" data-end="348.88">bigger reason is that a single point of</span> <span data-start="348.88" data-end="352">entry provides you some encapsulation so</span> <span data-start="352" data-end="354.849">that a developer can't just go require</span> <span data-start="354.849" data-end="356.529">into source of your application that you</span> <span data-start="356.529" data-end="357.909">shipped and use something you didn't</span> <span data-start="357.909" data-end="359.889">intend to be used in your mobile</span> <span data-start="359.889" data-end="361.719">application so I think those two things</span> <span data-start="361.719" data-end="365.099">were enough to make that choice for us</span> <span data-start="365.099" data-end="368.169">some of the issues with bundling the ES</span> <span data-start="368.169" data-end="372.009">target is weird but it's not that weird</span> <span data-start="372.009" data-end="375.58">there's react native implements its own</span> <span data-start="375.58" data-end="379.09">version of Babel helpers and so you want</span> <span data-start="379.09" data-end="380.71">to use external helpers it also</span> <span data-start="380.71" data-end="383.139">implements async/await natively and</span> <span data-start="383.139" data-end="385.69">that's because of performance and</span> <span data-start="385.69" data-end="388.96">reasons and so you don't want you want</span> <span data-start="388.96" data-end="390.279">to use external helpers and you don't</span> <span data-start="390.279" data-end="392.71">want to compile async/await</span> <span data-start="392.71" data-end="394.3">and so it's actually really easy to do</span> <span data-start="394.3" data-end="396.699">that if you're using roll-up at least</span> <span data-start="396.699" data-end="398.56">you say I want external helpers this is</span> <span data-start="398.56" data-end="400.449">your babel config and roll up and you</span> <span data-start="400.449" data-end="402.759">say transform syntax async functions so</span> <span data-start="402.759" data-end="403.719">the battle knows what you're talking</span> <span data-start="403.719" data-end="406.509">about but it won't touch it and then you</span> <span data-start="406.509" data-end="407.889">have something that you can consume in</span> <span data-start="407.889" data-end="411.669">your react native application some other</span> <span data-start="411.669" data-end="412.3">gotchas</span> <span data-start="412.3" data-end="414.22">you're obviously if you're not familiar</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="414.22" data-end="416.74">I'll just do a quick review the react</span> <span data-start="416.74" data-end="418.99">native is running in a JavaScript</span> <span data-start="418.99" data-end="422.62">context that does not have any access to</span> <span data-start="422.62" data-end="426.1">Dom api's or any other wave api's that</span> <span data-start="426.1" data-end="427.6">you're normally used to it is a</span> <span data-start="427.6" data-end="428.41">bare-bones</span> <span data-start="428.41" data-end="430.93">like JavaScript interpreter environment</span> <span data-start="430.93" data-end="433.66">so anything in your web code that is</span> <span data-start="433.66" data-end="436.33">referencing window or Dom like if you're</span> <span data-start="436.33" data-end="439.51">doing local storage get item as the</span> <span data-start="439.51" data-end="441.34">default value in your reducer which you</span> <span data-start="441.34" data-end="442.63">shouldn't do but if you're doing that</span> <span data-start="442.63" data-end="446.5">and I've seen that move that out just</span> <span data-start="446.5" data-end="447.79">move that into your components anything</span> <span data-start="447.79" data-end="449.32">that's web specific should probably live</span> <span data-start="449.32" data-end="453.33">in your components anyways so that's my</span> <span data-start="453.33" data-end="455.56">thought there the other part of this</span> <span data-start="455.56" data-end="457.06">which is really sort of the same thing</span> <span data-start="457.06" data-end="460">is if you have some static config so</span> <span data-start="460" data-end="463.66">most web projects can just generate a</span> <span data-start="463.66" data-end="465.25">bundle with some static config and</span> <span data-start="465.25" data-end="468.46">that's going to be the same for each</span> <span data-start="468.46" data-end="469.75">host you just make a different bundle</span> <span data-start="469.75" data-end="471.43">for each host that you deploy to right</span> <span data-start="471.43" data-end="473.83">so you can do all that at compile time</span> <span data-start="473.83" data-end="478.84">and that's easy at on mobile you're</span> <span data-start="478.84" data-end="481.18">probably going to want to hit multiple</span> <span data-start="481.18" data-end="482.26">different environments and switch</span> <span data-start="482.26" data-end="484.33">between them at runtime right you're</span> <span data-start="484.33" data-end="485.56">going to want to have some kind of like</span> <span data-start="485.56" data-end="487.18">dev settings interface where you say</span> <span data-start="487.18" data-end="489.7">okay go look at this other environment</span> <span data-start="489.7" data-end="491.95">or just for the pure effect that you</span> <span data-start="491.95" data-end="495.19">might hit you might be doing like third</span> <span data-start="495.19" data-end="496.9">tier domain stuff where this company is</span> <span data-start="496.9" data-end="498.04">on this domain this company is on that</span> <span data-start="498.04" data-end="499.6">domain and you might need to switch</span> <span data-start="499.6" data-end="502.18">between them and that's now needs to</span> <span data-start="502.18" data-end="503.77">happen at runtime rather than on at</span> <span data-start="503.77" data-end="505.3">compile time so you have to care about</span> <span data-start="505.3" data-end="507.34">that and so the solution for that is</span> <span data-start="507.34" data-end="508.72">really simple you just move it to your</span> <span data-start="508.72" data-end="510.55">components this is one possible solution</span> <span data-start="510.55" data-end="514.9">that we do is to just do the same static</span> <span data-start="514.9" data-end="516.46">config but then dispatch that from your</span> <span data-start="516.46" data-end="518.44">components and move that stuff to state</span> <span data-start="518.44" data-end="521.08">and then in your actions later on you</span> <span data-start="521.08" data-end="522.7">can select that information out of state</span> <span data-start="522.7" data-end="525.7">and it's all in sync and nice there's</span> <span data-start="525.7" data-end="526.66">probably some other ways you can solve</span> <span data-start="526.66" data-end="530.17">that but that's how we did it another</span> <span data-start="530.17" data-end="532.69">thing declaring externals this is not</span> <span data-start="532.69" data-end="535.42">really an issue so much as just a</span> <span data-start="535.42" data-end="536.89">reality so it's something to be aware of</span> <span data-start="536.89" data-end="538.45">and you should probably be aware of this</span> <span data-start="538.45" data-end="542.08">with your web bundles anyways is do you</span> <span data-start="542.08" data-end="543.31">want to declare all of your period</span> <span data-start="543.31"

and you didn't mean to in</span> <span data-start="549.22" data-end="551.35">your bundle and you don't want to do</span> <span data-start="551.35" data-end="553.11">that so just a friendly reminder</span> <span data-start="553.11" data-end="557.47">probably the biggest well this is not</span> <span data-start="557.47" data-end="559.72">really a huge issue at the end of the</span> <span data-start="559.72" data-end="562.24">day you can't use NPM link with the</span> <span data-start="562.24" data-end="563.769">react native packager it just doesn't</span> <span data-start="563.769" data-end="565.18">work so if you were thinking that you</span> <span data-start="565.18" data-end="567.61">could debug creating your entry point</span> <span data-start="567.61" data-end="570.339">file and your bundle and use NPM link to</span> <span data-start="570.339" data-end="572.17">nicely do that while you're consuming it</span> <span data-start="572.17" data-end="574.11">and test it in the consuming application</span> <span data-start="574.11" data-end="576.339">you can't do that and you're gonna end</span> <span data-start="576.339" data-end="577.959">up copying files on the file system</span> <span data-start="577.959" data-end="580.959">that's you'll notice this is issue</span> <span data-start="580.959" data-end="582.73">number one when they moved to Metro</span> <span data-start="582.73" data-end="585.069">bundler it was copied over from the old</span> <span data-start="585.069"

data-end="591.94">sure there's many people who would give</span> <span data-start="591.94" data-end="597.35">you beer ah let's take a break</span> <span data-start="597.36" data-end="600.1">you will

data-start="606.24" data-end="613.6">alright so using the bundle so now we've</span> <span data-start="613.6" data-end="616.3">moved from your web application who's</span> <span data-start="616.3" data-end="617.98">making a bundle and publishing some code</span> <span data-start="617.98" data-end="620.529">to your mobile application that's trying</span> <span data-start="620.529" data-end="623.829">to consume it and so you may have only</span> <span data-start="623.829" data-end="624.939">one application that you're trying to</span> <span data-start="624.939" data-end="626.529">share in our case we were trying to</span> <span data-start="626.529" data-end="628.689">compose multiple web applications down</span> <span data-start="628.689" data-end="630.73">into one mobile application that is</span> <span data-start="630.73" data-end="632.439">trying to implement all of them in one</span> <span data-start="632.439" data-end="636.43">native app and so here you can see we're</span> <span data-start="636.43" data-end="639.699">importing reducers we're aliasing them</span> <span data-start="639.699" data-end="642.13">and we're combining them into one</span> <span data-start="642.13" data-end="643.81">reducer and you notice we export</span> <span data-start="643.81" data-end="646.089">selectors to get at each of those pieces</span> <span data-start="646.089" data-end="648.63">of state which will be important later</span> <span data-start="648.63" data-end="651.67">and then this is what a container would</span> <span data-start="651.67" data-end="653.139">look like basically what you're doing</span> <span data-start="653.139" data-end="655.62">most of your work in the mobile app is</span> <span data-start="655.62" data-end="657.85">wiring up new containers and creating</span> <span data-start="657.85" data-end="661.6">new user interface in components and</span> <span data-start="661.6" data-end="663.579">you're reusing the same actions and</span> <span data-start="663.579" data-end="665.199">selectors that you would use so here</span> <span data-start="665.199" data-end="667.36">we're importing some actions we're</span> <span data-start="667.36" data-end="670.839">importing some selectors and we create a</span> <span data-start="670.839" data-end="672.79">container and this is too much code for</span> <span data-start="672.79" data-end="674.589">one slide I apologize this is the</span> <span data-start="674.589" data-end="677.889">important bit you'll notice here we're</span> <span data-start="677.889" data-end="679.45">using reselect as anyone</span> <span data-start="679.45" data-end="681.13">use reselect how many of you are</span> <span data-start="681.13" data-end="683.98">familiar with reselect have used it okay</span> <span data-start="683.98" data-end="688.18">some hands not a ton of hands basically</span> <span data-start="688.18" data-end="690.04">the important thing to know is that a</span> <span data-start="690.04" data-end="692.65">selector is doing something to get State</span> <span data-start="692.65" data-end="694.57">right it's it's grabbing your state and</span> <span data-start="694.57" data-end="696.16">it's going dot whatever it out whatever</span> <span data-start="696.16" data-end="697.95">that whatever to get you some value out</span> <span data-start="697.95" data-end="700.63">and it does fancier things because</span> <span data-start="700.63" data-end="704.02">performance so what we're doing here you</span> <span data-start="704.02" data-end="706.9">notice we're wrapping our selectors that</span> <span data-start="706.9" data-end="709.72">we imported in a transform to get at the</span> <span data-start="709.72" data-end="712.48">state and that's because we moved State</span> <span data-start="712.48" data-end="714.7">around right those selectors would be</span> <span data-start="714.7" data-end="716.62">looking at the wrong state shape if we</span> <span data-start="716.62" data-end="718.36">didn't do this but this is an easy</span> <span data-start="718.36" data-end="721.42">solution and this that selector that we</span> <span data-start="721.42" data-end="724.48">exported before it can be a simple just</span> <span data-start="724.48" data-end="726.97">property access like it is here and it</span> <span data-start="726.97" data-end="728.86">might actually be more complex and we'll</span> <span data-start="728.86" data-end="732.07">see an example of why later on so great</span> <span data-start="732.07" data-end="736.62">this works we're done thank you bye</span> <span data-start="736.62" data-end="741.19">could this be a trap maybe there's some</span> <span data-start="741.19" data-end="744.85">gotchas so like we were just talking</span> <span data-start="744.85" data-end="748">about how many of you use Redux func to</span> <span data-start="748" data-end="752.1">do your async stuff so a lot of people</span> <span data-start="752.1" data-end="757.26">quick survey redux promise no no means</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="757.26" data-end="761.29">Sagas okay I think you have this problem</span> <span data-start="761.29" data-end="762.82">everywhere if you're changing your state</span> <span data-start="762.82" data-end="764.56">shape this is how we solved it with</span> <span data-start="764.56" data-end="767.89">thunks because we use thunks so the</span> <span data-start="767.89" data-end="769.3">selectors that are in your thunks</span> <span data-start="769.3" data-end="770.56">remember they're in your web app code</span> <span data-start="770.56" data-end="772.84">they depend on the shape of the state</span> <span data-start="772.84" data-end="775">that your web app expected in the first</span> <span data-start="775" data-end="776.92">place when it was written and so it's</span> <span data-start="776.92" data-end="778.9">coupled to that state shape so just an</span> <span data-start="778.9" data-end="780.55">example here let's pretend that load</span> <span data-start="780.55" data-end="782.8">which widgets uses the get page number</span> <span data-start="782.8" data-end="784.81">selector right this is going to blow up</span> <span data-start="784.81" data-end="785.98">when you try to run it in your mobile</span> <span data-start="785.98" data-end="787.87">application if you move that state</span> <span data-start="787.87" data-end="790.45">around like we did so how do you fix</span> <span data-start="790.45" data-end="794.5">this this is a bad name for a thing I'm</span> <span data-start="794.5" data-end="796.48">sorry naming is hard but this is the</span> <span data-start="796.48" data-end="799.44">name that I came up with a func adaptor</span> <span data-start="799.44" data-end="802">basically what it does is it wraps your</span> <span data-start="802" data-end="804.25">thunk it returns you another thunk you</span> <span data-start="804.25" data-end="806.29">give it a transform and it'll make sure</span> <span data-start="806.29" data-end="808.09">that when your thunk calls get state and</span> <span data-start="808.09" data-end="811.15">any it gets the transformed state and</span> <span data-start="811.15" data-end="813.43">not your original station</span> <span data-start="813.43" data-end="814.84">and then it also makes sure that when</span> <span data-start="814.84" data-end="816.43">you dispatch other thunks from that</span> <span data-start="816.43" data-end="818.89">thunk that those also get the transform</span> <span data-start="818.89" data-end="822.79">state and this works this is an example</span> <span data-start="822.79" data-end="825.61">of usage pretend that that create func</span> <span data-start="825.61" data-end="827.59">adapter exists and it does that what I</span> <span data-start="827.59" data-end="830.26">just described so you can it works kind</span> <span data-start="830.26" data-end="832">of like connect where you call it with</span> <span data-start="832" data-end="833.38">the transform it gives you a function</span> <span data-start="833.38" data-end="835.81">that you can then use to wrap your</span> <span data-start="835.81" data-end="838.69">thunks and so that's what that looks</span> <span data-start="838.69" data-end="841.3">like you can just copy this code if you</span> <span data-start="841.3" data-end="843.19">want it's just it's a small function</span> <span data-start="843.19" data-end="846.1">it's not a big deal but that exists okay</span> <span data-start="846.1" data-end="850.42">so if you we we survived that our app</span> <span data-start="850.42" data-end="853.21">can now run it can be compiled consumed</span> <span data-start="853.21" data-end="855.07">and we can actually run and dispatch</span> <span data-start="855.07" data-end="864.07">actions and things work okay so Q he's</span> <span data-start="864.07" data-end="870.37">so fat all right so this next section of</span> <span data-start="870.37" data-end="873.49">things is going to be more less like</span> <span data-start="873.49" data-end="874.9">issues and fixing things because we</span> <span data-start="874.9" data-end="876.94">already got our app working there's</span> <span data-start="876.94" data-end="878.32">going to be situations where either</span> <span data-start="878.32" data-end="880.48">because of design or because of what you</span> <span data-start="880.48" data-end="883.89">want to achieve you're going to want to</span> <span data-start="883.89" data-end="885.97">augment the behavior or enhance the</span> <span data-start="885.97" data-end="887.89">behavior that the web application gave</span> <span data-start="887.89" data-end="889.42">you to do something that's more specific</span> <span data-start="889.42" data-end="891.7">to what you want on mobile and you want</span> <span data-start="891.7" data-end="894.4">to try to do that in as least as little</span> <span data-start="894.4" data-end="897.87">obtrusive not intrusive ly as possible</span> <span data-start="897.87" data-end="900.19">so that these are the there's an example</span> <span data-start="900.19" data-end="904.12">of that so on your web application you</span> <span data-start="904.12" data-end="905.79">might have like a search and filter and</span> <span data-start="905.79" data-end="907.93">those changes are happening live you</span> <span data-start="907.93" data-end="910.18">click the buttons the request has made</span> <span data-start="910.18" data-end="912.79">it you see the results it's all changing</span> <span data-start="912.79" data-end="914.68">live but on mobile your designs maybe</span> <span data-start="914.68" data-end="917.17">have like a cancel apply pattern where</span> <span data-start="917.17" data-end="918.49">you don't want to actually make the</span> <span data-start="918.49" data-end="919.839">request until later and you want to be</span> <span data-start="919.839" data-end="923.55">able to cancel back to some old state</span> <span data-start="923.55" data-end="925.93">that's not functionality that your web</span> <span data-start="925.93" data-end="928.33">app built and you shouldn't necessarily</span> <span data-start="928.33" data-end="930.31">have to refactor your entire web app</span> <span data-start="930.31" data-end="933.76">just to get this on mobile right so how</span> <span data-start="933.76" data-end="937.3">could we do this we can use a</span> <span data-start="937.3" data-end="939.37">higher-order reducer reducer enhancer or</span> <span data-start="939.37" data-end="941.8">whatever word you want to call that this</span> <span data-start="941.8" data-end="945.01">function takes this is imaginary this is</span> <span data-start="945.01" data-end="945.85">something that we've written in our</span> <span data-start="945.85" data-end="946.99">application but here it's</span> <span data-start="946.99" data-end="949.51">imaginary we're passing in a reducer</span> <span data-start="949.51" data-end="951.31">that controls some state that we want to</span> <span data-start="951.31" data-end="953.32">be able to cancel back to and it takes</span> <span data-start="953.32" data-end="956.35">an action type to mark the value of</span> <span data-start="956.35" data-end="958.149">state that you want to potentially go</span> <span data-start="958.149" data-end="960.459">back to so like this would be the action</span> <span data-start="960.459" data-end="961.87">that you fire when you navigate to that</span> <span data-start="961.87" data-end="964.51">modal screen and then it also takes a</span> <span data-start="964.51" data-end="966.52">cancel action which tells it yeah we</span> <span data-start="966.52" data-end="967.99">actually do want to cancel back please</span> <span data-start="967.99" data-end="969.58">restore the state that you marked</span> <span data-start="969.58" data-end="973.089">previously and then your state is going</span> <span data-start="973.089" data-end="975.279">to look like this right here this is it</span> <span data-start="975.279" data-end="976.93">was flow I changed it to typescript</span> <span data-start="976.93" data-end="978.61">because of the NPM talk I guess more</span> <span data-start="978.61" data-end="981.07">people use typescript and flow but</span> <span data-start="981.07" data-end="982.87">that's okay your state's gonna look</span> <span data-start="982.87" data-end="985">something like this right where your</span> <span data-start="985" data-end="986.83">state is now wrapped into properties</span> <span data-start="986.83"
