data-end="776.92">got that semicolon in there how can we</span> <span data-start="776.92" data-end="780.069">get rid of it can anyone tell me how</span> <span data-start="780.069" data-end="781.6">without actually changing what would</span> <span data-start="781.6" data-end="782.649">actually happen with this code how would</span> <span data-start="782.649" data-end="784.929">actually get rid of time going get rid</span> <span data-start="784.929" data-end="797.139">of who all right you're behind Susie is</span> <span data-start="797.139" data-end="799.3">fantastic thank you here's how I did it</span> <span data-start="799.3" data-end="801.939">okay so make that function a declaration</span> <span data-start="801.939" data-end="804.309">cuz declarations don't need and</span> <span data-start="804.309" data-end="806.259">semicolons after them right I didn't</span> <span data-start="806.259" data-end="809.709">know that uh here's one with document</span> <span data-start="809.709" data-end="812.009">open then write hello and then closed</span> <span data-start="812.009" data-end="815.499">okay so now we have well this is</span> <span data-start="815.499" data-end="817.98">actually a comma could be I guess but um</span> <span data-start="817.98" data-end="819.999">all right so we actually can make that</span> <span data-start="819.999" data-end="821.8">shorter but the only reason we could</span> <span data-start="821.8" data-end="822.759">have minified I could make a sort of</span> <span data-start="822.759" data-end="823.959">necessarily the only reason we can make</span> <span data-start="823.959" data-end="825.429">a service because we know how this code</span> <span data-start="825.429" data-end="826.689">works and what we actually do is move</span> <span data-start="826.689" data-end="829.769">close over here and then get rid of that</span> <span data-start="829.769" data-end="831.79">right that's another that's another</span> <span data-start="831.79" data-end="833.98">trick you'll see a lot of eight loops we</span> <span data-start="833.98" data-end="837.009">can totally golf loops down here's some</span> <span data-start="837.009" data-end="839.74">code so what is this cody ok we have</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="839.74" data-end="842.17">Naren we have I equals 0 and 4b</span> <span data-start="842.17" data-end="843.99">envisages the global object in this case</span> <span

data-start="851.559" data-end="852.91">we're gonna put in this right okay but</span> <span data-start="852.91" data-end="855.309">we can actually golf this down and this</span> <span data-start="855.309" data-end="856.72">is again something I learned only after</span> <span data-start="856.72" data-end="857.649">starting these contests we can actually</span> <span data-start="857.649" data-end="860.319">switch these things so actually the</span> <span data-start="860.319" data-end="861.879">thing that's like in like something in</span> <span

data-end="867.009">so this thing we're actually it'll sign</span> <span data-start="867.009" data-end="868.299">it for us which means we don't need that</span> <span data-start="868.299" data-end="870.639">anymore right and as long as you lead</span> <span data-start="870.639" data-end="872.17">that well we don't even need that body</span> <span data-start="872.17" data-end="873.819">anymore he's replace it with semicolon</span> <span data-start="873.819" data-end="875.35">right and we're not done yet cuz the</span> <span data-start="875.35" data-end="876.279">trick we just learned we can actually</span> <span data-start="876.279" data-end="878.049">move that in over right so which Gulf</span> <span data-start="878.049" data-end="880.36">that down I that was four bites through</span> <span data-start="880.36" data-end="883.169">keeping track at home represent</span> <span data-start="883.169" data-end="885.309">you use numbers like this quadrillion</span> <span data-start="885.309" data-end="886.719">well you can actually make that shorter</span> <span data-start="886.719" data-end="888.999">you can golf one character off love that</span> <span data-start="888.999" data-end="892.059">15 0 SI using math.pow but actually four</span> <span data-start="892.059" data-end="893.229">decimal we have a notation for that</span> <span data-start="893.229" data-end="895.119">that's very short so you see that used a</span> <span data-start="895.119" data-end="896.799">lot the decimal notation dennery</span>

data-end="935.139">recursive right we got a tree okay so we</span> <span data-start="935.139" data-end="936.339">can write iterative code we're lucky to</span> <span data-start="936.339" data-end="938.049">get well we have X that's gonna be the</span> <span data-start="938.049" data-end="939.639">next thing we've see which is the first</span> <span data-start="939.639"

data-end="948.189">and we go over and then for something</span> <span data-start="948.189" data-end="949.779">over we go up and then we finally hit</span> <span data-start="949.779" data-end="951.519">the last thing so we're done and so we</span> <span data-start="951.519" data-end="953.139">return the new list okay well we can</span> <span data-start="953.139" data-end="954.819">actually do that by just having a</span> <span data-start="954.819" data-end="956.529">recursive function that says okay well</span> <span data-start="956.529" data-end="958.089">if the node this wasn't there create it</span> <span data-start="958.089" data-end="961.539">and then right basically we're curse ok</span> <span data-start="961.539" data-end="963.939">that's a group is
