<p><span data-start="21.619" data-end="22.63">I'd like to open with a quote.</span> <span data-start="22.63" data-end="28.25">I read a book the other day, about speaking in public, and it said something about opening</span> <span data-start="28.25" data-end="30.74">with a quote.</span> <span data-start="30.74" data-end="33.07">Okay.</span> <span data-start="33.07" data-end="34.07">It wasn't actually a book.</span> <span data-start="34.07" data-end="35.87">It was a web page.</span> <span data-start="35.87" data-end="38.26">It was called..</span> <span data-start="38.26" data-end="43.37">Top ten things you should never do while giving a talk.</span> <span data-start="43.37" data-end="45.34">But I'm going to open with a quote anyway.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="45.34" data-end="48.29">Because this is where it all started.</span> <span data-start="48.29" data-end="56.67">We are about to study the idea of a computational process.</span> <span data-start="56.67" data-end="58.78">Computational processes are abstract beings that</span> <span data-start="58.78" data-end="61.01">inhabit computers.</span> <span data-start="61.01" data-end="65.74">As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things,</span> <span data-start="65.74" data-end="67.6">called data.</span> <span data-start="67.6" data-end="71.05">The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules</span> <span data-start="71.05" data-end="73.11">called a program.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="73.11" data-end="75.759">People create programs to direct processes.</span> <span data-start="75.759" data-end="81.31">In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our</span> <span data-start="81.31" data-end="83">spells.</span> <span data-start="83" data-end="86.009">So when I first read that, two years ago, it was like something</span> <span data-start="86.009" data-end="90.899">that had been misaligned suddenly snapped into place.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="90.899" data-end="96.649">This idea that the code that we write, the artifact that we're creating, and</span> <span data-start="96.649" data-end="101.979">the process that unfurls in the system as that is being evaluated are two</span> <span data-start="101.979" data-end="102.979">separate things.</span> <span data-start="102.979" data-end="104.24">This is so simple.</span> <span data-start="104.24" data-end="106.83">It's such a fundamental idea.</span> <span data-start="106.83" data-end="110.789">But it's so easy to overlook.</span> <span data-start="110.789" data-end="117.069">If our code is directing the evolution of a process, then in</span> <span data-start="117.069" data-end="121.6">many ways it's a lot like the DNA in a cell, directing the evolution of that</span> <span data-start="121.6" data-end="122.6">cell.</span> <span data-start="122.6" data-end="126.32">But DNA is really the most boring part of the cell.</span> <span data-start="126.32" data-end="131.21">It just sits there, curled up into little balls, being read, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="131.21" data-end="135.39">And all around it, there's this fantastic machinery that's involved in</span> <span data-start="135.39" data-end="140.4">finding pieces of the DNA in a massively parallel way and unwrapping it and</span> <span data-start="140.4" data-end="145.48">parsing it and opening it up and copying pieces out of it into RNA, jotting</span> <span data-start="145.48" data-end="151.01">it down, and RNA goes into the rest of the cell and causes effects.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="151.01" data-end="155.41">Some of it gets pulled into ribosomes, which are these amazing molecular machines that</span> <span data-start="155.41" data-end="160.191">kind of ratchet in a little bit of RNA and poop out a little bit of amino acid</span> <span data-start="160.191" data-end="165.069">at the top, and they find the right amino acids to match that sequence of</span> <span data-start="165.069" data-end="170.67">codons in the RNA and then they make this protein, which is like a data structure,</span> <span data-start="170.67" data-end="172.29">that has active sites.</span> <span data-start="172.29" data-end="173.93">It's like an object in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="173.93" data-end="175.55">And it causes effects on other things.</span> <span data-start="175.55" data-end="177.75">And we can keep pushing this biological metaphor.</span> <span data-start="177.75" data-end="183.549">But the point is that there's a party going on in there, and we weren't invited.</span> <span data-start="183.549" data-end="188.7">I want to go to that party.</span> <span data-start="188.7" data-end="192.28">So this talk is a series of three steps.</span> <span data-start="192.28" data-end="195.359">Of me trying to find a path.</span> <span data-start="195.359" data-end="198.379">To understand what's happening in this process, as it's</span> <span data-start="198.379" data-end="199.379">evolving.</span> <span data-start="199.379" data-end="201.269">Step one is data.</span> <span data-start="201.269" data-end="205.709">Our data structures in JavaScript are becoming increasingly sophisticated.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="205.709" data-end="208.389">This is in response to our applications that we're</span> <span data-start="208.389" data-end="212.79">developing, becoming increasingly sophisticated, and there's a lot of</span> <span data-start="212.79" data-end="216.329">information added in asynchronous processes.</span> <span data-start="216.329" data-end="220.45">And when we share mutable state and asynchronous processes we have exactly</span> <span data-start="220.45" data-end="224.019">the same problem that people in other communities have when they share mutable</span> <span data-start="224.019" data-end="227.03">state between threads in a multi-threading environment.</span> <span data-start="227.03" data-end="233.219">So now we've got things here, thing A, and some</span> <span data-start="233.219" data-end="238.15">other piece of code over here, thing B, and these two things are communicating</span> <span data-start="238.15" data-end="239.739">through a communication channel.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="239.739" data-end="241.81">Sharing messages back and forth.</span> <span data-start="241.81" data-end="243.86">But if they're also sharing mutable state, they're</span> <span data-start="243.86" data-end="246.389">communicating through that too.</span> <span data-start="246.389" data-end="249.75">And that communication happens instantly and it bypasses the communication</span> <span data-start="249.75" data-end="254.12">passageways of your application.</span> <span data-start="254.12" data-end="257.769">So that means you have this spooky action at a distance going on, when you're</span> <span data-start="257.769" data-end="259.2">dealing with mutable state.</span> <span data-start="259.2" data-end="260.2">Right?</span> <span data-start="260.2" data-end="261.22">And it's..</span> <span data-start="261.22" data-end="263.22">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="263.22" data-end="264.22">So..</span> <span data-start="264.22" data-end="267.25">We have persistent data structures that help us have</span> <span data-start="267.25" data-end="271.36">immutable data so we can reason about our processes and our programs in a</span> <span data-start="271.36" data-end="273.46">more effective fashion.</span> <span data-start="273.46" data-end="275.5">And they do that in a performant way, rather than having</span> <span data-start="275.5" data-end="279.699">to deep copy everything like you would if you were making immutable data yourself.</span> <span data-start="279.699" data-end="284.08">So we're looking at two of those, immutable JS and Mori, from a particular</span> <span data-start="284.08" data-end="285.53">perspective.</span> <span data-start="285.53" data-end="287.99">So you have to know a little bit about (inaudible) trees.</span> <span data-start="287.99" data-end="288.99">Or tris.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="288.99" data-end="290.31">Who says try?</span> <span data-start="290.31" data-end="291.699">Who says tree?</span> <span data-start="291.699" data-end="293.58">Either way is fine.</span> <span data-start="293.58" data-end="295.91">You're both right.</span> <span data-start="295.91" data-end="300.4">As long as people understand what you're saying.</span> <span data-start="300.4" data-end="304.33">I'll try to say tri, because it disambiguates better.</span> <span data-start="304.33" data-end="311.389">But a tri is a tree.</span> <span data-start="311.389" data-end="316.62">This is just a super high level surface topology of a</span> <span data-start="316.62" data-end="317.62">(inaudible).</span> <span data-start="317.62" data-end="319.41">They're really interesting data structures.</span> <span data-start="319.41" data-end="322.27">We put all of our values down at the bottom and use pieces of</span> <span data-start="322.27" data-end="324.7">the key to walk down to that value.</span> <span data-start="324.7" data-end="328.479">We're going to hash those keys first, so we can pull an unlimited</span> <span data-start="328.479" data-end="329.72">number of bytes out of them.</span> <span data-start="329.72" data-end="332.99">If we hit the end of the hash we rehash.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="332.99" data-end="336.35">So it gives us consistent and unlimited hash lengths,</span> <span data-start="336.35" data-end="337.84">so we can deal with conflicts.</span> <span data-start="337.84" data-end="343.409">Because if two things have the same key or the same piece of the hash of the</span> <span data-start="343.409" data-end="346.55">key, then we have to go to the next piece of the hash.</span> <span data-start="346.55" data-end="349.8">So we're going to take pieces of the hash, five bits at a time, and</span> <span data-start="349.8" data-end="351.12">use that to walk down the street.</span> <span data-start="351.12" data-end="354.57">Those five bits give us 32 possible values.</span> <span data-start="354.57" data-end="359.94">So we're going to have an array of 32 possible values, up to 32 values, as the</span> <span data-start="359.94" data-end="362.47">child of a particular node.</span> <span data-start="362.47" data-end="366.05">And that's going to dereference into its children.</span> <span data-start="366.05" data-end="371.65">So the things you have to remember from that are: 32 and hashing.</span> <span data-start="371.65" data-end="373.169">Hashing gives us good distribution properties.</span> <span data-start="373.169" data-end="377.479">We would rather have shallow, wide trees.</span> <span data-start="377.479" data-end="381.24">We don't want deep trees, because depth increases our space usage and</span> <span data-start="381.24" data-end="386.199">also our time usage.</span> <span data-start="386.199" data-end="389.509">So we're going to put these two libraries under a</span> <span data-start="389.509" data-end="390.509">microscope.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="390.509" data-end="392.449">We're going to use a thing called underscore, which is kind of</span> <span data-start="392.449" data-end="396.439">like a data structure oscilloscope or something.</span> <span data-start="396.439" data-end="398.33">And this is slightly the wrong aspect ratio.</span> <span data-start="398.33" data-end="401.229">So you're not seeing all of the slides.</span> <span data-start="401.229" data-end="402.229">That just says..</span> <span data-start="402.229" data-end="404.9">Full history of the data structure down there.</span> <span data-start="404.9" data-end="406.1">Okay.</span> <span data-start="406.1" data-end="411.68">So these are the joys of AV confusion.</span> <span data-start="411.68" data-end="412.68">Which was..</span> <span data-start="412.68" data-end="413.68">Yeah, my fault, not theirs.</span> <span data-start="413.68" data-end="416.27">They did an excellent job of recovering from that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="416.27" data-end="418.68">So we're going to write out our data structure as a single long</span> <span data-start="418.68" data-end="419.71">list.</span> <span data-start="419.71" data-end="420.74">Right?</span> <span data-start="420.74" data-end="423.1">We're going to take all of the numbers in it, and for each number</span> <span data-start="423.1" data-end="425.379">in it, we're going to generate a pixel.</span> <span data-start="425.379" data-end="427.379">That pixel will be colored according to that number.</span> <span data-start="427.379" data-end="430.9">We're going to take that line of pixels, turn it on its side</span> <span data-start="430.9" data-end="436.24">and make a column, and every time we make a new version of this data structure,</span> <span data-start="436.24" data-end="438.15">we're going to move everything over and put the new column in</span> <span data-start="438.15" data-end="441.419">place, so we can see the history of it.</span> <span data-start="441.419" data-end="447.74">So let's cross our fingers and see if we can see what that looks like.</span> <span data-start="447.74" data-end="449.67">Here we are..</span> <span data-start="449.67" data-end="451.96">Oh, man.</span> <span data-start="451.96" data-end="452.96">Aspect ratios!</span> <span data-start="452.96" data-end="453.99">All right.</span> <span data-start="453.99" data-end="457.669">So everything is kind of up in this corner.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="457.669" data-end="459.319">But that's cool.</span> <span data-start="459.319" data-end="460.389">We can zoom here.</span> <span data-start="460.389" data-end="462.43">This is the power of zoom.</span> <span data-start="462.43" data-end="463.849">All right.</span> <span data-start="463.849" data-end="469.58">So what we've done here is to start putting in some numbers.</span> <span data-start="469.58" data-end="471.1">We see this triangle shape.</span> <span data-start="471.1" data-end="472.1">That's what we're expecting.</span> <span data-start="472.1" data-end="474.86">Because every single tick, we're adding a new number, enqueuing a new</span> <span data-start="474.86" data-end="475.86">number.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="475.86" data-end="479.039">We see random numbers here.</span> <span data-start="479.039" data-end="481.889">Those correlate to the numbers that we've added.</span> <span data-start="481.889" data-end="485.349">So it just stays in place in this queue.</span> <span data-start="485.349" data-end="489.819">The secondary feature we can pick out here is these shaded areas,</span> <span data-start="489.819" data-end="493.12">which are shaded..</span> <span data-start="493.12" data-end="497.49">They're less light, because they are down an extra level.</span> <span data-start="497.49" data-end="500.43">So the lightness is corresponding to our depth in the tree.</span> <span data-start="500.43" data-end="503.12">This area is down an extra level, so we can see it fills up</span> <span data-start="503.12" data-end="504.759">with 32 things.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="504.759" data-end="507.37">And then those get added to the main data structure.</span> <span data-start="507.37" data-end="509.889">And we start a new nursery at that point.</span> <span data-start="509.889" data-end="512.59">Everybody on board so far?</span> <span data-start="512.59" data-end="515.44">So both of these  —  and I've cleverly code named them</span> <span data-start="515.44" data-end="520.14">blue and red  —  because this is not a performance comparison between Mori</span> <span data-start="520.14" data-end="521.87">and immutable JS.</span> <span data-start="521.87" data-end="525.29">It's just  —  we're going to use these as a way of understanding</span> <span data-start="525.29" data-end="529.69">what's happening in the process and in the program by looking at the data.</span> <span data-start="529.69" data-end="533.47">Additionally, even if you figure out which is which, which is not very hard,</span> <span data-start="533.47" data-end="536.96">after I hit a couple more buttons  —  I'm using older versions of them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="536.96" data-end="540.63">So it's not an effective performance comparison.</span> <span data-start="540.63" data-end="542.45">So we start taking numbers off.</span> <span data-start="542.45" data-end="547.889">They look more or less the same, but suddenly we see a really big difference.</span> <span data-start="547.889" data-end="554.15">Here in the blue zone, we have a data structure that is the same size.</span> <span data-start="554.15" data-end="555.17">Right?</span> <span data-start="555.17" data-end="558.839">Here it was growing and here it's the same size every tick.</span> <span data-start="558.839" data-end="561.74">And what we're doing every single tick is pushing on</span> <span data-start="561.74" data-end="564.271">a number and dequeuing a number off of this end.</span> <span data-start="564.271" data-end="567.74">And we can see it's actually happening in the data structure.</span> <span data-start="567.74" data-end="568.74">Right?</span> <span data-start="568.74" data-end="572.64">There's a couple of strange little places in here, like this little blip here,</span> <span data-start="572.64" data-end="574.67">that occurs about six ticks in.</span> <span data-start="574.67" data-end="576.47">I have no idea why but it's there every single</span> <span data-start="576.47" data-end="578.399">time  —  I haven't looked at the code for either of these.</span> <span data-start="578.399" data-end="581.01">The point is to understand it by looking at the</span> <span data-start="581.01" data-end="582.01">pictures.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="582.01" data-end="585.91">So this is a traditional queue, other than the fact that we still have our</span> <span data-start="585.91" data-end="587.579">nurseries going.</span> <span data-start="587.579" data-end="591.43">Shifting off of one end and pushing onto the other end.</span> <span data-start="591.43" data-end="595.42">There's probably some performance implications here, because shift or unshift,</span> <span data-start="595.42" data-end="599.02">whichever one we use, in JavaScript is not a very fast function.</span> <span data-start="599.02" data-end="601.99">Over here we're doing something completely different.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="601.99" data-end="607.269">In particular, we can see that a whole new triangle has emerged, and we're</span> <span data-start="607.269" data-end="609.889">keeping the old data up here.</span> <span data-start="609.889" data-end="613.11">So what we infer from this is that rather than</span> <span data-start="613.11" data-end="616.01">destroying things as we dequeue them, we're keeping pointers.</span> <span data-start="616.01" data-end="617.86">And in fact, we can see these pointers here in</span> <span data-start="617.86" data-end="619.47">this middle section.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="619.47" data-end="623.86">We're keeping pointers into this data and we're floating</span> <span data-start="623.86" data-end="626.209">a counter to the end of it.</span> <span data-start="626.209" data-end="627.95">As we dequeue things.</span> <span data-start="627.95" data-end="632.639">And then when we hit the end of the old kind of master section or new growth</span> <span data-start="632.639" data-end="636.61">section, we're dropping everything.</span> <span data-start="636.61" data-end="641.12">And this new growth section down here becomes a new old one, and it starts getting</span> <span data-start="641.12" data-end="643.42">dequeued, and we start over again here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="643.42" data-end="646.76">Does that kind of make sense so far?</span> <span data-start="646.76" data-end="650.63">So what we understand at this point is that there's a massive difference between</span> <span data-start="650.63" data-end="653.11">these two libraries and how they handle queues.</span> <span data-start="653.11" data-end="655.82">In particular, there may be some performance implications for</span> <span data-start="655.82" data-end="657.47">that difference.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="657.47" data-end="660.24">We understand this not by looking at the code, but just by</span> <span data-start="660.24" data-end="661.4">looking at these pictures.</span> <span data-start="661.4" data-end="664.07">Let me show you another example.</span> <span data-start="664.07" data-end="667.55">We're going to start throwing random numbers in here.</span> <span data-start="667.55" data-end="671.56">So we'll take a number and we'll give it a key that is the number with the letter</span> <span data-start="671.56" data-end="675.16">pre-pended, and insert this into the map.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="675.16" data-end="678.97">So what do we immediately see when we're looking at this?</span> <span data-start="678.97" data-end="681.71">We immediately see that this blue side is about</span> <span data-start="681.71" data-end="686">twice as tall as the red side over here.</span> <span data-start="686" data-end="690.899">And so we can start to think that maybe there's some spatial implications</span> <span data-start="690.899" data-end="691.899">here.</span> <span data-start="691.899" data-end="692.899">Right?</span> <span data-start="692.899" data-end="694.96">That our space usage is a little bit stronger over here.</span> <span data-start="694.96" data-end="699.48">Let's turn on another way of looking at this.</span> <span data-start="699.48" data-end="701.23">So this is a flattened tree view.</span> <span data-start="701.23" data-end="703.77">What we're going to do is take our tree with all</span> <span data-start="703.77" data-end="708.269">of its levels, and we're going to flatten every single level.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="708.269" data-end="709.589">And then we're going to turn the whole thing on</span> <span data-start="709.589" data-end="711.18">its side.</span> <span data-start="711.18" data-end="714.86">So if we look over here, we can see that we have our initial node</span> <span data-start="714.86" data-end="719.13">here, this blue is a pointer to the secondary node here, this points to an</span> <span data-start="719.13" data-end="724.54">array of 32 pointers, each point to a dereference column here, and then those</span> <span data-start="724.54" data-end="728.26">point to this array over here, and so on.</span> <span data-start="728.26" data-end="730.209">But just from eyeballing this..</span> <span data-start="730.209" data-end="733.82">I don't know how much of this you can actually see..</span> <span data-start="733.82" data-end="740.23">We can see that these are adding new key value pairs in very</span> <span data-start="740.23" data-end="741.37">different ways.</span> <span data-start="741.37" data-end="742.85">This one is a lot more compact.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="742.85" data-end="747.39">So this reconfirms our intuition that we saw just from looking at</span> <span data-start="747.39" data-end="748.759">the sizes.</span> <span data-start="748.759" data-end="754.43">Let's try, instead of adding these randomly, adding them..</span> <span data-start="754.43" data-end="756.04">Hang on.</span> <span data-start="756.04" data-end="757.66">Come on.</span> <span data-start="757.66" data-end="758.73">You can do it.</span> <span data-start="758.73" data-end="760.39">All right.</span> <span data-start="760.39" data-end="766.12">Apparently the reload button is not actually the reload button.</span> <span data-start="766.12" data-end="768.13">Borrowed laptop issues.</span> <span data-start="768.13" data-end="770.69">All right.</span> <span data-start="770.69" data-end="774.17">What's happening here?</span> <span data-start="774.17" data-end="777.759">Now we're loading in numbers sequentially, instead of randomly.</span> <span data-start="777.759" data-end="781.329">And something that we started to see toward the end of this one becomes very</span> <span data-start="781.329" data-end="782.97">clear.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="782.97" data-end="785.68">We're seeing this banding effect.</span> <span data-start="785.68" data-end="789.899">Whereas these colors are well distributed, these colors are patterned in a very particular</span> <span data-start="789.899" data-end="790.899">way.</span> <span data-start="790.899" data-end="792.65">And what that's telling us  —  if we look here, we can see the same</span> <span data-start="792.65" data-end="793.65">story.</span> <span data-start="793.65" data-end="798.13">This one, even though we're adding them sequentially, is well populated.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="798.13" data-end="799.46">It's fairly dense.</span> <span data-start="799.46" data-end="805.37">Over here, we see something that has these increasing sort</span> <span data-start="805.37" data-end="810.43">of harmonic oscillations that are going on in the number of collisions.</span> <span data-start="810.43" data-end="816.44">So this tells us that the hashing algorithm that blue is using is not distributing</span> <span data-start="816.44" data-end="820.66">values or keys as well as the hashing algorithm that red is using.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="820.66" data-end="823.6">In fact, we're getting very bad hashing behavior out of this.</span> <span data-start="823.6" data-end="827.279">It's probably modulo or something like that.</span> <span data-start="827.279" data-end="829.67">Oh, dear.</span> <span data-start="829.67" data-end="832.89">Fortunately, that was actually the end of the conclusions that we were going</span> <span data-start="832.89" data-end="833.89">to draw from that.</span> <span data-start="833.89" data-end="839.93">So what we've learned so far is that you should always</span> <span data-start="839.93" data-end="843.35">bring a backup laptop when you're giving a talk.</span> <span data-start="843.35" data-end="848.24">And the second thing that we've learned is that we can make observations</span> <span data-start="848.24" data-end="851.61">about a piece of code without ever looking at that code at all.</span> <span data-start="851.61" data-end="853.5">So we've learned something about these two libraries.</span> <span data-start="853.5" data-end="855.279">But we didn't have to look at any code.</span> <span data-start="855.279" data-end="861.519">And that's important, because it doesn't matter how good or poorly</span> <span data-start="861.519" data-end="864.49">written that code was.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="864.49" data-end="866.19">Right?</span> <span data-start="866.19" data-end="867.26">It could be obfuscated.</span> <span data-start="867.26" data-end="868.55">Both of these are well written libraries.</span> <span data-start="868.55" data-end="870.42">But it doesn't matter.</span> <span data-start="870.42" data-end="880.92">For example, if a library is the framework we're using or that someone</span> <span data-start="880.92" data-end="884.61">else is using, we have to take over maintenance of that code, there's hundreds</span> <span data-start="884.61" data-end="888.25">of thousands of lines in the framework, so we could read the entire thing to</span> <span data-start="888.25" data-end="893.551">understand how it works, or we could try to go in the back door and try to</span> <span data-start="893.551" data-end="898.24">develop our intuitions by actually observing the process unfolding.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="898.24" data-end="899.899">So one problem that we saw..</span> <span data-start="899.899" data-end="902.94">Or I guess we didn't see, but we should have seen  — </span> <span data-start="902.94" data-end="904.709">was that there was limited screen real estate.</span> <span data-start="904.709" data-end="905.709">We had the opposite problem.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="905.709" data-end="909.22">There was way too much screen real estate.</span> <span data-start="909.22" data-end="914.89">So fitting everything in can be an issue.</span> <span data-start="914.89" data-end="916.98">Sorry?</span> <span data-start="916.98" data-end="922.17">Will that actually work with images?</span> <span data-start="922.17" data-end="923.17">It works!</span> <span data-start="923.17" data-end="924.699">That's so great.</span> <span data-start="924.699" data-end="927.17">Thank you!</span> <span data-start="927.17" data-end="929.54">Cool.</span> <span data-start="929.54" data-end="933.22">So we have some issues with the amount of available space to us.</span> <span data-start="933.22" data-end="935.209">So we could, for example, look at a single line</span> <span data-start="935.209" data-end="940.779">of code, and observe this line of code, or we could observe the entire code</span> <span data-start="940.779" data-end="941.779">base.</span> <span data-start="941.779" data-end="942.779">Right?</span> <span data-start="942.779" data-end="943.99">And watch the entire process unfolding.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="943.99" data-end="947.1">So we can kind of pick a place along this continuum that</span> <span data-start="947.1" data-end="948.279">we're interested in.</span> <span data-start="948.279" data-end="951.18">We could also, on the temporal dimension, look at a</span> <span data-start="951.18" data-end="953.49">single operation at a time.</span> <span data-start="953.49" data-end="957.67">Or we could look at the entire process unfolding in realtime.</span> <span data-start="957.67" data-end="961.98">And so we have really good tools for this end of the spectrum.</span> <span data-start="961.98" data-end="965.22">For looking at a single operation, one at a time.</span> <span data-start="965.22" data-end="966.22">Right?</span> <span data-start="966.22" data-end="968.209">Step-through debuggers work great for this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="968.209" data-end="970.959">And they give us a street level view of what's happening.</span> <span data-start="970.959" data-end="971.959">Right?</span> <span data-start="971.959" data-end="975.13">We're taking  —  we're walking through the town of our process.</span> <span data-start="975.13" data-end="978.839">But they don't give us the 10,000-foot view of what's</span> <span data-start="978.839" data-end="985.12">happening all at once, so we can develop our intuitions about it, and we don't</span> <span data-start="985.12" data-end="986.8">have very good tools for that right now.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="986.8" data-end="988.87">So that's what's on the left hand of the slide.</span> <span data-start="988.87" data-end="993.05">On the right hand is some mathematics that ostensibly proves</span> <span data-start="993.05" data-end="996.88">that the information we have is greater than the information we would like</span> <span data-start="996.88" data-end="1001.66">to have, but really it's a ham handed way of trying to work the '80s theme</span> <span data-start="1001.66" data-end="1004.89">into my presentation.</span> <span data-start="1004.89" data-end="1009.95">All right.</span> <span data-start="1009.95" data-end="1012.48">So..</span> <span data-start="1012.48" data-end="1014.06">What we're going to do..</span> <span data-start="1014.06" data-end="1016.94">Because JavaScript is huge  —  the ES5 spec is</span> <span data-start="1016.94" data-end="1021.05">over 250 pages, and because we write huge applications in it, we're going to</span> <span data-start="1021.05" data-end="1024.41">punt a little on this problem and we're going to start with a system where we</span> <span data-start="1024.41" data-end="1029.31">can see everything at full granularity, with the entire process, all at the</span> <span data-start="1029.31" data-end="1030.589">same time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1030.589" data-end="1031.589">Okay?</span> <span data-start="1031.589" data-end="1034.69">So that means we're going to have to design a language.</span> <span data-start="1034.69" data-end="1036.069">We have some design constraints for this.</span> <span data-start="1036.069" data-end="1040.12">We're going to keep it very simple, so we have an 8-bit architecture.</span> <span data-start="1040.12" data-end="1044.76">Our memory is going to be 256 bytes.</span> <span data-start="1044.76" data-end="1046.65">And we would like to introduce random programs, because</span> <span data-start="1046.65" data-end="1050.75">the whole idea is to gain intuition about the process that's unfolding</span> <span data-start="1050.75" data-end="1053.63">from a program without actually understanding the program.</span> <span data-start="1053.63" data-end="1055.22">If we understand the program, then we don't need to</span> <span data-start="1055.22" data-end="1056.39">do that.</span> <span data-start="1056.39" data-end="1057.39">Right?</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1735.72" data-end="1737.96">So I want this for the programs that I'm writing, and</span> <span data-start="1737.96" data-end="1740.86">I also want it for the programs that I'm reading.</span> <span data-start="1740.86" data-end="1742.99">And if you want it too, then I think we should work together</span> <span data-start="1742.99" data-end="1743.99">on this.</span> <span data-start="1743.99" data-end="1745.21">I think we should make this happen.</span> <span data-start="1745.21" data-end="1748.84">I think we should get this  —  not this, but something like this  —  into dev</span> <span data-start="1748.84" data-end="1749.929">tools.</span> <span data-start="1749.929" data-end="1752.659">So we have it available for everything that we're doing.</span> <span data-start="1752.659" data-end="1756.94">Let's augment our vision.</span> <span data-start="1756.94" data-end="1760.809">Let's let the computer do the hard work of helping us understand</span> <span data-start="1760.809" data-end="1764.05">what it is we're working with.</span> <span data-start="1764.05" data-end="1767.42">Let's go to that party.</span> </p>
