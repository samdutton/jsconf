data-end="1111.98">let's let's launch this again and it's</span> <span data-start="1111.98" data-end="1118.97">still working awesome and now let's go</span> <span data-start="1118.97" data-end="1120.169">leave it running so we see we're going</span> <span data-start="1120.169" data-end="1124.22">to save some log data and we'll land it</span> <span data-start="1124.22"

data-end="1139.879">our in our portal here we have we have</span> <span data-start="1139.879" data-end="1141.889">got some data so let's go ahead and copy</span> <span data-start="1141.889"

data-end="1148.85">got all our log saved so so pretty</span> <span data-start="1148.85" data-end="1151.899">simple we have a few more minutes left</span> <span data-start="1151.899" data-end="1154.759">so now so what I want to do I think we</span> <span data-start="1154.759" data-end="1156.83">have time now I want to actually deploy</span> <span data-start="1156.83" data-end="1160.429">this application up into this is the web</span> <span data-start="1160.429" data-end="1162.71">app up into windows azure so on this is</span> <span data-start="1162.71" data-end="1164.149">the part that gets very dangerous so</span> <span data-start="1164.149" data-end="1166.58">that you guys can decide when it flaw</span> <span data-start="1166.58" data-end="1170.419">when it when it takes off and lands so</span> <span data-start="1170.419" data-end="1172.73">for nodejs we have we have a service</span> <span data-start="1172.73" data-end="1175.1">called windows as your websites which is</span> <span data-start="1175.1" data-end="1178.519">basically a super easy way to to deploy</span> <span data-start="1178.519" data-end="1180.529">applications into the cloud so let's</span> <span data-start="1180.529" data-end="1181.85">just go ahead and create a windows as</span> <span data-start="1181.85" data-end="1183.789">your website and let's just call this</span> <span data-start="1183.789" data-end="1188.929">j/s com it's not taken cool beans so</span> <span data-start="1188.929" data-end="1190.549">let's choose our region east us and</span> <span data-start="1190.549" data-end="1192.559">create Jas comp so with windows as your</span> <span data-start="1192.559" data-end="1193.73">websites is a variety of different</span> <span data-start="1193.73" data-end="1196.49">deployment options but the the one that</span> <span data-start="1196.49" data-end="1198.23">makes most sense for no developers as we</span> <span data-start="1198.23" data-end="1199.58">can deploy right up to Windows Azure</span> <span data-start="1199.58" data-end="1203.12">websites with get so so let's so our</span> <span data-start="1203.12" data-end="1205.64">sites created and let's go ahead and</span> <span data-start="1205.64" data-end="1211.39">select this and go to our dashboard oops</span> <span data-start="1211.39" data-end="1216.92">go back and a set of deployment so we</span> <span data-start="1216.92" data-end="1218.84">can do a couple of different things we</span> <span data-start="1218.84" data-end="1220.46">can actually deploy with continuous</span> <span data-start="1220.46" data-end="1222.83">integration from github or from you from</span> <span data-start="1222.83" data-end="1225.23">dropbox and from like bitbucket whatever</span> <span data-start="1225.23" data-end="1227.75">or we can just push directly to a to a</span> <span data-start="1227.75" data-end="1230.36">local to a local get or to a good end</span> <span data-start="1230.36" data-end="1232.04">point just in our in our deployment</span> <span data-start="1232.04" data-end="1234.47">servers so we'll take just a second to</span> <span data-start="1234.47" data-end="1236.54">create that get endpoint and then allah</span> <span data-start="1236.54" data-end="1239.21">then I'll initialize I'll set this up</span> <span data-start="1239.21" data-end="1251.24">and while this is and here's our here's</span> <span data-start="1251.24" data-end="1253.49">our get server so let's just let's just</span> <span data-start="1253.49" data-end="1256.55">quickly push this up into windows azure</span> <span data-start="1256.55" data-end="1258.95">so i'm going to nish Eliza's a git repo</span> <span data-start="1258.95" data-end="1261.679">again just a regular git repo remote as</span> <span data-start="1261.679" data-end="1269.76">europe's add a sure</span> <span data-start="1269.77" data-end="1272.62">and I didn't put it ignore so we're</span> <span data-start="1272.62" data-end="1273.94">going to push the node modules we don't</span> <span data-start="1273.94" data-end="1277.6">actually med sorry we don't actually</span> <span data-start="1277.6" data-end="1279.1">have to push up the modules of course</span> <span data-start="1279.1" data-end="1281.83">those will be installed the first time</span> <span data-start="1281.83" data-end="1284.05">those will be installed from packages</span> <span data-start="1284.05" data-end="1286.72">but i forgot to create a pack and ignore</span> <span data-start="1286.72" data-end="1288.67">to get ignore file so we're just going</span> <span data-start="1288.67" data-end="1290.65">to push those up anyway which is fine</span> <span data-start="1290.65" data-end="1294.58">get push as your master although it'll</span> <span data-start="1294.58" data-end="1296.02">take a little longer so we'll make it</span> <span data-start="1296.02" data-end="1304.09">quite a cool so again we're just pushing</span> <span data-start="1304.09" data-end="1311.47">this this website up to up to up to</span> <span data-start="1311.47" data-end="1315.22">windows as your websites port good so</span> <span data-start="1315.22" data-end="1317.38">we're just pushing this up with get to</span> <span data-start="1317.38" data-end="1320.2">windows azure websites to a website that</span> <span data-start="1320.2" data-end="1322.33">will be at j s comped as your websites</span> <span data-start="1322.33" data-end="1325.3">net and I should not have committed the</span> <span data-start="1325.3" data-end="1327.55">modules because they're huge compared to</span> <span data-start="1327.55" data-end="1329.35">the site but that's alright so normally</span> <span data-start="1329.35" data-end="1331.3">you would obviously ignore the modules</span> <span data-start="1331.3" data-end="1332.92">and not commit that into your git repo</span> <span data-start="1332.92" data-end="1334.75">eyes would be best practice and windows</span> <span data-start="1334.75" data-end="1336.04">as your websites will pull those and</span> <span data-start="1336.04" data-end="1338.44">install those when you when you push the</span> <span data-start="1338.44" data-end="1341.5">site so making it much faster so we'll</span> <span data-start="1341.5" data-end="1343.84">see here our deployment happens and this</span> <span data-start="1343.84" data-end="1350.92">just takes a few seconds few seconds</span> <span data-start="1350.92" data-end="1355.75">longer Joey's takes longer when you're</span> <span data-start="1355.75" data-end="1358.48">demoing right entra have any questions</span> <span data-start="1358.48" data-end="1360.52">while we're waiting oh there we go no</span> <span
