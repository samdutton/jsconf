data-end="378.53">easier to understand or maintain but you</span> <span data-start="378.53" data-end="380.509">are not addressing this kind of issues</span> <span data-start="380.509" data-end="384.65">and actually that's why you are feeling</span> <span data-start="384.65" data-end="389.05">that situation over and over for always</span> <span data-start="389.05" data-end="391.37">right it doesn't matter the project you</span> <span data-start="391.37" data-end="393.469">are the company you are working with or</span> <span data-start="393.469"

reaches</span> <span data-start="411.319" data-end="414.8">right so when we are doing bottom-up</span> <span data-start="414.8" data-end="416.36">approaches is difficult for us to</span> <span data-start="416.36" data-end="418.28">understand at the end what's the code is</span> <span data-start="418.28" data-end="419.659">difficult to maintain is difficult to</span> <span data-start="419.659" data-end="423.229">make changes there is out of its cases</span> <span data-start="423.229" data-end="425">that we are not considering there is</span> <span data-start="425" data-end="426.949">sort of mutation that we are starting to</span> <span data-start="426.949" data-end="429.59">do it's really easy I'm prone to start</span> <span data-start="429.59" data-end="431.569">doing some hacks around the code which</span> <span data-start="431.569" data-end="434.779">is no good it's also difficult to test</span> <span data-start="434.779" data-end="436.43">of course if you don't understand</span> <span data-start="436.43" data-end="438.229">something it's going to be difficult to</span> <span data-start="438.229" data-end="442.279">test also our code is not going to be</span> <span data-start="442.279" data-end="443.93">pure most of the times because with</span> <span data-start="443.93" data-end="447.469">those mutations well and we have these</span> <span data-start="447.469" data-end="449.9">complex setups for testing I have seen</span> <span data-start="449.9" data-end="452">projects small projects with ensign</span> <span data-start="452" data-end="453.979">configurations longer than the actual</span> <span data-start="453.979" data-end="455.87">project and I'm not joking this is</span> <span data-start="455.87" data-end="458.389">something I've seen which is obviously a</span> <span data-start="458.389" data-end="460.189">cough the smell is difficult in Haines</span> <span data-start="460.189" data-end="463.94">obviously if you can test something it's</span> <span data-start="463.94" data-end="465.949">also like dangerous thing hence you</span> <span data-start="465.949" data-end="468.469">don't know if the testing is working it</span> <span data-start="468.469" data-end="469.819">generates out of bugs and gonna make</span> <span data-start="469.819" data-end="472.55">this I mean like a lot a lot of facts</span> <span data-start="472.55" data-end="475.639">right we don't want a spaghetti code in</span> <span data-start="475.639" data-end="477.44">case you don't notice we have a lot of</span> <span data-start="477.44" data-end="480.49">posters around this venue that say so</span> <span data-start="480.49" data-end="482.87">and refactoring is also going to be very</span> <span data-start="482.87" data-end="484.789">difficult because we don't know what</span> <span data-start="484.789" data-end="487.94">exactly we have to change so at the end</span> <span data-start="487.94" data-end="489.259">you are gonna feel like this pooch</span> <span data-start="489.259" data-end="491.509">reminder that you are just fixing one</span> <span data-start="491.509" data-end="493.339">fire after the other and you're more</span> <span data-start="493.339" data-end="496.33">like a fireman rather than a developer</span> <span data-start="496.33" data-end="498.939">so what's the solution</span> <span data-start="498.939" data-end="501.319">so the top-down approach which actually</span> <span data-start="501.319" data-end="504.5">makes a lot of sense um the top-down</span> <span data-start="504.5" data-end="506.569">approach is basically that you have this</span> <span data-start="506.569" data-end="509.75">abstract concept and bu of your product</span> <span data-start="509.75" data-end="512.449">and every time you have a problem you go</span> <span data-start="512.449" data-end="516.169">back to that abstract definition and</span> <span data-start="516.169" data-end="518.87">then analyze it from then and later on</span> <span data-start="518.87" data-end="522.099">you implement it you stop reacting</span> <span data-start="522.099" data-end="526.459">that's a pun and and basically how does</span> <span data-start="526.459" data-end="527.899">this looks because so far everything is</span> <span data-start="527.899" data-end="529.43">super abstract it looks like that it's a</span> <span data-start="529.43"
