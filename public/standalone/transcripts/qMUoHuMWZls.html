<p><span data-start="3.794" data-end="5.475">Hello.</span> <span data-start="6.072" data-end="10.499">This is my first time doing a full-scale presentation so I'm really nervous.</span> <span data-start="11.783" data-end="15.118">As you can see, in this session,</span> <span data-start="15.44" data-end="19.147">I'm going to make a presentation about functional JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="19.198" data-end="22.3">It's not that I know functional Javascript that well</span> <span data-start="22.301" data-end="25.348">that I'm making a presentation.</span> <span data-start="25.871" data-end="28.939">Some of the traits of functional programming</span> <span data-start="28.94" data-end="31.749">that I've applied on real projects</span> <span data-start="31.822" data-end="35.073">and my experience of grasping it little by little, is what I want to share.</span> <span data-start="35.074" data-end="36.674">And that's why I'm here.</span> <span data-start="39.873" data-end="43.001">I'm a developer in a company called Lunit</span> <span data-start="43.002" data-end="46.247">that analyses medical images.</span> <span data-start="47.113" data-end="49.922">It's been 3 years since I started being a developer.</span> <span data-start="50.195" data-end="52.569">Before this, I worked in design.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="54.287" data-end="59.099">It was 2016 when I just started learning how to program, three years ago.</span> <span data-start="59.1" data-end="62.719">There was a keyword that was very popular at the time.</span> <span data-start="64.325" data-end="66.2">That is 'React'.</span> <span data-start="67.56" data-end="71.583">React is a library that helps to make interfaces.</span> <span data-start="71.879" data-end="75.799">There would be some of you who haven't used it</span> <span data-start="75.8" data-end="78.5">but I'm sure everyone has heard of it before.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="78.995" data-end="81.895">It's a library that people have been constantly giving love to.</span> <span data-start="82.118" data-end="83.266">And three years ago,</span> <span data-start="83.267" data-end="86.822">along with 'React', there was another keyword that arose.</span> <span data-start="87.762" data-end="89">That is 'Redux'</span> <span data-start="89.323" data-end="92.57">MobX is used a lot recently too,</span> <span data-start="92.991" data-end="95.868">and it's compared with React Hooks a lot too.</span> <span data-start="95.869" data-end="98.722">At the time Redux was thought to be very innovative.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="98.723" data-end="103.323">So it was in the center of the stage.</span> <span data-start="105.234" data-end="109.1">Redux is used with the library that  makes UI</span> <span data-start="109.2" data-end="113.599">and it's a tool that maintains state in  Javascript.</span> <span data-start="116.17" data-end="118.119">As you can see on the right,</span> <span data-start="118.222" data-end="122.046">it separates the state and the UI interface on the bottom</span> <span data-start="122.1" data-end="126.2">and makes the state into action. That is the basic structure of Redux.</span> <span data-start="127.387" data-end="130.368">With Redux,</span> <span data-start="131.506" data-end="133.199">it is not as fast but</span> <span data-start="133.2" data-end="137">there's a keyword that slowly appeared.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="138.385" data-end="140.724">That is 'functional programming'.</span> <span data-start="142.034" data-end="145.219">Dan Abramov, who made Redux,</span> <span data-start="145.273" data-end="148.1">got the idea from Elm, a functional language,</span> <span data-start="148.101" data-end="151.571">and made it. So with Redux,</span> <span data-start="151.597" data-end="153.6">the keyword 'functional' was gradually mentioned.</span> <span data-start="155.299" data-end="158.022">At the time, I was a beginner in development.</span> <span data-start="158.023" data-end="162.418">So it was too hard for me to get the grasp of what it meant.</span> <span data-start="165.238" data-end="168.111">Although I didn't understand all the basic concepts of Redux,</span> <span data-start="168.112" data-end="171.047">using Redux by itself</span> <span data-start="171.145" data-end="173.932">was very interesting and fun.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="175.152" data-end="178.4">When you make apps following the structure of Redux,</span> <span data-start="178.5" data-end="181">eventually, the interests were all separated</span> <span data-start="181.1" data-end="185.368">and the codes, including the components, became very neat.</span> <span data-start="185.369" data-end="187.4">That's why I liked Redux very much.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="188.809" data-end="191.3">Because of my interest for Redux,</span> <span data-start="191.4" data-end="193.7">in the case of functional programming,</span> <span data-start="193.997" data-end="199.1">I looked at it with vague curiosity and admiration.</span> <span data-start="201.206" data-end="206.231">As time passed and I got used to the job,</span> <span data-start="206.232" data-end="210.6">my curiosity for functional programming was revived</span> <span data-start="210.7" data-end="212.966">and I started to study with my co-workers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="214.304" data-end="216.595">In this study,</span> <span data-start="216.758" data-end="222.643">the basic concepts of functions, to use a pure function,</span> <span data-start="222.644" data-end="224.7">to prevent additional effects,</span> <span data-start="225.02" data-end="228.02">to use preface grammars,</span> <span data-start="228.02" data-end="230.48">I was able to understand these basic concepts.</span> <span data-start="231.66" data-end="236.2">I also got to know about Monad and Reactive Programming.</span> <span data-start="238.086" data-end="240.6">The most memorable thing that I remember from this study</span> <span data-start="240.7" data-end="242.8">was actually the advantages of using functional programming.</span> <span data-start="244.086" data-end="247.268">Since it connects simple pure functions,</span> <span data-start="247.469" data-end="251.253">it's less likely to have errors in a function, so it's more stable.</span> <span data-start="251.328" data-end="255.799">And it's more likely to be reused since it connects small functions.</span> <span data-start="255.8" data-end="261.399">And it's easy to understand higher logic. These three were the advantages.</span> <span data-start="262.243" data-end="264.671">It was very appealing at the time</span> <span data-start="264.968" data-end="266.884">but after studying,</span> <span data-start="267.06" data-end="269.696">other co-workers and I</span> <span data-start="269.945" data-end="272.715">still didn't catch the grasp on</span> <span data-start="274.353" data-end="276.32">what exactly the functionals were.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="276.722" data-end="282.081">I think this was because when we wrote for a real project,</span> <span data-start="282.181" data-end="286.718">this was the limitation of what we could apply</span> <span data-start="287.08" data-end="288.376">from what we've learned while studying.</span> <span data-start="288.401" data-end="294.054">Well, we could do more</span> <span data-start="294.129" data-end="297.269">but when we copied,</span> <span data-start="297.344" data-end="300">there was feedback that it didn't seem like functional programming.</span> <span data-start="300.1" data-end="302.4">So this was mostly what we wrote.</span> <span data-start="304.553" data-end="310.843">So we.. studied functional programming but it was still vague.</span> <span data-start="310.844" data-end="314.2">Just understanding the concepts, a year passed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="315.438" data-end="317.309">I went to a new company</span> <span data-start="317.31" data-end="319.7">and started a new project.</span> <span data-start="323.408" data-end="328.324">To show you simply, this is the app.</span> <span data-start="329.419" data-end="330.503">One moment.</span> <span data-start="332.575" data-end="334.516">Add a grid like this,</span> <span data-start="335.135" data-end="336.982">and from that cell slide,</span> <span data-start="337.683" data-end="339.783">which is the cancer cell</span> <span data-start="340.5" data-end="345.5">or the fat cell, is all marked.</span> <span data-start="345.6" data-end="349.542">It's the tool that helps process data.</span> <span data-start="357.697" data-end="359.292">Refactoring</span> <span data-start="360.455" data-end="362.699">this tool was the task given to me.</span> <span data-start="362.7" data-end="365.9">Because, before, only React and Canvas were applied</span> <span data-start="366.494" data-end="370.462">and it wasn't organized.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="370.463" data-end="371.3">Using Redux,</span> <span data-start="371.4" data-end="373.1">I was given the task to refactor it.</span> <span data-start="373.496" data-end="377.445">Like I wrote originally,</span> <span data-start="377.446" data-end="379.8">I naturally used combineReducers</span> <span data-start="380.013" data-end="381.556">and wrote the code.</span> <span data-start="382.933" data-end="385.034">When using the combine reducer,</span> <span data-start="385.113" data-end="390.231">it takes the state of the reducer</span> <span data-start="390.784" data-end="395.989">and see it as each domain like DB</span> <span data-start="396.558" data-end="399.212">and it separates the reducer completely.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="399.313" data-end="403.613">The connection between reducers can be made actions.</span> <span data-start="407.919" data-end="414.113">So let's say we are adding</span> <span data-start="414.212" data-end="417.527">a label to a display like this</span> <span data-start="417.777" data-end="422.832">I put together the key points here.</span> <span data-start="422.981" data-end="430.212">When you write a reducer to add a label like that</span> <span data-start="430.313" data-end="431.726">you need to use label type</span> <span data-start="431.727" data-end="434.613">and other information from grid reducer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="434.712" data-end="437.513">As the app gets more complex,</span> <span data-start="437.613" data-end="439.736">more information is going to be added.</span> <span data-start="441.096" data-end="443.78">When using combine reducer like this</span> <span data-start="443.854" data-end="445.399">in order to process this</span> <span data-start="445.4" data-end="448.681">you need to take information in the other reducer</span> <span data-start="448.712" data-end="451.433">and pass it onto the factors and parameters.</span> <span data-start="452.371" data-end="454.913">With more actions like these,</span> <span data-start="455.013" data-end="458.413">there is going to be more cases of having to pass onto the parameters.</span> <span data-start="461.587" data-end="466.025">Also, there was one other thing I was not happy with.</span> <span data-start="469.313" data-end="473.212">You can use a middleware when using redux,</span> <span data-start="473.313" data-end="478.245">and this middleware, takes care of ajax</span> <span data-start="478.246" data-end="485.212">or processes events that cause additional effects,</span> <span data-start="485.212" data-end="486.813">and loads other action</span> <span data-start="486.913" data-end="490.212">or processes loading other actions right away.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="491.679" data-end="497.726">Let's say we are writing reducer that exits</span> <span data-start="498.713" data-end="502.902">the selected grid here,</span> <span data-start="504.287" data-end="507.635">after writing the reducer exiting the grid</span> <span data-start="507.806" data-end="512.251">it needs to be processed along with the other reducer</span> <span data-start="513.091" data-end="517.357">although there is no api call</span> <span data-start="517.357" data-end="519.712">in order to simply load other action</span> <span data-start="519.813" data-end="525.512">the code for middleware must be written.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="527.122" data-end="530.432">And of course with more processes like these</span> <span data-start="530.433" data-end="534.486">unnecessary middleware code is going to increase.</span> <span data-start="535.081" data-end="537.213">So it's going to look like this.</span> <span data-start="540.507" data-end="543.512">So then we wondered</span> <span data-start="543.612" data-end="549.313">if there is another way to write it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="549.413" data-end="551.453">So we looked into redux documents</span> <span data-start="551.454" data-end="555.989">and there was a post called Beyond combineReducers.</span> <span data-start="555.99" data-end="558.896">It has been updated so it looks different from when I first saw it</span> <span data-start="558.896" data-end="560.712">but the basic information is the same.</span> <span data-start="560.837" data-end="564.135">Here, it talks about combine reducers, that</span> <span data-start="564.285" data-end="572.313">it can only cover simple cases.</span> <span data-start="573.807" data-end="575.25">And that there needs to be some kind of a customization?</span> <span data-start="575.324" data-end="578.858">or reducer logic is needed.</span> <span data-start="582.049" data-end="585.512">So I wanted to minimize having to pass factors into function</span> <span data-start="585.512" data-end="587.713">and write each reducer code separately</span> <span data-start="587.813" data-end="589.413">then in the redux middleware,</span> <span data-start="589.512" data-end="591.56">I wanted to write the reducer and customize it</span> <span data-start="591.957" data-end="596.112">so that it will only deal with additional effects.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="596.114" data-end="599.334">These are the purposes I started the works with.</span> <span data-start="602.653" data-end="606.313">There was something else that helped with that</span> <span data-start="606.413" data-end="608.713">If you scroll down to the previous document</span> <span data-start="608.813" data-end="611.913">it introduces a library called reduce-reducers</span> <span data-start="612.012" data-end="614.881">as another method.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="616.11" data-end="617.435">As you can see in the code here</span> <span data-start="618.402" data-end="622.612">it is a reducer function composition library</span> <span data-start="622.713" data-end="625.529">where you can execute different reducers</span> <span data-start="625.654" data-end="629.512">in order and finally make it into</span> <span data-start="629.612" data-end="630.813">one type of state.</span> <span data-start="631.778" data-end="635.112">This is the official document on reduce-reducers</span> <span data-start="635.213" data-end="642.603">I saw this format, and if I were to follow it exactly I would need to add a state</span> <span data-start="642.604" data-end="644.737">so I wanted to make it into a format I liked</span> <span data-start="645.257" data-end="647.913">by composing reducer like this</span> <span data-start="648.012" data-end="650.958">and tried writing it.</span> <span data-start="653.213" data-end="657.913">Actually I did not look into libraries composing reducers</span> <span data-start="658.556" data-end="661.512">closely at the time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="661.613" data-end="665.913">When you go through the documents in redux</span> <span data-start="666.012" data-end="668.113">there are so many libraries.</span> <span data-start="668.213" data-end="670.299">This is only part of the page</span> <span data-start="670.624" data-end="675.194">and there is a library called reducer ramda.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="675.195" data-end="679.447">There are so many reducer composing libraries</span> <span data-start="679.448" data-end="686.613">and I wanted to just simply start with something I knew about so I chose ramda.</span> <span data-start="687.999" data-end="693.713">Ramda.js focuses on currying and composition and it is a functional library</span> <span data-start="693.813" data-end="699.947">as I remembered from studying before,</span> <span data-start="699.948" data-end="702.713">so I wanted to give it a try.</span> <span data-start="703.83" data-end="710.713">Also, among these I used pipe which composes each function in order</span> <span data-start="713.804" data-end="716.413">as the main method.</span> <span data-start="717.75" data-end="722.913">Composing the functions is the main work but</span> <span data-start="723.012" data-end="725.087">I didn't use compose because</span> <span data-start="725.449" data-end="727.353">compose basically does its work</span> <span data-start="727.807" data-end="730.601">backwards,</span> <span data-start="730.948" data-end="733.73">so I did not think it would be natural to read them.</span> <span data-start="733.756" data-end="735.117">So I used pipe instead</span> <span data-start="739.541" data-end="742.612">so using this composition</span> <span data-start="742.983" data-end="746.913">I wrote the reducer exiting the grid earlier</span> <span data-start="748.77" data-end="755.482">Here, select label and select type</span> <span data-start="755.483" data-end="759.313">and select grid are separated like this. And there is reducer for each as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="759.486" data-end="759.986">This reducer</span> <span data-start="760.108" data-end="763.936">combining and finally made a reducer called</span> <span data-start="764.305" data-end="768.507">exitGrid. And each of the reducers</span> <span data-start="770.759" data-end="774.273">could be mapped in the action.</span> <span data-start="774.917" data-end="779.415">Seeing each reducer like this individually</span> <span data-start="780.72" data-end="783.473">as a separate function and writing them like this.</span> <span data-start="783.473" data-end="785.687">eventually rather than a switch</span> <span data-start="785.689" data-end="787.008">a reducer used to map formation</span> <span data-start="787.009" data-end="791.709">seemed to be better for writing. So that's why I wrote it like this.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1638.413" data-end="1642.802">So I thought I should separate them.</span> <span data-start="1642.901" data-end="1647.901">I realized that I was coding</span> <span data-start="1648.002" data-end="1649.521">just by using pipe to fit to the class.</span> <span data-start="1649.522" data-end="1651.681">That came to my mind.</span> <span data-start="1651.98" data-end="1654.701">So now, I changed the structure like this.</span> <span data-start="1656.058" data-end="1661.043">I exclusively modified the data</span> <span data-start="1661.966" data-end="1665.901">and using that data, I made the effects that would be passed at the end.</span> <span data-start="1666.002" data-end="1668.502">Then, all of them together are applied</span> <span data-start="1668.601" data-end="1672.802">to canvas context, and changed the overall data flow.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1672.901" data-end="1674.601">That is what I've been working on.</span> <span data-start="1675.566" data-end="1678.475">When you see this, the data structure was like this,</span> <span data-start="1678.637" data-end="1682.332">each was separated by canvas effects like this.</span> <span data-start="1682.802" data-end="1685.201">It's almost like action, right? It's now separated.</span> <span data-start="1687.058" data-end="1692.286">And the basic drawing functions with too much curry</span> <span data-start="1692.287" data-end="1695.502">are now neatly organized.</span> <span data-start="1696.023" data-end="1704.101">What's added is this effector map, which is added like a reducer map.</span> <span data-start="1705.513" data-end="1710.201">Then, the grid guide</span> <span data-start="1710.203" data-end="1715.602">on the drawing part, has a function that makes data.</span> <span data-start="1715.802" data-end="1717.601">Then it receives the data that was made</span> <span data-start="1717.701" data-end="1720.901">and the function that is practiced is typed.</span> <span data-start="1721.002" data-end="1723.502">Here too, the function is changed into</span> <span data-start="1723.601" data-end="1725.643">the function that processes the data first.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1728.669" data-end="1734.67">The final function also has a bit of context bound.</span> <span data-start="1735.562" data-end="1739.748">The context and the data weren't so far apart</span> <span data-start="1739.997" data-end="1744.866">In the new function, I made a function that only handles the data</span> <span data-start="1745.013" data-end="1748.725">and finally applies it to the text.</span> <span data-start="1748.725" data-end="1750.652">And the code is changed like this.</span> <span data-start="1751.119" data-end="1758.302">I lifted the Redux and the Canvas part and distributed them.</span> <span data-start="1758.822" data-end="1761.101">Surprisingly, after distributing,</span> <span data-start="1761.201" data-end="1765.002">there were a lot of corrections to be made.</span> <span data-start="1765.101" data-end="1768.101">Excluding a few components, all of the codes were modified.</span> <span data-start="1770.179" data-end="1775.7">There were only three minor issues that occurred for three months.</span> <span data-start="1775.701" data-end="1781.174">One thing that we could observe here is that, when we first learned about functional programming,</span> <span data-start="1785.872" data-end="1790.802">one of the advantages was the reliability.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1791.37" data-end="1795.802">The stability was something that was experienced.</span> <span data-start="1795.901" data-end="1800.196">And after writing each function,</span> <span data-start="1800.197" data-end="1801.302">it was highly reused.</span> <span data-start="1801.401" data-end="1805.002">And by turning Redux into one state,</span> <span data-start="1805.101" data-end="1808.502">selectors could reuse them in Redux</span> <span data-start="1808.601" data-end="1811.802">so a lot of codes could be reduced.</span> <span data-start="1812.594" data-end="1818.302">There was an uncertainty about</span> <span data-start="1818.401" data-end="1822.601">whether it was easy to notice the final logic.</span> <span data-start="1822.701" data-end="1825.401">Because, as I mentioned earlier,</span> <span data-start="1825.502" data-end="1831.502">in the written codes, there is a function called converge</span> <span data-start="1831.899" data-end="1836.502">or juxt function which use codes that only involve methods</span> <span data-start="1836.601" data-end="1839.547">found in functional programming.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1839.822" data-end="1844.502">So, a lot of effort is needed for other people to understand more</span> <span data-start="1844.601" data-end="1850.761">and maintain it.</span> <span data-start="1850.762" data-end="1854.002">So in that aspect, I gave this a triangle rank.</span> <span data-start="1854.77" data-end="1859.601">To sum up, I explained a few data structures and many operations.</span> <span data-start="1859.701" data-end="1865.201">such as currying and composition, and discriminated union.</span> <span data-start="1865.302" data-end="1869.302">As I was familiarizing with these concepts,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1869.401" data-end="1874.639">I learned something more important that</span> <span data-start="1874.937" data-end="1878.296">as you can see when I wrote the wrong flow,</span> <span data-start="1878.397" data-end="1880.431">In my opinion,</span> <span data-start="1880.707" data-end="1883.401">the data flow of the whole structure</span> <span data-start="1883.502" data-end="1886.002">is essential in functional programming</span> <span data-start="1887.737" data-end="1890.349">This is the end of my presentation.</span> </p>
