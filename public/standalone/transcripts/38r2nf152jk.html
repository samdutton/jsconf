<p><span data-start="22.61" data-end="23.61">So, give it up for them.</span> <span data-start="23.61" data-end="24.61">Are you ready?</span> <span data-start="24.61" data-end="25.61">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="25.61" data-end="26.61">Give it up for Julien.</span> <span data-start="26.61" data-end="27.61">[ Applause ] JULIEN: Hello, what's up, everybody?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="27.61" data-end="28.61">Welcome to trans eye for the cis ally.</span> <span data-start="28.61" data-end="29.61">My name is Julien, I use they/them pro nouns.</span> <span data-start="29.61" data-end="30.61">I used to be a cartoonist, now a software engineer.</span> <span data-start="30.61" data-end="31.61">I have been working as a programmer for the last four and a half years or so.</span> <span data-start="31.61" data-end="32.61">I work at a company called Artemis.</span> <span data-start="32.61" data-end="33.61">This is an indoor agriculture management platform.</span> <span data-start="33.61" data-end="34.61">We are hiring, of course.</span> <span data-start="34.61" data-end="37.28">So feel free to talk to me later.</span> <span data-start="37.28" data-end="42.73">In my spare time, I enjoy power lifting, hanging out with my really cute dog.</span> <span data-start="42.73" data-end="47.3">His name JPEG.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="47.3" data-end="51.91">That always gets a really big laugh from programming conferences.</span> <span data-start="51.91" data-end="57.149">I like to obsessively read about Freddie Mercury's life.</span> <span data-start="57.149" data-end="62.34">And finally, I'm like kind of a Queer Eye super fan.</span> <span data-start="62.34" data-end="65.17">So, what is Queer Eye?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="65.17" data-end="70.32">Before we get to the actual topic of the talk, I feel like I should give a little background</span> <span data-start="70.32" data-end="73.73">regarding Queer Eye just so we're all on the same page.</span> <span data-start="73.73" data-end="78.73">Queer Eye is a show on Netflix, currently, that on its surface is a makeover show.</span> <span data-start="78.73" data-end="85.78">Five gay guys take one person each episode, make over their hair, clothes, their house,</span> <span data-start="85.78" data-end="91.89">their cooking ability, but most importantly, their feelings.</span> <span data-start="91.89" data-end="96.36">Usually it's someone who's had kind of a hard time in their life and they've struggled and</span> <span data-start="96.36" data-end="101.72">the fab five, as they're called, come together to help them get their whole life together.</span> <span data-start="101.72" data-end="105.54">Almost every episode of the show ends up being pretty emotional.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="105.54" data-end="110.27">So, if you've never watched it before and you really to want watch a feel good kind</span> <span data-start="110.27" data-end="115">of tearjerker show, I would recommend it.</span> <span data-start="115" data-end="118.33">I should also mention that before I go on, even though I'm definitely a super fan of</span> <span data-start="118.33" data-end="119.84">the show, I don't think it's perfect.</span> <span data-start="119.84" data-end="124.83">There have been a lot of really valid critiques about aspects of the show.</span> <span data-start="124.83" data-end="128.14">Even though I'm not going to talk about those things right now, I'm happy to talk about</span> <span data-start="128.14" data-end="131.54">various critiques of Queer Eye in the hall or on Twitter.</span> <span data-start="131.54" data-end="134.82">If you want to do that, let me know.</span> <span data-start="134.82" data-end="139.67">So, moving on, what does this have to do with what we're talking about right now?</span> <span data-start="139.67" data-end="142.1">This talk is called trans eye for the cis ally.</span> <span data-start="142.1" data-end="147.86">Which is after the original Queer Eye, called Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.</span> <span data-start="147.86" data-end="149.37">I've never watched the original.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="149.37" data-end="151.24">Don't talk to me about it.</span> <span data-start="151.24" data-end="155.38">I don't know that much about it at all.</span> <span data-start="155.38" data-end="158.24">It's honestly pretty different from what I've heard from the modern one.</span> <span data-start="158.24" data-end="164.35">In this case, I'm the trans eye and you're probably the cis ally.</span> <span data-start="164.35" data-end="168.07">If you're here, you are likely interested in making your workplaces and events more</span> <span data-start="168.07" data-end="169.93">inclusive for trans people.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="169.93" data-end="172.17">Which is great.</span> <span data-start="172.17" data-end="176.36">The truth is, there are so many small things and some larger things that you can do to</span> <span data-start="176.36" data-end="181.47">not only give your existing trans coworkers and community members a good experience, but</span> <span data-start="181.47" data-end="187.25">also to make sure that even if you don't currently have any trans coworkers or community members,</span> <span data-start="187.25" data-end="192.06">you're providing a space and experience that will be welcoming in the future.</span> <span data-start="192.06" data-end="193.67">So, let's start with the basics.</span> <span data-start="193.67" data-end="197.63">Not even the basics, but like the basics of the basics.</span> <span data-start="197.63" data-end="199.569">So, what is trans?</span> <span data-start="199.569" data-end="202.09">What is cis?</span> <span data-start="202.09" data-end="206.25">The simple answer is that trans means you don't identify\h or transgender means you</span> <span data-start="206.25" data-end="210.3">don't identify with the gender you were assigned at birth.</span> <span data-start="210.3" data-end="211.3">That's it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="211.3" data-end="216.56">Not everybody who feels this way ends up identifying with or using the word trans to identify themselves.</span> <span data-start="216.56" data-end="219.69">But the word is there if they want to use it.</span> <span data-start="219.69" data-end="225.39">For example, a trans man was assigned female at birth and figured out later that he was</span> <span data-start="225.39" data-end="226.39">male.</span> <span data-start="226.39" data-end="230.37">And a trans woman would be someone who is assigned male at birth and later realized</span> <span data-start="230.37" data-end="232.12">that she was female.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="232.12" data-end="235.05">It's not that complicated.</span> <span data-start="235.05" data-end="236.05">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="236.05" data-end="238.2">Cis just means you do identify as the gender you were assigned at birth.</span> <span data-start="238.2" data-end="239.31">That's most people.</span> <span data-start="239.31" data-end="244.53">If the doctor said it's a boy when you were born, and you're a boy, congratulations, you're</span> <span data-start="244.53" data-end="245.53">cis.</span> <span data-start="245.53" data-end="247.29">Not hard.</span> <span data-start="247.29" data-end="256.15">Transgender and cis\h people can't be transgendered and cis gendered.</span> <span data-start="256.15" data-end="260.459">We jokingly say this, I trans'd you.</span> <span data-start="260.459" data-end="263.24">But you can't do that.</span> <span data-start="263.24" data-end="266.04">If you want to be respectful, use the words correctly.</span> <span data-start="266.04" data-end="273.95">And non binary, you're somewhere outside of the male/female binary.</span> <span data-start="273.95" data-end="278.1">There's a few common misconceptions about what non binary means.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="278.1" data-end="282.11">It doesn't mean gender neutral or androgynous.</span> <span data-start="282.11" data-end="286.87">Or assigned female at birth and leans masculine.</span> <span data-start="286.87" data-end="290.77">Non binary, it could mean that for some people.</span> <span data-start="290.77" data-end="295.9">There's not one way to be non binary or two or three ways.</span> <span data-start="295.9" data-end="299.62">It means you don't fit into the binary and this is the word you have chosen to describe</span> <span data-start="299.62" data-end="300.68">yourself.</span> <span data-start="300.68" data-end="304.78">Technically, it falls under the trans umbrella.</span> <span data-start="304.78" data-end="309.32">So, some non binary people don't consider themselves trans.</span> <span data-start="309.32" data-end="310.63">This is fine.</span> <span data-start="310.63" data-end="314.25">If someone tells you they're non binary and they're not trans, just say cool.</span> <span data-start="314.25" data-end="315.86">Serve different.</span> <span data-start="315.86" data-end="320.02">It's okay if you don't understand.</span> <span data-start="320.02" data-end="325.37">Something really important that cis people don't get is it's okay for you to not understand</span> <span data-start="325.37" data-end="329.56">trans people in order to respect us and treat us with dignity.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="329.56" data-end="332.22">I don't know what it's like to be cis or straight.</span> <span data-start="332.22" data-end="335.84">It doesn't stop me from being able to respect others.</span> <span data-start="335.84" data-end="339.69">You don't have to totally understand what it's like to be someone in order to respect</span> <span data-start="339.69" data-end="342.12">someone.</span> <span data-start="342.12" data-end="343.669">Pronouns are a really good example.</span> <span data-start="343.669" data-end="347.35">So, when someone first comes out as trans or you meet a trans person.</span> <span data-start="347.35" data-end="349.57">They might want to use different pronouns.</span> <span data-start="349.57" data-end="355.12">To you, they might not look like someone who uses the pronouns.</span> <span data-start="355.12" data-end="359.46">Or maybe they/them pronouns and you have never done that before.</span> <span data-start="359.46" data-end="360.46">Try.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="360.46" data-end="364.669">All you have to do is try, you don't have to get it.</span> <span data-start="364.669" data-end="371.21">If you mess up, just quickly apologize, correct yourself, don't make a big deal out of it</span> <span data-start="371.21" data-end="373.77">and eventually it will be second nature to you.</span> <span data-start="373.77" data-end="380.31">So, while we're talking about pronouns, I should mention as an aside that a person's</span> <span data-start="380.31" data-end="383.03">pronouns are just a person's pronouns.</span> <span data-start="383.03" data-end="384.699">My pronouns are they/them.</span> <span data-start="384.699" data-end="387.54">It's become common for people to say preferred pronouns.</span> <span data-start="387.54" data-end="390.92">But only when they're talking about trans people.</span> <span data-start="390.92" data-end="391.96">Everybody has pronouns.</span> <span data-start="391.96" data-end="396.11">They're not preferred, they're just pronouns.</span> <span data-start="396.11" data-end="400.139">Also worth mentioning, some people have done this in my life in the past.</span> <span data-start="400.139" data-end="404.38">Some people think they can use they/them for everyone because it's a simple solution to</span> <span data-start="404.38" data-end="407.08">having to remember the pronouns for everybody.</span> <span data-start="407.08" data-end="409.06">This is not great.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="409.06" data-end="415.229">If you have a trans person using he/him pronouns, and you call him they, you're still mis gendering</span> <span data-start="415.229" data-end="416.82">him.</span> <span data-start="416.82" data-end="417.82">Think of it this way.</span> <span data-start="417.82" data-end="422.33">You have to think of different names for everyone you know.</span> <span data-start="422.33" data-end="427.639">There's probably three different gender pronouns that you have to learn.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="427.639" data-end="431.13">Compared to learning all those names, it's honestly not that hard.</span> <span data-start="431.13" data-end="437.33">So, now that we've discussed some basics, let's move on to the next level and talk about</span> <span data-start="437.33" data-end="442.51">what you can actually do right now to make things better and more welcoming for trans</span> <span data-start="442.51" data-end="447.199">and non binary people at your company or your event or your meetup group or whatever.</span> <span data-start="447.199" data-end="449.949">So, back to pronouns.</span> <span data-start="449.949" data-end="455.42">For me, as a non binary, it's impossible for someone to guess what my pronouns are just</span> <span data-start="455.42" data-end="457.39">by looking at me.</span> <span data-start="457.39" data-end="461.979">My life is a series of awkward situations in which I have to figure out how to tell</span> <span data-start="461.979" data-end="469.33">a single person or a few people or a whole room of people they use they/them pronouns.</span> <span data-start="469.33" data-end="471.75">This is the case for binary trans people too.</span> <span data-start="471.75" data-end="475.79">Just because I have to do it all the time doesn't mean I'm good at it.</span> <span data-start="475.79" data-end="477.07">Or that I'm used to it.</span> <span data-start="477.07" data-end="479.19">I kind of hate it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="479.19" data-end="485.09">So, a really simple way to mitigate this is just be proactive and make sure that people</span> <span data-start="485.09" data-end="488.13">are given every opportunity state their pronouns.</span> <span data-start="488.13" data-end="493.27">At the beginning of a meeting when a new person is interesting introduced to the company or</span> <span data-start="493.27" data-end="497.33">whatever, just have whoever is running the meeting start by being, like, my name is so</span> <span data-start="497.33" data-end="498.33">and so.</span> <span data-start="498.33" data-end="500.57">My pronouns are, you know, they/them or he/him.</span> <span data-start="500.57" data-end="504.84">And just have all the employees just kind of be an example.</span> <span data-start="504.84" data-end="506.97">Make it a normal thing.</span> <span data-start="506.97" data-end="512.01">If you have an employee page on your website, you can have people include their pronouns.</span> <span data-start="512.01" data-end="517.05">This also helps prospective employees know that you tend to be a trans inclusive space.</span> <span data-start="517.05" data-end="521.339">It's something I look at when I'm looking at people's job pages.</span> <span data-start="521.339" data-end="525.12">If they have pronouns, cool.</span> <span data-start="525.12" data-end="529.8">Honestly the bar\h it's slightly above the worst.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="529.8" data-end="531.639">That's great.</span> <span data-start="531.639" data-end="535.04">So, same goes for events.</span> <span data-start="535.04" data-end="539.79">Anywhere a person's name is listed, if they want to include their pronouns you can include</span> <span data-start="539.79" data-end="540.899">their pronouns as well.</span> <span data-start="540.899" data-end="545.05">You can offer pronoun stickers or pins like we have here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="545.05" data-end="549.8">Or just have a way people can write their pronouns on their badges large enough that</span> <span data-start="549.8" data-end="551.35">people can see them easily.</span> <span data-start="551.35" data-end="554.079">Something I really like about these pins actually.</span> <span data-start="554.079" data-end="558.29">I have been to a lot of conferences with a lot of pronoun things and I like this because</span> <span data-start="558.29" data-end="560.74">you can read it easily, it's large.</span> <span data-start="560.74" data-end="561.98">You can put it anywhere you want.</span> <span data-start="561.98" data-end="563.98">You can make is visible.</span> <span data-start="563.98" data-end="568.829">I think that's the best solution.</span> <span data-start="568.829" data-end="573.949">Even if you're cis, put the pin on and whatever, write your pronouns.</span> <span data-start="573.949" data-end="577.899">Because you can encourage other people to do the same.</span> <span data-start="577.899" data-end="581.05">Just make sure like when you introduce yourself to people you say your pronouns.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="581.05" data-end="583">Just, you know, that sort of thing.</span> <span data-start="583" data-end="586.899">So, this picture of pronoun stickers is from a meetup where I live in Portland.</span> <span data-start="586.899" data-end="591.509">That's called Donut.JS, which is pretty great.</span> <span data-start="591.509" data-end="595.61">Yeah, make sure people know if they're interviewing candidates to introduce themselves with their</span> <span data-start="595.61" data-end="600.73">name and pronouns and ask if the candidates want to do the same.</span> <span data-start="600.73" data-end="605.24">Your company or event has a Slack, make sure everyone know they can include their pronouns</span> <span data-start="605.24" data-end="609.47">or have the leaders include their pronouns in the profile.</span> <span data-start="609.47" data-end="611.86">Make it a thing not only the trans people have to deal with.</span> <span data-start="611.86" data-end="614.16">It kinds of sucks.</span> <span data-start="614.16" data-end="617.44">And also something I haven't written in my notes.</span> <span data-start="617.44" data-end="620.999">I'm going ad lib, whoa.</span> </p>
