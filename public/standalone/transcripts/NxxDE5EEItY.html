data-end="37.07">creo hola familia ah bueno vamos a pasar</span> <span data-start="37.07" data-end="41.51">in des por que ama facil para me ah so</span> <span data-start="41.51" data-end="43.79">yeah add my talk is called sleepy map</span> <span data-start="43.79" data-end="47.089">style geo canvas design with caro CSS</span> <span data-start="47.089" data-end="49.55">and my name is a vaguely moser and i'm</span> <span data-start="49.55" data-end="51.14">from the mozilla science lab which is a</span> <span data-start="51.14" data-end="53.69">part of mozilla that build open-source</span> <span data-start="53.69" data-end="55.489">science software and its includes</span> <span data-start="55.489" data-end="57.86">geospatial geospatial scientific</span> <span data-start="57.86" data-end="61.22">software so this is making maps and all</span> <span data-start="61.22" data-end="63.05">of my slides or down at that link there</span> <span data-start="63.05" data-end="64.85">too so if you want to follow along I</span> <span data-start="64.85" data-end="66.65">have all of the links in the in the</span> <span data-start="66.65" data-end="69.77">notes below so the backgrounds isn't a</span> <span data-start="69.77" data-end="72.29">map you might have noticed it's a comic</span> <span data-start="72.29" data-end="74.659">so I'm going to reference comics as well</span> <span data-start="74.659" data-end="77.12">just like Rachel did in her talk kind of</span> <span data-start="77.12" data-end="79.25">except I'm not a comic creator i'm more</span> <span data-start="79.25" data-end="82.759">of a comic consumer but i like comics as</span> <span data-start="82.759" data-end="84.59">a metaphor for framing how we design</span> <span data-start="84.59" data-end="87.469">maps because maps are kind of built with</span> <span data-start="87.469" data-end="89.78">this similar story like cell structure</span> <span data-start="89.78" data-end="92.359">right maps are composed of tiles usually</span> <span data-start="92.359" data-end="93.89">if you're dealing with raster maps and</span> <span data-start="93.89" data-end="95.6">they kind of compose next to each other</span> <span data-start="95.6" data-end="99.14">to build a story and CSS supplies style</span> <span data-start="99.14" data-end="100.369">to that and so i'm going to talk a</span> <span data-start="100.369" data-end="103.219">little bit about how Carlos CSS kind of</span> <span data-start="103.219" data-end="106.34">gives a lot of punch and and and beauty</span> <span data-start="106.34" data-end="112.159">to maps so uh I like to start talks</span> <span data-start="112.159" data-end="114.74">talking about how we process things with</span> <span data-start="114.74" data-end="117.829">our vision our eyes are kind of</span> <span data-start="117.829" data-end="119.539">reflexive processors right they're</span> <span data-start="119.539" data-end="121.189">pretty sophisticated process or is much</span> <span data-start="121.189" data-end="123.02">more sophisticated than the machines are</span> <span data-start="123.02" data-end="126.439">at processing our 3d world understanding</span> <span data-start="126.439" data-end="129.74">depth perceiving what areas need to be</span> <span data-start="129.74" data-end="132.89">prioritized and also colorizing our</span> <span data-start="132.89" data-end="133.97">world and you don't have to write a new</span> <span data-start="133.97" data-end="135.83">rules for it depending on the quality of</span> <span data-start="135.83" data-end="136.94">your vision your eyes just kind of</span> <span data-start="136.94" data-end="138.44">naturally adjust to this right and</span> <span data-start="138.44" data-end="140.6">that's the kind of reflexive design that</span> <span data-start="140.6" data-end="141.86">we hope to achieve on the web but</span> <span data-start="141.86" data-end="143.54">there's usually some latency right</span> <span data-start="143.54" data-end="145.25">there's usually some loading screen with</span> <span data-start="145.25" data-end="145.54">web</span> <span data-start="145.54" data-end="147.4">visualizations things are kind of slow</span> <span data-start="147.4" data-end="149.98">so it's not as reflexive as with your</span> <span data-start="149.98" data-end="151.9">eyes but we'd like it to be and I'm</span> <span data-start="151.9" data-end="153.069">going to show you how we can make it</span> <span data-start="153.069" data-end="156.25">better with vector mapping too so this</span> <span data-start="156.25" data-end="158.5">is where I'm from from New York this is</span> <span data-start="158.5" data-end="161.709">a map from Wonder Woman comic I like to</span> <span data-start="161.709" data-end="163.9">start out with this too because it kind</span> <span data-start="163.9" data-end="166.65">of brings up the mythology of maps so</span> <span data-start="166.65" data-end="169.239">when you design maps you know or when</span> <span data-start="169.239" data-end="170.439">you use maps you don't really think</span> <span data-start="170.439" data-end="174.04">about how accurate they might be right</span> <span data-start="174.04" data-end="175.78">unless it's inaccurate and you know it's</span> <span data-start="175.78" data-end="177.01">inaccurate because you're in the place</span> <span data-start="177.01" data-end="180.069">that is inaccurate but really someone</span> <span data-start="180.069" data-end="182.5">had to draw that at some point even if</span> <span data-start="182.5" data-end="184.959">they had machine aids someone had to</span> <span data-start="184.959" data-end="187.329">kind of design the way we appreciate a</span> <span data-start="187.329" data-end="191.53">3d globe in a flat 2d canvas and so</span> <span data-start="191.53" data-end="193.45">there's a mythology beyond it behind it</span> <span data-start="193.45" data-end="195.129">that not a lot of people really</span> <span data-start="195.129" data-end="196.78">appreciate or they don't you know really</span> <span data-start="196.78" data-end="198.22">think about when they use maps for</span> <span data-start="198.22" data-end="202.409">navigation so it's not unlike designing</span> <span data-start="202.409" data-end="206.23">mythological maps for comics either real</span> <span data-start="206.23" data-end="208.45">mapping also relies on some assumptions</span> <span data-start="208.45" data-end="212.739">and some constraints and you kind of</span> <span data-start="212.739" data-end="214.599">have to give in to some of the errors</span> <span data-start="214.599" data-end="216.97">that are quite natural in building 2d</span> <span data-start="216.97" data-end="219.579">maps so this is the canvas that I</span> <span data-start="219.579" data-end="222.159">typically work on this is cardo or this</span> <span data-start="222.159" data-end="224.5">is osm openstreetmap who knows about</span> <span data-start="224.5" data-end="227.62">openstreetmap everyone almost hopefully</span> <span data-start="227.62" data-end="232">some people okay openstreetmap is kind</span> <span data-start="232" data-end="233.68">of like the Wikipedia for base maps</span> <span data-start="233.68" data-end="236.26">right people can go in and edit their</span> <span data-start="236.26" data-end="237.37">own communities so it's a</span> <span data-start="237.37" data-end="240.34">community-driven project and it's quite</span> <span data-start="240.34" data-end="242.199">robust in some areas and not so much in</span> <span data-start="242.199" data-end="244.629">others but I like to show this as an</span> <span data-start="244.629" data-end="246.4">animated chip because it shows me</span> <span data-start="246.4" data-end="247.87">panning and zooming left and right and</span> <span data-start="247.87" data-end="250.599">also zooming in infinitely and I don't</span> <span data-start="250.599" data-end="253.06">think people who design for the web or</span> <span data-start="253.06" data-end="255.609">even just regular you know charts and</span> <span data-start="255.609" data-end="257.949">bar graphs really think about how</span> <span data-start="257.949" data-end="259.989">complex this canvas is because you have</span> <span data-start="259.989" data-end="262.599">to design for the zoo II interface that</span> <span data-start="262.599" data-end="265.539">people expect to naturally adjust as</span> <span data-start="265.539" data-end="267.46">they zoom and they have very little</span> <span data-start="267.46" data-end="269.8">patience for it when it doesn't work and</span> <span data-start="269.8" data-end="272.11">then they pan infinitely left and right</span> <span data-start="272.11" data-end="276.19">so the canvas is infinite and and that's</span> <span data-start="276.19" data-end="277.47">a pretty serious</span> <span data-start="277.47" data-end="279.69">straight for development and also to</span> <span data-start="279.69" data-end="281.79">when it pans left you'll also see that</span> <span data-start="281.79" data-end="284.37">there are these blocks of gray let you</span> <span data-start="284.37" data-end="287.04">see right now so those are tiles loading</span> <span data-start="287.04" data-end="289.23">right so you appreciate the canvas as</span> <span data-start="289.23" data-end="291.77">being infinite because you can move but</span> <span data-start="291.77" data-end="294.27">but it's actually limited to your</span> <span data-start="294.27" data-end="295.77">browser screen usually if you're dealing</span> <span data-start="295.77" data-end="300.8">with raster maps or maps that use tiles</span> <span data-start="300.8" data-end="304.14">so this is from a talk that I saw in New</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="304.14" data-end="308.28">York very minimalistic slides but the</span> <span data-start="308.28" data-end="310.92">developer of a small mapping library I</span> <span data-start="310.92" data-end="313.95">think called simple tiles at ProPublica</span> <span data-start="313.95" data-end="316.05">which is a news investigative journalism</span> <span data-start="316.05" data-end="320.28">organization in in New York and he did a</span> <span data-start="320.28" data-end="323.28">lot of work with satellite imagery for</span> <span data-start="323.28" data-end="325.29">maps so he was talking about how slippy</span> <span data-start="325.29" data-end="326.64">maps which are the maps that you saw</span> <span data-start="326.64" data-end="329.07">here because you can slip around right</span> <span data-start="329.07" data-end="332.22">slippy mats slippy maps are optimized</span> <span data-start="332.22" data-end="334.56">for location and wayfinding and not for</span> <span data-start="334.56" data-end="337.68">aw which is so sad when that's what you</span> <span data-start="337.68" data-end="339.39">do for a living right you think that</span> <span data-start="339.39" data-end="341.22">someone just said at a conference that</span> <span data-start="341.22" data-end="343.8">your stuff is boring and not awesome and</span> <span data-start="343.8" data-end="346.919">it's usually utilitarian so this is a</span> <span data-start="346.919" data-end="348.54">similar block so I make a lot of maps</span> <span data-start="348.54" data-end="350.58">but I also make a lot of charts and</span> <span data-start="350.58" data-end="353.58">graphs with geodata and and I started</span> <span data-start="353.58" data-end="355.41">thinking a lot about this idea that maps</span> <span data-start="355.41" data-end="357.36">weren't particularly awesome and how we</span> <span data-start="357.36" data-end="359.88">could convince people otherwise so this</span> <span data-start="359.88" data-end="361.77">is a slippy map you can't see it sliding</span> <span data-start="361.77" data-end="363.419">because it's just an image but it's an</span> <span data-start="363.419" data-end="365.55">iso map of iceland and what that means</span> <span data-start="365.55" data-end="368.01">that has little iso lines that indicate</span> <span data-start="368.01" data-end="370.5">elevation so if you zoomed in you could</span> <span data-start="370.5" data-end="372.03">see those little iso lines you can kind</span> <span data-start="372.03" data-end="373.29">of see them over there where it's more</span> <span data-start="373.29" data-end="376.59">yellow but this was built in card ODB</span> <span data-start="376.59" data-end="377.94">which is the company that I worked for</span> <span data-start="377.94" data-end="381.36">before Mozilla and I worked on a bunch</span> <span data-start="381.36" data-end="382.89">of educational materials to teach people</span> <span data-start="382.89" data-end="384.93">how to build maps like this and a lot of</span> <span data-start="384.93" data-end="387.6">documentation on CSS to teach people how</span> <span data-start="387.6" data-end="390.96">to design maps like this it's beautiful</span> <span data-start="390.96" data-end="392.37">right you wouldn't necessarily use it</span> <span data-start="392.37" data-end="394.47">for location or wayfinding you wouldn't</span> <span data-start="394.47" data-end="398.3">hike across Iceland using this map but</span> <span data-start="398.3" data-end="400.89">but you can appreciate how beautiful and</span> <span data-start="400.89" data-end="404.01">artistic is and this is another one it's</span> <span data-start="404.01" data-end="406.71">a really bad jiff of</span> <span data-start="406.71" data-end="409.23">app that uses torque j/s which is a</span> <span data-start="409.23" data-end="412.2">library developed by cart 0 DB which is</span> <span

data-end="419.31">but it's a time series data map or</span> <span data-start="419.31" data-end="421.86">mapping library and what that means is</span> <span data-start="421.86" data-end="424.41">you can animate time series information</span> <span data-start="424.41" data-end="425.88">across a map if you have a time stamp</span> <span data-start="425.88" data-end="428.31">associated with any of
