<p><span data-start="22.08" data-end="26.01">North's shirts so what I'm here to talk</span> <span data-start="26.01" data-end="29.16">about today is a JavaScript framework we</span> <span data-start="29.16" data-end="32.969">created called cappuccino just out of</span> <span data-start="32.969" data-end="35.04">curiosity how many of you have heard of</span> <span data-start="35.04" data-end="36.48">it just so i know whether i should focus</span> <span data-start="36.48" data-end="40.68">on okay okay good so something we like</span> <span data-start="40.68" data-end="43.079">to say a lot and we always try to start</span> <span data-start="43.079" data-end="44.61">our presentations this way is by</span> <span data-start="44.61" data-end="46.23">describing exactly what it's for and</span> <span data-start="46.23" data-end="48.899">what it's not for cappuccino is for what</span> <span data-start="48.899" data-end="51.12">we call desktop-class applications and</span> <span data-start="51.12" data-end="53.67">by that we mean kind of the applications</span> <span data-start="53.67" data-end="55.559">that you used to expect running on the</span> <span data-start="55.559" data-end="57.239">desktop and a lot of people thought</span> <span data-start="57.239" data-end="59.129">would never make it to the web but are</span> <span data-start="59.129" data-end="61.379">more and more going there today so you</span> <span data-start="61.379" data-end="63.69">know we like to think of the web as this</span> <span data-start="63.69" data-end="65.64">giant spectrum right and when the web</span> <span data-start="65.64" data-end="68.28">first started it was had this kind of</span> <span data-start="68.28" data-end="70.02">web page in mind you know the</span> <span data-start="70.02" data-end="71.97">traditional restful web something like</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="71.97" data-end="73.77">New York Times just a bunch of pages</span> <span data-start="73.77" data-end="76.2">connected by hyperlinks and then over</span> <span data-start="76.2" data-end="78.33">time they got a little more dynamic</span> <span data-start="78.33" data-end="80.909">things like amazon com now amazon com</span> <span data-start="80.909" data-end="83.67">still fits this original vision of the</span> <span data-start="83.67" data-end="85.77">web really well but you can't deny that</span> <span data-start="85.77" data-end="87.6">it's not an application right you can</span> <span data-start="87.6" data-end="88.92">you can put your credit card number and</span> <span data-start="88.92" data-end="91.17">there thus it's an application so it</span> <span data-start="91.17" data-end="93.38">does things as well as present things</span> <span data-start="93.38" data-end="95.67">then you have things like Facebook which</span> <span data-start="95.67" data-end="99.06">are like exactly in the middle they are</span> <span data-start="99.06" data-end="101.46">very restful right every single user has</span> <span data-start="101.46" data-end="102.96">their own page and you know that pages</span> <span data-start="102.96" data-end="105.149">and change and everything but on the</span> <span data-start="105.149" data-end="107.25">other hand every single page can have</span> <span data-start="107.25" data-end="109.92">like 30 different apps running on it so</span> <span data-start="109.92" data-end="111.479">this is like something that's very</span> <span data-start="111.479" data-end="114.149">unique to the web and then on the far</span> <span data-start="114.149" data-end="116.369">right of the spectrum you have things</span> <span data-start="116.369" data-end="118.229">like Google Maps and Google Maps is</span> <span data-start="118.229" data-end="119.82">actually a really great example of this</span> <span data-start="119.82" data-end="122.04">kind of app because Microsoft actually</span> <span data-start="122.04" data-end="123.63">originally argued against the web</span> <span data-start="123.63" data-end="125.969">platform by saying they'll never be able</span> <span data-start="125.969" data-end="128.55">to do something like Maps well they were</span> <span data-start="128.55" data-end="131.28">wrong and this kind of kicked off the</span> <span data-start="131.28" data-end="132.67">revolution of doing</span> <span data-start="132.67" data-end="134.44">incredibly dynamic things things you'd</span> <span data-start="134.44" data-end="136.78">only expect on the desktop before on the</span> <span data-start="136.78" data-end="141.37">web so we really wanted to build this</span> <span data-start="141.37" data-end="144.28">kind of application on the web like</span> <span data-start="144.28" data-end="148.03">three years ago or something something</span> <span data-start="148.03" data-end="150.94">like that and the problem was that the</span> <span data-start="150.94" data-end="153.19">tools for doing it even though the web</span> <span data-start="153.19" data-end="155.17">was capable of doing it the tools</span> <span data-start="155.17" data-end="157.569">weren't really there to do it and it's</span> <span data-start="157.569" data-end="160.269">not because the tools were bad it's that</span> <span data-start="160.269" data-end="161.44">the tools focused on different things</span> <span data-start="161.44" data-end="163.39">right the tools were really you know</span> <span data-start="163.39" data-end="164.86">optimized for building things like new</span> <span data-start="164.86" data-end="167.53">york times or amazon.com that sort of</span> <span data-start="167.53" data-end="169.66">thing you know just when Google Maps</span> <span data-start="169.66" data-end="171.25">first came out no one had already made a</span> <span data-start="171.25" data-end="174.34">framework for it for anything so we</span> <span data-start="174.34" data-end="175.989">wanted to make a framework that really</span> <span data-start="175.989" data-end="177.58">targeted this right hand of the spectrum</span> <span data-start="177.58" data-end="180.13">what we call desktop-class applications</span> <span data-start="180.13" data-end="181.87">and you can really tell that this is</span> <span data-start="181.87" data-end="183.4">necessary because if you go hit view</span> <span data-start="183.4" data-end="185.29">source on any one of these applications</span> <span data-start="185.29" data-end="186.37">you know one of the great things of the</span> <span data-start="186.37" data-end="188.14">web you'll see that all of them have</span> <span data-start="188.14" data-end="190.69">basically done each other's job over and</span> <span data-start="190.69" data-end="193.06">over again right meebo is a great</span> <span data-start="193.06" data-end="195.67">example you know they me bows I use that</span> <span data-start="195.67" data-end="197.89">instead of ichat a lot and it's a really</span> <span data-start="197.89" data-end="200.29">great web app yet they have to put so</span> <span data-start="200.29" data-end="202.81">many resources into drawing windows and</span> <span data-start="202.81" data-end="204.91">drawing buttons and basically putting</span> <span data-start="204.91" data-end="207.28">together a windowing system and it</span> <span data-start="207.28" data-end="210.01">really sucks that for a chat application</span> <span data-start="210.01" data-end="212.68">there you know strategic advantage to be</span> <span data-start="212.68" data-end="214.81">we hired 20 people to write a windowing</span> <span data-start="214.81" data-end="216.31">system that that's not what the web</span> <span data-start="216.31" data-end="217.78">should be right that should be a solved</span> <span data-start="217.78" data-end="219.43">problem and you should be able to focus</span> <span data-start="219.43" data-end="222.94">on what makes your application unique so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="222.94" data-end="224.53">I want to give you an example of the</span> <span data-start="224.53" data-end="226.51">first step we wrote using this framework</span> <span data-start="226.51" data-end="229.42">it's called 280 slides and I will go</span> <span data-start="229.42" data-end="237.25">ahead and do that right now</span> <span data-start="237.26" data-end="241.36">go</span> <span data-start="241.37" data-end="243.17">so this is Twitty slides it's kind of</span> <span data-start="243.17" data-end="244.879">like keynote or powerpoint on the web</span> <span data-start="244.879" data-end="246.59">and it's running in Safari and you can</span> <span data-start="246.59" data-end="249.86">of course do you expect to be able to do</span> <span data-start="249.86" data-end="252.14">you know kind of make a title and set</span> <span data-start="252.14" data-end="254.06">the font or whatever but again we really</span> <span data-start="254.06" data-end="256.579">wanted that desktop feel so we really</span> <span data-start="256.579" data-end="258.019">tried to get media right so you know</span> <span data-start="258.019" data-end="259.639">we've got shapes and you can do whatever</span> <span data-start="259.639" data-end="261.019">you want with them and this will work in</span> <span data-start="261.019" data-end="263.66">you know IE or firefox or whatever and</span> <span data-start="263.66" data-end="265.43">we don't stop there you know we let you</span> <span data-start="265.43" data-end="267.59">do any arbitrary media so you can do a</span> <span data-start="267.59" data-end="269.33">search for an image on google images you</span> <span data-start="269.33" data-end="271.52">can drag that in you know this is just</span> <span data-start="271.52" data-end="272.78">going to work it's going to be fast and</span> <span data-start="272.78" data-end="274.94">of course just like on the desktop all</span> <span data-start="274.94" data-end="276.55">your key bindings should work right so</span> <span data-start="276.55" data-end="278.51">copy paste should work and that</span> <span data-start="278.51" data-end="280.01">shouldn't be just bound to text or</span> <span data-start="280.01" data-end="281.66">images I should be able to do it you</span> <span data-start="281.66" data-end="284">know on slide level if I move things</span> <span data-start="284" data-end="286.91">around undo should just work so all this</span> <span data-start="286.91" data-end="288.199">and you can undo all the way to the</span> <span data-start="288.199" data-end="290.96">beginning of your document etc and of</span> <span data-start="290.96" data-end="292.19">course you can do this with movies as</span> <span data-start="292.19" data-end="299.36">well so I'm do a quick search here so</span> <span data-start="299.36" data-end="300.53">when you can quick look this just like</span> <span data-start="300.53" data-end="305.49">on Mac OS 10 and it's letting up YouTube</span> <span data-start="305.5" data-end="309.32">there we go so he can kind of preview</span> <span data-start="309.32" data-end="311.03">your movie for you see it you guys</span> <span data-start="311.03" data-end="312.47">believe me that this is a real movie not</span> <span data-start="312.47" data-end="314.979">an animated gif friend I can close this</span> <span data-start="314.979" data-end="317.24">so then you can drag it on and if you</span> <span data-start="317.24" data-end="319.46">want so so that's kind of the idea we</span> <span data-start="319.46" data-end="320.72">wanted something that really felt like a</span> <span data-start="320.72" data-end="322.789">real application and I want to show you</span> <span data-start="322.789" data-end="324.32">one more application this one was just</span> <span data-start="324.32" data-end="326.24">released a couple days ago not by us</span> <span data-start="326.24" data-end="328.25">it's called mockingbird it's kind of</span> <span data-start="328.25" data-end="329.93">like balsamic have you guys played</span> <span data-start="329.93" data-end="331.91">around with balsamic at all so but it's</span> <span data-start="331.91" data-end="333.229">written completely with web standards</span> <span data-start="333.229" data-end="334.82">technologies on top of cappuccino and</span> <span data-start="334.82" data-end="336.8">it's kind of the same thing you can you</span> <span data-start="336.8" data-end="340.01">know lay out a UI and if you want to</span> <span data-start="340.01" data-end="341.72">link to another page you can just hear</span> <span data-start="341.72" data-end="343.16">you have your different pages you can</span> <span data-start="343.16" data-end="345.349">just kind of drag in the other page and</span> <span data-start="345.349" data-end="349.039">now it's linked to it there you go so</span> <span data-start="349.039" data-end="350.12">you guys should just play around with</span> <span data-start="350.12" data-end="358.22">this I'm go Mockingbird calm we go so</span> <span data-start="358.22" data-end="361.039">the way we decided to build this is by</span> <span data-start="361.039" data-end="362.84">taking an existing technology that we</span> <span data-start="362.84" data-end="364.55">thought already worked really well and</span> <span data-start="364.55" data-end="366.169">we're all former Mac guys and we used to</span> <span data-start="366.169" data-end="369.02">write mac software and Coco is the way</span> <span data-start="369.02" data-end="370.82">you write applications on the mac and we</span> <span data-start="370.82" data-end="372.1">really like it</span> <span data-start="372.1" data-end="373.15">you know it's a really great framework</span> <span data-start="373.15" data-end="374.8">for doing very visual you I driven</span> <span data-start="374.8" data-end="378.76">things and what really sealed the deal</span> <span data-start="378.76" data-end="380.56">for us was the fact that Coco has been</span> <span data-start="380.56" data-end="383.2">around for like 20 years like next step</span> <span data-start="383.2" data-end="384.85">was running this then Mac started</span> <span data-start="384.85" data-end="387.64">running it and a few years ago they took</span> <span data-start="387.64" data-end="389.14">this existing framework and shoved it</span> <span data-start="389.14" data-end="390.4">into a completely different environment</span> <span data-start="390.4" data-end="393.58">the iphone and if you look at iphone</span> <span data-start="393.58" data-end="395.68">apps they look pretty darn good so that</span> <span data-start="395.68" data-end="397.75">to us kind of proved this framework the</span> <span data-start="397.75" data-end="399.52">fact that you could take something a 20</span> <span data-start="399.52" data-end="401.62">year old idea put it on a completely</span> <span data-start="401.62" data-end="403.84">different platform and revolutionize the</span> <span data-start="403.84" data-end="405.58">industry well you know maybe they're</span> <span data-start="405.58" data-end="407.02">doing it because of the framework not in</span> <span data-start="407.02" data-end="409.12">spite of it right so we said well you</span> <span data-start="409.12" data-end="410.65">know if you can make great apps on the</span> <span data-start="410.65" data-end="413.56">mac and the iphone why not the wet so</span> <span data-start="413.56" data-end="416.35">basically what cappuccino is is a port</span> <span data-start="416.35" data-end="418.33">of the cocoa frameworks from the mac and</span> <span data-start="418.33" data-end="421.9">from the iphone onto the web so to do</span> <span data-start="421.9" data-end="423.28">that we actually created a new language</span> <span data-start="423.28" data-end="425.14">on top of JavaScript it's called</span> <span data-start="425.14" data-end="427.06">objective J it just adds a few new</span> <span data-start="427.06" data-end="429.19">features to JavaScript so if you've ever</span> <span data-start="429.19" data-end="430.39">wanted to be able to do classical</span> <span data-start="430.39" data-end="431.8">inheritance or be able to you know</span> <span data-start="431.8" data-end="433.71">import scripts that sort of thing</span> <span data-start="433.71" data-end="436.09">objective J handles it the nice thing</span> <span data-start="436.09"
