<p><span data-start="148.51" data-end="156.1">Along dismissing those problems, they finally agreed to bring in an experiment, a peer mediate</span> <span data-start="156.1" data-end="157.1">programme.</span> <span data-start="157.1" data-end="159.78">Every student in the school was required to take the training.</span> <span data-start="159.78" data-end="164.5">A room, a space for the peer mediation, was dedicated.</span> <span data-start="164.5" data-end="170.83">A teacher was only in there to sit and watch and stay quiet before the peers, we were required</span> <span data-start="170.83" data-end="174.561">to visit and volunteer in the peer peer mediation classroom once a week as if it was a study</span> <span data-start="174.561" data-end="175.561">hall.</span> <span data-start="175.561" data-end="181.27">The teachers and guidance counsellors were no longer breaking up the fights.</span> <span data-start="181.27" data-end="190.381">They trusted the students to solve their problems, how to communicate what they're feeling, why</span> <span data-start="190.381" data-end="195.88">they're feeling and, and to be calmly dialogue about their disagreements and the occurrences</span> <span data-start="195.88" data-end="199.03">of fighting dropped dramatically.</span> <span data-start="199.03" data-end="206.311">So, someone you relate to, going through the same history quizzes and algebra exams, they</span> <span data-start="206.311" data-end="211.54">don't look or act like you but they have to make it to the other side like you.</span> <span data-start="211.54" data-end="216.9">Something hiding on the other surface of the story is we don't wake up having these tools</span> <span data-start="216.9" data-end="223.04">to facilitate conflict naturally, it has to be cultivated by kid or as adults.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="223.04" data-end="227.84">This is a gift given to me by the secondary education, and I thought it might translate</span> <span data-start="227.84" data-end="233.25">to our distributed online world if done with wear.</span> <span data-start="233.25" data-end="236.55">We're programmers and also human.</span> <span data-start="236.55" data-end="239.77">I get very, very fired up in debates.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="239.77" data-end="244.73">It feels good, if only temporary, to think that you're right.</span> <span data-start="244.73" data-end="249.43">When you've taken it too far, though, built up this idea of another person on the other</span> <span data-start="249.43" data-end="254.51">side of the screen who is doing something so intentionally malicious, you're talking</span> <span data-start="254.51" data-end="255.88">past each other.</span> <span data-start="255.88" data-end="258.38">There's no understanding motivations.</span> <span data-start="258.38" data-end="263.08">The words on your screen are the surface layer of what is going on.</span> <span data-start="263.08" data-end="264.77">So what is conflict?</span> <span data-start="264.77" data-end="267.21">Conflict gets a really bad rap but that's a bit unfair.</span> <span data-start="267.21" data-end="269.73">It's not inherently bad.</span> <span data-start="269.73" data-end="275.57">Modern theories consider conflict a natural and inevitable outcome of human interaction.</span> <span data-start="275.57" data-end="279.8">Conflict situations also often lead to the generation of new ideas and positive change.</span> <span data-start="279.8" data-end="284.13">So, that's a lot to unpack.</span> <span data-start="284.13" data-end="288.47">Let's talk some approaches that we can use as instruments to put in our tool boxes to</span> <span data-start="288.47" data-end="292.29">communicate a little more kindly in our everyday work.</span> <span data-start="292.29" data-end="297.04">So the work we've done thus far with the Node moderation team has, through honing governance</span> <span data-start="297.04" data-end="302.72">and taking a deep look at what we need to change to modify behaviour, incidentally mirrored</span> <span data-start="302.72" data-end="310.53">when a Nobel Prize winning economist spoke of evidence-based social design.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="310.53" data-end="316.19">Limit effects of bad behaviour, and that is through moderation systems, making inappropriate</span> <span data-start="316.19" data-end="322.96">posts less prominent, keeping consistent moderation policies, including community members in the</span> <span data-start="322.96" data-end="327.69">moderation, offering reversion tools and introducing filters.</span> <span data-start="327.69" data-end="330.02">Limit bad behaviour itself.</span> <span data-start="330.02" data-end="336.38">You can do that through activity quotas, temporary or permanent bans, and consistent criteria</span> <span data-start="336.38" data-end="339.74">for the bans outlined with process.</span> <span data-start="339.74" data-end="345.52">Encourage volunteering and compliance by ensuring people learn the norms, showing examples of</span> <span data-start="345.52" data-end="351.03">appropriate or inappropriate behaviour but not too often and dwelling on it, displaying</span> <span data-start="351.03" data-end="355.33">statistics on the normative behaviour, and reminding people about the norms at the point</span> <span data-start="355.33" data-end="358.13">of action.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="358.13" data-end="362.1">So with the advent of social coding through GitHub, online communities have broken down</span> <span data-start="362.1" data-end="367.97">physical location differences in communication barriers, creating a new challenge with folks</span> <span data-start="367.97" data-end="372.62">who are not employed by the same company but collaborating on a common goal.</span> <span data-start="372.62" data-end="379.79">The speed at which we pass both positive and negative information, it is a break neck pace.</span> <span data-start="379.79" data-end="386.56">Even if we were to be at the same company, a well-meaning manager, a very well-staffed</span> <span data-start="386.56" data-end="391.6">HR firm, or internal team, they would have a hard time-keeping up.</span> <span data-start="391.6" data-end="396.59">So, with volunteer contributes, as is much of the the way of many open-source projects,</span> <span data-start="396.59" data-end="399.64">attention and time are a limited resource.</span> <span data-start="399.64" data-end="405.19">Low-quality contributions such as commenting without seeking out some context prior, creates</span> <span data-start="405.19" data-end="407.02">a social dilemma.</span> <span data-start="407.02" data-end="411.419">These contributions drown out other contributions with time and emotional labour, and often</span> <span data-start="411.419" data-end="414.54">exhaust the available attention.</span> <span data-start="414.54" data-end="421.419">So conflict researchers have studied this, and the effects on code source software development</span> <span data-start="421.419" data-end="423.02">is easier to track.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="423.02" data-end="429.8">Dr Steve Sawyer surveyed 40 package software development teams and concluded how people</span> <span data-start="429.8" data-end="435.43">work together and mitigate conflict is more important than the individual skills and ability</span> <span data-start="435.43" data-end="440.34">of the team's members in predicting their software developer performance.</span> <span data-start="440.34" data-end="443.29">So, â€” yes.</span> <span data-start="443.29" data-end="444.77">[Applause].</span> <span data-start="444.77" data-end="448.99">What do you think Node project activity looks like when we've ended up in big fights on</span> <span data-start="448.99" data-end="455.8">Twitter, or on long essays of debates going back and forth on GitHub long derailed the</span> <span data-start="455.8" data-end="457.52">issue at hand?</span> <span data-start="457.52" data-end="462.6">PRs and pushes dropped to a drawl when comments shoot up.</span> <span data-start="462.6" data-end="469.8">So, we are makers, and there's no doubt we love to fix things, and we are paid to problem-solve.</span> <span data-start="469.8" data-end="474.169">But we can't fix them all, and we can certainly not do all of this good work alone.</span> <span data-start="474.169" data-end="479.32">But we try through trial and error in iterating over governance, moderation policies, and</span> <span data-start="479.32" data-end="482.94">codes of conducts, and in value consensus.</span> <span data-start="482.94" data-end="488.33">So, as moderators in open source, we lay the ground work for participants to understand</span> <span data-start="488.33" data-end="490.08">one another's perspectives.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="490.08" data-end="495.82">For a content management system to work, we had to establish that proper grounding first.</span> <span data-start="495.82" data-end="503.73">We don't have to agree to get along, but a common understanding and a value system context</span> <span data-start="503.73" data-end="506.46">is important to effective interaction.</span> <span data-start="506.46" data-end="513.28">So, last year, the first thing that we did was meet as the top-level project committees,</span> <span data-start="513.28" data-end="516.379">and reran a core values session at collaboration summit.</span> <span data-start="516.379" data-end="521.56">Even with its global impact, Node had relied on an implicit understanding of community</span> <span data-start="521.56" data-end="523.949">members' expectations.</span> <span data-start="523.949" data-end="530.829">Core values serve as the boundaries within which an organisation will operate in pursuit</span> <span data-start="530.829" data-end="532.019">of its vision.</span> <span data-start="532.019" data-end="539.2">Moving forward, we codify expectations so we can work effectively together and empower</span> <span data-start="539.2" data-end="542.79">members in the best interests of a global Node.</span> <span data-start="542.79" data-end="550.779">It is vital that we address good behaviour practices, so we created the member expectations</span> <span data-start="550.779" data-end="551.779">file.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="551.779" data-end="556.55">It is important that members of our leadership group, that was the TSE community committee,</span> <span data-start="556.55" data-end="561.88">also the members of the board, act in a way that not only complies with the code but that</span> <span data-start="561.88" data-end="568.24">models the vision, mission, and operating principles of the Node project that we are</span> <span data-start="568.24" data-end="569.24">seeking.</span> <span data-start="569.24" data-end="574.339">Cultural acceptance: so cultural elements underline conflict are really important considerations</span> <span data-start="574.339" data-end="576.1">we need to bear in mind.</span> <span data-start="576.1" data-end="581.769">Adding an extra edge and degree of sensitivity to the difficult tasks of mediation and peace-building.</span> <span data-start="581.769" data-end="586.92">This includes perception-checking, how our own perception is affecting the conflict we</span> <span data-start="586.92" data-end="592.069">are part of, and what influences our mental programming has on how we are proceeding.</span> <span data-start="592.069" data-end="597.35">Creative ways of handling conflicts emerges from the adoption of a flexible outlook.</span> <span data-start="597.35" data-end="601.29">In short, one size does not fit all.</span> <span data-start="601.29" data-end="607.24">A nuanced approach to conflict through list he can first, gaining contacts from parties,</span> <span data-start="607.24" data-end="612.889">proceeding with care in the spaces, with which the parties feel comfortable, often allow</span> <span data-start="612.889" data-end="617.709">for early resolve instead of continued management.</span> <span data-start="617.709" data-end="622.939">The tooling: so, I would be remiss not to dive in a bit to the cooling constrains that</span> <span data-start="622.939" data-end="626.86">we as open-source moderators of conflict have.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="626.86" data-end="629.069">Where do your communities live?</span> <span data-start="629.069" data-end="635.3">For Node, we live on GitHub, we live on Twitter, we, in fact, for some time, had a magnitude</span> <span data-start="635.3" data-end="640.23">more tweets than the next most active programme language, Java.</span> <span data-start="640.23" data-end="644.26">I'm not kidding, or being hyperbolic.</span> <span data-start="644.26" data-end="646.87">Node has grown up with GitHub.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="646.87" data-end="651.429">We felt the pain of what it means to limit permissions of contributors for security's</span> <span data-start="651.429" data-end="656.809">sake, and then moderators don't have access to act swiftly or ban bad actors.</span> <span data-start="656.809" data-end="661.399">We've celebrated the awesome work they've done in recent years with incredible features</span> <span data-start="661.399" data-end="666.939">giving the power to maintainers to better fine-tune permissions, reduce noise, and ensure</span> <span data-start="666.939" data-end="674.499">productive through user-blocking and apply community guidelines through a repo.</span> <span data-start="674.499" data-end="676.939">And then there is scope.</span> <span data-start="676.939" data-end="682.649">We had to take a step back and look at what spaces our ecosystem interacts in but also</span> <span data-start="682.649" data-end="684.839">what we have control over.</span> <span data-start="684.839" data-end="689.759">We can work to improve the environment in GitHub because we control that space.</span> <span data-start="689.759" data-end="693.149">We have the permissions and the administrative tools do do that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="693.149" data-end="694.29">What about Twitter?</span> <span data-start="694.29" data-end="696.709">Or Reddit, or Hacker News.</span> <span data-start="696.709" data-end="705.16">We chose a strategy of the scope we could commit to, so as GitHub, select Slack and</span> <span data-start="705.16" data-end="708.29">IRC groups, and event.</span> <span data-start="708.29" data-end="712.6">That can be tough when many of us have found sub committees in these spaces that are really</span> <span data-start="712.6" data-end="716.79">helpful but we spend a lot of time trying to help in these spaces and we've ended up</span> <span data-start="716.79" data-end="720.07">with over exposed and attacked community members.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="720.07" data-end="722.79">So the who.</span> <span data-start="722.79" data-end="724.089">The Node moderation team.</span> <span data-start="724.089" data-end="729.739">We have an elevated responsibility to observe patterns, audit processes and draft new governance</span> <span data-start="729.739" data-end="733">to improve our work spaces of the Node project.</span> <span data-start="733" data-end="738.309">The top-level committees, the TSC, the technical steering committee, and the community committee,</span> <span data-start="738.309" data-end="743.85">are voting members who jointly select or object to any person on the moderation team.</span> <span data-start="743.85" data-end="751.259">And the process verifies the shared trust contributors have who are ending up selected.</span> <span data-start="751.259" data-end="755.17">So let's be clear, though, as I move through these examples.</span> <span data-start="755.17" data-end="759.6">As I've said already, perspective is vital to being effective in these challenges, and</span> <span data-start="759.6" data-end="762.569">we still lack in diversity on the moderation team.</span> <span data-start="762.569" data-end="767.56">I think that's echoed through much of the Node project, which also means we have gaps</span> <span data-start="767.56" data-end="769.589">in time zone coverage.</span> <span data-start="769.589" data-end="775.23">We will never be as effective as a group when the make-up of our team doesn't mirror the</span> <span data-start="775.23" data-end="779.91">make-up of the environment community we would like to see in Node.</span> <span data-start="779.91" data-end="782.48">This is an uphill battle worth fighting.</span> </p>
