data-end="439.87">data would be in the features and label</span> <span data-start="439.87" data-end="442.03">one would be punched but as I said you</span> <span data-start="442.03" data-end="443.74">have to gather quite a lot of data so</span> <span data-start="443.74" data-end="445.42">you end up creating the same thing for</span> <span data-start="445.42" data-end="446.92">each of your files so each of your text</span> <span data-start="446.92" data-end="449.08">file actually becomes an object and you</span> <span data-start="449.08" data-end="450.88">end up with a giant array of all of your</span> <span data-start="450.88" data-end="453.64">data sample ok so that's the first step</span> <span data-start="453.64" data-end="455.35">the thing is tensorflow doesn't really</span> <span data-start="455.35" data-end="457.03">work with objects it works more with</span> <span data-start="457.03" data-end="459.58">something that you know like arrays this</span> <span data-start="459.58" data-end="460.81">would there be another step afterwards</span> <span data-start="460.81" data-end="462.73">but so how would you then transform</span> <span data-start="462.73" data-end="466.06">these objects into another arrays so</span> <span data-start="466.06" data-end="468.75">what you have to do you end up with</span> <span data-start="468.75" data-end="470.65">multi-dimensional arrays and this is</span> <span data-start="470.65" data-end="471.79">where it gets a bit complicated to</span> <span data-start="471.79" data-end="474.46">explain but I'm gonna try my best so if</span> <span data-start="474.46" data-end="475.78">you look at you're going to split the</span> <span data-start="475.78" data-end="478.33">labels and the features so if we look at</span> <span data-start="478.33" data-end="480.19">the first layer of our multi-dimensional</span> <span data-start="480.19" data-end="482.47">labels array you have all of the zeros</span> <span data-start="482.47" data-end="484.6">so you have all of the hydrogens that</span> <span data-start="484.6" data-end="486.73">you trained and it's mapped to the first</span> <span data-start="486.73" data-end="489.04">layer of the features multi-dimensional</span> <span data-start="489.04" data-end="491.2">arrays so if we go a bit further and we</span> <span data-start="491.2" data-end="493.39">say our first ever hadouken that we</span> <span data-start="493.39" data-end="495.19">trained it's going to be mapped to the</span> <span data-start="495.19" data-end="498.25">first the first array of features in the</span> <span data-start="498.25" data-end="502.06">first layer of peaches and then so if</span> <span data-start="502.06" data-end="503.17">you do the second one is going to be</span> <span data-start="503.17" data-end="504.7">mapped as well so your second hydrogen</span> <span data-start="504.7" data-end="506.44">is going to be mapped to the second</span> <span data-start="506.44" data-end="509.05">array of features etc and then we move</span> <span data-start="509.05" data-end="510.64">on to the punches it's going to be the</span> <span data-start="510.64" data-end="512.38">same everything is mapped so it's in</span> <span data-start="512.38" data-end="513.55">like the same position but it's in</span> <span data-start="513.55" data-end="517.36">different arrays because in the end now</span> <span data-start="517.36" data-end="519.219">we're finally getting to a format that</span> <span data-start="519.219" data-end="521.53">tensorflow can work with now we don't</span> <span data-start="521.53" data-end="523.15">have strings we don't have objects we</span> <span data-start="523.15" data-end="524.95">have multi-dimensional arrays which is</span> <span data-start="524.95" data-end="527.08">closer to what to what tensorflow works</span> <span data-start="527.08" data-end="528.97">with and so I don't know if you noticed</span> <span data-start="528.97" data-end="530.62">well I didn't show any actual code</span> <span data-start="530.62" data-end="532.36">sample because so far it's not any</span> <span data-start="532.36" data-end="534.28">tensorflow specific code its</span> <span data-start="534.28" data-end="536.8">transformation of of data in a race and</span> <span data-start="536.8" data-end="537.85">objects that you would do in like</span> <span data-start="537.85" data-end="539.7">standard JavaScript if I could say so</span> <span data-start="539.7" data-end="542.14">but now now that we have</span> <span data-start="542.14" data-end="544.84">that resembles what what test we can</span> <span data-start="544.84" data-end="546.28">work with we can we can finally</span> <span data-start="546.28" data-end="549.61">transform that into tenses so if you</span> <span data-start="549.61" data-end="552.13">can't it's a bit small but don't worry</span> <span data-start="552.13" data-end="554.02">about really understanding what these</span> <span data-start="554.02" data-end="555.31">lines of code do because if you've never</span> <span data-start="555.31" data-end="557.11">played with tensorflow before it's going</span> <span data-start="557.11" data-end="558.97">to be like reading it will not really</span> <span data-start="558.97" data-end="561.46">make sense it's more about I only put it</span> <span data-start="561.46" data-end="562.78">there to show the amount of coordinated</span> <span data-start="562.78" data-end="564.31">to do that but what is really more</span> <span data-start="564.31" data-end="566.56">important well I'd be happy with is if</span> <span data-start="566.56" data-end="568.24">you understand more the process to go</span> <span data-start="568.24" data-end="569.77">through if you know if you want to know</span> <span data-start="569.77" data-end="571.93">exactly how to write a the repos are on</span> <span data-start="571.93" data-end="573.7">github or the documentation is pretty</span> <span data-start="573.7" data-end="574.87">good I'm sure that you'll figure out</span> <span data-start="574.87" data-end="577.21">later on the understanding the steps is</span> <span data-start="577.21" data-end="579.13">the most important thing so first of all</span> <span data-start="579.13" data-end="581.14">before transforming the our data to</span> <span data-start="581.14" data-end="583.42">tenses we have to shuffle it because if</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="583.42" data-end="584.53">I just go back to the slide before</span> <span data-start="584.53" data-end="587.14">everything is in order and you don't</span> <span data-start="587.14" data-end="588.55">really want to give your data that way</span> <span data-start="588.55" data-end="590.62">to a machine learning algorithm because</span> <span data-start="590.62" data-end="591.82">it's just going to get used to the way</span> <span data-start="591.82" data-end="593.83">you feed it so for example it's going to</span> <span data-start="593.83" data-end="596.11">look at it's gonna be like oh well the</span> <span data-start="596.11" data-end="598">five previous samples that you gave me</span> <span data-start="598" data-end="599.68">we're all hadoukens so this mean one</span> <span data-start="599.68" data-end="601.06">must be a hadouken it's not really going</span> <span data-start="601.06" data-end="603.1">to try to find any pattern in the data</span> <span data-start="603.1" data-end="604.18">and that's not what you want you wanted</span> <span data-start="604.18" data-end="606.16">to really understand what makes how do</span> <span data-start="606.16" data-end="607.96">you know what makes a punch based on the</span> <span data-start="607.96" data-end="609.78">data so it's not by shuffling it and</span> <span data-start="609.78" data-end="611.95">then you're gonna use the tensorflow</span> <span data-start="611.95" data-end="614.68">methods like tensor 2d because our</span> <span data-start="614.68" data-end="617.53">gestures are two-dimensional we have six</span> <span data-start="617.53" data-end="619.24">numbers over a certain amount of lines</span> <span data-start="619.24" data-end="620.86">so it's like an x and y axis for your</span> <span data-start="620.86" data-end="623.62">data and the labels is a one-dimensional</span> <span data-start="623.62" data-end="625.54">tensor because the label is only one</span> <span data-start="625.54" data-end="629.47">thing it's either either 0 1 or 2 or</span> <span data-start="629.47" data-end="631.2">more if you decide to do more classes</span> <span data-start="631.2" data-end="633.73">the next step is to splitting between</span> <span data-start="633.73" data-end="635.68">training set and test it so you just</span> <span data-start="635.68" data-end="638.26">have to calculate the amount of your</span> <span data-start="638.26" data-end="640.21">data that you're gonna split so the</span> <span data-start="640.21" data-end="642.25">reason why you do that is because you</span> <span data-start="642.25" data-end="644.62">have your entire label data set and the</span> <span data-start="644.62" data-end="646.45">training set is going to be given to</span> <span data-start="646.45" data-end="648.61">create the model so you keep 80% of your</span> <span data-start="648.61" data-end="651.46">data set to to create the model and you</span> <span data-start="651.46" data-end="653.77">keep 20% of it for the test set so the</span> <span data-start="653.77" data-end="654.94">test that is going to be used to</span> <span data-start="654.94" data-end="656.86">validate against the model that you</span> <span data-start="656.86" data-end="659.02">created because your test set is already</span> <span data-start="659.02" data-end="660.82">labeled again it's something that you</span> <span data-start="660.82" data-end="662.26">trained and you labeled yourself and</span> <span data-start="662.26" data-end="664.12">just to check that the accuracy of your</span> <span data-start="664.12" data-end="665.95">model is good you're going to use 20% of</span> <span data-start="665.95" data-end="669.34">your data set to train it against so so</span> <span data-start="669.34" data-end="670.99">yeah you end up doing that so you slice</span> <span data-start="670.99" data-end="672.85">your cereal tensors between training</span> <span data-start="672.85" data-end="674.62">features and testing features training</span> <span data-start="674.62" data-end="675.37">levels</span> <span data-start="675.37" data-end="678.16">testing levels once again if the code</span> <span data-start="678.16" data-end="679.42">doesn't make sense it's fine it's more</span> <span data-start="679.42" data-end="682.42">about the steps and now finally our data</span> <span data-start="682.42" data-end="685.24">is processed so it's it's ready but we</span> <span data-start="685.24" data-end="687.1">still haven't done anything so the step</span> <span data-start="687.1" data-end="688.36">3 is to create the model at the moment</span> <span data-start="688.36" data-end="690.279">we just reformatted the data so that we</span> <span data-start="690.279" data-end="693.04">can do something with it so to create</span> <span data-start="693.04" data-end="695.77">the model so this is more this at the</span> <span data-start="695.77" data-end="697.029">part where it's more of an art than a</span> <span data-start="697.029" data-end="699.94">science when you want to play with</span> <span data-start="699.94" data-end="701.11">machine learning you might not know in</span> <span data-start="701.11" data-end="702.7">advance what model you can use or what</span> <span data-start="702.7" data-end="704.74">parameters do you see it's more a step</span> <span data-start="704.74" data-end="706.33">where you play around here I use the</span> <span data-start="706.33" data-end="708.37">sequential model I could not explain why</span> <span data-start="708.37" data-end="711.46">it just worked so I used it and then</span> <span data-start="711.46" data-end="713.29">there's this other types of models but</span> <span data-start="713.29" data-end="715.779">it works for me sardine changing then in</span> <span data-start="715.779" data-end="718.15">terms of the amount of layers in your in</span> <span data-start="718.15" data-end="720.88">your own neural network you have to but</span> <span data-start="720.88" data-end="722.05">you can have four or five and the</span> <span data-start="722.05" data-end="723.88">parameters can be changing as well so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="723.88" data-end="725.32">I'm not going to go in-depth into this</span> <span data-start="725.32" data-end="728.17">because again what works for you just</span> <span data-start="728.17" data-end="731.38">keep it then we we just add like an</span> <span data-start="731.38" data-end="733.87">optimizer layer as well and then finally</span> <span data-start="733.87" data-end="735.339">what's important here is that the fit</span> <span data-start="735.339" data-end="737.529">method is what is going to train the</span> <span data-start="737.529" data-end="739.12">model so you pass it your training</span> <span data-start="739.12" data-end="740.62">features and training labels and you</span> <span data-start="740.62" data-end="742.69">have a parameter of validation data when</span> <span data-start="742.69" data-end="744.79">you give your test set as well so this</span> <span data-start="744.79" data-end="746.29">step is actually going to be the</span> <span data-start="746.29" data-end="748.209">training process and in the end once</span> <span data-start="748.209" data-end="749.92">this is done with all of the data that</span> <span data-start="749.92" data-end="752.14">you gave it you can save your model in</span> <span data-start="752.14" data-end="754.63">your file system so now we actually</span> <span data-start="754.63" data-end="756.07">gathered our data which once formed it</span> <span data-start="756.07" data-end="760.029">we created the model but okay step for</span> <span data-start="760.029" data-end="761.529">prediction you actually want to use that</span> <span data-start="761.529" data-end="762.459">model you're not going to go through all</span> <span data-start="762.459" data-end="765.04">of this to like know run predictions</span> <span data-start="765.04" data-end="767.17">later on so the final step of all of</span> <span data-start="767.17" data-end="770.37">this is the prediction so to do this I</span> <span data-start="770.37" data-end="772.72">like my application was more of like you</span> <span data-start="772.72" data-end="774.79">know GS fine but you can do that in the</span> <span data-start="774.79" data-end="777.61">browser you don't require tensorflow GS</span> <span data-start="777.61" data-end="779.92">instead of Tesla J's node but basically</span> <span data-start="779.92" data-end="782.92">you you import the framework we have a</span> <span data-start="782.92" data-end="785.11">gesture classes arrays that has how you</span> <span data-start="785.11" data-end="788.589">can punch and uppercut we load our model</span> <span data-start="788.589" data-end="791.08">to be able to use it and then if we go</span> <span data-start="791.08" data-end="793.66">back to our our code to get the data</span> <span data-start="793.66" data-end="795.13">from the accelerometer and gyroscope</span> <span data-start="795.13" data-end="798.25">when we hold the button we we save all</span> <span data-start="798.25" data-end="799.69">of our data into a variable we push it</span> <span data-start="799.69" data-end="801.7">into an array and this time we're not</span> <span data-start="801.7" data-end="803.23">setting it to the first system because</span> <span data-start="803.23" data-end="805.27">we are not training an algorithm we're</span> <span data-start="805.27" data-end="806.709">predicting life data that it's never</span> <span data-start="806.709" data-end="807.339">seen before</span> <span data-start="807.339" data-end="808.78">so we tip Laura in the variable</span> <span data-start="808.78" data-end="810.94">and when we release the button we're</span> <span data-start="810.94" data-end="812.32">sending all of that data to a predict</span> <span data-start="812.32" data-end="814.66">function and what our predict question</span> <span data-start="814.66" data-end="816.58">does it's going to transform a live data</span> <span data-start="816.58" data-end="818.08">that we just had in a variable into a</span> <span data-start="818.08" data-end="819.91">tensor as well so it can be compared to</span> <span data-start="819.91" data-end="822.88">what the model was trained with we call</span> <span data-start="822.88" data-end="824.77">the predict method with that input</span> <span data-start="824.77" data-end="826.48">that's been transformed and in the end</span> <span data-start="826.48" data-end="827.89">the prediction that you get is going to</span> <span data-start="827.89" data-end="829.78">be an index just the same way that our</span> <span data-start="829.78" data-end="831.64">label was a number the prediction is</span> <span data-start="831.64" data-end="832.93">going to come back as a number as well</span> <span data-start="832.93" data-end="834.76">so we have to look up what it means in</span>
