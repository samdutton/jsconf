<span data-start="375.47" data-end="378.74">champion in this and you you and the</span> <span data-start="378.74" data-end="380.36">committee decides that this is like</span> <span data-start="380.36" data-end="383.18">something that worth more investigation</span> <span data-start="383.18" data-end="386.99">so they goes to the stage one so then</span> <span data-start="386.99" data-end="390.65">they try to do a little bit more</span> <span data-start="390.65" data-end="393.62">research on that and shaped like if it's</span> <span data-start="393.62" data-end="396.65">a

which is the stage two</span> <span data-start="402.89" data-end="405.72">so then they start to</span> <span data-start="405.72" data-end="409.76">right the draft of the of this</span> <span data-start="409.76" data-end="413.82">specification and then sometimes they</span> <span data-start="413.82" data-end="416.61">have some implementation bubble and and</span> <span data-start="416.61" data-end="420.54">and sent to the to the developers to try</span> <span data-start="420.54" data-end="424.68">that out and then after after they find</span> <span data-start="424.68" data-end="427.2">some consensus on and syntax I'm in send</span> <span data-start="427.2" data-end="429.44">mailings of the the proposal that goes</span> <span data-start="429.44" data-end="433.05">that this proposal goes to the go stage</span> <span data-start="433.05" data-end="436.44">3 which is the time that they wait for</span> <span data-start="436.44" data-end="439.86">some permutation the browsers and and I</span> <span data-start="439.86" data-end="441.48">think like then you see this</span> <span data-start="441.48" data-end="446.12">implementation coming to the nightly</span> <span data-start="446.12" data-end="450.15">version of Firefox or Chrome Canary and</span> <span data-start="450.15" data-end="453.75">so on and then after everything's done</span> <span data-start="453.75" data-end="458.45">and the final consensus will seem to</span> <span data-start="458.45" data-end="461.73">stage 4 which is the last stage and then</span> <span data-start="461.73" data-end="463.59">they have a cohort I think in March</span> <span data-start="463.59" data-end="466.8">right and and then this goes to the next</span> <span data-start="466.8" data-end="471.15">spec which is in July then you talked</span> <span data-start="471.15" data-end="473.82">about similar feature advancement</span> <span data-start="473.82" data-end="476.13">happening in the web assembly is the</span> <span data-start="476.13" data-end="477.72">process they're similar or how does the</span> <span data-start="477.72" data-end="479.46">web assembly working group deal with</span> <span data-start="479.46" data-end="481.89">this there are a lot of similarities and</span> <span data-start="481.89" data-end="485.19">a couple of differences so for a web</span> <span data-start="485.19" data-end="487.97">assembly you do have also four stages</span> <span data-start="487.97" data-end="491.79">that look pretty similar there is a</span> <span data-start="491.79" data-end="494.43">difference in advancing between the</span> <span data-start="494.43" data-end="499.59">stages which is that with tc39 you need</span> <span data-start="499.59" data-end="501.6">really full consensus that happens at a</span> <span data-start="501.6" data-end="504.45">meeting individuals from different</span> <span data-start="504.45" data-end="508.05">companies can object whereas with</span> <span data-start="508.05" data-end="511.95">webassembly it's more the different</span> <span data-start="511.95" data-end="514.779">implementers</span> <span data-start="514.789" data-end="517.56">really it's what they do is technically</span> <span data-start="517.56" data-end="519.24">they take a vote and people can say I</span> <span data-start="519.24" data-end="522.12">strongly disagree I disagree I'm neutral</span> </p>
