data-end="152.28">because it kind of looks like a pretzel</span> <span data-start="152.29" data-end="155.42">and then we had a new vibrant color</span> <span data-start="155.42" data-end="158">palette like very you fool very exciting</span> <span data-start="158" data-end="160.7">colors and the new brand would have a</span> <span data-start="160.7" data-end="163.07">better focus on our community I guess</span> <span data-start="163.07" data-end="164.63">and a horse and all these things around</span> <span data-start="164.63" data-end="167.63">the globe so this came through my the</span> <span

data-end="180.05">me talk to a designer differently have</span> <span data-start="180.05" data-end="181.64">this understanding of what every brand</span> <span data-start="181.64" data-end="183.68">is

data-end="208.34">legacy code and not just any legacy code</span> <span data-start="208.34" data-end="214.64">but legacy CSS which is not very fun so</span> <span data-start="214.64" data-end="216.739">then we started thinking about how we</span> <span data-start="216.739" data-end="219.32">could ship this project and remain sane</span> <span data-start="219.32" data-end="221.959">at the same time and this is tree of the</span> <span data-start="221.959" data-end="224.66">main principles that we had first having</span> <span data-start="224.66" data-end="226.97">a say in CSS architecture so that we</span> <span data-start="226.97" data-end="228.98">wouldn't find ourselves hand changing</span> <span data-start="228.98" data-end="233">like thousands of lines of CSS second</span> <span data-start="233" data-end="234.8">being able to test and measure the</span> <span data-start="234.8" data-end="237.11">progress making sure that on the

data-end="242.659">job and the third is scalable across the</span> <span data-start="242.659" data-end="245.18">site because we have so many different</span> <span data-start="245.18" data-end="247.819">products that we need to change so first</span> <span data-start="247.819" data-end="249.319">thing talking about same CSS</span> <span data-start="249.319" data-end="252.83">architecture just we want to have</span> <span data-start="252.83" data-end="254.87">approached the CSS that doesn't drive</span> <span data-start="254.87" data-end="257.78">anyone nuts which may not be that easy</span> <span data-start="257.78" data-end="261.68">because the CSS so Xzibit one of typical</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="428.59" data-end="431.38">CSS we were actually working on my</span> <span data-start="431.38" data-end="433.27">natural CSS framework that we called 02</span> <span data-start="433.27" data-end="435.58">which was based upon bootstrap but</span> <span data-start="435.58" data-end="438.78">called down for a specific use case and</span> <span data-start="438.78" data-end="442.15">we have been working on this for about a</span> <span data-start="442.15" data-end="443.89">few months and we've begun rolling out</span> <span data-start="443.89" data-end="445.87">to be about ten percent of the pages by</span> <span data-start="445.87" data-end="449.02">the time the rebrand project started I'm</span> <span data-start="449.02" data-end="450.94">gonna make a side note about why we call</span> <span data-start="450.94" data-end="452.74">it 02 because it sounds very sciency</span> <span data-start="452.74" data-end="456.01">it's kind of a nerdy job because 02 is</span> <span data-start="456.01" data-end="458.53">the scientific notation for oxygen and</span> <span data-start="458.53" data-end="465.9">you can't have air BnB with oxygen</span> <span data-start="465.91" data-end="469.79">so so we had this framework called 02</span> <span data-start="469.79" data-end="472.88">and and on the left is 10 to look like</span> <span data-start="472.88" data-end="475.19">at a stop the project and so we had this</span> <span data-start="475.19" data-end="478.85">idea you know given our new rebrand</span> <span data-start="478.85" data-end="481.42">feeling rebrand designs what if we just</span> <span data-start="481.42" data-end="484.4">update the skin 402 and you see on the</span> <span data-start="484.4" data-end="487.76">right is all the same elements but just</span> <span data-start="487.76" data-end="489.67">in a slightly different style and</span> <span data-start="489.67" data-end="492.23">preserving the same Dom API like four</span> <span data-start="492.23" data-end="494.15">button in the old way it's called a</span> <span data-start="494.15" data-end="496.1">button primary and it's a blue button</span> <span data-start="496.1" data-end="498.59">and then in a rebrand ways it's still</span> <span data-start="498.59" data-end="500.36">called button by it just has a slightly</span> <span data-start="500.36" data-end="503.96">different color and this is kind of</span> <span data-start="503.96" data-end="506.87">magical because if we basically promised</span> <span data-start="506.87" data-end="509.18">like all the engineers across the side</span> <span data-start="509.18" data-end="511.28">and if you use o 2 components you get an</span> <span data-start="511.28" data-end="514.58">instant rebrand because whatever means</span> <span data-start="514.58" data-end="516.47">is that if you use auto components will</span> <span data-start="516.47" data-end="518.57">just change the CSS framework out for</span> <span data-start="518.57" data-end="519.56">you and you don't even need to do</span> <span data-start="519.56" data-end="523.67">anything get new styles so this is an</span> <span data-start="523.67" data-end="526.82">example of a page that use only Oh two</span> <span data-start="526.82" data-end="530.27">components and and when we just change</span> <span data-start="530.27" data-end="532.94">out the different version of 02 it looks</span> <span data-start="532.94" data-end="536.84">completely different and it's a great</span> <span data-start="536.84" data-end="539">formats because then you can scale the</span> <span data-start="539" data-end="541.16">rebrand across the site without having</span> <span data-start="541.16" data-end="543.41">to write that many lines of CSS and</span> <span data-start="543.41" data-end="549.56">everyone wins so another aspect I wanted</span> <span data-start="549.56" data-end="551.33">to make sure is making sure that we are</span> <span data-start="551.33" data-end="553.43">testable that we are progresses test boy</span> <span data-start="553.43" data-end="555.47">immeasurable making

data-end="573.98">between the odd version and the</span> <span data-start="573.98" data-end="575.99">rebranded version and we call it the</span> <span data-start="575.99" data-end="579.62">branch st

data-start="966.81" data-end="968.7">probably written ones like three years</span> <span data-start="968.7" data-end="973.529">ago and no one touch it again so we were</span> <span data-start="973.529" data-end="975.69">thinking about it so we talked about how</span> <span data-start="975.69" data-end="978.36">can we how can we rewrite this whole CSS</span> <span data-start="978.36" data-end="981.839">without going nuts and so we thought we</span> <span data-start="981.839" data-end="983.67">needed a more nuanced approach to it and</span> <span

data-end="1050.66">sauna to talk to the payment scheme and</span> <span data-start="1050.66" data-end="1055.37">ask them to help out for us and so over</span> <span data-start="1055.37"
