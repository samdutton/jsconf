data-start="178.36" data-end="183.48">is the schedule looks good to me</span> <span data-start="183.48" data-end="187.72">but I think we can bring a little bit</span> <span data-start="187.72" data-end="192.04">more celebration in there so I spice it</span> <span data-start="192.04" data-end="196.209">up a little bit with a fancy lazy</span> <span data-start="196.209"

data-end="208.959">this is done with one element so how</span> <span data-start="208.959" data-end="211.09">would you usually achieve this kind of</span> <span data-start="211.09" data-end="213.1">effect but first you have to figure out</span> <span data-start="213.1" data-end="214.39">if something is visible in the viewport</span> <span data-start="214.39" data-end="216.58">right so how do you do that</span> <span data-start="216.58" data-end="222.97">well I'd Google huh and then you sorry</span> <span data-start="222.97" data-end="225.66">and then you end up at Stack Overflow</span> <span data-start="225.66" data-end="228.81">who's guilty of copying this snippet</span> <span data-start="228.81" data-end="232.06">come on probably more people here and</span> <span data-start="232.06" data-end="234.1">then there's this piece of logic in</span> <span data-start="234.1" data-end="237.28">there which I I'm always too lazy to</span> <span data-start="237.28" data-end="240.31">think about that but this one got shot</span> <span data-start="240.31" data-end="244.18">with this though this is calling element</span> <span data-start="244.18" data-end="246.64">get bounding client rect and this</span> <span data-start="246.64" data-end="249.19">function on and anuman at Dom element</span> <span data-start="249.19" data-end="250.239">can trigger the browser to</span> <span data-start="250.239" data-end="252.34">asynchronously Nino to synchronously</span> <span data-start="252.34" data-end="255.04">calculate style and layout this happens</span> <span data-start="255.04" data-end="257.169">when something changed like adding in</span> <span data-start="257.169" data-end="259.71">class or something and this is a an</span> <span data-start="259.71" data-end="261.93">expensive operation</span> <span data-start="261.93" data-end="263.22">when you use this you should always</span> <span data-start="263.22" data-end="265.8">batch all the reads and then write stuff</span> <span data-start="265.8" data-end="268.37">but this is actually not cool because</span> <span data-start="268.37" data-end="271.71">well we have to pull for information</span> <span data-start="271.71" data-end="274.259">right we have to ask s Blissett li if</span> <span data-start="274.259" data-end="276.72">you understand shion's are good to use</span> <span data-start="276.72" data-end="278.4">performance wise Paul Irish is</span> <span data-start="278.4" data-end="281.759">maintaining this document here and when</span> <span data-start="281.759" data-end="284.58">you're doing these kind of things having</span> <span data-start="284.58" data-end="286.139">a look there it's definitely a big help</span> <span data-start="286.139" data-end="291.63">so what is next then well we define a</span> <span data-start="291.63" data-end="295.349">scroll handler right which fires 1,000</span> <span data-start="295.349" data-end="297.479">times when you scroll through a page and</span> <span data-start="297.479" data-end="298.86">there's also something wrong with that</span> <span data-start="298.86" data-end="302.55">because scroll or scroll handlers are</span> <span data-start="302.55" data-end="304.53">really expensive operation by default</span> <span data-start="304.53" data-end="308.46">and when we want to build great you eyes</span> <span data-start="308.46" data-end="311.639">that stick under our fingers when we</span> <span data-start="311.639" data-end="313.949">play around with our phones we always</span> <span data-start="313.949" data-end="317.81">have to aim for 60 frames per second</span> <span data-start="317.81" data-end="320.22">dividing one second by 60 means that we</span> <span data-start="320.22" data-end="322.44">have 16 millisecond but this is actually</span> <span data-start="322.44" data-end="325.32">not true because the browser has to do</span> <span data-start="325.32" data-end="327.87">some other same things then just dealing</span> <span data-start="327.87" data-end="331.02">with our JavaScript so in real time we</span> <span data-start="331.02" data-end="334.13">have around 10 milliseconds to avoid</span> <span data-start="334.13" data-end="337.8">janky scrolling this means that we want</span> <span data-start="337.8" data-end="339.659">to do as less as possible in a scroll</span> <span data-start="339.659" data-end="343.139">handler so what I did next is well I had</span> <span data-start="343.139" data-end="346.199">to my developer tools of choice and I</span> <span data-start="346.199" data-end="349.02">monitored the whole thing right these</span> <span data-start="349.02" data-end="351.69">are the chrome dev tools and first thing</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="351.69" data-end="355.139">I did is I throttled the CPU because</span> <span data-start="355.139" data-end="357.3">this device here and we heard that</span> <span data-start="357.3" data-end="359.639">yesterday already is not your average</span> <span data-start="359.639" data-end="364.05">user not everybody has this kind of</span> <span data-start="364.05" data-end="366.509">device and also not everybody has a</span> <span data-start="366.509" data-end="370.349">latest or recent phone and then I</span> <span data-start="370.349" data-end="373.889">checked the framerate of my cool lazy</span> <span data-start="373.889" data-end="379.08">loading effect and well it was not that</span> <span data-start="379.08" data-end="380.55">good right</span> <span data-start="380.55" data-end="382.949">and when we look a little bit deeper we</span> <span data-start="382.949" data-end="386.43">see that element get found inclined rect</span> <span data-start="386.43" data-end="389.94">takes big part of that and in this</span> <span data-start="389.94" data-end="391.919">example it took actually 12 milliseconds</span> <span data-start="391.919" data-end="393.21">which means that we already hit the</span> <span data-start="393.21" data-end="394.3">budget</span> <span data-start="394.3" data-end="397.509">and this is firing on every scroll frame</span> <span data-start="397.509" data-end="401.199">right this is really expensive so let me</span> <span data-start="401.199" data-end="403.979">show you one solution to this problem</span> <span data-start="403.979" data-end="407.02">the intersection observer the</span> <span data-start="407.02" data-end="408.61">intersection observer is a method to s</span> <span data-start="408.61" data-end="410.62">on personnel s synchronously query the</span> <span data-start="410.62" data-end="412.99">position of an element with respect to</span> <span data-start="412.99" data-end="415.949">other elements or the global viewport</span> <span data-start="415.949" data-end="419.259">this means with this we don't have to do</span> <span data-start="419.259" data-end="421.9">costly dumb and Styler queries and we</span> <span data-start="421.9" data-end="423.669">don't have to pause for information</span> <span data-start="423.669" data-end="426.25">using something like this helps us to</span> <span data-start="426.25" data-end="430.09">reduce CPU GPU and energy costs to</span> <span data-start="430.09" data-end="433.449">figure out if something is visible so</span> <span data-start="433.449" data-end="434.58">how does that work</span> <span data-start="434.58" data-end="436.719">here you see an intersection observer</span> <span data-start="436.719" data-end="439.96">implementation first you have to define</span> <span data-start="439.96" data-end="441.849">a threshold and in this case I'm going</span> <span data-start="441.849" data-end="443.71">with one point zero which means that I</span> <span data-start="443.71" data-end="447.729">want to get notified when an element is</span> <span data-start="447.729" data-end="450.28">completely visible then you have to</span> <span data-start="450.28" data-end="452.139">initialize a new intersection observer</span> <span data-start="452.139" data-end="453.909">and this is then called with several</span> <span data-start="453.909" data-end="456.699">intersection entries and these then have</span> <span data-start="456.699" data-end="459.009">a intersecting property and then I'm</span> <span data-start="459.009" data-end="460.24">adding a class that is called</span> <span data-start="460.24" data-end="460.93">party-party</span> <span data-start="460.93" data-end="463.36">and then I'm I'm observing the given</span> <span data-start="463.36" data-end="465.699">element because well my job is done here</span> <span data-start="465.699" data-end="468.759">and then I can just grab all the</span> <span data-start="468.759" data-end="471.75">elements and can tell the observer hey</span> <span data-start="471.75" data-end="476.56">can you please watch out here cool so in</span> <span data-start="476.56" data-end="480.009">with an implementation like that we see</span> <span data-start="480.009" data-end="484.81">that a now there is no get bound</span> <span data-start="484.81" data-end="487.419">inclined direct anymore and this is not</span> <span data-start="487.419" data-end="490.21">called onscroll and when we check the</span> <span data-start="490.21" data-end="492.219">framerate we see that at least for</span> <span data-start="492.219" data-end="494.259">figuring out if something is visible we</span> <span data-start="494.259" data-end="497.469">end up at 60 frames per second I think</span> <span data-start="497.469" data-end="499.509">this is really really cool so we're</span> <span data-start="499.509" data-end="501.159">building these kind of things I always</span> <span data-start="501.159" data-end="504.46">what I always try to do is take a moment</span> <span data-start="504.46" data-end="508.15">and measure it measured using the dev</span> <span data-start="508.15" data-end="509.83">tools of your choice use web page test</span> <span data-start="509.83" data-end="513.669">or lighthouse and maybe try it on a real</span> <span data-start="513.669"

data-end="1151.39">type measure and then you get notified</span> <span data-start="1151.39" data-end="1156.92">and this is really cool because this way</span> <span data-start="1156.92" data-end="1159.21">measurements are pushed toward</span> <span data-start="1159.21" data-end="1161.85">me so I and I also had a look at the</span> <span data-start="1161.85" data-end="1163.71">stack man and it was like what was</span> <span data-start="1163.71" data-end="1165.69">written in there all right developers</span> <span data-start="1165.69" data-end="1167.49">today are encouraged to use the</span> <span data-start="1167.49" data-end="1171.059">performance observer all right I can</span> <span data-start="1171.059" data-end="1171.659">deal with that</span> <span data-start="1171.659" data-end="1172.98">but then there was also an interesting</span> <span data-start="1172.98" data-end="1175.59">sentence which was like further new</span> <span data-start="1175.59"

data-end="1187.02">observer interface what new metrics are</span> <span data-start="1187.02" data-end="1190.23">we talking about here so there is for</span> <span data-start="1190.23" data-end="1193.71">example the paint timing API and this</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1193.71" data-end="1196.86">API gives us information for example</span> <span data-start="1196.86" data-end="1198.419">when the first paint which means any</span> <span data-start="1198.419" data-end="1200.429">painted pixel or when the first</span> <span data-start="1200.429" data-end="1202.409">contentful paint happened which means</span> <span data-start="1202.409" data-end="1205.26">that any text image non white canvas or</span> </p>

data-start="1217.2" data-end="1220.62">and then there's also the long task API</span> <span data-start="1220.62" data-end="1222.779">which tells us when JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1222.779" data-end="1225.059">operations took longer than 50</span> <span data-start="1225.059" data-end="1228.179">milliseconds and with these kind of</span> <span data-start="1228.179" data-end="1230.52">things I've kept the metrics right at my</span> <span data-start="1230.52" data-end="1232.409">fingertips right so this is for example</span> <span data-start="1232.409" data-end="1234.96">my personal website and what you see</span> <span data-start="1234.96" data-end="1236.64">there is that I have a local storage</span> <span data-start="1236.64" data-end="1242.429">flag and with this this I get the</span> <span data-start="1242.429" data-end="1245.09">information how long something took</span> <span data-start="1245.09" data-end="1247.83">right on my face and I'm also relying on</span> <span data-start="1247.83" data-end="1250.59">the content API here so I also see how</span> <span data-start="1250.59" data-end="1254.01">long the API calls take but let's have a</span> <span data-start="1254.01" data-end="1256.5">look at another example here so this is</span> <span data-start="1256.5" data-end="1259.71">the Lando and what's the most important</span> <span data-start="1259.71" data-end="1263.309">thing here well I would say it's the</span> <span data-start="1263.309" data-end="1265.89">image right it's been 50% of the screen</span> <span data-start="1265.89" data-end="1268.77">so how hard can it be to measure when</span> <span data-start="1268.77" data-end="1272.49">this thing is rendered well today we</span> <span data-start="1272.49" data-end="1274.169">have to do this we have to define the</span> <span data-start="1274.169" data-end="1277.26">image with an onload handler this clears</span> <span data-start="1277.26" data-end="1280.529">navigation timing API marks then inside</span> <span data-start="1280.529" data-end="1281.73">the new mark and then we've got an</span> <span data-start="1281.73" data-end="1283.59">inline script afterwards so what this</span> <span data-start="1283.59" data-end="1285.27">basically does is whatever happens last</span> <span data-start="1285.27" data-end="1286.63">is the right</span> <span data-start="1286.63" data-end="1289.48">but this is not good experience at least</span> <span data-start="1289.48" data-end="1293.44">in my mind so there are also new specs</span> <span data-start="1293.44" data-end="1296.29">in the making for example like hero</span> <span data-start="1296.29" data-end="1298">element timing this is currently really</span> <span data-start="1298" data-end="1299.71">only in spec writing and discussing how</span> <span data-start="1299.71" data-end="1301.39">we could implement that but with</span> <span data-start="1301.39" data-end="1302.77">something like that we can get</span> <span data-start="1302.77" data-end="1305.83">information when something crucial is</span> <span data-start="1305.83" data-end="1308.23">rendered or laid out for example Twitter</span> <span data-start="1308.23"

data-end="1314.47">and this is really valuable information</span> <span data-start="1314.47" data-end="1316.72">so let's see where this goes and just</span> <span data-start="1316.72" data-end="1317.77">for the sake of completeness</span> <span data-start="1317.77" data-end="1320.25">there's also server timing which rates</span> <span data-start="1320.25" data-end="1324.82">which the server can set via an header a</span> <span data-start="1324.82" data-end="1328.03">header and then this values can are</span> <span data-start="1328.03" data-end="1329.8">easily accessible via

<span data-start="1335.68" data-end="1338.35">more metrics regarding rep performance</span> <span data-start="1338.35" data-end="1339.79">there's this excellent talk that is</span> <span

data-end="1347.38">recommended so what's the support for</span> <span data-start="1347.38" data-end="1352.39">the performance observer today I just</span> <span data-start="1352.39" data-end="1353.86">covered last week actually that Safari</span> <span data-start="1353.86" data-end="1355.24">joined the party which was surprising</span> <span data-start="1355.24" data-end="1358.57">though so it's not that bad is this poly</span> <span data-start="1358.57" data-end="1362.05">fillable well if browser vendors at some</span> <span data-start="1362.05" data-end="1363.43">point decide that they only want to push</span> <span data-start="1363.43" data-end="1365.17">metrics through the performance observer</span> <span data-start="1365.17" data-end="1367.87">the gern is more or less over but so far</span> <span data-start="1367.87" data-end="1369.91">the metrics are also available via get</span> <span data-start="1369.91" data-end="1371.92">entries by type so you can do a feature</span> <span data-start="1371.92" data-end="1374.35">detection check and then you are ready</span> <span data-start="1374.35" data-end="1378.22">to go so what we have now is a lazy</span> <span data-start="1378.22" data-end="1380.64">loading effect we've got unicorns and</span> <span data-start="1380.64" data-end="1382.69">unicorns are pretty gate great but</span> <span data-start="1382.69" data-end="1387.43">what's better than unicorns once this</span> <span data-start="1387.43" data-end="1394.21">again anyone what was that I didn't</span> <span data-start="1394.21" data-end="1398.17">understand it all right I'll give you a</span> <span data-start="1398.17"

implemented</span> <span data-start="1421.07" data-end="1424.85">next was confetti and to do that I have</span> <span data-start="1424.85" data-end="1426.29">to cheat a little bit but I think that's</span> <span data-start="1426.29" data-end="1428.9">alright let's assume there's a slide up</span> <span data-start="1428.9" data-end="1440.45">and down thing in the website this makes</span> <span data-start="1440.45" data-end="1444.11">me really happy so how could we now</span> <span data-start="1444.11" data-end="1448.25">figure out if something changed its size</span> <span data-start="1448.25" data-end="1454.13">any guesses well there's also the resize</span> <span data-start="1454.13" data-end="1456.95">observer so how does that work so we</span> <span data-start="1456.95" data-end="1458.66">have to initialize a new resize observer</span> <span data-start="1458.66" data-end="1460.58">which then gets called with several</span> <span data-start="1460.58" data-end="1463.34">entries and then we're just telling hey</span> <span data-start="1463.34" data-end="1464.63">alright can you please watch out for</span> <span data-start="1464.63" data-end="1466.22">these elements cool I want to do</span> <span data-start="1466.22" data-end="1467.95">something I want to draw confetti then</span> <span data-start="1467.95" data-end="1470.54">you might ask yourself though okay a fan</span> <span data-start="1470.54" data-end="1473.87">but when is this firing the resize</span> <span data-start="1473.87" data-end="1476.15">observer fires when elements gets</span> <span data-start="1476.15" data-end="1478.55">inserted and removed from Dom when they</span> <span data-start="1478.55" data-end="1481.34">get set to display:none they are not</span> <span data-start="1481.34" data-end="1483.98">triggering on CSS transforms though and</span> <span data-start="1483.98" data-end="1486.74">with this information further I have to</span> <span data-start="1486.74" data-end="1490.93">tell you my implementation was broken so</span> <span data-start="1490.93" data-end="1497.15">triggers on on load that's not so cool</span> <span data-start="1497.15" data-end="1499.97">it's drawing and closing I mean confetti</span> <span data-start="1499.97" data-end="1502.49">is great but it's not really accurate</span> <span data-start="1502.49" data-end="1504.73">here and it's also triggering on on</span> <span data-start="1504.73" data-end="1508.49">horizontal resizing but I think it was</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1508.49" data-end="1510.86">OK at that point right so one where</span> <span data-start="1510.86" data-end="1513.26">could we use the resize observer well</span> <span data-start="1513.26" data-end="1515.06">for drag and drop interfaces this can</span> <span data-start="1515.06" data-end="1518.3">become really handy this is six lines of</span> <span data-start="1518.3" data-end="1520.13">JavaScript and I can maybe a just scroll</span> <span data-start="1520.13" data-end="1521.72">positioning or something like that</span> <span data-start="1521.72" data-end="1526.22">and we are all waiting for element</span> <span data-start="1526.22" data-end="1528.86">queries right maybe they will be there</span> <span data-start="1528.86" data-end="1531.44">at some point the JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1531.44" data-end="1532.85">implementations are polyfill for this</span> <span data-start="1532.85" data-end="1535.7">are also considering using the resize</span> <span data-start="1535.7" data-end="1538.4">observer and to figure out if something</span> <span data-start="1538.4" data-end="1542.03">changed its size so all the support of</span> <span data-start="1542.03" data-end="1547.159">the resize observer today</span> <span data-start="1547.169" data-end="1551.499">we're entering cutting edge here I would</span> <span data-start="1551.499" data-end="1554.739">say is this poly fillable and usable in</span> <span data-start="1554.739" data-end="1559.84">production I would say so so they are</span> <span data-start="1559.84" data-end="1561.429">polyfills for the Wizards observer out</span> <span data-start="1561.429" data-end="1563.799">there and these use mutation observers</span> <span data-start="1563.799" data-end="1567.7">and they aren't they're not covering</span> <span data-start="1567.7" data-end="1570.309">everything so you might want to consider</span> <span data-start="1570.309" data-end="1572.11">if you want to really want to use that</span> <span data-start="1572.11" data-end="1578.47">today but we're still not really happy</span> <span data-start="1578.47" data-end="1582.369">so let's face the resize problem here</span> <span data-start="1582.369" data-end="1585.22">and let's take a step back</span> <span data-start="1585.22" data-end="1586.96">and let's see what we're actually</span> <span data-start="1586.96" data-end="1589.119">dealing with so here we've got an</span> <span data-start="1589.119" data-end="1591.879">element and this is a simplified version</span> <span data-start="1591.879" data-end="1594.22">for one element so what are we dealing</span> <span data-start="1594.22" data-end="1595.57">with we're dealing with this initial</span> <span data-start="1595.57" data-end="1598.659">call we're dealing with several opening</span> <span data-start="1598.659" data-end="1601.149">calls and we're dealing with several</span> <span data-start="1601.149" data-end="1603.7">closing calls and what we actually want</span> <span data-start="1603.7" data-end="1605.169">to do is we want to get rid of the first</span> <span data-start="1605.169" data-end="1607.509">one and of the closing ones so how could</span> <span data-start="1607.509" data-end="1610.239">we do this well here we have to call</span> <span data-start="1610.239" data-end="1614.559">back that is triggered on resize so well</span> <span data-start="1614.559" data-end="1619.6">we could soar boolean and toggle that</span> <span data-start="1619.6" data-end="1622.69">and how could we figure out if it's</span> <span data-start="1622.69" data-end="1627.85">getting bigger and smaller well we could</span> <span data-start="1627.85" data-end="1632.59">store the last run and then compare but</span> <span data-start="1632.59" data-end="1634.509">this code for me is not really readable</span> <span data-start="1634.509" data-end="1636.7">and it's also hard to maintain and it</span> <span data-start="1636.7" data-end="1639.34">has side effects outside of the event</span> <span data-start="1639.34" data-end="1642.369">handler and if you have several entries</span> <span data-start="1642.369" data-end="1646.359">that gets more more complicated so let's</span> <span data-start="1646.359" data-end="1652.119">enter the final topic observables just</span> <span data-start="1652.119" data-end="1655.119">because the name is fitting observables</span> <span data-start="1655.119" data-end="1657.789">are a collection that arrives over time</span> <span data-start="1657.789" data-end="1660.129">and currently they're only in spec but</span> <span data-start="1660.129" data-end="1661.6">they have already a widespread usage</span> <span data-start="1661.6" data-end="1664.09">thanks to our X and libraries like that</span> <span data-start="1664.09" data-end="1666.749">and they're definitely a talk on its own</span> <span data-start="1666.749" data-end="1669.759">so again observables a collection that</span> <span data-start="1669.759" data-end="1671.2">arrives over time so let's have a look</span> <span data-start="1671.2" data-end="1673.809">at an observable implementation so here</span> <span data-start="1673.809" data-end="1676.72">you see a function that is called get</span> <span data-start="1676.72" data-end="1678.58">observable with three values it's</span> <span data-start="1678.58" data-end="1679.76">initializing in Europe so</span> <span data-start="1679.76" data-end="1682.04">observable then it's calling next and</span> <span data-start="1682.04" data-end="1684.68">pushing values into this collection and</span> <span data-start="1684.68" data-end="1687.29">then it's completing at some point then</span> <span data-start="1687.29" data-end="1690.29">we're defining handlers for given events</span> <span data-start="1690.29" data-end="1693.17">of this collection and then we just</span> <span data-start="1693.17" data-end="1695.81">subscribe to that and then we get next 1</span> <span data-start="1695.81" data-end="1698.42">2 3 and yeah we're done when I saw this</span> <span data-start="1698.42" data-end="1702.68">for the first time I was like what's the</span> <span data-start="1702.68" data-end="1703.43">deal here</span> <span data-start="1703.43" data-end="1706.21">let's just shifting around callbacks now</span> <span data-start="1706.21" data-end="1708.41">but now we're dealing with the</span> <span data-start="1708.41" data-end="1709.82">collection which means that we have</span> <span data-start="1709.82" data-end="1711.56">stuff available that like maps will the</span> <span data-start="1711.56"
