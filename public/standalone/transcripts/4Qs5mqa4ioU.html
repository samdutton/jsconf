<p><span data-start="20.64" data-end="28.039">All right, hi everyone, my name is Artur, I work on the Google security team as an engineer</span> <span data-start="28.039" data-end="32.8">and what my team does is we try to make sure that we don't have security vulnerabilities</span> <span data-start="32.8" data-end="38.61">in our products, as you might know Google has a lot of web application, web-apps are</span> <span data-start="38.61" data-end="47.66">a big part of our world and we work with external researchers that get paid for findings vulnerabilities</span> <span data-start="47.66" data-end="50.93">in our products when we miss something.</span> <span data-start="50.93" data-end="56.87">This puts us in a position where we find out a lot about new patterns and flaws that can</span> <span data-start="56.87" data-end="62.609">affect the security of our web applications, because a lot of are web-apps are built using</span> <span data-start="62.609" data-end="69.13">open sources frameworks like angular and other ones, we learn about patterns that can affect</span> <span data-start="69.13" data-end="78.22">security and your web-apps possibly as well, right after we update code we often get new</span> <span data-start="78.22" data-end="80.759">data about some security flaws.</span> <span data-start="80.759" data-end="87.82">My hope for this talk is to share some of this with you and I'm very, I'm very happy</span> <span data-start="87.82" data-end="92.659">that Anand Vemuri hopefully already scared you a little bit when it comes to security</span> <span data-start="92.659" data-end="99.14">and the impact of cross-site scripting, so I my intent is to build up on this a little</span> <span data-start="99.14" data-end="103.28">bit and show you some angular-specific examples.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="103.28" data-end="108.09">Before I start, can you guys raise your hand if you know what angular is or if you have</span> <span data-start="108.09" data-end="112.45">written angular code in the past â€” ok, this is music to my ears.</span> <span data-start="112.45" data-end="116.149">Ok, so let's get started.</span> <span data-start="116.149" data-end="121.56">This is a security talk, this is JSConf so I will not tell you anything about securing</span> <span data-start="121.56" data-end="126.899">your database, or your back up systems, so not going to talk about server security at</span> <span data-start="126.899" data-end="131.53">all, we're going to talk about client security and client security here is making sure that</span> <span data-start="131.53" data-end="138.48">the users of your web applications don't get, cannot get compromised or attacked by evil</span> <span data-start="138.48" data-end="140.21">websites or networks.</span> <span data-start="140.21" data-end="145.32">Client security is a fairly broad area as well and, you know, if you want to have a</span> <span data-start="145.32" data-end="149.819">secure website you should have HTTPS and prevent a bunch of other things, but we're not going</span> <span data-start="149.819" data-end="158.25">to talk about that in general either, I will focus on the biggest threat that is sort of,</span> <span data-start="158.25" data-end="166.98">as an industry or web application developers we have been facing since web-apps have existed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="166.98" data-end="173.54">I know this is a subjective view but, at least at Google this is something that we are super</span> <span data-start="173.54" data-end="174.909">concerned about.</span> <span data-start="174.909" data-end="177.54">So, cross-site scripting.</span> <span data-start="177.54" data-end="181.73">Also the other thing is that for the other flaws, the other common things that we are</span> <span data-start="181.73" data-end="186.93">worried about in web applications we have relatively a good way of preventing them,</span> <span data-start="186.93" data-end="193.41">it might not be super straightforward, but if you want to prevent eavesdroppers getting</span> <span data-start="193.41" data-end="205.12">access to your users' data in your web app, you can deploy HTTPS and security engineers</span> <span data-start="205.12" data-end="206.98">will tell you what to do, it will be ok.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="206.98" data-end="214.239">For cross-site scripting it's not usually that simple, there are no panaceas that will</span> <span data-start="214.239" data-end="219.75">prevent your developers from introducing cross-site scripting bugs.</span> <span data-start="219.75" data-end="229.81">If you have been here for Anand Vemuri's talk, most of you have, this is cross-site scripting,</span> <span data-start="229.81" data-end="236.08">cross-site scripting got introduced if you have a HTTP parameter that you output to your</span> <span data-start="236.08" data-end="241.93">page without any escape, right, so you have a script, you have a get parameter, you write</span> <span data-start="241.93" data-end="251.33">it out and then what an evil website can do, they can point to that URL and make your user</span> <span data-start="251.33" data-end="252.69">execute an evil script.</span> <span data-start="252.69" data-end="258.959">One example of an evil script was something that Anand Vemuri showed, basically someone</span> <span data-start="258.959" data-end="265.36">gave a webcam permissions to your website, they can transparently enable it and sort</span> <span data-start="265.36" data-end="266.771">of spy on your users, but it</span> <span data-start="266.771" data-end="269.68">goes much beyond that actually.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="269.68" data-end="274.78">So what the evil code can do once it's injected into your origin, your domain, it has full</span> <span data-start="274.78" data-end="281.76">access to everything your user can do in the web app, if you think of rich ecosystems of</span> <span data-start="281.76" data-end="289.11">application, such as any major provider, Google, Facebook, Twitter, most of your apps, the</span> <span data-start="289.11" data-end="295.23">HorseDrawingTycoon app that Curtis will talk about in the next session, if you are an,</span> <span data-start="295.23" data-end="300.21">attacker and can inject evil code you can get access to everything a web application</span> <span data-start="300.21" data-end="306.849">has and you can attack other apps that live in the same domain as a cross-site scripting</span> <span data-start="306.849" data-end="309.599">bug.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="309.599" data-end="318.899">We worry about the fact you can persist your access as an attacker after you exploit cross-site</span> <span data-start="318.899" data-end="322.19">scripting for a given user.</span> <span data-start="322.19" data-end="329.04">What this means, even two months later, even after the developer closes the cross-site</span> <span data-start="329.04" data-end="335.279">scripting vulnerability the attacker might still be able to retain some access to the</span> <span data-start="335.279" data-end="336.86">web app, so that is super scary.</span> <span data-start="336.86" data-end="345.11">So, but you know, the good thing is that traditionally as JavaScript developers we did not have to</span> <span data-start="345.11" data-end="354.5">worry too much about, you know, the various ways in which you can introduce XSS into the</span> <span data-start="354.5" data-end="360.13">web-apps, when you purely write JavaScript code there are only a few APIs that might</span> <span data-start="360.13" data-end="366.57">be able to, that could lead to cross-site scripting, so things like setting inner HTML,</span> <span data-start="366.57" data-end="378.37">document.write, when you set HTML, when you set JavaScript URIs on window open navigation</span> <span data-start="378.37" data-end="384.56">and so on, maybe five years ago if you kept all of those in mind when you were writing</span> <span data-start="384.56" data-end="395.12">your JavaScript code, you would be safe from say 95% of the bugs that would otherwise introduced,</span> <span data-start="395.12" data-end="399.58">be careful with all the APIs.</span> <span data-start="399.58" data-end="405.45">The thing that is different these days, we don't really write web applications that use</span> <span data-start="405.45" data-end="414.05">those primatives directly, it's fairly rare, stuff like that rarely happens, it's rare</span> <span data-start="414.05" data-end="420.37">for modern well designed web application to use document.write, there are circumstances</span> <span data-start="420.37" data-end="423.71">where you might have to do that, but it's not that common.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="423.71" data-end="429.07">The reason that's the case, there are many new frameworks and many new APIs that were</span> <span data-start="429.07" data-end="434.57">introduced to make our lives easier, as part of the big web frameworks, so we don't have</span> <span data-start="434.57" data-end="447.55">to use the bare metal â€” it does make our life easier, it makes it easier to use the APIs</span> <span data-start="447.55" data-end="453.2">without really understanding, if you have a framework that wraps around one of these</span> <span data-start="453.2" data-end="459.36">functions then you are still vulnerable to the same class of issues, but even though</span> <span data-start="459.36" data-end="464.37">you have not written code that uses the dangerous API directly.</span> <span data-start="464.37" data-end="470.589">So, one of the things that has been, one of the frameworks that has become fairly popular</span> <span data-start="470.589" data-end="477.2">recently has been angular, to be honest I'm sure that almost all of you know way more</span> <span data-start="477.2" data-end="483.39">about angular than I do, I'm not an angular developer or Evangelist for that matter, I'm</span> <span data-start="483.39" data-end="490.719">a security engineer, I know enough to break angular apps but not enough to build with</span> <span data-start="490.719" data-end="497.01">angular, but that's ok, hopefully if you don't know too much about angular, I will show you</span> <span data-start="497.01" data-end="501.469">the bare things you need to understand, code examples that we will talk about.</span> <span data-start="501.469" data-end="509.18">Angular is pretty popular, just in case you forgot all about angular in the ten minutes</span> <span data-start="509.18" data-end="514.07">since I asked you if you know angular, this is how it works, three short steps.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="514.07" data-end="520.55">You include the angular JavaScript somewhere on your page, then you write something that</span> <span data-start="520.55" data-end="528.12">looks like HTML, sort of, so, you know, you write mark-up and you also have these ng-attributes</span> <span data-start="528.12" data-end="535.66">that allow your application to do the angular magic, right, you can have loops, you can</span> <span data-start="535.66" data-end="543.24">have, you know, data-bindings, the must have syntax that will be important in a few</span> <span data-start="543.24" data-end="554.65">minutes, it's not specific to angular, it's one of the big users of moustache syntax,</span> <span data-start="554.65" data-end="564.89">the last thing is to behind the JavaScript that you write for your controller, to the</span> <span data-start="564.89" data-end="573.75">appropriate DOM element that has all the bindings and angular syntax, right, it's fairly straightforward</span> <span data-start="573.75" data-end="579.31">conceptually it allows really powerful, really cool web applications to be built.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="579.31" data-end="586.09">There is a lot of APIs, the template syntax is very rich, you can do a lot with that,</span> <span data-start="586.09" data-end="593.1">there is components, a lot of APIs for requesting data from the server and you know, really</span> <span data-start="593.1" data-end="596.44">lots of cool stuff you can look at examples, it's great.</span> <span data-start="596.44" data-end="602.72">All right, so, you know, I've set it up a little bit, you know angular, you know this</span> <span data-start="602.72" data-end="607.66">is an security talk, so what, what's the deal?</span> <span data-start="607.66" data-end="614.99">So, when you start using these frameworks there are a lot of things that might look</span> <span data-start="614.99" data-end="620.67">to be, might seem to be very safe, but actually when you, when you sort of look more closely</span> <span data-start="620.67" data-end="623.05">turns out there are subtle issues there.</span> <span data-start="623.05" data-end="628.09">So, the first issue that we have actually run into several times in several of our applications</span> <span data-start="628.09" data-end="635.16">is what happens if you mix angular and surfer-side template systems, so I hope that most if you,</span> <span data-start="635.16" data-end="639.55">when you generate mark-up on the server are using a templatetime, as Anand Vemuri was</span> <span data-start="639.55" data-end="643.47">saying earlier, this is something that gives you context escaping so you don't have to</span> <span data-start="643.47" data-end="653.41">do it manually because you need different types of escaping, the template server will</span> <span data-start="653.41" data-end="655.67">take care of all of that for you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="655.67" data-end="663.39">In the past you would have a template, you would render it and even if you had evil inputs</span> <span data-start="663.39" data-end="670.3">to your application, the template system would, by default, just escape it, properly for the</span> <span data-start="670.3" data-end="675.33">context, at least if you are using a good template system and most, most reasonable,</span> <span data-start="675.33" data-end="678.45">modern frameworks use those and you are fine.</span> <span data-start="678.45" data-end="681.55">So, ok, so what this problem really?</span> <span data-start="681.55" data-end="686.53">So this is what happens when you, when you use a template system on the server-side and</span> <span data-start="686.53" data-end="688.74">angular.</span> <span data-start="688.74" data-end="693.34">The only difference here is that we have included some angular elements in are template right,</span> <span data-start="693.34" data-end="703.6">we have the ng-app, but what happens is and this is in the bottom code box, that the template</span> <span data-start="703.6" data-end="710.81">system will escape all your HTML meta characters, you can't just inject HTML but your server-side</span> <span data-start="710.81" data-end="721.47">system knows much about the moustache system, you if you allow this kind of output, angular</span> <span data-start="721.47" data-end="728.47">when it processes the page after it loads it will do it's magic, try to find directives</span> <span data-start="728.47" data-end="733.57">in the angular controlled DOM element and it will execute them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="733.57" data-end="738.17">What this means is that as an attacker you might not be able to inject straight up mark-up,</span> <span data-start="738.17" data-end="746.85">but you can use angular data bindings, execute arbitrary angular controller functions so</span> <span data-start="746.85" data-end="754.16">basically do anything that is defined in your angular controllers and also the sort of really</span> <span data-start="754.16" data-end="760.87">big thing that, that is not often talked about, is that it's possible to escape out of the</span> <span data-start="760.87" data-end="774.779">angular box, and once you can inject the moustache since tax â€” if you go to the angular security</span> <span data-start="774.779" data-end="780.11">page they will tell you, you should not mix client side and server-side templates, it</span> <span data-start="780.11" data-end="788.52">can lead to the interesting interactions between the two, that will, that will â€” that can possibly</span> <span data-start="788.52" data-end="789.9">make your app vulnerable.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="789.9" data-end="795.47">There are good reasons to do this, if you retrofit angular into existing web applications</span> <span data-start="795.47" data-end="803.18">that are often generated alongside server-side templates then you will have these issues.</span> <span data-start="803.18" data-end="807.97">Also if you want to pre-populate part of your page with data the server knows about and</span> <span data-start="807.97" data-end="814.77">you want to avoid a separate call back to get this data, it's sort of natural to do</span> <span data-start="814.77" data-end="820.45">this, it's one pattern that is surprisingly interesting.</span> <span data-start="820.45" data-end="827.72">Ok so let's say we go about this, we create our Angular part of the page statically we</span> <span data-start="827.72" data-end="834.97">don't have any server-side template generation we just have a very simple application here,</span> <span data-start="834.97" data-end="842.69">which has just one image and alt tag and displays the fav icon.</span> <span data-start="842.69" data-end="848.47">We have a controller, the controller has a dangerous function but we're not executing</span> <span data-start="848.47" data-end="852.819">it so everything is fine, nothing to worry about here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="852.819" data-end="860.68">So what happens if before we run Angular on the page, we insert and we run another completely</span> <span data-start="860.68" data-end="867.18">innocuous JavaScript function, what this function is doing is finding all the image elements</span> <span data-start="867.18" data-end="874.779">on the page, and it's adding an alt attribute to every image it's probably a really crappy</span> <span data-start="874.779" data-end="881.32">use of the alt attribute you should never do this but we're just adding some data image</span> <span data-start="881.32" data-end="882.66">from our site.</span> <span data-start="882.66" data-end="887.47">When the location is something that is controlled in part by the user because you can open any</span> <span data-start="887.47" data-end="893.77">web page with location.hash, the URL fragment at the end is something that the user controls</span> <span data-start="893.77" data-end="901.279">but the alt tag, the alt attribute it's not async, it's normally if you do this nothing</span> <span data-start="901.279" data-end="902.279">bad will happen.</span> <span data-start="902.279" data-end="909.33">If you insert a script tag or HTML markup it will not render it's just like a bit of</span> <span data-start="909.33" data-end="917.02">text, but what happens here when this interaction appears, is before Angular is invoked after</span> <span data-start="917.02" data-end="923.17">our function runs, we will suddenly have this bit of DOM where you have an alt attribute</span> <span data-start="923.17" data-end="933.589">which data so assuming that the attacker injected a bit of Angular markup in the URL what Angular</span> <span data-start="933.589" data-end="938.36">sees when it tries to parse the page is an alt attribute with a data binding.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="938.36" data-end="944.38">It will look at it think ok well now there is something for me I will execute it.</span> <span data-start="944.38" data-end="953.23">Again as an attacker, you are able to inject arbitrary JavaScript and compromise the application.</span> <span data-start="953.23" data-end="958.68">So this is another example of an interaction where before everything would have been safe,</span> <span data-start="958.68" data-end="963.81">but because you are using a client side powerful framework you start having problems.</span> <span data-start="963.81" data-end="968.44">All right, so let me give you another example.</span> <span data-start="968.44" data-end="974.31">So one of the most powerful features of Angular and other similar framework Ss are in includes</span> <span data-start="974.31" data-end="983.51">where you don't have to have all your HTML syntax inline but you can include sub templates</span> <span data-start="983.51" data-end="988.82">and these templates will be rendered as part of your application so it's really great.</span> <span data-start="988.82" data-end="995.48">It allows angular to fetch a little bit of markup anywhere from the server, render it</span> <span data-start="995.48" data-end="1000.19">in it's super useful.</span> <span data-start="1000.19" data-end="1006.44">So in here what we're doing is we have this NG, including that is based on the scope of</span> <span data-start="1006.44" data-end="1012.74">the controller so when we set the template URL variable we're saying this is just a pass</span> <span data-start="1012.74" data-end="1016.399">to an HTML file on our server.</span> <span data-start="1016.399" data-end="1021.53">So again nothing to worry about it's fine the user language is controlled, by the user</span> <span data-start="1021.53" data-end="1025.179">possibly but it doesn't seem like there's anything super wrong here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1025.179" data-end="1026.179">Right?</span> <span data-start="1026.179" data-end="1030.579">Well hopefully by now you know that all the examples are tricky, yes there is something</span> <span data-start="1030.579" data-end="1034.6">wrong and there is something bad that can happen in this application.</span> <span data-start="1034.6" data-end="1042.74">So if the user can control this variable, part of the URL from which Angular loads the</span> <span data-start="1042.74" data-end="1050.9">template what they can do is they can add and this is actually very reminiscent of old</span> <span data-start="1050.9" data-end="1058.47">server where you have directory reversal you are sometimes on the server able to read files</span> <span data-start="1058.47" data-end="1060.67">from different directories than you would expect.</span> <span data-start="1060.67" data-end="1063.52">Here is the same but it's on the client.</span> <span data-start="1063.52" data-end="1065.92">So when this sort of</span> <span data-start="1065.92" data-end="1074.38">evil language variable is embedded as part of the include value, what will happen is</span> <span data-start="1074.38" data-end="1082.67">that this URL is no longer pointing to/angular templates/something it can point to a URL</span> <span data-start="1082.67" data-end="1089.34">on your website that redirects to a completely external site that might be controlled by</span> <span data-start="1089.34" data-end="1090.89">the user.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1090.89" data-end="1100.01">Because under the hood what Angular is doing is XML HTTP request if it replies with all</span> <span data-start="1100.01" data-end="1106.27">the cross origin headers the data that the attacker supplies will now be include as part</span> <span data-start="1106.27" data-end="1112.49">of our application that can contain HTML and arbitrary scripts.</span> <span data-start="1112.49" data-end="1118.809">Something that I should mention here is that Angular does have a mechanism that will, that</span> <span data-start="1118.809" data-end="1125.15">by default prevent this from happening, but Angular also considers anything under your</span> <span data-start="1125.15" data-end="1128.16">domain to be a trusted resource.</span> <span data-start="1128.16" data-end="1134.87">So to angular this URL/angular/templates, this looks like a trusted resource, it points</span> <span data-start="1134.87" data-end="1141.4">to your web server it has no easy way of knowing that eventually if the browser follows all</span> <span data-start="1141.4" data-end="1145.33">the redirects this can contain untrusted data.</span> <span data-start="1145.33" data-end="1152.55">So by default if you use those kind of patterns, your application will be vulnerable.</span> <span data-start="1152.55" data-end="1154.64">So another example.</span> <span data-start="1154.64" data-end="1163.63">So, let's say that just hypothetically you have a HorseDrawingTycoon application, and</span> <span data-start="1163.63" data-end="1173.1">you use JCP in that, complete hypothetical HorseDrawingTycoon I am sure most of you are</span> <span data-start="1173.1" data-end="1182.3">familiar with JSONP, I am not sure why it's called JSON, it doesn't look like padding</span> <span data-start="1182.3" data-end="1186.85">to me that's what it's called four few years I guess the name stuck.</span> <span data-start="1186.85" data-end="1198.53">It's how you JSONP in angular there's a convenience rapper for JSONP, you can call a HTTP object,</span> <span data-start="1198.53" data-end="1205.84">what happens is the URL you pass to this function will be used as a script source if you think</span> <span data-start="1205.84" data-end="1213">about what that means you will not manually ever write JavaScript code that says create</span> <span data-start="1213" data-end="1218.97">a document, create element script then as a source assign evil.com to it, but when you</span> <span data-start="1218.97" data-end="1227.52">use the JSONP API in a way that's is commonly used especially for restful APIs, you say</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1227.52" data-end="1238.4">I want to load JSONP from my server, /app then there is something that is potentially</span> <span data-start="1238.4" data-end="1239.64">controlled by the user.</span> <span data-start="1239.64" data-end="1248.49">A name of your object, or an identifier of your object, and if you create a URL like</span> <span data-start="1248.49" data-end="1257.62">this, it's the same kind of pattern that we just saw with the NG include example.</span> <span data-start="1257.62" data-end="1269.04">Basically if as part of the URL you have, ./you will fetch an open re-direct or from</span> <span data-start="1269.04" data-end="1270.53">an evil site.</span> <span data-start="1270.53" data-end="1277.73">Again now the evil application cannot respond with HTML but it can respond with an evil</span> <span data-start="1277.73" data-end="1279.88">straight up JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1279.88" data-end="1287.87">So maybe the JSONP API is not that common but what is really common in angular applications</span> <span data-start="1287.87" data-end="1294.64">is the HTTP get API, any time you want to retrieve something from your server or any</span> <span data-start="1294.64" data-end="1300.309">external resource you use HTTP get.</span> <span data-start="1300.309" data-end="1307.429">If you just want to load say JSON, not JSONP but JSON or any other thing you generate from</span> <span data-start="1307.429" data-end="1313.53">the server you will have a very similar issue.</span> <span data-start="1313.53" data-end="1317.51">So this is actually a very common pattern we see.</span> <span data-start="1317.51" data-end="1324.45">By itself if you just use HTTP get on a potentially external untrusted resource it's not terrible</span> <span data-start="1324.45" data-end="1329.32">because what will end up happening is that you will issue an XML HTTP request your application</span> <span data-start="1329.32" data-end="1335.03">will get the data but if it discards is or does nothing with it you will be safe because</span> <span data-start="1335.03" data-end="1340.25">the data just by calling HTTP get you are not doing anything thatâ€™s super scary but</span> <span data-start="1340.25" data-end="1347.89">what actually happens is that the data that you obtain from the server, is used for something</span> <span data-start="1347.89" data-end="1350.36">later, like generating parts of the page.</span> <span data-start="1350.36" data-end="1357.16">So in here if we call inner HTML we assign inner HTML us any of the data we have got</span> <span data-start="1357.16" data-end="1362.82">from what we think is our server about it's actually an attacker called response.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1362.82" data-end="1367.64">We will again have a problem because inner HTML is a DOM sync, then we have a bug.</span> <span data-start="1367.64" data-end="1375.86">Iâ€™m sure you are thinking about what I said before which is no-one really writes code</span> <span data-start="1375.86" data-end="1378.67">that uses inner HTML directly anymore, so this is</span> <span data-start="1378.67" data-end="1380.4">sort of a fake example right?</span> <span data-start="1380.4" data-end="1386.25">Yes it's a fake example, but what ends up happening much more common in practice, is</span> <span data-start="1386.25" data-end="1394.21">that rather than using inner HTML directly what you end up doing is instead of using</span> <span data-start="1394.21" data-end="1401.391">inner HTML you use some of the jQ lite rappers that let you create part of the DOM your JQ</span> <span data-start="1401.391" data-end="1415.04">lite is a sub-set you just get some of these convenience methods eye HTML, append and others,</span> <span data-start="1415.04" data-end="1424.309">and in here if you get the data from the attacker and then you call append, this is sort of</span> <span data-start="1424.309" data-end="1430.47">in visibly wraps round the inner HTML DOM sync, and you might have a problem.</span> <span data-start="1430.47" data-end="1438.03">So in the past, if I were a security engineer, reviewing the code of a JavaScript application,</span> <span data-start="1438.03" data-end="1443.309">I would grab for an inner HTML, crap for a bunch of these other patterns, but in here</span> <span data-start="1443.309" data-end="1449.34">we have angular and any other framework like that injecting their own wrappers that do</span> <span data-start="1449.34" data-end="1454.64">the same thing but are sort of hard for both the security engineer and the developer writing</span> <span data-start="1454.64" data-end="1458.34">the code to understand, that they are potentially dangerous.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1458.34" data-end="1465.62">There's no big list that you can Google and sort of know that these function calls are</span> <span data-start="1465.62" data-end="1467.4">dangerous.</span> <span data-start="1467.4" data-end="1473.799">So you just sort of have to keep that in mind.</span> <span data-start="1473.799" data-end="1477.74">We're almost done, I just have a couple of things to show you that are maybe a little</span> <span data-start="1477.74" data-end="1486.61">less used but also interesting from the sort of new way of doing things perspective.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1486.61" data-end="1493.48">So angular and other frameworks give you direct access some of the interesting parsing functionality</span> <span data-start="1493.48" data-end="1495.58">that the framework has to do.</span> <span data-start="1495.58" data-end="1501.41">So rather than create a bit of HTML sort of statically then in invoking angular on it</span> <span data-start="1501.41" data-end="1509.1">you can create a string on JavaScript then call interpolate and angular will do the same</span> <span data-start="1509.1" data-end="1518.15">thing it would normally do on your page substitute data bindings, render HTML the same thing</span> <span data-start="1518.15" data-end="1519.809">as compiling.</span> <span data-start="1519.809" data-end="1524.71">If you parse any untrusted data to any of those function if you manually need to call</span> <span data-start="1524.71" data-end="1531.83">them for some reason you will also have another cross-site scripting bug.</span> <span data-start="1531.83" data-end="1536.98">The final example that I wanted to show you is something that Anand also mentioned earlier,</span> <span data-start="1536.98" data-end="1544.73">and that is probably the most common thing that is like to happen in angular applications</span> <span data-start="1544.73" data-end="1553.83">in the past if you wanted to render some HTML, that the potential lay has JavaScript attributes</span> <span data-start="1553.83" data-end="1560.95">or things that might be dangerous in some way, but if you trust it you control all the</span> <span data-start="1560.95" data-end="1569.57">input you can say ngbinding HTML safe it will be fine but this a dangerous API because any</span> <span data-start="1569.57" data-end="1574.23">time you pass user controlled data to it you will have a bug.</span> <span data-start="1574.23" data-end="1581.32">Now angular actually prevented this from happening in new versions, so now you just a have ngbindHTML</span> <span data-start="1581.32" data-end="1587.799">which will by default sanitise all the markup you give the if you give it a script it will</span> <span data-start="1587.799" data-end="1593.799">escape everything if you give it a bold tag it will keep it because it's knows it's safe.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1593.799" data-end="1600.7">There's a whole family of functions that let you trust bits of data as HTML, basically</span> <span data-start="1600.7" data-end="1605.99">tell angular this fine don't worry about it don't escape it I have checked it's correct.</span> <span data-start="1605.99" data-end="1613.17">This tends to be used improperly as scary with scary frequency.</span> <span data-start="1613.17" data-end="1616.58">All right, ok.</span> <span data-start="1616.58" data-end="1620.41">So, like what's the point of all this?</span> <span data-start="1620.41" data-end="1624.98">What I thought initially as I was working on this talk I thought ok I will try to scare</span> <span data-start="1624.98" data-end="1630.87">you a little bit, and then I will give you solutions for all these things because why</span> <span data-start="1630.87" data-end="1631.87">wouldn't</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1631.87" data-end="1632.87">I?</span> <span data-start="1632.87" data-end="1636.63">I don't want to be a jerk I want to tell you how to write secure code, but in the end I</span> <span data-start="1636.63" data-end="1641.7">decided I will probably be a little bit of a jerk and not tell you how to fix it and</span> <span data-start="1641.7" data-end="1646.28">the reason is that even if I told you how to address all these patterns, that that we</span> <span data-start="1646.28" data-end="1655.62">saw on the previous slides it would not comprehensively cover all of the sharp edges of the framework</span> <span data-start="1655.62" data-end="1657.559">that you might need to be concerned about.</span> <span data-start="1657.559" data-end="1661.47">So you would come out of this room thinking ok I know everything there is to know about</span> <span data-start="1661.47" data-end="1667.22">angular security I will avoid these thing it will be fine, but in practice it's not</span> <span data-start="1667.22" data-end="1671.19">like that because first of all angular is just one of many frameworks and second of</span> <span data-start="1671.19" data-end="1675.46">all, there are many other things in angular that we don't yet know about the framework</span> <span data-start="1675.46" data-end="1681.68">changes, so instead of giving you specific recipes or patterns for how to avoid it I</span> <span data-start="1681.68" data-end="1685.42">will ask you to do 3 things, sort of to keep in mind at a high level.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1685.42" data-end="1687.26">First of all, read the box.</span> <span data-start="1687.26" data-end="1692.97">I know as developers we often want to get things running there's a lot of pressures,</span> <span data-start="1692.97" data-end="1697.679">but if you want to have a secure application, usually what will really had is read the docks</span> <span data-start="1697.679" data-end="1703.46">from your framework they will tell you what you have to keep in mind or what you have</span> <span data-start="1703.46" data-end="1704.74">to worry about.</span> <span data-start="1704.74" data-end="1710.37">The second thing is talk to security people, either in person or on Twitter, ask them Iâ€™m</span> <span data-start="1710.37" data-end="1714.44">using angular what should I be worried about.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1714.44" data-end="1721.95">Because they, we as security folks get super excited about these minute that led to thee</span> <span data-start="1721.95" data-end="1728.84">problems if you want to talk to me later I am super happy to do it I love to do it.</span> <span data-start="1728.84" data-end="1729.84">That's second thing.</span> <span data-start="1729.84" data-end="1736.559">The third thing I want to leave you with is I wanted to show you that these kind of things</span> <span data-start="1736.559" data-end="1744.36">can be, that interactions between these components and the ways in which you can use new frameworks</span> <span data-start="1744.36" data-end="1751.98">are super cool exciting and it's fun to think about it, and it's fun to break your on applications.</span> <span data-start="1751.98" data-end="1755.71">Next time you write code like this think about whether it could possibly be vulnerable to</span> <span data-start="1755.71" data-end="1759.84">one of the things I showed and overall this is just super fun.</span> <span data-start="1759.84" data-end="1765.679">I think it's almost as fun as HorseDrawingTycoon kind of game.</span> </p>
