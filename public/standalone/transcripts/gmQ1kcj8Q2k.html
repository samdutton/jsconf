PCM encoding as an</span> <span data-start="363.879" data-end="366.429">array and each channel gets interleaved</span> <span data-start="366.429" data-end="368.829">so we can think about the array

data-end="826.69">let's take a look so this is max</span> <span data-start="826.7" data-end="829">we can go and we can start a new project</span> <span data-start="829" data-end="835.64">and we can start by just making a cycle</span> <span data-start="835.64" data-end="839.03">at 440 Hertz and we'll connect that to</span> <span data-start="839.03" data-end="847.85">the output we got some sound

<span data-start="851.36" data-end="853.79">changing the amplitude is just</span> <span data-start="853.79" data-end="856.7">multiplying so we can take you know the</span> <span data-start="856.7" data-end="858.23">output of this and put it into a</span> <span data-start="858.23" data-end="864.11">multiplier here we can connect it then</span> <span data-start="864.11" data-end="866.12">we can

now we're going</span> <span data-start="869.84" data-end="873.62">to get amplitude modulation</span> <span data-start="873.63" data-end="876.39">and then we can take you know another</span> <span data-start="876.39" data-end="877.8">one of these and we can do frequency</span> <span data-start="877.8" data-end="881.61">modulation as well so we take another</span> <span data-start="881.61" data-end="883.89">cycle will put it through like a number</span> <span data-start="883.89" data-end="886.8">object turn that signal into like an</span> <span data-start="886.8" data-end="890.31">actual number then we want to do we want</span> <span data-start="890.31" data-end="896.01">to take it we want to add one to it so</span> <span data-start="896.01" data-end="897.78">that it's not zero based anymore and</span> <span data-start="897.78" data-end="916.86">then we can multiply it by like 220</span> <span data-start="916.87" data-end="919.13">we can just start kind of like changing</span> <span data-start="919.13" data-end="939.439">that</span> <span data-start="939.449" data-end="941.429">we could like literally just copy this</span> <span data-start="941.429" data-end="944.089">whole thing we can encapsulate it</span> <span data-start="944.089" data-end="947.54">we can duplicate it</span> <span data-start="947.55" data-end="949.86">add another one</span> <span data-start="949.86" data-end="953.11">popping this one</span> <span data-start="953.12" data-end="993.36">change this one to be like</span> <span data-start="993.37" data-end="1003.13">that's music I guess so this is the</span> <span data-start="1003.13" data-end="1004.42">monome that I was talking before and</span> <span data-start="1004.42" data-end="1005.56">just let me know when we need to stop</span> <span data-start="1005.56" data-end="1010.21">because I'll just keep going so I built</span> <span data-start="1010.21" data-end="1013.33">this one a couple years ago I think I</span> <span data-start="1013.33" data-end="1015.64">can just kind of like yeah so the case</span> <span data-start="1015.64" data-end="1017.5">comes out and there's like electronics</span> <span data-start="1017.5" data-end="1021.4">in there it's really pretty and so the</span> <span data-start="1021.4" data-end="1023.95">case the top part is steel milled</span> <span data-start="1023.95" data-end="1026.44">aluminum and then this was like hand</span> <span data-start="1026.44" data-end="1029.17">routed it actually was another ma noms</span> <span data-start="1029.17" data-end="1030.76">case and then I got it secondhand</span> <span data-start="1030.76" data-end="1032.5">through a form you could tell the edges</span> <span data-start="1032.5" data-end="1034.39">where I roughly routed it to shove this</span> <span data-start="1034.39" data-end="1037.69">case in so that it all fit so we plug</span> <span data-start="1037.69" data-end="1040.3">this in it's going to give a light and</span> <span data-start="1040.3" data-end="1041.62">so there's some fun things that we can</span> <span data-start="1041.62" data-end="1043.6">do like really quickly with this so we</span> <span data-start="1043.6" data-end="1048.7">can open up monome cereal which is this</span> <span data-start="1048.7" data-end="1050.74">communicates the computer through cereal</span> <span data-start="1050.74"

everything over UDP</span> <span data-start="1061.18" data-end="1063.19">so you can do a lot more than you can</span> <span data-start="1063.19" data-end="1065.13">with MIDI MIDI you really only have
