<p><span data-start="6.799" data-end="14.4">reject hi everyone I'm really excited to</span> <span data-start="14.4" data-end="16.77">be here talking to you I've come all the</span> <span data-start="16.77" data-end="23.55">way from Melbourne Australia so today</span> <span data-start="23.55" data-end="24.63">what I'm going to talk to you about is</span> <span data-start="24.63" data-end="27.689">how I use the browser to do science I'm</span> <span data-start="27.689" data-end="29.88">going to talk about how I use it to do</span> <span data-start="29.88" data-end="32.099">my research which involves simulating</span> <span data-start="32.099" data-end="35.61">brain cells but I'm also going to talk</span> <span data-start="35.61" data-end="38.19">sort of more generally about my</span> <span data-start="38.19" data-end="40.86">experiences and thoughts relating to</span> <span data-start="40.86" data-end="42.329">sort of the crossroads between science</span> <span data-start="42.329" data-end="46.53">and web development but first I'm going</span> <span data-start="46.53" data-end="50.76">to tell you to origin stories and like</span> <span data-start="50.76" data-end="52.379">all good origin stories both of these</span> <span data-start="52.379" data-end="56.69">involve science so the first one I think</span> <span data-start="56.69" data-end="60.02">probably most you are familiar with is</span> <span data-start="60.02" data-end="63.66">it's the birth of the web so the web was</span> <span data-start="63.66" data-end="65.97">created in the late 1980s by Tim</span> <span data-start="65.97" data-end="69.57">berners-lee at CERN and it was created</span> <span data-start="69.57" data-end="73.92">to help scientists do science it was so</span> <span data-start="73.92" data-end="75.42">the problem that was happening was that</span> <span data-start="75.42" data-end="76.95">there were all these particle physicists</span> <span data-start="76.95" data-end="78.99">who would travel discern to do their</span> <span data-start="78.99" data-end="80.58">experiments on the facilities there and</span> <span data-start="80.58" data-end="83.009">they needed a better way to share and</span> <span data-start="83.009" data-end="85.17">access their data when they go back to</span> <span data-start="85.17" data-end="89.22">their home home laboratories so as Tim</span> <span data-start="89.22" data-end="91.56">berners-lee put it in those days there</span> <span data-start="91.56" data-end="93.03">was different information on different</span> <span data-start="93.03" data-end="94.89">computers and you'd have to log on to</span> <span data-start="94.89" data-end="96.09">these different computers and often have</span> <span data-start="96.09" data-end="98.579">to learn a new program to get at the</span> <span data-start="98.579" data-end="101.909">data so often it was just easier to to</span> <span data-start="101.909" data-end="105.27">meet with the people um over a coffee or</span> <span data-start="105.27" data-end="107.009">something like that and so he saw the</span> <span data-start="107.009" data-end="115.29">web as a way to solve these problems and</span> <span data-start="115.29" data-end="117.6">so shortly after that the web spun out</span> <span data-start="117.6" data-end="119.159">of the scientific community and became</span> <span data-start="119.159" data-end="123.6">what it is today now the second origin</span> <span data-start="123.6" data-end="125.549">story I'm pretty confident not many</span> <span data-start="125.549" data-end="128.22">people here will know about it's the</span> <span data-start="128.22" data-end="129.78">story of how I came to be speaking here</span> <span data-start="129.78" data-end="132.74">today</span> <span data-start="132.75" data-end="136.23">so like many of you and as Ronald sort</span> <span data-start="136.23" data-end="137.73">of pointed out earlier a lot of people</span> <span data-start="137.73" data-end="139.65">come from a different area and I'm no</span> <span data-start="139.65" data-end="142.41">exception my background is in sort of</span> <span data-start="142.41" data-end="144.45">mathematics and engineering and then</span> <span data-start="144.45" data-end="147.57">went into modeling brain systems trying</span> <span data-start="147.57" data-end="151.95">to understand how they worked much stand</span> <span data-start="151.95" data-end="157.56">here so and I was so interested in that</span> <span data-start="157.56" data-end="160.2">that I decided to do a PhD in it which I</span> <span data-start="160.2" data-end="161.94">don't recommend people get into</span> <span data-start="161.94" data-end="165.39">half-heartedly PhDs are hard and it's</span> <span data-start="165.39" data-end="166.62">not because you need to be super smart</span> <span data-start="166.62" data-end="168.66">or anything like that it's hard because</span> <span data-start="168.66" data-end="170.04">you have to stay interested in a</span> <span data-start="170.04" data-end="172.5">particular topic for a long time you</span> <span data-start="172.5" data-end="173.76">have to be the one driving it forward</span> <span data-start="173.76" data-end="176.88">and motivating it you will probably be</span> <span data-start="176.88" data-end="178.44">the only one who really fully knows</span> <span data-start="178.44" data-end="181.11">what's going on and really cares you</span> <span data-start="181.11" data-end="184.59">know if you're successful and this needs</span> <span data-start="184.59" data-end="186.81">to be the case for years and because of</span> <span data-start="186.81" data-end="188.67">this the end of a PhD is often a time of</span> <span data-start="188.67" data-end="190.59">stress disillusionment and</span> <span data-start="190.59" data-end="196.11">procrastination so I didn't make a</span> <span data-start="196.11" data-end="198.6">jacket out of tax receipts the way I</span> <span data-start="198.6" data-end="201.32">procrastinated was instead teaching</span> <span data-start="201.32" data-end="206.459">myself Ruby on Rails and so I'd like to</span> <span data-start="206.459" data-end="208.14">help me learn i decided to build a</span> <span data-start="208.14" data-end="210.18">project and so actually built a rhyming</span> <span data-start="210.18" data-end="213.36">dictionary called any rom-com so us can</span> <span data-start="213.36" data-end="216.09">check that out if you want and I taught</span> <span data-start="216.09" data-end="217.83">myself JavaScript as well to try and</span> <span data-start="217.83" data-end="219.209">make sort of a nice interface for how</span> <span data-start="219.209" data-end="221.67">you could you know make a particular</span> <span data-start="221.67" data-end="223.98">kind of rhyme that you wanted so I</span> <span data-start="223.98" data-end="226.29">learned angular for that and I found</span> <span data-start="226.29" data-end="228.45">myself really enjoying doing this I was</span> <span data-start="228.45" data-end="230.549">really satisfying and it's not just</span> <span data-start="230.549" data-end="232.11">because i had a thesis but I didn't want</span> <span data-start="232.11" data-end="237.93">to ride but at this point I did</span> <span data-start="237.93" data-end="239.88">eventually hand in my thesis and I got a</span> <span data-start="239.88" data-end="242.989">job working for IBM Research Australia</span> <span data-start="242.989" data-end="245">still doing euro science research</span> <span data-start="245" data-end="248.85">believe it or not but at this point I</span> <span data-start="248.85" data-end="252.9">now had a taste for for what for what</span> <span data-start="252.9" data-end="254.73">the web could do and and I now knew</span> <span data-start="254.73" data-end="255.989">about this whole other world of cool</span> <span data-start="255.989" data-end="258.6">stuff and and maybe this could help with</span> <span data-start="258.6" data-end="262.47">my research so before I go any further</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="262.47" data-end="264.419">I'll give you some context to my</span> <span data-start="264.419" data-end="265.43">research</span> <span data-start="265.43" data-end="268.61">so this is the human brain well it's a</span> <span data-start="268.61" data-end="270.83">plastic model of human brain it</span> <span data-start="270.83" data-end="272.72">represents this hunk of meat that sits</span> <span data-start="272.72" data-end="275.21">in our head that is somehow responsible</span> <span data-start="275.21" data-end="277.699">for all our memories emotions and</span> <span data-start="277.699" data-end="280.759">decisions our sense of self and our</span> <span data-start="280.759" data-end="284.169">ability to comprehend the world it takes</span> <span data-start="284.169" data-end="286.34">information from our senses from our</span> <span data-start="286.34" data-end="288.949">eyes our ears and our fingertips and</span> <span data-start="288.949" data-end="294.11">somehow members this and we can then use</span> <span data-start="294.11" data-end="298.58">this information to to speak to move but</span> <span data-start="298.58" data-end="300.139">how it does all of this is largely a</span> <span data-start="300.139" data-end="303.949">mystery and understanding this is sort</span> <span data-start="303.949" data-end="305.9">of the map the fundamental goal of</span> <span data-start="305.9" data-end="308.93">neuroscience what we do know however is</span> <span data-start="308.93" data-end="311.24">that the brain is made up of a large</span> <span data-start="311.24" data-end="314.599">number of cells called neurons in the</span> <span data-start="314.599" data-end="316.37">human brain they're approximately 86</span> <span data-start="316.37" data-end="318.8">billion neurons and each one of these</span> <span data-start="318.8" data-end="320.66">forms 10,000 connections to its</span> <span data-start="320.66" data-end="324.74">neighbors and it's this dense network of</span> <span data-start="324.74" data-end="328.34">neurons that scientists believe is what</span> <span data-start="328.34" data-end="329.659">sort of gives rise to the brains</span> <span data-start="329.659" data-end="332.87">abilities so if we now just focusing on</span> <span data-start="332.87" data-end="335.21">a single neuron we see it has sort of</span> <span data-start="335.21" data-end="337.07">this fairly common structure it has</span> <span data-start="337.07" data-end="338.889">incoming fibers called dendrites and</span> <span data-start="338.889" data-end="342.139">which carry signal to carry a signal to</span> <span data-start="342.139" data-end="344.5">the cell body called the soma and</span> <span data-start="344.5" data-end="346.849">there's an outgoing fiber called an axon</span> <span data-start="346.849" data-end="349.97">which branches and forms connections to</span> <span data-start="349.97" data-end="356.419">the dendrites of other neurons um but</span> <span data-start="356.419" data-end="357.83">despite this basic structure there</span> <span data-start="357.83" data-end="360.74">exists a large variety of shapes and</span> <span data-start="360.74" data-end="362.63">morphologies for these neurons depending</span> <span data-start="362.63" data-end="364.07">on where in the brain our and what type</span> <span data-start="364.07" data-end="368.06">of neuron now and luckily</span> <span data-start="368.06" data-end="370.31">experimentalists have there's an online</span> <span data-start="370.31" data-end="372.47">database where you can go through these</span> <span data-start="372.47" data-end="376.669">different types of of morphologies so</span> <span data-start="376.669" data-end="378.74">experimentalist what they've done is</span> <span data-start="378.74" data-end="382.19">they've taken brain tissue they've</span> <span data-start="382.19" data-end="384.34">stained neurons with fluorescent dyes</span> <span data-start="384.34" data-end="387.83">they've been taken many many microscope</span> <span data-start="387.83" data-end="390.979">images at different depths what they've</span> <span data-start="390.979" data-end="393.74">been done is carefully traced well their</span> <span data-start="393.74" data-end="395.36">graduate students have carefully traced</span> <span data-start="395.36" data-end="398.99">through these microscope images in order</span> <span data-start="398.99" data-end="399.18">to</span> <span data-start="399.18" data-end="400.949">reconstruct like the 3d information of</span> <span data-start="400.949" data-end="403.68">the neuron and so you can see here are</span> <span data-start="403.68" data-end="405.33">some images of these types of neurons so</span> <span data-start="405.33" data-end="408.18">these are just sort of static images but</span> <span data-start="408.18" data-end="411.3">what the data actually looks like is a</span> <span data-start="411.3" data-end="414.24">text file so each point in here is a</span> <span data-start="414.24" data-end="416.34">sort of a point on the neuron starting</span> <span data-start="416.34" data-end="418.34">with the cell body is the first point</span> <span data-start="418.34" data-end="422.52">each of the points has an ID it has a</span> <span data-start="422.52" data-end="425.15">type so if it's a dendrite or an axon</span> <span data-start="425.15" data-end="429.15">has XYZ coordinates and has a radius so</span> <span data-start="429.15" data-end="431.03">it gives the thickness of the fiber and</span> <span data-start="431.03" data-end="434.16">it has its like parent point so the</span> <span data-start="434.16" data-end="435.75">point going back towards the cell body</span> <span data-start="435.75" data-end="438.21">and in this way it describes like a tree</span> <span data-start="438.21" data-end="441.96">structure which is what a neuron is so</span> <span data-start="441.96" data-end="444.84">very often in science it's it's</span> <span data-start="444.84" data-end="447.03">invaluable to have sort of a visual way</span> <span data-start="447.03" data-end="449.16">of looking at your data and this is a</span> <span data-start="449.16" data-end="452.28">prime example because it's very hard to</span> <span data-start="452.28" data-end="454.5">look at this and understand what's going</span> <span data-start="454.5" data-end="458.09">on like what does this neuron look like</span> <span data-start="458.09" data-end="461.19">and so I decided to build something that</span> <span data-start="461.19" data-end="463.44">would help me look at this so there they</span> <span data-start="463.44" data-end="465.81">were existing Java applets and that sort</span> <span data-start="465.81" data-end="469.409">of thing to try and visualize this but I</span> <span data-start="469.409" data-end="470.82">wanted to build my own I wanted to use</span> <span data-start="470.82" data-end="472.71">three jess to build something that I</span> <span data-start="472.71" data-end="476.159">could use so that's what our demo to you</span> <span data-start="476.159" data-end="479.039">now so this is kind of the very basic</span> <span data-start="479.039" data-end="482.669">interface I made where I can select one</span> <span data-start="482.669" data-end="483.84">of these text files that I was just</span> <span data-start="483.84" data-end="487.169">showing you and it loads up here and we</span> <span data-start="487.169" data-end="490.44">can zoom in and then rotate and so this</span> <span data-start="490.44" data-end="491.82">one's a little bit flat but we can see</span> <span data-start="491.82" data-end="495.84">it has a three-dimensional structure and</span> <span data-start="495.84" data-end="498.36">also i can click on points with in here</span> <span data-start="498.36" data-end="500.849">and see see the data that generated that</span> <span data-start="500.849" data-end="504.27">so i can see what type of fiber it is i</span> <span data-start="504.27" data-end="507.3">can see the coordinates of it and i can</span> <span data-start="507.3" data-end="508.979">see its ID so i can link it back to the</span> <span data-start="508.979" data-end="516.539">data so this is nice I've got like a</span> <span data-start="516.539" data-end="522.04">useful tool to help me do my research</span> <span data-start="522.05" data-end="524.13">but let's put that aside for the moment</span> <span data-start="524.13" data-end="528.54">and come back to the problems in science</span> <span data-start="528.54" data-end="530.34">that Tim berners-lee was trying to solve</span> <span data-start="530.34" data-end="534.75">with the web how we doing today how is</span> <span data-start="534.75" data-end="538.53">how a science going well the web has</span> <span data-start="538.53" data-end="541.92">helped scientific research a lot we can</span> <span data-start="541.92" data-end="543.99">now easily browse through scientific</span> <span data-start="543.99" data-end="546.09">publications from researchers around the</span> <span data-start="546.09" data-end="549.45">world and in addition to these reports</span> <span data-start="549.45" data-end="551.79">researchers can share and publish their</span> <span data-start="551.79" data-end="555.87">data and code for others to use I can</span> <span data-start="555.87" data-end="557.4">point to a number of websites just in</span> <span data-start="557.4" data-end="560.57">neuroscience such as neuromorphic org</span> <span data-start="560.57" data-end="563.28">with carefully curated data sets that</span> <span data-start="563.28" data-end="567.78">for other people to use and online you</span> <span data-start="567.78" data-end="570.06">can find the software that they've used</span> <span data-start="570.06" data-end="571.35">to analyze the data or to run</span> <span data-start="571.35" data-end="573.18">simulations and you can download this</span> <span data-start="573.18" data-end="575.22">and its documentation and forums around</span> <span data-start="575.22" data-end="581.22">how to use it but is this really that</span> <span data-start="581.22" data-end="582.45">different to how things were before the</span> <span data-start="582.45" data-end="585.78">web I mean it is we can now trivially</span> <span data-start="585.78"

data-end="834.87">code to show today so instead what I'm</span> <span data-start="834.87" data-end="840.36">going to show is some equations so the</span> <span data-start="840.36" data-end="841.74">model they develop the mathematical</span> <span data-start="841.74" data-end="843.9">model developed is is encompassed by</span> <span data-start="843.9" data-end="846.75">these

what I wanted to be able to do was</span> <span data-start="874.79" data-end="877.46">build a visual tool for constructing</span> <span data-start="877.46" data-end="879.38">models of neurons and

to</span> <span data-start="883.16" data-end="885.08">inject current into the neuron and then</span> <span data-start="885.08" data-end="886.85">look at where in the neuron got excited</span> <span data-start="886.85" data-end="888.589">or I might want to look at adding</span> <span data-start="888.589" data-end="890.149">synaptic inputs from other neurons and</span> <span data-start="890.149" data-end="893.99">look at how the neuron responded so i</span> <span data-start="893.99" data-end="895.73">started building an interface to let me</span> <span data-start="895.73" data-end="898.01">do this this was something i spent a</span> <span data-start="898.01" data-end="900.26">decent portion of the last year working</span> <span data-start="900.26" data-end="902.3">on and it's something that I'm really</span> <span data-start="902.3" data-end="907.22">proud of my baby so I'm now going to</span> <span data-start="907.22" data-end="909.29">demonstrate the interface the first</span> <span data-start="909.29" data-end="911.18">thing I'm going to show you is how it</span> <span data-start="911.18" data-end="912.589">can be used to sort of set up a</span> <span data-start="912.589" data-end="914.54">simulation exactly how you want it so</span> <span data-start="914.54" data-end="917.029">set up the inputs and then going to show</span> <span data-start="917.029" data-end="920.39">you how it can be used to visualize the</span> <span data-start="920.39" data-end="921.74">outputs and see what happened in the</span> <span data-start="921.74"

data-end="931.22">this is the interface it's it's pretty</span> <span data-start="931.22" data-end="932.33">similar to the one I showed you before</span> <span data-start="932.33" data-end="936.38">you can rotate and zoom in I've now got</span> <span data-start="936.38" data-end="937.97">a sphere for the cell body which sort of</span> <span data-start="937.97" data-end="940.63">helps a bit so you can see where that is</span> <span data-start="940.63" data-end="943.43">one difference now though is I can click</span> <span data-start="943.43" data-end="946.49">on a section of the neuron and look at</span> <span data-start="946.49" data-end="949.13">the properties for that section so I can</span> <span data-start="949.13" data-end="951.08">look at the sort of Jim geometric</span> <span data-start="951.08" data-end="953.48">properties like XYZ and are but I could</span> <span data-start="953.48" data-end="958.1">also

channel</span> <span data-start="962.3" data-end="964.94">conductances and that sort of thing and</span> <span data-start="964.94" data-end="966.92">so I can select for instance multiple</span> <span
