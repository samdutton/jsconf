data-end="1645.929">mobile web perforated faster than the</span> <span data-start="1645.929" data-end="1650.009">home web this means that mobile first</span> <span data-start="1650.009"

data-end="1663.869">is it left to go I think it's a kind of</span> <span data-start="1663.869" data-end="1665.909">interesting time for mobile web in Japan</span> <span data-start="1665.909" data-end="1668.729">at the moment because there's almost two</span> <span data-start="1668.729" data-end="1670.379">different worlds that coexist there's</span> <span data-start="1670.379"

data-end="1677.759">feature phones that are still being</span> <span data-start="1677.759" data-end="1679.979">produced and still being designed some</span> <span data-start="1679.979"

data-end="1686.849">of them are also still very much serving</span> <span data-start="1686.849" data-end="1689.82">a real function for example phones made</span> <span data-start="1689.82"

data-end="1696.419">children to have too much access to the</span> <span data-start="1696.419" data-end="1698.34">web for example which is a problem with</span> <span data-start="1698.34" data-end="1702.029">smartphones um so I think that these</span> <span data-start="1702.029" data-end="1704.249">will continue to exist and I think</span> <span data-start="1704.249" data-end="1706.049">they'll continue to serve a purpose it</span> <span data-start="1706.049" data-end="1708.629">in fact for example a lot of times</span> <span data-start="1708.629" data-end="1710.669">during disasters like earthquakes these</span> <span data-start="1710.669" data-end="1711.989">feature phones can sometimes be a</span> <span data-start="1711.989" data-end="1714.149">lifesaver so a lot of people that I know</span> <span data-start="1714.149" data-end="1715.919">still have both their smartphone and</span> <span data-start="1715.919" data-end="1718.049">their feature phone it's a backup and I</span> <span data-start="1718.049" data-end="1720.769">don't think that's a bad idea at all um</span> <span data-start="1720.769" data-end="1723.419">and of course people in Japan are using</span> <span data-start="1723.419" data-end="1724.559">smartphones for all the things we're</span> <span data-start="1724.559" data-end="1727.289">using them now social networking chat</span> <span data-start="1727.289" data-end="1730.109">games shopping surfing but now it's</span> <span data-start="1730.109" data-end="1730.71">mostly on</span> <span data-start="1730.71" data-end="1733.71">our phones I say mostly because people</span> <span data-start="1733.71" data-end="1735.48">are still using these got okay but then</span> <span data-start="1735.48" data-end="1737.309">again I don't think those are going to</span> <span data-start="1737.309" data-end="1740.37">go away and i think that the advent of</span> <span data-start="1740.37" data-end="1742.71">smartphones is tipped power but not a</span> <span data-start="1742.71" data-end="1748.62">whole lot um i think that what's going</span> <span data-start="1748.62" data-end="1750.12">to happen is that there's going to be a</span> <span data-start="1750.12" data-end="1753.44">bit of a flattening of the whole culture</span> <span data-start="1753.44" data-end="1756.179">smartphones are more or less similar I</span> <span data-start="1756.179" data-end="1757.74">mean we have different features we have</span> <span data-start="1757.74" data-end="1759.21">different models what have you but</span> <span data-start="1759.21" data-end="1760.95">they're all based on very app centric</span> <span data-start="1760.95" data-end="1763.799">technology whereas feature phones aren't</span> <span data-start="1763.799" data-end="1766.799">they're very individual there each model</span> <span data-start="1766.799" data-end="1768.36">is extremely different from the last</span> <span data-start="1768.36" data-end="1771.02">each provider has a different array of</span> <span data-start="1771.02" data-end="1774.299">ranges of handsets available so I think</span> <span data-start="1774.299" data-end="1775.83">there's a diversity that's available</span> <span data-start="1775.83" data-end="1778.23">with these feature phones doesn't really</span> <span data-start="1778.23" data-end="1780.179">play out in the same way in the</span> <span data-start="1780.179" data-end="1783.96">smartphone field um so I think that</span> <span data-start="1783.96" data-end="1786">there's probably gonna be a muting of</span> <span data-start="1786" data-end="1787.649">the market but I also think that there's</span> <span data-start="1787.649" data-end="1790.169">still potential for a lot of interesting</span> <span data-start="1790.169" data-end="1795.76">maybe more artistic Oh interesting or</span> <span data-start="1795.77" data-end="1799.77">interesting or artistic ways to design</span> <span data-start="1799.77" data-end="1803.61">these feature phones um one thing I want</span> <span data-start="1803.61" data-end="1805.5">to point out is the statistic I want to</span> <span data-start="1805.5" data-end="1806.94">come back to from before that the</span> <span data-start="1806.94" data-end="1808.62">fastest-growing subset of mobile web</span> <span data-start="1808.62" data-end="1813.45">users is age 5 or younger this is also a</span> <span data-start="1813.45" data-end="1816.36">function of smartphones a lot of parents</span> <span data-start="1816.36" data-end="1818.25">are using them as educational tools for</span> <span data-start="1818.25" data-end="1820.11">their children they're very image based</span> <span data-start="1820.11" data-end="1822.029">children are able to touch the screens</span> <span data-start="1822.029" data-end="1823.559">and be tactile with them which is very</span> <span data-start="1823.559" data-end="1827.46">important so I'm it maybe it's a bit of</span> <span data-start="1827.46" data-end="1830.58">a skewed statistic because of the way</span> <span data-start="1830.58" data-end="1832.919">that people use their smartphones and I</span> <span data-start="1832.919" data-end="1834.929">think that in that sense that's where</span> <span data-start="1834.929" data-end="1836.97">that generation is going to miss out on</span> <span data-start="1836.97" data-end="1838.74">some of the advantages of having these</span> <span data-start="1838.74" data-end="1843.659">feature phones um in that sense</span> <span data-start="1843.659" data-end="1844.95">smartphones were kind of slow to</span> <span data-start="1844.95" data-end="1847.5">penetrate in Japan and this is an</span> <span data-start="1847.5" data-end="1849.12">interesting case I wanted to focus on a</span> <span data-start="1849.12" data-end="1853.14">little bit with iphone vs android the</span> <span data-start="1853.14" data-end="1855.12">fun fact about this is that iphone was a</span> <span data-start="1855.12" data-end="1857.49">bit slow to catch on in japan because</span> <span data-start="1857.49" data-end="1858.929">there wasn't really much of a carrier</span> <span data-start="1858.929" data-end="1861.48">choice it wasn't available in japan</span> <span data-start="1861.48" data-end="1864.179">until mid-2008 and Softbank</span> <span data-start="1864.179" data-end="1866.779">which was Vodafone which was Jay phone</span> <span data-start="1866.779" data-end="1869.519">had a three-year monopoly on iPhone and</span> <span data-start="1869.519" data-end="1872.279">iPad retail and contracts before number</span> <span data-start="1872.279" data-end="1874.379">portability

carriers</span> <span data-start="1877.619" data-end="1878.909">because if they changed their carriers</span> <span data-start="1878.909" data-end="1880.499">they lost their phone number so people</span> <span data-start="1880.499" data-end="1882.749">were very loyal to their carriers and I</span> <span data-start="1882.749" data-end="1885.059">think this also has another factor in</span> <span data-start="1885.059" data-end="1887.129">the sense of all of these feature phones</span> <span data-start="1887.129" data-end="1888.809">and how people would stick with the

<span data-start="1894.809" data-end="1897.57">come about Japan is the only market</span> <span data-start="1897.57" data-end="1899.85">where Android has actually had a gain of</span> <span

data-start="1908.19" data-end="1911.1">because um this shows again a bit of a</span> <span data-start="1911.1" data-end="1913.98">tipping into a diversity of app related</span> <span
