data-end="51.579">actually that great of a speaker but I</span> <span data-start="51.579" data-end="53.59">talk a lot about beautiful language and</span> <span data-start="53.59" data-end="57.75">so that's kind of a cool dichotomy so</span> <span data-start="57.75" data-end="59.829">also people think that I can speak</span> <span data-start="59.829" data-end="61.21">multiple languages because I

data-end="77.619">presentation it's a template problem</span> <span data-start="77.619" data-end="81.159">like there's it's not a language</span> <span data-start="81.159" data-end="82.57">necessarily

that we struggle from these days is</span> <span data-start="131.41" data-end="133.989">is in message formatting and message</span> <span data-start="133.989" data-end="137.019">displaying so so you might not think</span> <span data-start="137.019" data-end="139.209">that it comes up much or you might think</span> <span data-start="139.209" data-end="140.68">that it's the same as translating like

data-end="159.4">to consider problems like there are five</span> <span data-start="159.4" data-end="161.98">results or there are three new messages</span> <span data-start="161.98"

<p><span data-start="400.289" data-end="403.32">I believe I said so this why this talk</span> <span data-start="403.32" data-end="406.59">is is considered the the UX of language</span> <span data-start="406.59" data-end="408.539">we want to avoid situations like that</span> <span data-start="408.539" data-end="411.21">and it gets much much worse whenever you</span> <span data-start="411.21" data-end="413.76">start going into other languages that I</span> <span data-start="413.76" data-end="416.039">don't speak Sark</span> <span data-start="416.039" data-end="417.389">traditional way of concatenating strings</span> <span data-start="417.389" data-end="419.789">together isn't sufficient when those</span> <span data-start="419.789" data-end="424.259">strings form a coherent sentence so this</span> <span data-start="424.259" data-end="426.74">is like a rhetorical question but but</span> <span data-start="426.74" data-end="429.659">this is this is something that I used to</span> <span data-start="429.659" data-end="431.49">do and I still find myself doing it's</span> <span data-start="431.49" data-end="432.96">like when I make my template I make sure</span> <span data-start="432.96" data-end="435.449">that even when the template runs like</span> <span data-start="435.449" data-end="438.119">all the brackets line up nicely in like</span> <span data-start="438.119" data-end="440.009">the indented what right like so I spend</span> <span data-start="440.009"

this is the sentence we were we were</span> <span data-start="449.279" data-end="451.589">talking about earlier you have two new</span> <span data-start="451.589" data-end="454.08">messages so this is this is some of the</span> <span data-start="454.08" data-end="456.449">ways that we saw this now kind of this</span> <span data-start="456.449" data-end="458.849">is this is our solutions these are our</span> <span data-start="458.849" data-end="461.52">solutions English so the first one is</span> <span data-start="461.52" data-end="463.77">just ugly</span> <span data-start="463.77" data-end="466.02">it works in English it doesn't work in</span> <span data-start="466.02" data-end="467.789">every language if you have more than one</span> <span data-start="467.789" data-end="469.529">additional way to pluralize something</span> <span data-start="469.529" data-end="471.149">you'd have to have like some or</span> <span data-start="471.149" data-end="475.05">operators in there it gets bad and the</span> <span data-start="475.05" data-end="476.669">second one is considered prefix and</span> <span data-start="476.669" data-end="478.409">postfix sometimes it works but other</span> <span data-start="478.409" data-end="479.969">times it's still just it's not very</span> <span data-start="479.969" data-end="482.58">personable if you consider something</span> <span data-start="482.58" data-end="484.949">like Facebook's application where they</span> <span data-start="484.949" data-end="487.469">say like Alex x10 and three others like</span> <span data-start="487.469" data-end="490.589">this product that would be really bad if</span> <span data-start="490.589"

data-end="502.68">branching is it's really what we want to</span> <span data-start="502.68" data-end="504.629">end up doing so let's write some code to</span> <span data-start="504.629" data-end="508.919">to figure out when we want our branch on</span> <span data-start="508.919" data-end="510.24">the two different strings so in this</span> <span data-start="510.24" data-end="513.029">case you can you have in English right</span> <span data-start="513.029" data-end="515.19">you say if it's one you have one new</span> <span data-start="515.19"

trying to</span> <span data-start="521.459" data-end="522.99">internationalize your app you have a</span> <span data-start="522.99" data-end="527.029">branch and you say okay now I'll do this</span> <span data-start="527.029" data-end="529.649">this message in Spanish and this message</span> <span data-start="529.649" data-end="532.86">in English and that's cool but this is</span> <span data-start="532.86" data-end="534.69">this really gross it's directly coupled</span> <span data-start="534.69" data-end="538.529">inside your app code and that gets</span> <span data-start="538.529"
