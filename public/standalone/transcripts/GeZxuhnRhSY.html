<p><span data-start="130.08" data-end="130.869">I had to</span> <span data-start="130.869" data-end="133.36">tends to pack ends to manage I had a</span> <span data-start="133.36" data-end="136.06">team to train so really when it comes to</span> <span data-start="136.06" data-end="138.31">markup integrations I didn't want it to</span> <span data-start="138.31" data-end="141.819">come that way and be so painful so then</span> <span data-start="141.819" data-end="143.739">I took a step back and then I remembered</span> <span data-start="143.739" data-end="147.069">that well I had a friend Hoss who has</span> <span data-start="147.069" data-end="149.079">actually an experiment a designer and I</span> <span data-start="149.079" data-end="150.97">wondered how she was working so I</span> <span data-start="150.97" data-end="152.59">reached out to her and asked for her</span> <span data-start="152.59" data-end="156.579">help and her insights so when she called</span> <span data-start="156.579" data-end="158.379">me was actually pretty funny because I</span> <span data-start="158.379" data-end="161.14">was suffering on my own project back</span> <span data-start="161.14" data-end="163.299">then I was working at a sister company</span> <span data-start="163.299" data-end="165.609">of thedo and so I was working with a</span> <span data-start="165.609" data-end="168.22">client and a very simple app it was a</span> <span data-start="168.22" data-end="170.44">mobile application with a very classic</span> <span data-start="170.44" data-end="171.7">sign up and login</span> <span data-start="171.7" data-end="175.93">so I gave the design for the signup form</span> <span data-start="175.93" data-end="177.73">to the developers who start working on</span> <span data-start="177.73" data-end="180.37">it and then asked me for the login form</span> <span data-start="180.37" data-end="182.829">and I go why do you need it because</span> <span data-start="182.829" data-end="185.349">they're actually the same design with</span> <span data-start="185.349" data-end="188.049">different wordings but they insisted so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="188.049" data-end="190.15">I ended up providing it to them but I</span> <span data-start="190.15" data-end="191.859">was very frustrated because if you look</span> <span data-start="191.859" data-end="193.599">at those design side by side they're the</span> <span data-start="193.599" data-end="195.37">same structure the basically the same</span> <span data-start="195.37" data-end="198.22">thing and it's just it felt like they</span> <span data-start="198.22" data-end="200.049">didn't try to understand a product as a</span> <span data-start="200.049" data-end="202.72">whole and were just designing the pages</span> <span data-start="202.72" data-end="208.09">as he came and I was actually I had</span> <span data-start="208.09" data-end="209.799">other things to do I had a product owner</span> <span data-start="209.799" data-end="211.69">who didn't want you to usability testing</span> <span data-start="211.69" data-end="213.34">so I was trying very hard to convince</span> <span data-start="213.34" data-end="214.989">him that that was very important to do</span> <span data-start="214.989" data-end="218.62">and a very short timeline to design the</span> <span data-start="218.62" data-end="222.37">rest of the features of the app so I'm</span> <span data-start="222.37" data-end="226.389">having to copy paste the same design and</span> <span data-start="226.389" data-end="227.919">then changing the wording was that the</span> <span data-start="227.919" data-end="232.06">last thing I wanted to do so having</span> <span data-start="232.06" data-end="234.25">heard each side of the story we realized</span> <span data-start="234.25" data-end="236.889">that by under sting understanding each</span> <span data-start="236.889" data-end="239.169">other more we would actually enjoy</span> <span data-start="239.169" data-end="241.239">working together and that's how we</span> <span data-start="241.239" data-end="244">started this whole Devi web thing and so</span> <span data-start="244" data-end="246.609">we experimented on new projects we've</span> <span data-start="246.609" data-end="248.859">worked with other teams and we were able</span> <span data-start="248.859" data-end="251.079">to map out four levels of dev UX</span> <span data-start="251.079" data-end="253">collaborations so I'm going to work</span> <span data-start="253" data-end="254.099">through them</span> <span data-start="254.099" data-end="256.59">grunts you're obviously STIs function</span> <span data-start="256.59" data-end="258.69">then you can move up to level one the</span> <span data-start="258.69" data-end="261.81">basics then level two efficiency and</span> <span data-start="261.81" data-end="265.5">finally the Holy Grail symbiosis so what</span> <span data-start="265.5" data-end="266.88">we're going to do is walk you through</span> <span data-start="266.88" data-end="268.77">different projects at different stages</span> <span data-start="268.77" data-end="270.84">of collaboration to illustrate our</span> <span data-start="270.84" data-end="273.99">points and before that just a summarize</span> <span data-start="273.99" data-end="276.72">of the context so the usual team</span> <span data-start="276.72" data-end="279.21">composition of the project would be the</span> <span data-start="279.21" data-end="281.009">product team with designers and</span> <span data-start="281.009" data-end="283.11">developers working hand-in-hand with a</span> <span data-start="283.11" data-end="285.06">product owner that sets the product</span> <span data-start="285.06" data-end="287.52">vision and the roadmap around this team</span> <span data-start="287.52" data-end="290.46">we have stakeholders such as the CEO of</span> <span data-start="290.46" data-end="292.62">someone from marketing someone from</span> <span data-start="292.62" data-end="294.9">another product team or even legal</span> <span data-start="294.9" data-end="296.49">that's gonna tell you yeah I need this</span> <span data-start="296.49" data-end="301.47">or that so for the first story by the</span> <span data-start="301.47" data-end="303.479">way all stories are true for the first</span> <span data-start="303.479" data-end="305.13">time I'm going to take a food tech app</span> <span data-start="305.13" data-end="307.199">that my company worked on a couple of</span> <span data-start="307.199" data-end="310.41">years back I didn't work on the project</span> <span data-start="310.41" data-end="311.849">we're actually working with a freelance</span> <span data-start="311.849" data-end="313.86">designer who had a very limited time on</span> <span data-start="313.86" data-end="316.05">the project but I did follow the project</span> <span data-start="316.05" data-end="319.349">very closely and so it started like this</span> <span data-start="319.349" data-end="321.99">the designer had time in advance to ship</span> <span data-start="321.99" data-end="325.199">all of the design for the product so he</span> <span data-start="325.199" data-end="327.449">provides that to the team and the</span> <span data-start="327.449" data-end="328.979">product owner is very happy because</span> <span data-start="328.979" data-end="331.53">that's exactly what she wanted so the</span> <span data-start="331.53" data-end="335.82">team happily starts and actually one</span> <span data-start="335.82" data-end="338.58">week later the CEO sees the app and he</span> <span data-start="338.58" data-end="340.44">is very unhappy with the UI he says</span> <span data-start="340.44" data-end="342.27">that's totally not what he wanted for</span> <span data-start="342.27" data-end="344.58">the app and actually that puts a stop to</span> <span data-start="344.58" data-end="347.039">everything the team has to start over on</span> <span data-start="347.039" data-end="349.05">the design and the development team has</span> <span data-start="349.05" data-end="351.15">no choice but to only work on the</span> <span data-start="351.15" data-end="353.599">backend for a while and it took</span> <span data-start="353.599" data-end="357.93">literally three weeks and 17 attempts to</span> <span data-start="357.93" data-end="360.659">find a UI design that actually worked</span> <span data-start="360.659" data-end="366.13">for both the PIO and the nd CEO and</span> <span data-start="366.13" data-end="367.9">from then development can start again</span> <span data-start="367.9" data-end="370.21">but that's when the designer had to</span> <span data-start="370.21" data-end="371.83">leave because he only had that much time</span> <span data-start="371.83" data-end="375.19">on the project and that's in theory if</span> <span data-start="375.19" data-end="378.64">all the designs are great great but of</span> <span data-start="378.64" data-end="380.11">course there were things that were</span> <span data-start="380.11" data-end="381.97">missing there were behaviors that were</span> <span data-start="381.97" data-end="384.34">not clear and so the developers they</span> <span data-start="384.34" data-end="385.54">have no one to turn to except the</span> <span data-start="385.54" data-end="387.43">product owner so they asked her for</span> <span data-start="387.43" data-end="389.5">advice and she goes well I'm not a</span> <span data-start="389.5" data-end="391.72">designer so I really don't know so they</span> <span data-start="391.72" data-end="393.7">do what they can and then we call this</span> <span data-start="393.7" data-end="396.43">best effort which means they try to do</span> <span data-start="396.43" data-end="399.07">something that not too ugly and Kanna</span> <span data-start="399.07" data-end="401.08">works and let's hope nothing breaks</span> <span data-start="401.08" data-end="405.07">and so yeah so let's look back and see</span> <span data-start="405.07" data-end="408.34">what went wrong so first thing the CEO</span> <span data-start="408.34" data-end="411.07">made the whole team start over and this</span> <span data-start="411.07" data-end="413.23">happens when the process for product</span> <span data-start="413.23" data-end="415.09">definition is not clear so this happens</span> <span data-start="415.09" data-end="417.97">mostly with macaws being late too many</span> <span data-start="417.97" data-end="419.56">people being involved in the decision</span> <span data-start="419.56" data-end="422.08">process there's other problems that can</span> <span data-start="422.08" data-end="423.25">happen too</span> <span data-start="423.25" data-end="425.23">like for example the vision of the</span> <span data-start="425.23" data-end="427.24">product is not well defined so it's very</span> <span data-start="427.24" data-end="430.21">important at this very basic level to</span> <span data-start="430.21" data-end="432.7">clarify what each team member has to do</span> <span data-start="432.7" data-end="434.71">what their responsibility is and to</span> <span data-start="434.71" data-end="436.06">define key moments where they can</span> <span data-start="436.06" data-end="437.8">synchronize with each other so a very</span> <span data-start="437.8" data-end="441.04">simple very basic process would be the</span> <span data-start="441.04" data-end="444.31">product owner is the one who is in</span> <span data-start="444.31" data-end="446.19">charge of the product vision so he</span> <span data-start="446.19" data-end="448.9">writes down the specifications and the</span> <span data-start="448.9" data-end="451.12">description of the task description he</span> <span data-start="451.12" data-end="453.49">has dedicated moment with the designer</span> <span data-start="453.49" data-end="456.04">so that he can pass on that vision so</span> <span data-start="456.04" data-end="457.51">that the designer can make the mock-ups</span> <span data-start="457.51" data-end="459.28">and there's a separate moment for</span> <span data-start="459.28" data-end="461.62">developers you altogether define the</span> <span data-start="461.62" data-end="464.32">technical strategy to implement all this</span> <span data-start="464.32" data-end="467.26">so of course this is a very simple way</span> <span data-start="467.26" data-end="469.63">of doing it but don't be afraid of</span> <span data-start="469.63" data-end="472.03">adapting this to your context for</span> <span data-start="472.03" data-end="473.44">example if you know that your product</span> <span data-start="473.44" data-end="477.34">owner wants or likes to have user inputs</span> <span data-start="477.34" data-end="479.86">before he decides of the needs bring him</span> <span data-start="479.86" data-end="483.04">into your user research if you know that</span> <span data-start="483.04" data-end="485.8">developers can be very picky about</span> <span data-start="485.8" data-end="488.47">certain things in the design invite them</span> <span data-start="488.47" data-end="490.51">to the UX workshop so that they can</span> <span data-start="490.51" data-end="493.33">together you can find solutions for the</span> <span data-start="493.33" data-end="494.02">upcoming</span> <span data-start="494.02" data-end="497.139">juice etc etc and it might look a bit</span> <span data-start="497.139" data-end="498.789">scary like this because it looks like</span> <span data-start="498.789" data-end="500.319">they're all those big meetings but they</span> <span data-start="500.319" data-end="502.15">don't have to be big meetings you can do</span> <span data-start="502.15" data-end="502.479">this</span> <span data-start="502.479" data-end="505.78">a synchronously over slag or on any tool</span> <span data-start="505.78" data-end="508.18">that you use you can do that over a</span> <span data-start="508.18" data-end="510.22">coffee break five minutes the important</span> <span data-start="510.22" data-end="512.169">thing is just to update every member of</span> <span data-start="512.169" data-end="514.68">the team product design product owner</span> <span data-start="514.68" data-end="518.11">all together on what is the new</span> <span data-start="518.11" data-end="522.459">direction for the product so what's the</span> <span data-start="522.459" data-end="525.329">second issue the second issue is that</span> <span data-start="525.329" data-end="528.22">actually the there were missing assets</span> <span data-start="528.22" data-end="531.22">and that happens a lot when designers do</span> <span data-start="531.22" data-end="533.41">their job ship the designs and they just</span> <span data-start="533.41"

data-end="833.97">that house uses on sketch so it's it's</span> <span data-start="833.97" data-end="836.19">called craft and what you can do is</span> <span data-start="836.19" data-end="838.68">basically use an API to get some data</span> <span data-start="838.68" data-end="841.9">and use those data to populate a lists</span> <span data-start="841.9" data-end="845.23">so

data-end="876.64">layout behaves so really important to</span> <span data-start="876.64" data-end="879.46">have a style guide that some of all the</span> <span data-start="879.46" data-end="882.16">states and behaviors of components and</span> <span data-start="882.16" data-end="885.43">also define the break points for your</span> <span data-start="885.43"

data-end="896.68">talks do you have like a common language</span> <span data-start="896.68" data-end="899.35">between designers and developers and</span> <span data-start="899.35" data-end="901.12">that's why I really like the style guide</span> <span data-start="901.12" data-end="903.55">it's really a UI contract between the</span> <span data-start="903.55"

errors</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="931.51" data-end="935.14">States etc so I don't know if you have</span> <span data-start="935.14" data-end="936.99">this on your project if you don't really</span> <span data-start="936.99" data-end="940.24">try to get this as soon as possible</span> <span data-start="940.24" data-end="942.04">because that will help you in your</span> <span data-start="942.04"

data-end="1668.36">coming out for example recently I shared</span> <span data-start="1668.36" data-end="1671.6">a lot about sketch 55:58 which i think</span> <span data-start="1671.6" data-end="1673.37">is going to change a lot of things on</span> <span data-start="1673.37" data-end="1676.55">the design side of the project</span> <span data-start="1676.55" data-end="1679.88">and it's great because you can discuss</span> <span data-start="1679.88" data-end="1681.65">in a very informal way about your</span> <span data-start="1681.65" data-end="1684.74">problems about what how you feel as a as</span> <span data-start="1684.74" data-end="1686.99">a person in a team that might be working</span> <span data-start="1686.99" data-end="1690.679">well or might not for example in stencil</span> <span data-start="1690.679" data-end="1692.96">and recently not actually I learned</span> <span data-start="1692.96" data-end="1695.2">during the first of these drinks is that</span> <span data-start="1695.2" data-end="1697.34">actually even though there's friction</span> <span data-start="1697.34" data-end="1698.99">sometimes between developers and</span> <span data-start="1698.99" data-end="1701.09">designers developers are always so much</span> <span data-start="1701.09" data-end="1703.13">happier when they work with designers</span> <span data-start="1703.13" data-end="1705.62">because in the end at the end of the day</span> <span data-start="1705.62" data-end="1707.45">they're just prouder of the product that</span> <span data-start="1707.45" data-end="1709.76">they're making and that was meant so</span> <span data-start="1709.76" data-end="1713.12">much to me yeah I I really like those</span> <span data-start="1713.12" data-end="1714.77">drinks — I mean wine and cheese like</span> <span data-start="1714.77" data-end="1717.8">what what's more serious and more</span> <span data-start="1717.8" data-end="1720.26">seriously like there's something that I</span> <span data-start="1720.26" data-end="1722.3">learned and that was surprising to me</span> <span data-start="1722.3" data-end="1725.48">and actually I felt very relieved to</span> <span data-start="1725.48" data-end="1728.3">learn that is that designers are happy</span> <span data-start="1728.3" data-end="1730.309">to work with developers because they</span> <span data-start="1730.309" data-end="1733.76">help them make their more make them more</span> <span data-start="1733.76" data-end="1736.4">thorough with their work and and that's</span> <span data-start="1736.4" data-end="1738.11">a relief for me because before that I</span> <span data-start="1738.11" data-end="1739.79">only thought I was being annoying with</span> <span data-start="1739.79" data-end="1743.36">all those requests and questions so I</span> <span data-start="1743.36"
