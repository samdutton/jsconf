<p><span data-start="4.62" data-end="5.62"Audience member: Hello, everyone.</span> <span data-start="5.62" data-end="8.47">Welcome to the third and final, for the time being, TC39 panel we are doing at JSConf.</span> <span data-start="8.47" data-end="9.88">It's always a pleasure to come back.</span> <span data-start="9.88" data-end="10.93">We will introduce ourselves as we speak.</span> <span data-start="10.93" data-end="11.93">We collected your questions in the last couple of weeks.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="11.93" data-end="12.93">A little bit differently, we are going to ask questions from the past years, so, that's</span> <span data-start="12.93" data-end="13.93">how the panel's going to work.</span> <span data-start="13.93" data-end="14.93">Let's give a round of applause for the panel members.</span> <span data-start="14.93" data-end="15.93">[Applause].</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="15.93" data-end="16.93">As we get started, not everyone knows how the committee works or what the committee</span> <span data-start="16.93" data-end="17.93">is.</span> <span data-start="17.93" data-end="21.39">There was a question that was asked in person at one of our prep events that seemed quite</span> <span data-start="21.39" data-end="28.22">obvious, but it is a great question to start with: what is the organisation behind TC39</span> <span data-start="28.22" data-end="43.739">in ? >> Hi, I'm Aki, part of the chair group for</span> <span data-start="43.739" data-end="44.739">TC39.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="44.739" data-end="48.98">I work for PayPal in Braintree.</span> <span data-start="48.98" data-end="56.26">TC39 is the 39th technical committee by the name of a committee called Ecma International,</span> <span data-start="56.26" data-end="61.899">a standards body, like ISO, or that sort of thing, and they publish the standard that</span> <span data-start="61.899" data-end="65.59">we work on as a committee.</span> <span data-start="65.59" data-end="69.33">That's the organisation behind TC39.</span> <span data-start="69.33" data-end="75.75">The committee itself is made up of people who are sent by member organisations that</span> <span data-start="75.75" data-end="79.48">are companies and non-profits who are part of Ecma.</span> <span data-start="79.48" data-end="82.39">We are considered delegates.</span> <span data-start="82.39" data-end="88.56">We either work for or are associated with these companies that are part of Ecma International.</span> <span data-start="88.56" data-end="95.25">We work together and collaborate on what goes into the spec, and how we are going to be</span> <span data-start="95.25" data-end="102.91">able to make improvements and changes, and support all these different ways that JavaScript</span> <span data-start="102.91" data-end="105.32">is used.</span> <span data-start="105.32" data-end="107.22"Audience member: Thank you, Aki.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="107.22" data-end="113.41">And the next question that we are going to do to set up the stage what TC 39 is and does</span> <span data-start="113.41" data-end="119.86">is how does a proposal move through the committee.</span> <span data-start="119.86" data-end="127.62">We have Jase here on stage who did a wonderful talk about his Rust engine in JavaScript,</span> <span data-start="127.62" data-end="132.36">and he's been doing more work with the TC39, specifically, he's been getting a proposal</span> <span data-start="132.36" data-end="133.379">through called All Settled.</span> <span data-start="133.379" data-end="144.95">Can you tell us about getting a proposal through such a committee?</span> <span data-start="144.95" data-end="150.69"Audience member: Yeah, I was quite lucky to meet a lot of people on the committee last year in London.</span> <span data-start="150.69" data-end="155.959">I felt a lot started off with a conversation, and talking to various members of the committee,</span> <span data-start="155.959" data-end="158.569">if there was an appetite for such a proposal.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="158.569" data-end="160.439">It turns out there was.</span> <span data-start="160.439" data-end="161.719">That was a good thing.</span> <span data-start="161.719" data-end="168.709">Daniel, he has been helpful in putting me in contact with the right people.</span> <span data-start="168.709" data-end="170.97">Not only that, but people who come from different backgrounds as well.</span> <span data-start="170.97" data-end="172.469">That really helped.</span> <span data-start="172.469" data-end="178.92">It started off by a "straw person proposal" which is a state zero which is a GIT repo</span> <span data-start="178.92" data-end="182.879">with identifying the problem space.</span> <span data-start="182.879" data-end="192.299">Then we managed to get a champion here, Matthias, V8 — and stage one is identifying what is</span> <span data-start="192.299" data-end="193.299">the problem here?</span> <span data-start="193.299" data-end="196.01">What is the limitation and you and how we can fix it.</span> <span data-start="196.01" data-end="199.18">It's not too important to have a solution at this point.</span> <span data-start="199.18" data-end="201.45">We managed to craft something up that worked.</span> <span data-start="201.45" data-end="207.029">We had a small proposal that went through — Matthias championed it.</span> <span data-start="207.029" data-end="215.59">For stage 2, myself and Rob from Bloomberg both worked together on some of the specification,</span> <span data-start="215.59" data-end="218.79">and also getting more ideas from people as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="218.79" data-end="223.44">Also, another good thing is after stage 1, we had implementation from Babel which is</span> <span data-start="223.44" data-end="227.73">really good which helps as well when you get feedback.</span> <span data-start="227.73" data-end="232.42">Stage 3 is getting even more feedback and thinking about a candidate release, and luckily,</span> <span data-start="232.42" data-end="237.169">I don't think there were too many sort of rejections or limitations, and most people</span> <span data-start="237.169" data-end="244.209">seemed happy with it, and very recently, we made stage 3 as well, and so now, I think</span> <span data-start="244.209" data-end="249.219">it's just getting some implementations in browsers, and people can try it in Chrome</span> <span data-start="249.219" data-end="252.499">and Canary, and nightly.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="252.499" data-end="255.76">Yes, hopefully stage 4.</span> <span data-start="255.76" data-end="260.07"Audience member: You made this proposal not as a member of the committee but as an independent contributor,</span> <span data-start="260.07" data-end="261.07">right?</span> <span data-start="261.07" data-end="262.07"Audience member: Yes, absolutely.</span> <span data-start="262.07" data-end="263.27">I was become at the BBC at the time.</span> <span data-start="263.27" data-end="266.79">It was a limitation for me as a JavaScript developer, and I thought if it's a limitation</span> <span data-start="266.79" data-end="270.11">for me, how many other people have this limitation?</span> <span data-start="270.11" data-end="275.24">One of those ways of working that out was going to npm seeing how many people download</span> <span data-start="275.24" data-end="278.349">these packages, others languages have this natively.</span> <span data-start="278.349" data-end="282.7">Can we do it in JavaScript?</span> <span data-start="282.7" data-end="284.88">Everyone here was friendly.</span> <span data-start="284.88" data-end="290.039">I had a conversation with members of the panel, and they were very happy to champion it, and</span> <span data-start="290.039" data-end="291.659">we went from there.</span> <span data-start="291.659" data-end="293.83"Audience member: And I'm going to ask you to introduce yourself?</span> <span data-start="293.83" data-end="298.34"Audience member: Yes, Jason Williams, software engineer at Bloomberg.</span> <span data-start="298.34" data-end="304.569"Audience member: So, another question that we get sometimes is we've got this whole proposal structure,</span> <span data-start="304.569" data-end="307.669">but how do we know it's implemented correctly in browsers?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="307.669" data-end="309.72">What is going on there?</span> <span data-start="309.72" data-end="323.069">I'm going to hand this over to Valerie, and, if you could introduce yourself, and how we</span> <span data-start="323.069" data-end="324.069">do that?</span> <span data-start="324.069" data-end="328.18"Audience member: I'm an open-web engineer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="328.18" data-end="335.72">I'm also the editor — the extension to JavaScript called Ecma 402, the object that does pluralisation</span> <span data-start="335.72" data-end="338.88">and daytime formatting.</span> <span data-start="338.88" data-end="348.25">I help to maintain the test 262 test suite which is ECMAScript implementations.</span> <span data-start="348.25" data-end="359.28">The test suite is about 35,000 tests which test the individual tests, which test JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="359.28" data-end="366.819">Each test is a test file which has some metadata about what line it tests in ECMAScript itself.</span> <span data-start="366.819" data-end="367.819">Each test is run twice.</span> <span data-start="367.819" data-end="374.259">There are really 70,000 tests, once in strict and this is non-strict mode.</span> <span data-start="374.259" data-end="385.129">This report is showing how well the tests are doing on all of the four four JavaScript</span> <span data-start="385.129" data-end="391.5">engines, and the tests are each in individual tests files, so this is a directory structure</span> <span data-start="391.5" data-end="397.03">which shows the test structure that you can find, and, if you want to look at the source,</span> <span data-start="397.03" data-end="400.919">you can drill down and look at individual tests and whether or not they're passing,</span> <span data-start="400.919" data-end="402.919">and see the source code on the page of this website.</span> <span data-start="402.919" data-end="413.47">Or you can go to our GitHub, TC39/test 2662, and to get a standard in ECMAScript or a new</span> <span data-start="413.47" data-end="422.129">proposal in Ecma script, the last test is to add to test 662 as well as the browser</span> <span data-start="422.129" data-end="423.129">implementation.</span> <span data-start="423.129" data-end="427.699">There are tests beak contributed, and all the browsers can make sure they're in compliance</span> <span data-start="427.699" data-end="429.219">and passing the same tests.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="429.219" data-end="431.419">It's a fun project.</span> <span data-start="431.419" data-end="432.419">[Applause].</span> <span data-start="432.419" data-end="434.08"Audience member: Thank you, Valerie.</span> <span data-start="434.08" data-end="437.759"Audience member: If I could add to that.</span> <span data-start="437.759" data-end="440.27">This is actually really an awesome resource.</span> <span data-start="440.27" data-end="445.84">Jason talked about implementing a JavaScript engine, but for our major JavaScript engines</span> <span data-start="445.84" data-end="452.599">having something like this to be able to say very easily when are we not being spec-conformant</span> <span data-start="452.599" data-end="456.54">is such an immense resource.</span> <span data-start="456.54" data-end="457.569"Audience member: And can you introduce yourself?</span> <span data-start="457.569" data-end="463.979"Audience member: Oh, yes, I'm Ross Kersling and I work at PlayStation on our WebKit team.</span> <span data-start="463.979" data-end="465.639"Audience member: Thank you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="465.639" data-end="471.919">So, this sort of rounds off our introduction to how TC39 works, and we're going to be moving</span> <span data-start="471.919" data-end="475.83">on with community questions that you folks asked, and we will start with one from last</span> <span data-start="475.83" data-end="478.37">year, asked by Sam Basson.</span> <span data-start="478.37" data-end="486.1">He asked, "I notice the committee's very heavily dominated by Americans and American companies,</span> <span data-start="486.1" data-end="487.1">particularly Google.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="487.1" data-end="491.689">Do you have any plans to become more representative of the world, and only give certain companies</span> <span data-start="491.689" data-end="494.689">so much power?"</span> <span data-start="494.689" data-end="504.509"Audience member: We're looking at how individual companies and specifically individual spaces where we</span> <span data-start="504.509" data-end="511.97">get together in person are impacting those contributions, and Ecma International, which</span> <span data-start="511.97" data-end="517.74">is the organisation we're part of, in fact, is currently put an effort into helping us</span> <span data-start="517.74" data-end="522.63">find a way to be more inclusive internationally in future years.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="522.63" data-end="527.85">The 2019 meetings are already scheduled, but 2020 is being scheduled right now, and we</span> <span data-start="527.85" data-end="531.37">are going to work on finding a way of being more inclusive.</span> <span data-start="531.37" data-end="532.37"Audience member: Thank you.</span> <span data-start="532.37" data-end="536.23">That was a nice answer.</span> <span data-start="536.23" data-end="546.06"Audience member: Hi, I'm Daniel Aaronberg, I work in our compiler's team.</span> <span data-start="546.06" data-end="552.54">I think there is a real issue of this particular kind of bias, that was identified, but I just</span> <span data-start="552.54" data-end="557.73">also want to point out there is heavy European involvement in the development of the JavaScript</span> <span data-start="557.73" data-end="567.029">specification, both from people in Munich V8 office, V8 from Bloomberg, and my company</span> <span data-start="567.029" data-end="573.7">based in Spain, and several others also.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="573.7" data-end="576.61">We can build on that success, of course.</span> <span data-start="576.61" data-end="578.96">Julia based in Germany.</span> <span data-start="578.96" data-end="582.72"Audience member: I'm based in Germany and Berlin, so, if you have any complaints, you know where to</span> <span data-start="582.72" data-end="584.64">find me!</span> <span data-start="584.64" data-end="588.01">Thanks for that answer.</span> <span data-start="588.01" data-end="594.37">Moving along into more specific questions about the standard, we have had several questions</span> <span data-start="594.37" data-end="598.23">about how long it takes to standardise things and when do things come out?</span> <span data-start="598.23" data-end="602.85">Like how long does it take for a proposal to go from stage zero to stage four?</span> <span data-start="602.85" data-end="606.95"Audience member: I will take that one.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="606.95" data-end="609.56">It can take a very long time.</span> <span data-start="609.56" data-end="612.829">The simple answer is years.</span> <span data-start="612.829" data-end="618.06">If you were to essentially — essentially, you wouldn't really expecting to through our</span> <span data-start="618.06" data-end="625.98">staging process more than one per meeting, and we do meet every other month, but, you</span> <span data-start="625.98" data-end="629.639">know, there's a lot to do in that time frame.</span> <span data-start="629.639" data-end="633.68">Implementing in Babel may take time, for instance.</span> <span data-start="633.68" data-end="639.31">The problem space you're addressing might be quite clear but the solution may not be.</span> <span data-start="639.31" data-end="642.16">Maybe you need to revise that ultimate times.</span> <span data-start="642.16" data-end="645.079">Decorators might be a great example.</span> <span data-start="645.079" data-end="650.58">Finally, at the end of it all, before we can say that we are all said and done, we need</span> <span data-start="650.58" data-end="656.26">this to be implemented — and shipping — in at least two of the major engines, and you,</span> <span data-start="656.26" data-end="660.76">unless you want to implement that yourself, might not have control over that time frame.</span> <span data-start="660.76" data-end="666.41">It can take a very lock time, and discussions can get very heated, and so unless you have</span> <span data-start="666.41" data-end="674.84">a very simple, very uncontroversial proposal, it will probably take on the order of years.</span> <span data-start="674.84" data-end="690.38"Audience member: The next question we have is about when are we going to get a standard library for</span> </p>
