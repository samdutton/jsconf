<p><span data-start="61.62" data-end="65.22">Boston in a couple of weeks trying not</span> <span data-start="65.22" data-end="67.5">to say you should all use dojo we'll see</span> <span data-start="67.5" data-end="71.4">how I do this to me came out just I</span> <span data-start="71.4" data-end="74.31">don't know a couple days ago and I think</span> <span data-start="74.31" data-end="76.2">it speaks really well to what I want to</span> <span data-start="76.2" data-end="78.42">talk about today that it used to be that</span> <span data-start="78.42" data-end="81.36">JavaScript was a toy and we just used it</span> <span data-start="81.36" data-end="84.6">to get stuff done and somebody was</span> <span data-start="84.6" data-end="86.369">saying that they would actually get</span> <span data-start="86.369" data-end="88.259">resumes from people who knew JavaScript</span> <span data-start="88.259" data-end="90.54">but they wouldn't put it on the resume</span> <span data-start="90.54" data-end="91.89">because they were afraid that it was</span> <span data-start="91.89" data-end="93.689">going to make them look like a less</span> <span data-start="93.689" data-end="95.46">legitimate developer a less serious</span> <span data-start="95.46" data-end="97.17">developer and I think that's really</span> <span data-start="97.17" data-end="99.54">changed and now it's becoming the case</span> <span data-start="99.54" data-end="101.46">that if you don't know JavaScript and if</span> <span data-start="101.46" data-end="105.259">you don't take it seriously you are</span> <span data-start="105.259" data-end="108.71">setting yourself up for some real hurt</span> <span data-start="108.71" data-end="110.7">so there's three things that I want to</span> <span data-start="110.7" data-end="113.22">kind of hit on today number one I want</span> <span data-start="113.22" data-end="116.88">to talk about how I think jquery and its</span> <span data-start="116.88" data-end="120.06">popularity among newcomers is making</span> <span data-start="120.06" data-end="121.619">those newcomers learn some really</span> <span data-start="121.619" data-end="125.909">terrible things and you know the ease of</span> <span data-start="125.909" data-end="128.009">the ubiquity of it the popularity of it</span> <span data-start="128.009" data-end="130.11">means it's the go to library for a lot</span> <span data-start="130.11" data-end="132.629">of people who don't have any programming</span> <span data-start="132.629" data-end="133.2">experience</span> <span data-start="133.2" data-end="135.629">on some levels that's wonderful on other</span> <span data-start="135.629" data-end="138.989">levels it's terrifying as a I work for</span> <span data-start="138.989" data-end="142.98">myself I consult with companies who call</span> <span data-start="142.98" data-end="144.9">me up and say you help us fix this</span> <span data-start="144.9" data-end="147.959">gigantic mess that we've made so i'll</span> <span data-start="147.959" data-end="149.31">talk about that in a minute i also want</span> <span data-start="149.31" data-end="150.599">to talk about why i think that this</span> <span data-start="150.599" data-end="153.45">audience needs to care about this this</span> <span data-start="153.45" data-end="156.239">audience who'd you know very few of you</span> <span data-start="156.239" data-end="157.92">would admit that you didn't understand</span> <span data-start="157.92" data-end="161.88">call and apply so that's probably true</span> <span data-start="161.88" data-end="163.59">here but but i know that i'm not</span> <span data-start="163.59" data-end="165.239">speaking to an audience that needs a</span> <span data-start="165.239" data-end="167.01">lecture on the jquery api or what's</span> <span data-start="167.01" data-end="168.239">wrong with it or what's good about it</span> <span data-start="168.239" data-end="169.89">but i do think that this topic is</span> <span data-start="169.89" data-end="171.15">important to this audience and number</span> <span data-start="171.15" data-end="172.59">three I want to talk about what I think</span> <span data-start="172.59" data-end="175.89">that we as the people who assemble</span> <span data-start="175.89" data-end="178.5">together at this fairly exclusive</span> <span data-start="178.5" data-end="181.65">conference that you know turns away more</span> <span data-start="181.65" data-end="185.31">people and probably get in why what we</span> <span data-start="185.31" data-end="187.11">who are here actually need to do about</span> <span data-start="187.11" data-end="190.26">this that we shouldn't just let the</span> <span data-start="190.26" data-end="192.78">status quo be what it is I think that we</span> <span data-start="192.78" data-end="194.7">actually have a responsibility to take</span> <span data-start="194.7" data-end="196.92">some ownership of this problem it was</span> <span data-start="196.92" data-end="199.5">about a year a year ago year a half ago</span> <span data-start="199.5" data-end="201.15">that I started talking about code</span> <span data-start="201.15" data-end="204.78">organization in the jQuery community it</span> <span data-start="204.78" data-end="206.4">was a problem that i was running into as</span> <span data-start="206.4" data-end="208.68">i was using jquery it was a problem that</span> <span data-start="208.68" data-end="210.329">other people were definitely sensitive</span> <span data-start="210.329" data-end="212.25">to so it's about a year ago that i</span> <span data-start="212.25" data-end="213.359">started talking about it writing blog</span> <span data-start="213.359" data-end="214.92">posts about it i spoke at the jquery</span> <span data-start="214.92" data-end="217.319">conference in Boston about it last year</span> <span data-start="217.319" data-end="220.62">and through doing all of that talking I</span> <span data-start="220.62" data-end="223.019">find that a lot of people are calling me</span> <span data-start="223.019" data-end="226.17">and saying help we've done terrible</span> <span data-start="226.17" data-end="231.239">things and I'm proud of them for calling</span> <span data-start="231.239" data-end="232.62">me I'm proud of them for asking these</span> <span data-start="232.62" data-end="234.51">questions I'm impressed that people are</span> <span data-start="234.51" data-end="236.34">realizing sort of like Nicole was</span> <span data-start="236.34" data-end="237.599">talking about the CSS people are</span> <span data-start="237.599" data-end="240.15">realizing that this is actually a</span> <span data-start="240.15" data-end="242.13">problem it's a maintenance problem it's</span> <span data-start="242.13" data-end="246.42">a skill it's a extensibility problem</span> <span data-start="246.42" data-end="249.239">they they find themselves copying and</span> <span data-start="249.239" data-end="250.769">pasting like Nicole was talking about</span> <span data-start="250.769" data-end="253.56">instead of actually solving problems or</span> <span data-start="253.56" data-end="255.06">looking at their application in a big</span> <span data-start="255.06" data-end="257.639">picture sort of way so I applaud them</span> <span data-start="257.639" data-end="259.169">for saying you know I have a problem</span> <span data-start="259.169" data-end="262.019">that's the first step right so I say</span> <span data-start="262.019" data-end="264.479">sure I can help you and you know jquery</span> <span data-start="264.479" data-end="265.1">it</span> <span data-start="265.1" data-end="267.71">events a Jackson effects library it's</span> <span data-start="267.71" data-end="269.96">decent most of that it has some others</span> <span data-start="269.96" data-end="272.51">parts of it that I don't like when it</span> <span data-start="272.51" data-end="274.1">comes to some pieces of that but that's</span> <span data-start="274.1" data-end="275.93">what it does dumb Ajax events and</span> <span data-start="275.93" data-end="278.27">effects and what I'm hearing you tell me</span> <span data-start="278.27" data-end="280.82">dear client is that your needs are</span> <span data-start="280.82" data-end="282.28">actually a little bit bigger than this</span> <span data-start="282.28" data-end="285.56">and in my experience when you start</span> <span data-start="285.56" data-end="287.12">doing anything remotely serious with</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="287.12" data-end="288.98">JavaScript then your needs are actually</span> <span data-start="288.98" data-end="290.95">bigger than Dom Ajax events and effects</span> <span data-start="290.95" data-end="293.84">so we're off to a good start needing</span> <span data-start="293.84" data-end="296.42">this client and then but we must keep</span> <span data-start="296.42" data-end="298.37">using jQuery because it's easy and it's</span> <span data-start="298.37" data-end="301.67">popular and we don't want to hear about</span> <span data-start="301.67" data-end="303.83">any other options you know yeah you can</span> <span data-start="303.83" data-end="305.27">talk about the other options but really</span> <span data-start="305.27" data-end="308.54">we we want to stick with jquery we are</span> <span data-start="308.54" data-end="313.31">not willing to it's too easy it's too</span> <span data-start="313.31" data-end="315.8">easy we can't give that up and so at</span> <span data-start="315.8" data-end="317.27">this point now it's just sort of</span> <span data-start="317.27" data-end="318.95">entertaining because I'd been I've had</span> <span data-start="318.95" data-end="320.45">these conversations over and over and</span> <span data-start="320.45" data-end="321.92">over again and so this might say well</span> <span data-start="321.92" data-end="325.13">let me see your code let's take a look</span> <span data-start="325.13" data-end="326.48">at your code and see what it is you're</span> <span data-start="326.48" data-end="330.89">doing um this is obfuscated adha you</span> <span data-start="330.89" data-end="332.36">just enough that the client who sent it</span> <span data-start="332.36" data-end="333.92">to me to review it won't know it was</span> <span data-start="333.92" data-end="339.53">them but a terrible terrible this</span> <span data-start="339.53" data-end="341.33">is I mean Pete and I were upstairs</span> <span data-start="341.33" data-end="343.07">looking at it it's just it's amazing it</span> <span data-start="343.07" data-end="345.95">is so completely Dom centric it's</span> <span data-start="345.95" data-end="347.69">selections happening over and over and</span> <span data-start="347.69" data-end="349.76">over again on the exact same thing I</span> <span data-start="349.76" data-end="351.32">mean some of this stuff i don't know if</span> <span data-start="351.32" data-end="352.7">i put it up on the screen but some of</span> <span data-start="352.7" data-end="354.38">this stuff is like line for line</span> <span data-start="354.38" data-end="356.69">repeated except it's in a different it's</span> <span data-start="356.69" data-end="359.09">like a different if statement this is</span> <span data-start="359.09" data-end="363.08">what people well intentioned people who</span> <span data-start="363.08" data-end="366.08">are using jquery this is these these are</span> <span data-start="366.08" data-end="367.37">the answers that they're coming up with</span> <span data-start="367.37" data-end="370.61">to mildly complicated problems this I</span> <span data-start="370.61" data-end="372.05">think was on a search something from a</span> <span data-start="372.05" data-end="373.34">search results page or something like</span> <span data-start="373.34" data-end="376.19">that so mildly complicated problems not</span> <span data-start="376.19" data-end="378.29">you know we're not talking rocket</span> <span data-start="378.29" data-end="380.06">science here my only complex problems</span> <span data-start="380.06" data-end="382.01">that are more than just get some</span> <span data-start="382.01" data-end="383.93">elements and do something with them but</span> <span data-start="383.93" data-end="385.52">they're still approaching it's a get</span> <span data-start="385.52" data-end="386.87">some elements and do something with them</span> <span data-start="386.87" data-end="389.03">kind of problem instead of considering</span> <span data-start="389.03" data-end="390.29">how to actually architect their</span> <span data-start="390.29" data-end="392.78">application and then this is my favorite</span> <span data-start="392.78" data-end="393.889">part</span> <span data-start="393.889" data-end="396.319">is when they say that the real reason</span> <span data-start="396.319" data-end="397.61">they need to stick with jQuery is</span> <span data-start="397.61" data-end="399.68">because their database guys like they</span> <span data-start="399.68" data-end="402.319">get it and so and you know maybe they're</span> <span data-start="402.319" data-end="404.539">java developers they get it to and so we</span> <span data-start="404.539" data-end="407.21">can't do anything that actually means</span> <span data-start="407.21" data-end="408.59">that those people can't continue</span> <span data-start="408.59" data-end="412.419">contributing to the team and it's uh</span> <span data-start="412.419" data-end="415.729">yeah I don't know what to say about that</span> <span data-start="415.729" data-end="419.029">a really big believer that front end</span> <span data-start="419.029" data-end="420.68">developers should be doing front end and</span> <span data-start="420.68" data-end="422.449">let's groom the front end developers to</span> <span data-start="422.449" data-end="423.889">get the front end developers doing</span> <span data-start="423.889" data-end="426.139">better front end stuff when we pull in</span> <span data-start="426.139" data-end="430.33">people who don't have expertise in the</span> <span data-start="430.33" data-end="433.759">browser environment well we get that</span> <span data-start="433.759" data-end="436.759">code that we saw so I tell the story to</span> <span data-start="436.759" data-end="438.59">illustrate four points number one the</span> <span data-start="438.59" data-end="440.12">perceived popularity of jQuery is</span> <span data-start="440.12" data-end="442.819">pervasive the Percy's perceived ease of</span> <span data-start="442.819" data-end="445.849">use if factor is pervasive and it really</span> <span data-start="445.849" data-end="447.379">factors into the library choices that</span> <span data-start="447.379" data-end="450.319">people are making number two people who</span> <span data-start="450.319" data-end="452.419">don't know how to write JavaScript are</span> <span data-start="452.419" data-end="454.61">doing non trivial things with it and we</span> <span data-start="454.61" data-end="457.849">can't stop them the best that we can do</span> <span data-start="457.849" data-end="459.8">is help them do them better I've talked</span> <span data-start="459.8" data-end="462.77">to some people this weekend whoo hoo I</span> <span data-start="462.77" data-end="467.029">think would prefer to see the market</span> <span data-start="467.029" data-end="469.099">just just dispose of these people</span> <span data-start="469.099" data-end="471.43">because they're not good but the fact is</span> <span data-start="471.43" data-end="474.05">people are doing our writing complicated</span> <span data-start="474.05" data-end="476.27">things whether they should or not and I</span> <span data-start="476.27" data-end="478.539">think that's problem we need to address</span> <span data-start="478.539" data-end="480.919">number three there's actually demand for</span> <span data-start="480.919" data-end="482.27">the answers to these questions people</span> <span data-start="482.27" data-end="484.669">are realizing they've created problems</span> <span data-start="484.669" data-end="485.839">they don't know what to do about it</span> <span data-start="485.839" data-end="488.06">number for the people seeking these</span> <span data-start="488.06" data-end="490.219">answers they're not necessarily dumb</span> <span data-start="490.219" data-end="491.99">they just don't know what they don't</span> <span data-start="491.99" data-end="494.81">know

to think about</span> <span data-start="849.29" data-end="850.91">components that work with each other</span> <span data-start="850.91" data-end="852.17">without depending on each other we have</span> <span data-start="852.17" data-end="853.88">to think about how can we drive stuff</span> <span data-start="853.88" data-end="855.41">out we have to think about how can we</span> <span

of menu or</span> <span data-start="878" data-end="879.89">add a little bit of Ajax they've arrived</span> <span data-start="879.89" data-end="884.54">at jQuery to do that and now the knees</span> <span data-start="884.54" data-end="885.68">just keep growing and growing and</span> <span data-start="885.68" data-end="887.42">growing and at no point do they step</span> <span data-start="887.42" data-end="889.67">back and say I might not know what I</span> <span data-start="889.67" data-end="892.91">need to know to do this so here's a</span> <span data-start="892.91" data-end="894.65">simple little rewrite how we might</span> <span data-start="894.65" data-end="897.16">rewrite the search results portion of</span> <span data-start="897.16" data-end="900.53">that application to actually be

data-start="915.74" data-end="918.35">itself is almost as long as the simple</span> <span data-start="918.35" data-end="921.02">little code for for making the first</span> <span data-start="921.02"
