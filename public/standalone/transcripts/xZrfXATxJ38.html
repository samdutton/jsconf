<p><span data-start="398.21" data-end="404.37">So, let's talk about KTMJS.</span> <span data-start="404.37" data-end="411.82">As I said earlier, it's a community of JS developers in Kathmandu where we gather together,</span> <span data-start="411.82" data-end="421.24">share things around JavaScript, just we talk, and it started two years ago as a Facebook</span> <span data-start="421.24" data-end="422.24">group.</span> <span data-start="422.24" data-end="424.08">It is still there.</span> <span data-start="424.08" data-end="425.58">I mean, yes.</span> <span data-start="425.58" data-end="430.12">So, we are currently six people managing the community, six co-contributors.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="430.12" data-end="438.2">Until now, we have managed to organise around 13 event, and in our Facebook group, there</span> <span data-start="438.2" data-end="445.9">are around 1,500 members, so I'm not into all these numbers at all, but I wanted to</span> <span data-start="445.9" data-end="449.56">have it in the slide so I could talk about it.</span> <span data-start="449.56" data-end="458.52">So the last meet-up that we did was on 25 May.</span> <span data-start="458.52" data-end="464.48">We do a regular meet-up of different formats, like sometimes formal, sometimes informal,</span> <span data-start="464.48" data-end="468.19">and sometimes a mix of both.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="468.19" data-end="472.9">This is the photo from the last week of KMTJS.</span> <span data-start="472.9" data-end="482.53">There were 65 people, I guess, with four speakers.</span> <span data-start="482.53" data-end="487.79">It was about testing, and security in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="487.79" data-end="492.17">So let me talk about where — let me talk about the conference in Kathmandu, the conference</span> <span data-start="492.17" data-end="497.02">that I'm so excited and proud about.</span> <span data-start="497.02" data-end="500.84">It's the only web conference in Nepal.</span> <span data-start="500.84" data-end="505.81">There are a few conferences which are related to the workplace or something like that, but</span> <span data-start="505.81" data-end="516.539">it's the only conference that — it's a two-day conference, but a bit different than the KTMJ</span> <span data-start="516.539" data-end="517.649">- than JSConf EU.</span> <span data-start="517.649" data-end="525.3">On the first day, it's talks like this, but on the second day, we do outdoor activities</span> <span data-start="525.3" data-end="536.11">like, you know, trekking, and hiking, and roaming around the city together.</span> <span data-start="536.11" data-end="540.15">I want to talk about the motivation behind this conference.</span> <span data-start="540.15" data-end="548.81">So, there are a lot of experienced developers promising start-ups in Nepal, they are scattered</span> <span data-start="548.81" data-end="551.45">and unnoticed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="551.45" data-end="556.76">The main motivation behind this conference is making these people come together and say</span> <span data-start="556.76" data-end="563.59">about their stuff with — share their stuff with each other, and get together and build</span> <span data-start="563.59" data-end="564.77">something, right?</span> <span data-start="564.77" data-end="572.26">And also, it's very economically hard for Nepalese, like in their salary range to come</span> <span data-start="572.26" data-end="581.84">to this place and attend the conference and not everybody is as lucky as me to get their</span> <span data-start="581.84" data-end="589.7">talk accepted and attend the conference or get a scholarship.</span> <span data-start="589.7" data-end="598.12">What it aims to do is to provide these opportunities to meet people, and attend high-class talks</span> <span data-start="598.12" data-end="600.97">for the local people in Nepal.</span> <span data-start="600.97" data-end="607.42">Let me talk about a little bit of behind the scenes, how it all started.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="607.42" data-end="610.26">So I was attending this conference in Iceland.</span> <span data-start="610.26" data-end="614.24">It's JSConf Iceland which you may have heard of.</span> <span data-start="614.24" data-end="619.09">I was talking to one of the speakers of JSConf Iceland.</span> <span data-start="619.09" data-end="624.59">He actually asked me if there were any conferences that are happening in Nepal?</span> <span data-start="624.59" data-end="628">At that point of time, I was speechless, actually.</span> <span data-start="628" data-end="630.02">So, I was really sad.</span> <span data-start="630.02" data-end="632.58">I came back to Nepal.</span> <span data-start="632.58" data-end="639.58">In one of the local meet-ups in my surprise, I found this group of people who were actually</span> <span data-start="639.58" data-end="642.94">planning to do a conference in Nepal.</span> <span data-start="642.94" data-end="646.14">So, I was so excited, you know?</span> <span data-start="646.14" data-end="651.44">I was attending this conference in all the places of the world, but I had not any conferences</span> <span data-start="651.44" data-end="658.81">in my place, so I was so excited, I joined the team, successfully organised, the first</span> <span data-start="658.81" data-end="661.88">time in 2018.</span> <span data-start="661.88" data-end="665.33">So do you want to know the best part?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="665.33" data-end="675">The speaker who asked me about the conference in Nepal will be speak ing at in 2019 in September</span> <span data-start="675" data-end="676.18">22 to 23rd.</span> <span data-start="676.18" data-end="680.01">How cool is that?</span> <span data-start="680.01" data-end="682.47">[Applause].</span> <span data-start="682.47" data-end="687.68">So these are some of the stats from WWKTM.</span> <span data-start="687.68" data-end="697.61">We were initially expecting only 80 people, so I guess around 80 people to come, and five</span> <span data-start="697.61" data-end="705.05">or six speakers, but to our surprise, as you can see in the stats, there were 300-plus</span> <span data-start="705.05" data-end="711.26">attendees, and ten speakers from 14-plus countries.</span> <span data-start="711.26" data-end="719.27">This is the group photo from the Kathmandu 2018.</span> <span data-start="719.27" data-end="726.21">So this was — it — so there are a lot of perks going together with community.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="726.21" data-end="732.86">There are a lot of perks when leading a meet-up group or organising events and conferences.</span> <span data-start="732.86" data-end="736.92">It's possible to grow together with community, right?</span> <span data-start="736.92" data-end="739.03">You guys believed it before.</span> <span data-start="739.03" data-end="747.89">So, if you haven't watched the final episode of Game of Thrones yet, this might be the</span> <span data-start="747.89" data-end="752.5">spoiler for you, but I hope it won't matter anyway.</span> <span data-start="752.5" data-end="754.2">Yes.</span> <span data-start="754.2" data-end="758.59">How many of you ..! Did you get it!</span> <span data-start="758.59" data-end="760.82">How do you think I came all this way?</span> <span data-start="760.82" data-end="763.92">I mean, if it wasn't for community?</span> <span data-start="763.92" data-end="769.12">I wouldn't have been here speaking before you guys, organising meet-ups and conferences,</span> <span data-start="769.12" data-end="780.22">giving me the courage to do challenging things that even if I'm not very good at it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="780.22" data-end="786.42">I hadn't known about this conference or I wouldn't have applied for the talk if it wasn't</span> <span data-start="786.42" data-end="791.04">for community, and, if I wasn't involved in these kind of activities.</span> <span data-start="791.04" data-end="795.36">So you will be more privileged.</span> <span data-start="795.36" data-end="799.73">So list — I was listening to this podcast called Howe I Built This?</span> <span data-start="799.73" data-end="803.34">Has anyone heard of that?</span> <span data-start="803.34" data-end="811.7">I was listening to this podcast by John from BuzzFeed.</span> <span data-start="811.7" data-end="819.79">He was saying when you get initial success, as he did in the Huffington Post, you will</span> <span data-start="819.79" data-end="826.54">get access to greater ideas, resources and people, et cetera, that strike me right in.</span> <span data-start="826.54" data-end="833.16">For this, I mean when you lead a community or you organise this kind of event, even if</span> <span data-start="833.16" data-end="839.87">you participate actively in these programmes, you will have access to more resources, and</span> <span data-start="839.87" data-end="843.4">many more available stuff, right?</span> <span data-start="843.4" data-end="848.82">So, you know, you get these perks.</span> <span data-start="848.82" data-end="852.37">I found myself doing these things.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="852.37" data-end="856.94">You can have your own set of stuff.</span> <span data-start="856.94" data-end="858.08">Attend the talks actively.</span> <span data-start="858.08" data-end="861.12">Yes, you are the organiser of the meet-up.</span> <span data-start="861.12" data-end="868.089">You might not have a lot of time attending the talks, but you have to, you can try to</span> <span data-start="868.089" data-end="873.41">manage things in such a way that you are also attending the talks actively which will surely</span> <span data-start="873.41" data-end="878.69">help you grow your professional lives and get some skills.</span> <span data-start="878.69" data-end="882">How many of you agree on this?</span> <span data-start="882" data-end="887.86">Reaching out to the speakers, reaching out to the speakers will help you grow your communication</span> <span data-start="887.86" data-end="890.35">skills of course.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="890.35" data-end="898.9">Your network of friends and professionals will be wide enough to get more opportunities.</span> <span data-start="898.9" data-end="905.92">Challenges that I faced: so, of course, you're going to face a lot of challenges if you trying</span> <span data-start="905.92" data-end="911.69">to conduct meet-ups in small communities like Nepal, right?</span> <span data-start="911.69" data-end="914.97">There might be a lot of them in different forms.</span> <span data-start="914.97" data-end="921.28">I will talk about these challenges that I'm facing in my place, Nepal, and you can always</span> <span data-start="921.28" data-end="923.86">deliver them to yours.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="923.86" data-end="928.29">No wonder you might have differences of challenges.</span> <span data-start="928.29" data-end="938.41">Values: yes, in a small community like Nepal, it's really hard to get nice conference hall</span> <span data-start="938.41" data-end="939.63">for free of cost.</span> <span data-start="939.63" data-end="949.65">I mean, as we are not well funded, and that could accommodate more, more than 50 participants.</span> <span data-start="949.65" data-end="958.279">I actually, we, I had to postpone one of the meet-ups because of not getting the venue</span> <span data-start="958.279" data-end="959.71">in time, right?</span> <span data-start="959.71" data-end="961.67">That was a very sad moment.</span> <span data-start="961.67" data-end="966.22">Another challenge would be to find sponsors.</span> <span data-start="966.22" data-end="972.331">You might not need sponsors to run the meet-up, but, in fact, most of the meet-ups that I</span> <span data-start="972.331" data-end="974.899">have organised they are sponsor-free.</span> <span data-start="974.899" data-end="982.45">On the other hand, it's hard to organise meet-ups without sponsors.</span> <span data-start="982.45" data-end="993.77">I mean, usually, we have — with no sponsors, there are not going to be food and drinks</span> <span data-start="993.77" data-end="995.399">for the attendees, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="995.399" data-end="1001.56">How actively one can participate in the event, a hungry stomach?</span> <span data-start="1001.56" data-end="1011.63">And also, it's really nice to give some token of love to speakers.</span> <span data-start="1011.63" data-end="1020.11">In my context, the main issue with finding sponsors was, like, not so many companies</span> <span data-start="1020.11" data-end="1022.54">to approach for sponsorship.</span> <span data-start="1022.54" data-end="1029.04">There were not enough companies, there are not enough companies in Nepal, sorry, where</span> <span data-start="1029.04" data-end="1035.55">I can approach for sponsorship.</span> <span data-start="1035.55" data-end="1042.06">Finding speakers turned out to be hard task for me as well.</span> <span data-start="1042.06" data-end="1048.39">In the case of Nepal, and in the case of some of the speakers don't really want to talk</span> <span data-start="1048.39" data-end="1054.49">in the small meet-up like ours, and most of them, most of the engineers, they hesitate</span> <span data-start="1054.49" data-end="1056.44">to talk in public.</span> <span data-start="1056.44" data-end="1059.66">That's a real problem in our place.</span> <span data-start="1059.66" data-end="1066.04">So, if you want to share something in the community, or if you have done some amazing</span> <span data-start="1066.04" data-end="1072.89">stuff that will help the public, please go forward and don't hesitate about talking in</span> <span data-start="1072.89" data-end="1073.98">the meet-ups.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1073.98" data-end="1077.09">It could be local, or it could be a conference like this.</span> <span data-start="1077.09" data-end="1079.98">It would really help the organisers.</span> <span data-start="1079.98" data-end="1089.25">The same like the speakers, attendees are also like, faced challenges in attendees as</span> <span data-start="1089.25" data-end="1090.25">well.</span> <span data-start="1090.25" data-end="1095.75">Senior engineers and developers are not willing to attend the meet-up maybe because they feel</span> <span data-start="1095.75" data-end="1102.53">like they aren't going to learn anything from the meet-up, but, yes, most of the participants</span> <span data-start="1102.53" data-end="1107.47">in the meet-ups in Nepal are students.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1107.47" data-end="1113.992">Also, this is the main thing, I guess, motivations in teams. since we are non-funded, we're</span> <span data-start="1113.992" data-end="1122.7">not funded by any big organisations, there might be the loss of motivation in the team.</span> <span data-start="1122.7" data-end="1129.77">Yes, too much or too few meet-ups.</span> <span data-start="1129.77" data-end="1132.68">This is a very big problem.</span> <span data-start="1132.68" data-end="1138.24">Because of the lack of motivation and the different jobs of the people, of the organising</span> <span data-start="1138.24" data-end="1146.25">team, there might be very few meet-ups, and also there might be too many meet-ups.</span> <span data-start="1146.25" data-end="1149.3">So how to overcome these challenges?</span> <span data-start="1149.3" data-end="1155.46">Again, these are based on my experience, and these things are subjected to change according</span> <span data-start="1155.46" data-end="1162.71">to the country, according to the place, and according to the organiser teams.</span> <span data-start="1162.71" data-end="1165.17">So you can try to find alternative venues.</span> <span data-start="1165.17" data-end="1169.58">You know, you can talk to the schools and colleges, and universities to provide their</span> <span data-start="1169.58" data-end="1173.06">premises as a venue.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1173.06" data-end="1179.92">You can also conduct small meet-ups in coffee shops and cafes where participants can buy</span> <span data-start="1179.92" data-end="1186.08">their own coffee and food, and also you can ask the venue providers to provide light snacks</span> <span data-start="1186.08" data-end="1193.61">and tea and coffee for their attendees.</span> <span data-start="1193.61" data-end="1201.5">In the — senior developers and engineers don't like to go, why they wouldn't like to come</span> <span data-start="1201.5" data-end="1210.48">in the meet-up, it's like they're not going to learn anything from the talks, they just</span> <span data-start="1210.48" data-end="1216.43">want to build their network, but students, they like to attend the talks from the seniors,</span> <span data-start="1216.43" data-end="1220.37">and they like to learn programming languages, or something like that.</span> <span data-start="1220.37" data-end="1230.1">So you can try to have, you know, different formats of the events like these talks should</span> <span data-start="1230.1" data-end="1237.65">not, I mean, it doesn't have to be formal meet-ups where two guys come and do the frameworks,</span> <span data-start="1237.65" data-end="1243.38">right, so you can try to do informal meet-ups where developers meet and greet, talk about</span> <span data-start="1243.38" data-end="1247.89">their life, talk about their side projects.</span> <span data-start="1247.89" data-end="1253.25">You can also try doing events in different time, like, sometimes in the morning, sometimes</span> <span data-start="1253.25" data-end="1257.26">in the afternoon, and even in the evening.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1257.26" data-end="1259.08">Right?</span> <span data-start="1259.08" data-end="1269.26">Yes, the meet-ups in the Facebook group can be also very fruitful.</span> <span data-start="1269.26" data-end="1278.22">Too frequent meet-ups in the beginning, we used to do meet-ups efficient week.</span> <span data-start="1278.22" data-end="1281.18">That was crazy.</span> <span data-start="1281.18" data-end="1287.84">Attendees and even yourself, you don't want to lose all your weekends, you know?</span> <span data-start="1287.84" data-end="1290.79">Going to the meet-ups, and listening to some stuff.</span> <span data-start="1290.79" data-end="1298.52">Having said that, skipping six or seven months for a meet-up is not healthy, either.</span> <span data-start="1298.52" data-end="1307.51">You have to do — regularly, it could be once in a month, or twice in — I don't know, once</span> <span data-start="1307.51" data-end="1311.86">in two months, and something like that.</span> <span data-start="1311.86" data-end="1317.7">And another thing that you can do is let your team member lead the meet-up.</span> <span data-start="1317.7" data-end="1324.2">I actually, did this recently, that I was just talking about the May 25 meet-up.</span> <span data-start="1324.2" data-end="1332.19">I was actually preparing for JSConf EU talk, and I didn't have enough time to conduct meet-up,</span> <span data-start="1332.19" data-end="1342.12">so I asked one of my team members to organise this and do anything they like, you know?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1342.12" data-end="1344.88">It was very good thing.</span> <span data-start="1344.88" data-end="1351.95">I mean, there was a lot of — all the people from the team came up, and they started working</span> <span data-start="1351.95" data-end="1354.62">on them, and it was successful.</span> <span data-start="1354.62" data-end="1361.679">I mean, 65 people were there, and I heard it went a lot better.</span> <span data-start="1361.679" data-end="1369.14">Also, you can get engaged in social media, Facebook groups, and invite the attendees</span> <span data-start="1369.14" data-end="1373.28">to attend, to join the group, and ask questions, or something like that.</span> <span data-start="1373.28" data-end="1381">Yes, very, very important, not — yes, check feedback from your attendees.</span> <span data-start="1381" data-end="1382.54">It's very important.</span> <span data-start="1382.54" data-end="1389.48">Like, I told you earlier that we are trying to have different formats of events, right?</span> <span data-start="1389.48" data-end="1396.55">So it was because of the feedbacks from the attendees.</span> <span data-start="1396.55" data-end="1406.33">Takeaways, actively to grow and participate with the together, involved in community will</span> <span data-start="1406.33" data-end="1413.33">help you grow your communication skills and professional skills, have motivated members</span> <span data-start="1413.33" data-end="1415.27">in your team.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1415.27" data-end="1420.45">Too many meet-ups and too irregular meet-ups, avoid.</span> <span data-start="1420.45" data-end="1426.96">Always take feedback from the attendees, and screw it, just do it!</span> <span data-start="1426.96" data-end="1435.09">If you have — if you're not getting involved in the local meet-ups, just get involved in</span> <span data-start="1435.09" data-end="1437.01">it, and thank you.</span> <span data-start="1437.01" data-end="1438.13">This is Roshan Gautam.</span> <span data-start="1438.13" data-end="1441.23">You can find me in the GitHub.</span> <span data-start="1441.23" data-end="1443.61">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="1443.61" data-end="1444.799">[Applause].</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1444.799" data-end="1455.549">Actually, one more thing: if you want to speak at Kathmandu, we've just opened up our wildcard</span> <span data-start="1455.549" data-end="1462.99">speaker proposal for a very limited tile, make sure you apply as soon as possible.</span> <span data-start="1462.99" data-end="1463.99">Thanks again!</span> </p>
