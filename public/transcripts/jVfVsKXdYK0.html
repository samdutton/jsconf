<p><span data-start="7.169" data-end="15.75">Hope you're enjoying the conference so far.</span> <span data-start="15.75" data-end="19.64">I wish I could be there in person, but this is the next best thing.</span> <span data-start="19.64" data-end="24.26">And I'm excited to talk about accessibility and coats of arms.</span> <span data-start="24.26" data-end="29.15">So, if you're someone who likes to follow along with slides while the talk is going,</span> <span data-start="29.15" data-end="35.18">I did Tweet them out so you can go and look me up on Twitter if you want to access those.</span> <span data-start="35.18" data-end="40.691">The inspiration for this talk is basically in software design and development, often</span> <span data-start="40.691" data-end="46.829">we deal with complex problems and lessons that can feel kind of novel and new at first.</span> <span data-start="46.829" data-end="52.12">But a lot of times these are problems that people have wrestled with in some capacity</span> <span data-start="52.12" data-end="53.86">for years or even centuries.</span> <span data-start="53.86" data-end="59.7">So, I thought it would be interesting to take a look at design, specifically accessibility,</span> <span data-start="59.7" data-end="63.43">within the historical lens of coats of arms.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="63.43" data-end="69.77">So, it give you an idea of where we're headed, I'll hope by giving you some historical context</span> <span data-start="69.77" data-end="73.46">about coats of arms and what they're for and where they come from.</span> <span data-start="73.46" data-end="78.1">For the meat of this talk, we'll look at the lessons we can learn from the designs of coats</span> <span data-start="78.1" data-end="85.47">of arms and how to apply those in our work in software.</span> <span data-start="85.47" data-end="91.659">A popular place you might have seen coats of arms recently is in Game of Thrones.</span> <span data-start="91.659" data-end="97.43">If you're a fan, you might recognize some of the symbols like the Stark's direwolf or</span> <span data-start="97.43" data-end="99.259">the Lannister lion.</span> <span data-start="99.259" data-end="105.81">These had special meanings to the houses and were used to identify people who belonged</span> <span data-start="105.81" data-end="108.35">to one of those houses.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="108.35" data-end="111.659">Accessibility is kind of a big word.</span> <span data-start="111.659" data-end="116.92">And especially in the last two to five years, it's been kind of a buzzword.</span> <span data-start="116.92" data-end="119.95">This talk is not meant to be an introduction to accessibility.</span> <span data-start="119.95" data-end="124.729">There are college courses and degrees and certificates on that subject.</span> <span data-start="124.729" data-end="130.289">But just to kind of look at best practices of accessibility within a different historical</span> <span data-start="130.289" data-end="131.4">lens.</span> <span data-start="131.4" data-end="135.829">And hopefully you'll learn some interesting things and kind of gain a new perspective.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="135.829" data-end="142.799">So, as you probably know, accessibility's about more than just what something looks</span> <span data-start="142.799" data-end="143.799">like.</span> <span data-start="143.799" data-end="148.019">So, more than just kind of using good contrast and having a readable font.</span> <span data-start="148.019" data-end="153.18">It means designing for people with motor impairments, by providing keyboard accessible functions</span> <span data-start="153.18" data-end="156.449">for everything that you expect a use to do.</span> <span data-start="156.449" data-end="159.439">Means accommodating screenreaders for your website.</span> <span data-start="159.439" data-end="160.439">Things like that.</span> <span data-start="160.439" data-end="165.87">So, again, this is not intended to be a comprehensive introduction to accessibility.</span> <span data-start="165.87" data-end="171.83">But I did pull the top ten rules on accessibility practices from the guide to the Internet for</span> <span data-start="171.83" data-end="173.549">the EU.</span> <span data-start="173.549" data-end="176.18">And those are you don't worry about memorizing these or anything.</span> <span data-start="176.18" data-end="178.269">I just to want review them quickly.</span> <span data-start="178.269" data-end="181.54">Number one, structured contents.</span> <span data-start="181.54" data-end="185.48">Avoid dependence on any one single sense, eyesight in particular.</span> <span data-start="185.48" data-end="186.799">Help your users avoid mistakes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="186.799" data-end="190.14">If they make a mistake, show them how to correct it.</span> <span data-start="190.14" data-end="192.879">Avoid flashing.</span> <span data-start="192.879" data-end="196.04">Try to provide text descriptions where possible.</span> <span data-start="196.04" data-end="200.37">Make the functions on your site or app keyboard accessible.</span> <span data-start="200.37" data-end="202.43">Avoid rushing your users.</span> <span data-start="202.43" data-end="204.749">Identify links and where they will take you.</span> <span data-start="204.749" data-end="210.93">Keep navigation UI consistent and try and keep your experience compatible across devices</span> <span data-start="210.93" data-end="211.93">and browsers.</span> <span data-start="211.93" data-end="218.001">So, I boiled those down more into three big rules which are: Structure contents, avoid</span> <span data-start="218.001" data-end="223.92">dependence on any single sense and avoid rushing your users or pigeonholing them into any one</span> <span data-start="223.92" data-end="224.92">action.</span> <span data-start="224.92" data-end="230.359">So, if you hear the term "Coats of arms," you might picture something like this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="230.359" data-end="232.459">That's not what it is.</span> <span data-start="232.459" data-end="238.4">The term is if I were getting ready for battle and putting on a suit of armor, I would put</span> <span data-start="238.4" data-end="244.209">on a coat over that that would have a coat of arms or essentially a crest printed on</span> <span data-start="244.209" data-end="245.819">it.</span> <span data-start="245.819" data-end="251.15">The purpose of a coat of arms is to be easily identifiable for the house or country it represents.</span> <span data-start="251.15" data-end="253.7">And there are several reasons why that's good.</span> <span data-start="253.7" data-end="258.68">It enables you to record and embellish the history of your nation in kind of a visual</span> <span data-start="258.68" data-end="259.68">format.</span> <span data-start="259.68" data-end="261.09">It was a way to identify the dead.</span> <span data-start="261.09" data-end="264.56">So that you could look at their coat and see what house they belonged to.</span> <span data-start="264.56" data-end="267.19">A way to declare military units.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="267.19" data-end="273.289">If I was traveling and saw a group of people, I could see if they were friendly based on</span> <span data-start="273.289" data-end="274.5">what they were wearing.</span> <span data-start="274.5" data-end="280.34">A means to establish pedigree if you could trace back your coat several generations and</span> <span data-start="280.34" data-end="283.76">a way to pass down family honors or symbols.</span> <span data-start="283.76" data-end="287.26">So, I'm gonna use the term "Heraldry."</span> <span data-start="287.26" data-end="292.889">Heraldry is the system by which coats of arms and other bearings are devised, described</span> <span data-start="292.889" data-end="293.889">and regulated.</span> <span data-start="293.889" data-end="296.449">It's kind of the overarching context.</span> <span data-start="296.449" data-end="302.07">I'm going to use the terms emblem and seal interchangeably with coats of arms.</span> <span data-start="302.07" data-end="306.219">They're considered subsets of coats of arms if I show you something that's more like a</span> <span data-start="306.219" data-end="311.77">seal for a later, it's also a coat of arms.</span> <span data-start="311.77" data-end="316.389">I wanted to touch on rights of use for coats of arms because I think it's kind of interesting.</span> <span data-start="316.389" data-end="321.849">I pulled facts from the countries I researched while preparing for this talk.</span> <span data-start="321.849" data-end="326.9">In Denmark, any unlawful use of heraldic arms is a criminal offense.</span> <span data-start="326.9" data-end="333.849">If I'm using a coat of arms that I don't have the rights to, I could be charged criminally.</span> <span data-start="333.849" data-end="339.15">In Italy, heraldic matters were ruled outside of the scope of official law.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="339.15" data-end="344.169">Can in South Africa, they said all citizens can wear arm it is they please.</span> <span data-start="344.169" data-end="348.52">So, kind of a more flexible approach there.</span> <span data-start="348.52" data-end="352.05">In Scotland, coats of arms are considered inheritable property.</span> <span data-start="352.05" data-end="356.129">I inherit the family farm and then also the family coat of arms.</span> <span data-start="356.129" data-end="361.57">And in Ireland, if you can trace back your ancestry, you can be granted the rights to</span> <span data-start="361.57" data-end="363.31">a coat of arms.</span> <span data-start="363.31" data-end="369.68">So, I came up with a basic timeline for key events in different regions surrounding this</span> <span data-start="369.68" data-end="370.68">concept.</span> <span data-start="370.68" data-end="376.229">So, the earliest reference that we have to coats of arms in general is in 2000B.C., Egyptian</span> <span data-start="376.229" data-end="382.33">hieroglyphics and artwork, they had rulers who wore emblems to signify why where they</span> <span data-start="382.33" data-end="383.35">came from.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="383.35" data-end="391.879">And in the book of numbers in the Bible, it's the insignia of the children of Italy, a precursor.</span> <span data-start="391.879" data-end="396.99">Then they were in use by western nobilities.</span> <span data-start="396.99" data-end="401.68">By the 16th century, strictly regulated in Ireland.</span> <span data-start="401.68" data-end="407.84">And the 17th through 19th centuries, they were widely used to record family history.</span> <span data-start="407.84" data-end="410.62">So, some interesting event there is.</span> <span data-start="410.62" data-end="411.62">Great.</span> <span data-start="411.62" data-end="413.889">Now let's see what we looked like.</span> <span data-start="413.889" data-end="418.19">I tried to pull a decedent sample size of different kinds of designs.</span> <span data-start="418.19" data-end="419.5">It's not totally comprehensive.</span> <span data-start="419.5" data-end="425.84">And I'm going to start with what you are familiar with you have seen crests in a tourist shop</span> <span data-start="425.84" data-end="427.26">or something like that.</span> <span data-start="427.26" data-end="429.779">They were probably from Scotland or Ireland.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="429.779" data-end="434.04">So, often the ones that people are familiar with are from Europe.</span> <span data-start="434.04" data-end="438.9">And particularly in this top row you can see some design commonalities with the two figures</span> <span data-start="438.9" data-end="444.46">on either side and the shield in the forefront and then some type of crown symbol and maybe</span> <span data-start="444.46" data-end="445.819">a motto as well.</span> <span data-start="445.819" data-end="449.72">You can see certain similarities in a lot of those.</span> <span data-start="449.72" data-end="455.96">Asian heraldry, the ones for China and south Korea look more like seals in this case.</span> <span data-start="455.96" data-end="458.699">They're kind of more round and bold.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="458.699" data-end="462.37">The one representing the Russian empire, you can see the western influence.</span> <span data-start="462.37" data-end="467.07">It's got kind of some similarities to the ones on the previous slide.</span> <span data-start="467.07" data-end="473.77">And point out Japan in the bottom row, those are pictures of Mon, emblems used to present</span> <span data-start="473.77" data-end="477.24">houses and we will talk about them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="477.24" data-end="484.96">And you can see western influence, particularly with colonialism, with Nigeria, Malawi and</span> <span data-start="484.96" data-end="492.21">Somalia and Kenya, and you can see the supporters on the central shield.</span> <span data-start="492.21" data-end="498.659">And then in the bottom right, the complete of arms for Sudan has an eagle which is a</span> <span data-start="498.659" data-end="503.16">common trend for coats of arms from the Middle East.</span> <span data-start="503.16" data-end="506.86">These are what some of the different heraldic signs look like in the Middle East.</span> <span data-start="506.86" data-end="513.479">And you can see many feature this eagle which is the eagle of Saladin and a motto on the</span> <span data-start="513.479" data-end="514.479">bottom.</span> <span data-start="514.479" data-end="520.029">It's interesting to see certain patterns in various regions when it comes to their coats</span> <span data-start="520.029" data-end="523.099">of arms.</span> <span data-start="523.099" data-end="525.82">These are some of the symbols from the Americas.</span> <span data-start="525.82" data-end="530.67">These ones tend I think they all have some kind of greenery which is kind of interesting.</span> <span data-start="530.67" data-end="535.44">They also tend to be a little bit taller than the others which I also found to be interesting.</span> <span data-start="535.44" data-end="539.15">And maybe a little bit more color as well.</span> <span data-start="539.15" data-end="540.15">Great.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="540.15" data-end="545.17">So, again, that's not obviously all of the coats of arms there are, but it's a sampling.</span> <span data-start="545.17" data-end="549.649">So, we were to think about what makes a good coat of arms, if we were to create our own,</span> <span data-start="549.649" data-end="551.639">we would want it to be easily identifiable.</span> <span data-start="551.639" data-end="554.74">Potentially across a battlefield to our enemies.</span> <span data-start="554.74" data-end="560.029">We might want to incorporate symbols that have special meaning to us or look impressive</span> <span data-start="560.029" data-end="561.55">to someone else.</span> <span data-start="561.55" data-end="566.44">Those are things to keep in mind as we keep going.</span> <span data-start="566.44" data-end="569.81">This is, again, some of the samples that I showed you.</span> <span data-start="569.81" data-end="572.13">And you can see there's a lot of variety.</span> <span data-start="572.13" data-end="577.06">Some of them are extremely interesting, this one from Haiti with minute details.</span> <span data-start="577.06" data-end="581.84">And some are more bold like this one from China which is an emblem that pops out at</span> <span data-start="581.84" data-end="584.09">you from among the rest.</span> <span data-start="584.09" data-end="589.68">So, let's talk about some of the things that are done well in a lens of modern standards</span> <span data-start="589.68" data-end="590.68">of accessibility.</span> <span data-start="590.68" data-end="594.589">And, again, there's no right and wrong because these are works of art.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="594.589" data-end="598.52">We're just choosing to look at them within this particular framework.</span> <span data-start="598.52" data-end="602.05">So, generally these are pretty easily distinguishable.</span> <span data-start="602.05" data-end="605.7">So, these are some heraldic symbols from Germany.</span> <span data-start="605.7" data-end="610.37">And there are some similarities like the use of the crown or the lion in some of them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="610.37" data-end="615.589">But if two of them were side by side, I probably would be able to tell them apart pretty easily.</span> <span data-start="615.589" data-end="617.96">Which is good.</span> <span data-start="617.96" data-end="620.06">There's generally good color contrast.</span> <span data-start="620.06" data-end="621.69">This example is from Egypt.</span> <span data-start="621.69" data-end="626.72">And it's got an object in the forefront against a lighter background and the red lining.</span> <span data-start="626.72" data-end="631.11">I will point out if you had red will have green color blindness, this is not ideal,</span> <span data-start="631.11" data-end="635.759">but it does have some good contrast.</span> <span data-start="635.759" data-end="640.29">There's evidence of clear themes, specifically within regions for a lot of these.</span> <span data-start="640.29" data-end="643.269">And a good example is the Japanese Mon.</span> <span data-start="643.269" data-end="650.72">One example, you can see that there's a blossom and that symbolizes the renewal of life.</span> <span data-start="650.72" data-end="656.51">Often, they're recognizable even if someone came from a different background.</span> <span data-start="656.51" data-end="660.399">In particular there's one with a sword, easy to interpret.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="660.399" data-end="665.05">An animal with bared teeth, that's pretty understandable.</span> <span data-start="665.05" data-end="670.45">It's not a blanket rule, but in general they have recognizable elements for people that</span> <span data-start="670.45" data-end="671.839">come from different backgrounds.</span> <span data-start="671.839" data-end="677.459">So, what are some things that could have been done better in terms of modern standards of</span> <span data-start="677.459" data-end="680.6">accessibility?</span> <span data-start="680.6" data-end="701.79">This is an example.</span> <span data-start="701.79" data-end="725.5">Recognizable elements for people from different backgrounds.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="725.5" data-end="731.44">So, what are some things that could have been done standpoint.</span> <span data-start="731.44" data-end="736">Could provide a description of what this looks like.</span> <span data-start="736" data-end="739.04">But obviously it's intended to be a visual thing.</span> <span data-start="739.04" data-end="743.709">You might think of the audible equivalent as like a battle cry or something like that</span> <span data-start="743.709" data-end="745.279">as you're going into battle.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="745.279" data-end="749.649">Or maybe a song.</span> <span data-start="749.649" data-end="751.009">Readability is not always great.</span> <span data-start="751.009" data-end="755.55">So, this is a coat of arms from Portugal that's been printed ton some fabric.</span> <span data-start="755.55" data-end="760.259">It's beautiful look at, but it's hard it make out the letters on the bottom there.</span> <span data-start="760.259" data-end="763.949">So, not superreadable.</span> <span data-start="763.949" data-end="765.279">Some of them are very complex.</span> <span data-start="765.279" data-end="767.399">Like this one from imperial Russia.</span> <span data-start="767.399" data-end="773.19">So, if I were to print this into a book and able to look at all the details with a magnifying</span> <span data-start="773.19" data-end="774.35">glass, that would be interesting.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="774.35" data-end="780.99">But on a coat of arms, a lot of this detail would probably get lost.</span> <span data-start="780.99" data-end="782.61">Great.</span> <span data-start="782.61" data-end="786.63">Let's talk about what lessons we can take away from some of these designs and some of</span> <span data-start="786.63" data-end="788.19">the problems they faced.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="788.19" data-end="793.32">So, a big one is the meaning and unintended meaning behind various symbols.</span> <span data-start="793.32" data-end="798.47">So, while I was researching this talk, I read a paper from some students at Kansas State</span> <span data-start="798.47" data-end="805.57">University opt meaning of Chinese symbols and what they mean in nonChinese cultures.</span> <span data-start="805.57" data-end="813.31">They gave a meaning of a fish, a symbol of good luck and joy in China and is often used</span> <span data-start="813.31" data-end="815.79">in business logos as a result.</span> <span data-start="815.79" data-end="820.079">But if you were to apply this in a more western context, a lot of times those are only used</span> <span data-start="820.079" data-end="824.95">in a logo geared towards children or a restaurant.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="824.95" data-end="826.77">You could see where this could be confusing.</span> <span data-start="826.77" data-end="832.209">If I put a fish into my coat of arms and I wanted to symbolize good luck and someone</span> <span data-start="832.209" data-end="837.41">from a western background saw it and thought that my house was selling sushi.</span> <span data-start="837.41" data-end="844.579">Even symbols like animals that can seem clear to us often have specific cultural connotations.</span> <span data-start="844.579" data-end="849.81">The international standard of organizations provides some guidelines on symbols.</span> <span data-start="849.81" data-end="857.819">Stay away from hand gestures, religious symbols and animals which can be ambiguous culturally.</span> <span data-start="857.819" data-end="862.399">You can use nature symbols in general like sun or rain or flowers.</span> <span data-start="862.399" data-end="867.56">Graphics that are officially recognized by the ISO and symbols that represent things</span> <span data-start="867.56" data-end="869.139">like equipment or transportation.</span> <span data-start="869.139" data-end="872.949">So, something like a truck or a hammer would be pretty safe.</span> <span data-start="872.949" data-end="877.64">Abstract shapes like circles and squares are also good choices.</span> <span data-start="877.64" data-end="882.279">I mentioned the international organization of standards.</span> <span data-start="882.279" data-end="886.81">That's a body that was established by the U.N. and is headquartered in Geneva.</span> <span data-start="886.81" data-end="893.139">Their purpose is to develop highquality standards which facilitates exchange of goods, supports</span> <span data-start="893.139" data-end="897.38">growth, promote innovation and protect health, safety and the environment.</span> <span data-start="897.38" data-end="902.399">So, you're probably familiar with some of the icons that they've standardized.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="902.399" data-end="907.33">They're things that are used in safety context or on roads signs, at airports.</span> <span data-start="907.33" data-end="911.569">They can be things like hospital and no diving sign.</span> <span data-start="911.569" data-end="915.389">And you can see by looking at these that they're meant to be have a universal meaning.</span> <span data-start="915.389" data-end="920.389">You don't need to speak a particular language to understand these.</span> <span data-start="920.389" data-end="925.31">I think another case study when it comes to the meaning of symbols is interesting to look</span> <span data-start="925.31" data-end="927.54">at, the Mon from Japan.</span> <span data-start="927.54" data-end="931.56">I talked about earlier the blossom is the symbol of the renewal of life.</span> <span data-start="931.56" data-end="934.939">If I came from somewhere else, I might be able to guess that.</span> <span data-start="934.939" data-end="939.019">Plant life is frequently correlated with renewal of life.</span> <span data-start="939.019" data-end="943.199">But it might be harder to understand not having the right background.</span> <span data-start="943.199" data-end="946.899">There are others like this one in the top right is four diamonds which might be unclear</span> <span data-start="946.899" data-end="948.259">to me at first glance.</span> <span data-start="948.259" data-end="955">So, some of these symbols are specific to a particular region.</span> <span data-start="955" data-end="958.949">Another important lesson that we can take away from heraldic design is the importance</span> <span data-start="958.949" data-end="961.779">of establishing a framework for your user.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="961.779" data-end="967.329">As you probably know, we as human beings are really good at recognizing patterns and dealing</span> <span data-start="967.329" data-end="968.67">with patterns.</span> <span data-start="968.67" data-end="973.74">And you see this in UI design or good UI design with things like a menu which is pretty consistent</span> <span data-start="973.74" data-end="975.439">between websites.</span> <span data-start="975.439" data-end="979.62">That's very helpful to me if I need to go to a website and find something that the navigation</span> <span data-start="979.62" data-end="981.51">is consistent.</span> <span data-start="981.51" data-end="986.85">And an example of this in heraldic design, a lot of them had a very strict format for</span> <span data-start="986.85" data-end="987.85">a coat of arms.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="987.85" data-end="992.57">So, this is a more western one and it shows the helmet and two supporters and the battle</span> <span data-start="992.57" data-end="994.839">crier, a slogan across the stop.</span> <span data-start="994.839" data-end="1000.629">If I studied these and I was very familiar with their anatomy, I could read this and</span> <span data-start="1000.629" data-end="1004.819">look at a coat of arms and say, okay, the supporters of this house are this and this</span> <span data-start="1004.819" data-end="1009.939">is the motto, and this is where everything goes.</span> <span data-start="1009.939" data-end="1013.85">It's also good to remember that as sick as you are of design, your users are not going</span> <span data-start="1013.85" data-end="1016.54">to be as sick of it.</span> <span data-start="1016.54" data-end="1019.079">This is called Jacob's Law of the Internet User.</span> <span data-start="1019.079" data-end="1023.97">And basically, if you're looking at your own website for maybe one hour or a couple hours</span> <span data-start="1023.97" data-end="1029.07">every single day, everyone your most active users are only spending a couple of minutes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1029.07" data-end="1033.88">So, in the course of a month you can imagine that you would have maybe 30 hours of time</span> <span data-start="1033.88" data-end="1039.55">spent looking at your website whereas your user would only have maybe 15 minutes or so.</span> <span data-start="1039.55" data-end="1044.22">And as a result, you might be sick of the design and think that you need a refresh,</span> <span data-start="1044.22" data-end="1047.36">but your user doesn't have nearly the same exposure to it.</span> <span data-start="1047.36" data-end="1051.82">So, it's a good thing to keep in mind in design in general.</span> <span data-start="1051.82" data-end="1055.56">And heavily related, they've done Studies that find that users actually like feeling</span> <span data-start="1055.56" data-end="1057.34">pretty exposed to a website.</span> <span data-start="1057.34" data-end="1062.63">So, you might think that they want a new and edgy experience, but in reality, they probably</span> <span data-start="1062.63" data-end="1068.3">like feel like they know exactly how your website works.</span> <span data-start="1068.3" data-end="1073.78">Another important lesson that we can learn from heraldic design is the importance of</span> <span data-start="1073.78" data-end="1074.78">simplicity.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1074.78" data-end="1080.19">So, this is I think a good lesson from someone named Steve Krug.</span> <span data-start="1080.19" data-end="1085.02">And he referred to users of the web as sharks who have essentially going along and trying</span> <span data-start="1085.02" data-end="1086.85">to accomplish a specific thing.</span> <span data-start="1086.85" data-end="1089.05">And then they accomplish that and have to keep going.</span> <span data-start="1089.05" data-end="1091.65">If they stop, they'll die.</span> <span data-start="1091.65" data-end="1094.25">They have to keep swimming.</span> <span data-start="1094.25" data-end="1098.67">If you can imagine your users when they go to your website with not trying to stop and</span> <span data-start="1098.67" data-end="1099.67">smell the roses.</span> <span data-start="1099.67" data-end="1102.28">They're trying to accomplish one specific thing.</span> <span data-start="1102.28" data-end="1105.84">And however, you can help them do that will be good.</span> <span data-start="1105.84" data-end="1110.96">So, this is an example of where complexity won out.</span> <span data-start="1110.96" data-end="1117.15">This is the 1915 code of arms for the AustriaHungarian empire.</span> <span data-start="1117.15" data-end="1118.95">There's a lot going down here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1118.95" data-end="1124.45">They got into the tradition of passing down history in the coat of arms and there's a</span> <span data-start="1124.45" data-end="1131.28">bunch of flags and symbols jumbled together here to the point that it's hard to get meaning</span> <span data-start="1131.28" data-end="1133.02">from looking at it.</span> <span data-start="1133.02" data-end="1137.51">It's obviously very interesting and if you know what's going on, I'm sure it tells an</span> <span data-start="1137.51" data-end="1139.13">interesting story.</span> <span data-start="1139.13" data-end="1145.44">But might have been better to favor simplicity, depending on your purpose.</span> <span data-start="1145.44" data-end="1150.62">Another important lesson that we can take away is related to complex text flow.</span> <span data-start="1150.62" data-end="1154.39">So, maybe you've had this experience as an engineer where you get your beige laid out</span> <span data-start="1154.39" data-end="1156.69">just right and everything looks awesome.</span> <span data-start="1156.69" data-end="1159.87">And then you add one word and all of a sudden there's a line break.</span> <span data-start="1159.87" data-end="1162.8">And everything has been changed and it looks horrible.</span> <span data-start="1162.8" data-end="1166.89">So, this is one of the examples of why text flow is really hard to deal with.</span> <span data-start="1166.89" data-end="1169.69">In particular if you're changing the language as well.</span> <span data-start="1169.69" data-end="1172.13">That's an added complication.</span> <span data-start="1172.13" data-end="1174.81">And in heraldic design there's a similar corollary.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1174.81" data-end="1176.39">I have to explain something first.</span> <span data-start="1176.39" data-end="1181.08">So, if I were a night going into battle, the right side is the Dexter side and the left</span> <span data-start="1181.08" data-end="1183.8">side is the sinister side.</span> <span data-start="1183.8" data-end="1188.62">On a coat of arms, it looks like this, the user's right side is their Dexter side and</span> <span data-start="1188.62" data-end="1195.34">the left side is the left is the feminine and the right side is more masculine.</span> <span data-start="1195.34" data-end="1202.36">It ma tern signs go on the left.</span> <span data-start="1202.36" data-end="1208.49">They would put them together.</span> <span data-start="1208.49" data-end="1212.82">These are two coats of arms, one with Munich and one from Frankfurt.</span> <span data-start="1212.82" data-end="1216.26">If I combine them, it looks like this.</span> <span data-start="1216.26" data-end="1218.33">You lose a lot of the original design.</span> <span data-start="1218.33" data-end="1223.88">Then we get this practice called impalement, which is a form of heraldic combination or</span> <span data-start="1223.88" data-end="1225.52">marshaling of two coats of arms.</span> <span data-start="1225.52" data-end="1228.05">It's a little bit more nuanced.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1228.05" data-end="1233.75">This is an example of a composition of different symbols that I think is more effective.</span> <span data-start="1233.75" data-end="1237.66">On the left you see the three blossoms here which is representing one thing.</span> <span data-start="1237.66" data-end="1240.68">And then in the middle you have the two lions which is another house.</span> <span data-start="1240.68" data-end="1244.03">And then on the right you have the bugles and the crosses.</span> <span data-start="1244.03" data-end="1249.87">So, this is an example of how you could combine several symbols in a more thought out approach</span> <span data-start="1249.87" data-end="1253.88">that ends up being more effective than just kind of shopping them in the middle and sticking</span> <span data-start="1253.88" data-end="1254.88">them together.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1254.88" data-end="1259.29">And I think this is heavily correlated to what it's like to deal with text sometimes.</span> <span data-start="1259.29" data-end="1262.13">There's not a clean way to chop it.</span> <span data-start="1262.13" data-end="1266.53">Often you have to think carefully about composing elements.</span> <span data-start="1266.53" data-end="1272.66">And the bottom line it's hard, often it can be like the diary page with text everywhere.</span> <span data-start="1272.66" data-end="1275.77">There's no one size fits all solution.</span> <span data-start="1275.77" data-end="1280.63">Specialization will be necessary in your approach.</span> <span data-start="1280.63" data-end="1287.99">To wrap up, if you take anything away from this talk, try and favor simplicity over complexity.</span> <span data-start="1287.99" data-end="1292.63">It's a good idea to accomplish familiar frameworks for your user.</span> <span data-start="1292.63" data-end="1296.011">And consider the meaning that your symbols might have, particularly for people from a</span> <span data-start="1296.011" data-end="1297.42">different background.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1297.42" data-end="1302.68">So, if you take anything away, those are the three things that I would hope that you remember.</span> <span data-start="1302.68" data-end="1305.79">And, again, I did Tweet out these slides.</span> <span data-start="1305.79" data-end="1307.24">Thank you for coming.</span> <span data-start="1307.24" data-end="1313.83">And I think we'll have some time for questions.</span> </p>
