<p><span data-start="22.71" data-end="28.22">I am super excited to be following another history talk it's really relevant to hear</span> <span data-start="28.22" data-end="33.21">where we came from so we know where we're going. Like Lindsay said my name is Whitney</span> <span data-start="33.21" data-end="37.64">I am a front-end developer from Greenville South Carolina. Two of my favourite things</span> <span data-start="37.64" data-end="48.44">are JavaScript and Germany, speaking on stage here is like the best thing ever. \{applause\}</span> <span data-start="48.44" data-end="54.17">If you have any questions, you can tweet at me on Twitter I am also in German if you have</span> <span data-start="54.17" data-end="61.129">questions you can ask me in the hallway or on Twitter in German. Fortunately this talk</span> <span data-start="61.129" data-end="73.28">is in English. So, this talk is about ideas and not aesthetics. For many people it was</span> <span data-start="73.28" data-end="78.2">associated with a particular style and has a particular look. While it's true the Bauhaus</span> <span data-start="78.2" data-end="84.06">left behind a distinct visual legacy the school and its makers left behind something that’s</span> <span data-start="84.06" data-end="89.659">way more important than the visual style. That's a way of thinking. So for this talk</span> <span data-start="89.659" data-end="94.68">we'll focus a lot more on the visual or a lot less on the visual, a lot more on the</span> <span data-start="94.68" data-end="99.59">methodology and the reason behind it. In other words we're going to focus a lot more on the</span> <span data-start="99.59" data-end="106.14">what, and a lot more on the why less on the what. So because the visual legacy is also</span> <span data-start="106.14" data-end="112.119">important I have tried to include a lot of that stuff the pictures in my talk, but hopefully</span> <span data-start="112.119" data-end="116.85">you will get a picture of the idea that it's more than just this sort of look.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="116.85" data-end="122.009">So the industrialisation of the 19th century end of World War I and the dissolution of</span> <span data-start="122.009" data-end="126.159">the German monarchy brought about social political changes without with the Bauhaus would have</span> <span data-start="126.159" data-end="132.43">been pretty much inconceivable. It came about at a time when everything was changing, and</span> <span data-start="132.43" data-end="137.89">Germany was really undergoing a revolution not just in design but in the entire country.</span> <span data-start="137.89" data-end="140.69">It's something I think is really, really interesting.</span> <span data-start="140.69" data-end="147.5">At this time factories for the first time were really starting to mass distribute stuff</span> <span data-start="147.5" data-end="153.31">inexpensively in the mid-1880s but most of the stuff that was designed and produced was</span> <span data-start="153.31" data-end="158.079">of incredibly awful quality. It was that sort of throwaway produce where it was good for</span> <span data-start="158.079" data-end="163.06">a little while then all of a sudden once it broke there was no fixing it, you threw it</span> <span data-start="163.06" data-end="170.239">out. Arts & Craft movement came along said we want to switch and make something that’s</span> <span data-start="170.239" data-end="177.47">beautiful, amazing, something the complete opposite of mass produced. So in the 1860s</span> <span data-start="177.47" data-end="181.66">they started to try to reconcile decoration with design so this idea that stuff had a</span> <span data-start="181.66" data-end="189.139">lot of detail, and a lot of really beautiful surface sort of stuff on top of it. This was</span> <span data-start="189.139" data-end="196.729">something that factory made goods beforehand just plain old didn't have, and could not</span> <span data-start="196.729" data-end="198.41">reproduce.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="198.41" data-end="206.93">So the Bauhaus was formed from a merger of Saxony's Kunstschule and the Kunstgewerbeschule.</span> <span data-start="206.93" data-end="211.94">I say those in German there are no words for them in English. It basically means arts school,</span> <span data-start="211.94" data-end="220.269">the technical title was Staatliches Bauhaus Weimar, they sought to work within the limitation</span> <span data-start="220.269" data-end="225.699">of less expensive materials and really produce something that was of really, really nice</span> <span data-start="225.699" data-end="229.919">quality and it was also well designed so they hoped to bring these two ideas together and</span> <span data-start="229.919" data-end="234.53">say we can make something that is beautiful and it's functional but it's also affordable</span> <span data-start="234.53" data-end="237.229">to the everyday person.</span> <span data-start="237.229" data-end="241.299">The other thing that Gropius really tried to do was that he tried to build and shape</span> <span data-start="241.299" data-end="246.519">a new kind of designer in a human being, he thought could change the world really.</span> <span data-start="246.519" data-end="252.32">A big question I am going to ask today is how did the Bauhaus ideas and approaches stand</span> <span data-start="252.32" data-end="260">the test of time, how are they still relevant today, almost 80 years later. So this school’s</span> <span data-start="260" data-end="265.11">founder Walter Gropius like I said he hoped to create this new designer, this new human</span> <span data-start="265.11" data-end="270.389">being that could change the world. Less than four years after its founding his school was</span> <span data-start="270.389" data-end="277.12">internationally known and had become a meeting place for the European avant-garde in an industry</span> <span data-start="277.12" data-end="283.449">that’s changing and seeking the next big thing. I want to look at how almost hundred</span> <span data-start="283.449" data-end="289.52">years later the Bauhaus in this style and idea of how we design and how we write our</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="289.52" data-end="296.479">JavaScript, has sort of experience of resurgence in popularity. So to shape the new designer</span> <span data-start="296.479" data-end="301.669">envisioned by Walter Gropius, education at the Bauhaus was not just limited to academic</span> <span data-start="301.669" data-end="308.259">knowledge but they really encouraged experimentation, collaborative learning in the idea of friendly</span> <span data-start="308.259" data-end="312.27">interaction between the masters an students, so you had a lot of good stuff like Bauhaus</span> <span data-start="312.27" data-end="317.419">parties that were legendary. They had the white party, the yellow party, the red party</span> <span data-start="317.419" data-end="324.08">and I went and visited Bauhaus and you see the architecture if you see the sort of atmosphere</span> <span data-start="324.08" data-end="330.139">that they believed it's incredible how everything that came into not just a school and learning</span> <span data-start="330.139" data-end="335.52">and ok sitting in a classroom but really a lifestyle. It was incredibly interesting how</span> <span data-start="335.52" data-end="339.08">they did it, and did it very differently.</span> <span data-start="339.08" data-end="345.979">Unfortunately, I think a hundred years later our industry has lost its way, unlike the</span> <span data-start="345.979" data-end="351.889">Bauhaus where they try to create this collaborative movement and lifestyle, we have really gone</span> <span data-start="351.889" data-end="356.289">off the rails and far from cultivating friendly interaction we really are struggling as a</span> <span data-start="356.289" data-end="361.379">community to build a welcoming, cohesive community. Instead a lot of the time we're building up</span> <span data-start="361.379" data-end="366.409">barriers that are not just senseless but they stand in the way of real progress. We tend</span> <span data-start="366.409" data-end="369.979">to sort of surround ourselves with people who think like us, they look like us, they</span> <span data-start="369.979" data-end="375.469">talk like us, we end up seeking out inspiration within our tiny circle — that's a huge mistake.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="375.469" data-end="383.68">One of the most, I guess important for me, personal sort of struggles in the JavaScript</span> <span data-start="383.68" data-end="388.759">community is this which is the ridiculous split between designers and developers. It's</span> <span data-start="388.759" data-end="396.77">really, really harmful, thinking we can do stuff together so rather than collaborate</span> <span data-start="396.77" data-end="405.189">\{applause\} so rather than collaborating to achieve common goals, designers and developers</span> <span data-start="405.189" data-end="410.379">I think a lot of times really feel like hey we're on competing teams, we're fighting against</span> <span data-start="410.379" data-end="414.87">each other and we can't come together and say hey, you know what at end of the day all</span> <span data-start="414.87" data-end="421.37">we want to do is ship a product, and that goes together, we're all in this together.</span> <span data-start="421.37" data-end="424.699">This uneasiness, it stands in the way of successful</span> <span data-start="424.699" data-end="429.84">collaboration. In reality the principles of good design often mirror those of good development.</span> <span data-start="429.84" data-end="435.539">So while it can be said that the school and its masters issued this harmonious atmosphere</span> <span data-start="435.539" data-end="444.599">that Gropius set forth in his Bauhaus manifesto back in 1919, instead the Bauhaus was incredibly</span> <span data-start="444.599" data-end="451.68">progressive for its time and Gropius believed that through the process of modernisation</span> <span data-start="451.68" data-end="457.24">he could master that via design and that the arts and crafts would form the foundation</span> <span data-start="457.24" data-end="462.05">of all activity, and so he really wanted to bring everything together sort of under one</span> <span data-start="462.05" data-end="467.479">umbrella. Unlike the European arts schools of the time he actually — which typically</span> <span data-start="467.479" data-end="472.949">taught art and design as 2 totally separate subjects never together the Bauhaus decided</span> <span data-start="472.949" data-end="477.939">to bring those 2 together and reverse the split between art and production which up</span> <span data-start="477.939" data-end="482.419">until that point really had not been done, it was either you were a fine artist or a</span> <span data-start="482.419" data-end="487.259">designer, and never both that's something that's really, really interesting the idea</span> <span data-start="487.259" data-end="496.409">that hey we do have roots in fine arts and craft it's something that’s very important.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="496.409" data-end="501.849">So the struggle to reconcile the fine arts that was happening back then in the early</span> <span data-start="501.849" data-end="506.979">20th century that really for me mirrors our development community struggle to reconcile</span> <span data-start="506.979" data-end="512.729">code with design. A lot of times we sort of we blame the complexity of modern websites</span> <span data-start="512.729" data-end="519.61">or apps, we say we really need an increasing amount of specialisation from today's designers</span> <span data-start="519.61" data-end="525.86">and developers and we forget that even back then, there was this huge challenge of physical</span> <span data-start="525.86" data-end="533.21">architecture and building and similarly we still face the same kinds of challenges. It's</span> <span data-start="533.21" data-end="535.4">still difficult.</span> <span data-start="535.4" data-end="540.16">I think that the way that we fix this, is to move away from tiny circles, we move away</span> <span data-start="540.16" data-end="545.64">from picking sides, we move away and we shape and create a community that we can be proud</span> <span data-start="545.64" data-end="550.35">of and that's going to be a community where developers and designers they really work</span> <span data-start="550.35" data-end="557.32">with each other, instead of against each other. I think that is the first step for me.</span> <span data-start="557.32" data-end="564.89">So in the Bauhaus in order to prepare students that introduced a foundation called Liberate</span> <span data-start="564.89" data-end="570.03">the People individually from the dead weight of convention, he really wanted to get away</span> <span data-start="570.03" data-end="577.18">from all the Old Masters stuff and so the course, the foundation course the The Vorkurs</span> <span data-start="577.18" data-end="584.92">was originally taught by Johannes Itten, it uses eccentric Swiss painter guy his aim was</span> <span data-start="584.92" data-end="589.77">to form the creative individual so for the first time instead of looking at the Old Masters</span> <span data-start="589.77" data-end="595.03">works then just copying them it was like hey ok let's look at these works and tell a sort</span> <span data-start="595.03" data-end="601.04">of what is happening here, let's learn form, let's learn colour, composition, let's learn</span> <span data-start="601.04" data-end="605.89">all of these things that the masters are teaching us but instead of copying that work let's</span> <span data-start="605.89" data-end="610.81">just go ahead an say I am going to take my inspiration from this but I am going to make</span> <span data-start="610.81" data-end="617.69">something myself. So I am going to learn by creating and not by copying.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="617.69" data-end="627.41">So, by 1923 Gropius had started to shift his ideas a little bit. Itten, said he was a bit</span> <span data-start="627.41" data-end="633.78">of a weird guy, his increasing focus on individual artistic expression as well as his involvement</span> <span data-start="633.78" data-end="642.95">in this religious group/cult called the Mazdaznan religious group, started to irritate Gropius,</span> <span data-start="642.95" data-end="643.7">went a little bit off the</span> <span data-start="643.7" data-end="651">rails. Gropius desired a more intense collaboration with technology, he really wanted to make</span> <span data-start="651" data-end="656.87">that the focus, and so it was dismissed and instead they transferred the leadership of</span> <span data-start="656.87" data-end="666.71">the Vorkurs to 2 new people, Josef Albers and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, integration of designed</span> <span data-start="666.71" data-end="673.07">technology and industrial production, this course in the The Vorkurs become one of the</span> <span data-start="673.07" data-end="681.44">Bauhaus most defining pedagogical features, it still exists in many design schools today,</span> <span data-start="681.44" data-end="685.22">it's something that really changed the way we think about design the way that we teach</span> <span data-start="685.22" data-end="692.57">design and it's still incredibly relevant. The other thing that they came up with was</span> <span data-start="692.57" data-end="696.78">this idea that form follows function, the quote itself ‘form follows function’ was</span> <span data-start="696.78" data-end="700.65">actually from an American it's not from the Bauhaus, which is why I didn't put it in the</span> <span data-start="700.65" data-end="707.38">slides, but yeah, so this idea that everything has a purpose.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="707.38" data-end="714.96">So after this increasing political and economic pressure from the conservative parties forced</span> <span data-start="714.96" data-end="720.94">the Bauhaus out of Weimer, they needed to find a new location. So in 1925 the school</span> <span data-start="720.94" data-end="725.97">relocated to Dessau, they have an incredible museum I would really recommend you all go</span> <span data-start="725.97" data-end="731.06">to if you are all interested. The one here in Berlin is unfortunately a) not friendly</span> <span data-start="731.06" data-end="740.19">and b) not interesting. \{laughter\}, so it's here in Dessau that Gropius founded the new</span> <span data-start="740.19" data-end="747.7">building so he also built houses for the Bauhaus teachers essentially to live in, these are</span> <span data-start="747.7" data-end="755.99">called Meisterhauser. They all interact with these building significant interest from inside</span> <span data-start="755.99" data-end="763.37">Germany itself but also from abroad. As industrial output grows the German population become</span> <span data-start="763.37" data-end="772.6">a lot more urbanised, they starting living more cities. They focused on industrial mass</span> <span data-start="772.6" data-end="778.81">production and technology, for him technology was incredibly important, he had an almost</span> <span data-start="778.81" data-end="785.66">singular focus on this. A lot of the time contemporaries are like we really think this</span> <span data-start="785.66" data-end="792.05">is a mistake, looking back in retrospective is this stubborn quality that made the Bauhaus</span> <span data-start="792.05" data-end="799.72">this revolutionary, this embracing of technology, this embracing of change saying we know this</span> <span data-start="799.72" data-end="803.91">is different we don't care, we're going to do it anyway, we think it’s the right thing</span> <span data-start="803.91" data-end="805.49">to do.</span> <span data-start="805.49" data-end="810.97">Similarly the modern web is evolving at a super, super incredibly fast rate. We either</span> <span data-start="810.97" data-end="815.06">face this challenge of we're going to adapt or we're going to be left behind</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="815.06" data-end="820.81">Listening to a lot of the other talks, that talk about yes, 2015, it's pretty obvious</span> <span data-start="820.81" data-end="827.07">if you don't talk about this stuff now you don't have a career as a JavaScripter, two</span> <span data-start="827.07" data-end="832.44">years from now, certainly not ten years from now, that's something we really need to take</span> <span data-start="832.44" data-end="833.79">into consideration.</span> <span data-start="833.79" data-end="839.97">So JavaScript developers are seeking to push the boundaries of the web, developing new</span> <span data-start="839.97" data-end="846.91">experiences that weren't possible a few years ago, not even popular or possible a couple</span> <span data-start="846.91" data-end="853.72">of months back we complain a lot about oh my God we really have to learn the new frameworks,</span> <span data-start="853.72" data-end="859.79">learn to build the new features and tools, we have to look at applications, there is</span> <span data-start="859.79" data-end="866.42">so much stuff to get through and we complain a lot. Whoops..</span> <span data-start="866.42" data-end="872.01">One thing I think that we kind of forget is that being revolutionary means taking risks,</span> <span data-start="872.01" data-end="878.16">it means challenging ourselves and saying, hey, we are ready for this. It's easy to forget</span> <span data-start="878.16" data-end="880.54">that the challenges we face today are not</span> <span data-start="880.54" data-end="886.16">linked to us and our culture and our time, they're actually — they are very different</span> <span data-start="886.16" data-end="890.48">to the challenges that Gropius faced, but at the same time they are also incredibly</span> <span data-start="890.48" data-end="896.66">similar, we are facing the pressure to go forward, to reinvent ourselves to keep making,</span> <span data-start="896.66" data-end="904.63">to keep doing, to always sort of churning out new work, it's exhausting, it was exhausting</span> <span data-start="904.63" data-end="911.01">back then and it's exhausting now, but it's something that we just can't get around.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="911.01" data-end="918.18">So, the real question then is how do we sort of avoid burn out, what can we do that's meaningful</span> <span data-start="918.18" data-end="923.81">and worthwhile? These are problems that are really hard to solve, because for everyone</span> <span data-start="923.81" data-end="929.4">it's incredibly different, there is no one solution that we can fix for everybody, but</span> <span data-start="929.4" data-end="934.57">what we need to remember is that progress and not perfection is our goal. You just need</span> <span data-start="934.57" data-end="941.05">to, we need to try it, we need to keep moving forward. It's not an end game thing. There</span> <span data-start="941.05" data-end="944.14">is always going to be something new to learn.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="944.14" data-end="950.29">So, Gropius actually, he really failed to realise the idealistic dreams that he had</span> <span data-start="950.29" data-end="956.61">in his opening manifesto, but his influence is still really incredibly strong today, almost</span> <span data-start="956.61" data-end="962.29">100 years later and the way of thinking that he left behind is enormously influential not</span> <span data-start="962.29" data-end="968.65">just in the fields of education and architecture but also in design and development.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="968.65" data-end="977.55">So, umm.. like I said, there were three leaders of the Bauhaus, each of the Bauhaus directors</span> <span data-start="977.55" data-end="983.74">worked to change and change the world of design in its section in the world in its own way,</span> <span data-start="983.74" data-end="989.23">Gropius seeked to close the gap between the artist and the citizen to bring art to every</span> <span data-start="989.23" data-end="997.92">burn he wanted to make well designed products available to the masses. The was Hannes Meyer,</span> <span data-start="997.92" data-end="1002.53">you won't find out about him in the history books, it's starting to change more, he was</span> <span data-start="1002.53" data-end="1009.66">politically unsavoury at the time, eventually thrown out, interesting his time as Director</span> <span data-start="1009.66" data-end="1016">of the Bauhaus he tried to bring to the forefront the social aspect of designs and provide goods</span> <span data-start="1016" data-end="1024.01">for the people rather than the luxury. The final Director of the Bauhaus, refers to a</span> <span data-start="1024.01" data-end="1032.78">lot of what Meyer said, he was politically not savoury at the time, umm.. so Ludwig</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1032.78" data-end="1039.47">Mies van der Rohe, so he reversed a lot of the decisions and refocused the school back</span> <span data-start="1039.47" data-end="1047.339">to architecture, in particular the connection between building technology and aesthetics,</span> <span data-start="1047.339" data-end="1051.57">the students stood that forefront of the industry and they believed they could use technology</span> <span data-start="1051.57" data-end="1058.36">to make the world better. For them the idea of acceptability enjoyed a much broader context,</span> <span data-start="1058.36" data-end="1067.12">back then it meant just something was accessible period, available period. Now we sort of have</span> <span data-start="1067.12" data-end="1073.24">this period of acceptability being with a screen or being with a particular device,</span> <span data-start="1073.24" data-end="1079.309">that's true now in the modern context, but really at its core we assume that people have</span> <span data-start="1079.309" data-end="1085.149">these devices and these screens, but at the same time it's really, really important that</span> <span data-start="1085.149" data-end="1090.7">we remember that we're not supporting devices, we're not supporting screens, we're not supporting</span> <span data-start="1090.7" data-end="1096.08">things, we are supporting people. I think that's, that's very different from this idea</span> <span data-start="1096.08" data-end="1100.7">of — I'm going to do something that works on every product, what you really want to</span> <span data-start="1100.7" data-end="1107.35">do is build something that is accessible by every individual person.</span> <span data-start="1107.35" data-end="1112.999">So, for Gropius leading the Bauhaus was an incredibly exhausting and he leaned a lot</span> <span data-start="1112.999" data-end="1119.48">on the Masters of form, the teachers at the Bauhaus, initially this sort of struggle of</span> <span data-start="1119.48" data-end="1121.62">keeping the Bauhaus alive especially in</span> <span data-start="1121.62" data-end="1127.289">Germany at a time when things were falling apart all over the place, was incredibly just</span> <span data-start="1127.289" data-end="1135.19">awful and it brought them together, originally, but conflict sort of, it.. it builds on itself,</span> <span data-start="1135.19" data-end="1141.07">it gets worse. Unfortunately the sort of collaborative spirit that Gropius tried to build in the</span> <span data-start="1141.07" data-end="1148.21">beginning started to fall apart, so it was exacerbated by the constant shift on teachers,</span> <span data-start="1148.21" data-end="1153.409">the politically scene was very radical in Germany and also very owe pre-sieve, it led</span> <span data-start="1153.409" data-end="1161.11">to an erosion of passion and collaborativeness, people stopped wanting to work together, instead</span> <span data-start="1161.11" data-end="1168.49">things fell apart around Gropius and eventually he left. During his time leading the Bauhaus,</span> <span data-start="1168.49" data-end="1175.539">he wanted to create this, you know, hey we're all in this together. It was probably really</span> <span data-start="1175.539" data-end="1183.669">influenced by his time in the organisation called the Deutsche Werkbund, for the rest</span> <span data-start="1183.669" data-end="1189.909">of his career, looking back at the Bauhaus, thing, "Wow, I tried hard", things really</span> <span data-start="1189.909" data-end="1200.72">fell apart, he started to value the I'd of partnership over individual so he said this</span> <span data-start="1200.72" data-end="1205.019">was something that really affected him for the rest of his career.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1205.019" data-end="1210.129">So, almost 90 years since the closing of the Bauhaus we are still confronting the same</span> <span data-start="1210.129" data-end="1215.999">exhaustion, the same idea of, we're not as enthusiastic sometimes as we used to be when</span> <span data-start="1215.999" data-end="1220.679">we are building things. Like the Masters, we struggle to balance our desire for praise,</span> <span data-start="1220.679" data-end="1227.32">the idea that we personally built the whole thing, that we personally tried some new technology,</span> <span data-start="1227.32" data-end="1232.679">we struggle to work together to accomplish something as a team, this frenetic pace of</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1232.679" data-end="1238.529">JavaScript development today makes the situation worse, we have to master new technology and</span> <span data-start="1238.529" data-end="1244.32">support an ever expanding array of devices, a lot of times it's just exhausting, we feel</span> <span data-start="1244.32" data-end="1251.269">overwhelmed, exhausted sometimes both, sometimes we are faced with the decision to become specialists</span> <span data-start="1251.269" data-end="1258.61">or generalists, we can't possibly learn everything, it's really frustrating. So I think what we</span> <span data-start="1258.61" data-end="1263.799">should do is look back at what Gropius did and say, hey, what we really need to do is</span> <span data-start="1263.799" data-end="1270.96">establish a set of guiding principles that will guide our community. When we look back</span> <span data-start="1270.96" data-end="1275.36">and we look at what Gropius achieved, you know, he really didn't achieve his initial</span> <span data-start="1275.36" data-end="1281.639">vision what he set out to do, what he set out to do isn't in the history books. Even</span> <span data-start="1281.639" data-end="1285.429">after the Bauhaus closed the students and teachers emigrated all around the world and</span> <span data-start="1285.429" data-end="1287.409">took the ideas with them.</span> <span data-start="1287.409" data-end="1294.809">So where does it leave us, what does this walk through history show us? Gropius developed</span> <span data-start="1294.809" data-end="1300.539">this new technology of mass produce with beauty and functionality, he said the final goals</span> <span data-start="1300.539" data-end="1308.35">of artistic activity is architecture, what I want to say is that for him buildings, they</span> <span data-start="1308.35" data-end="1313.999">represented the coming together of knowledge, inspiration and he referred to this by a German</span> <span data-start="1313.999" data-end="1323.419">word Gesamtkunstwerk, so, what I think is really cool, is to think that the web is Gesamtkunstwerk,</span> <span data-start="1323.419" data-end="1328.289">it's this coming together of all of the things, it's our product, it's are culture, it's our</span> <span data-start="1328.289" data-end="1334.86">industry. We're not likely to leave behind physical sort of remnant, the architecture</span> <span data-start="1334.86" data-end="1340.679">of the buildings like the Bauhaus was, but 80 years from now, 100 years from now, when</span> <span data-start="1340.679" data-end="1348.049">they look at us and they say, "What did the JavaScript developers of 2015 leave behind?"</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1348.049" data-end="1354.749">It's actually our culture, the way we build things, the way we work with people and not</span> <span data-start="1354.749" data-end="1360.019">the actual things that we leave behind, I want our legacy to be something we are truly</span> <span data-start="1360.019" data-end="1364.09">proud of.</span> </p>
