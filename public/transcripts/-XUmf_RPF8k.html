<p><span data-start="388.12" data-end="391.25">But the elephant in the room that I have to mention to you, because we're</span> <span data-start="391.25" data-end="395.479">talking about automated accessibility testing, is that it is no substitute for</span> <span data-start="395.479" data-end="397.62">real user feedback.</span> <span data-start="397.62" data-end="399.09">Including people with disabilities.</span> <span data-start="399.09" data-end="401.66">You want to have people testing your apps so that they can</span> <span data-start="401.66" data-end="403.65">tell you when something really sucks.</span> <span data-start="403.65" data-end="406.789">Like Peter Griffin saying what really grinds his gears.</span> <span data-start="406.789" data-end="409.15">Because that feedback is so valuable.</span> <span data-start="409.15" data-end="412.26">So that should be part of your strategy as well.</span> <span data-start="412.26" data-end="415.139">And even getting to accessibility earlier in the</span> <span data-start="415.139" data-end="417.139">design process, too.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="417.139" data-end="418.569">Those are all very important things.</span> <span data-start="418.569" data-end="421.19">But we're here to talk about automated testing.</span> <span data-start="421.19" data-end="424.569">Which is an important thing to know how to do.</span> <span data-start="424.569" data-end="428.199">So the first thing that I do, when I look at a website to figure out what the</span> <span data-start="428.199" data-end="433.039">accessibility situation is  —  I just tab through the page with the keyboard.</span> <span data-start="433.039" data-end="434.2">So we're going to do that real quick.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="434.2" data-end="439.819">I'm going to show you gov.uk, which has pretty good focus styles, solid blocks of</span> <span data-start="439.819" data-end="446.479">color, the text links are either bolded with blue text or bold with white text,</span> <span data-start="446.479" data-end="452.08">and if we start tabbing through the page, the focus indicator is really obvious.</span> <span data-start="452.08" data-end="456.099">It's orange color on whatever the other background color is.</span> <span data-start="456.099" data-end="461.13">And it actually really shows you effectively where you are on a web page.</span> <span data-start="461.13" data-end="466.83">It has been pointed out to me that this is technically not WCAG AA compliant.</span> <span data-start="466.83" data-end="470.04">And that's because there isn't quite enough visual contrast to meet that</span> <span data-start="470.04" data-end="471.069">standard.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="471.069" data-end="475.539">But what they could do to fix it is either widen the visual contrast</span> <span data-start="475.539" data-end="478.789">between the foreground and background colors, or you could make the text</span> <span data-start="478.789" data-end="479.789">bigger.</span> <span data-start="479.789" data-end="482.79">So you have some things that you can do to fix this.</span> <span data-start="482.79" data-end="486.33">But compared to most websites, gov.uk is awesome, and it's</span> <span data-start="486.33" data-end="487.82">winning the focus style..</span> <span data-start="487.82" data-end="491.61">Like, they do it the best of any site I've seen.</span> <span data-start="491.61" data-end="494.699">So they deserve a pat on the back.</span> <span data-start="494.699" data-end="496.099">Okay.</span> <span data-start="496.099" data-end="497.599">So that's the first thing I do.</span> <span data-start="497.599" data-end="501.68">The next thing I do  —  which I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time on  —  but</span> <span data-start="501.68" data-end="503.93">you should be demoing in screen readers.</span> <span data-start="503.93" data-end="509.42">I'm going to show you SoundCloud in Safari with VoiceOver on the Mac.</span> <span data-start="509.42" data-end="512.219">But it's not the most used screen reader.</span> <span data-start="512.219" data-end="515.56">JAWS is the most used.</span> <span data-start="515.56" data-end="519.06">NVDA and Firefox are well used.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="690.74" data-end="695.27">So next I want to tell you about the Chrome accessibility developer tools.</span> <span data-start="695.27" data-end="698.36">It's a must have for any well developer these days.</span> <span data-start="698.36" data-end="703">It's great for checking the overall page accessibility for any website.</span> <span data-start="703" data-end="705.529">Especially in active development.</span> <span data-start="705.529" data-end="709.14">It catches kind of the low hanging fruit of things that you  — </span> <span data-start="709.14" data-end="710.93">like missing labels and things.</span> <span data-start="710.93" data-end="714.3">So let's go check out an audit.</span> <span data-start="714.3" data-end="715.899">Okay.</span> <span data-start="715.899" data-end="717.5">So..</span> <span data-start="717.5" data-end="719.56">I'm going to pick on CNN today.</span> <span data-start="719.56" data-end="723.48">Let's go see what crusty accessibility things they have going on.</span> <span data-start="723.48" data-end="725.149">So I'm going to open up the dev tools.</span> <span data-start="725.149" data-end="727.09">And I have the extension installed.</span> <span data-start="727.09" data-end="732.53">So under audits, I get an accessibility audit, which I can go and run, and it will</span> <span data-start="732.53" data-end="737.329">go and it will look at their site, analyze it, run tests against it, and it will</span> <span data-start="737.329" data-end="739.6">report back to you what's wrong with it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="739.6" data-end="742.36">So they are missing a bunch of form labels.</span> <span data-start="742.36" data-end="746.32">If I drill down into it, I can look at the specific node that is a</span> <span data-start="746.32" data-end="747.32">problem.</span> <span data-start="747.32" data-end="751.829">I can review it in the elements panel, and go over here in the element</span> <span data-start="751.829" data-end="752.829">inspector.</span> <span data-start="752.829" data-end="753.829">You get a couple little add-ons.</span> <span data-start="753.829" data-end="757.23">Actually, with the extension, you get this accessibility</span> <span data-start="757.23" data-end="758.72">properties panel.</span> <span data-start="758.72" data-end="762.39">And it will show you some of the accessibility information.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="762.39" data-end="766.92">I'm using Chrome Canary, which actually has a dev tools experiment.</span> <span data-start="766.92" data-end="770.47">If you're curious, I can send you the information later.</span> <span data-start="770.47" data-end="772.959">Because it's sort of hard to enable.</span> <span data-start="772.959" data-end="776.3">But the deal is that this extension will be moved into the dev tools</span> <span data-start="776.3" data-end="777.3">at some point.</span> <span data-start="777.3" data-end="779.389">And Google is working on that right now.</span> <span data-start="779.389" data-end="782.74">But if you have it enabled in Chrome Canary, you get this secret</span> <span data-start="782.74" data-end="786.779">panel of extra information of the accessibility node.</span> <span data-start="786.779" data-end="789.36">And this will tell you what role it has, if it has any</span> <span data-start="789.36" data-end="793.98">ARIA attributes, and so on.</span> <span data-start="793.98" data-end="796.25">That highlights an important concept that I want you to know.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="796.25" data-end="798.46">Which is about the accessibility tree.</span> <span data-start="798.46" data-end="800.74">The accessibility tree is something created by</span> <span data-start="800.74" data-end="801.74">browsers.</span> <span data-start="801.74" data-end="803.67">It is a parallel structure to the DOM.</span> <span data-start="803.67" data-end="807.02">And it has in it semantic information that screen readers and other</span> <span data-start="807.02" data-end="811.97">assistive technologies can use to present information without the performance</span> <span data-start="811.97" data-end="814.85">implications of everything else in the DOM.</span> <span data-start="814.85" data-end="818.6">So the accessibility tree you can check a couple different ways.</span> <span data-start="818.6" data-end="822.769">If you go to Chrome://accessibility, you can</span> <span data-start="822.769" data-end="826.74">look at a raw dump of the accessibility tree of every tab that you have</span> <span data-start="826.74" data-end="827.74">open.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="843.23" data-end="846.16">But when I first got into the Chrome accessibility developer</span> <span data-start="846.16" data-end="850.48">tools I found on Github that all the library code is out there under the</span> <span data-start="850.48" data-end="856.91">Google Chrome organization on Github, down to every audit rule as a JavaScript</span> <span data-start="856.91" data-end="857.91">file.</span> <span data-start="857.91" data-end="859.69">And I didn't quite know what those were for.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="859.69" data-end="863.589">I felt like Finn from Adventure Time going  —  what do you do with those?</span> <span data-start="863.589" data-end="866.37">Well, that's where we get into definitely automated testing.</span> <span data-start="866.37" data-end="871.769">I'm going to start by showing you a tool called a11y.</span> <span data-start="871.769" data-end="874.17">It's a numeronym for accessibility.</span> <span data-start="874.17" data-end="877.29">You take out all the numbers and add 11 in the middle.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="877.29" data-end="880.26">You see me tweeting that all the time because it's shorter.</span> <span data-start="880.26" data-end="884.1">But they made a really great NPM module.</span> <span data-start="884.1" data-end="892.72">You can install it with a11y, and you get this tool where you can call the same</span> <span data-start="892.72" data-end="896.71">audit that we ran in the browser from the command line.</span> <span data-start="896.71" data-end="899.35">So I'm going to show you this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="899.35" data-end="902.019">Instead of pulling it into a JavaScript file, we're just going to</span> <span data-start="902.019" data-end="903.699">run it from the command line.</span> <span data-start="903.699" data-end="909.1">So I'm going to type a11y cnn.com and then we're</span> <span data-start="909.1" data-end="911.07">going to wait and hope that it resolves.</span> <span data-start="911.07" data-end="912.39">It takes a second.</span> <span data-start="912.39" data-end="915.209">It's a little bit longer than the browser extension.</span> <span data-start="915.209" data-end="919.579">But this is using phantom.js, which is a headless browser.</span> <span data-start="919.579" data-end="921.209">So we're not seeing the browser open.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="921.209" data-end="925.64">This is running on the command line, using phantom, hitting their site, and returning</span> <span data-start="925.64" data-end="927.79">an audit back to us.</span> <span data-start="927.79" data-end="929.589">Hopefully this will work.</span> <span data-start="929.589" data-end="932.839">Hello, conference Wi-Fi.</span> <span data-start="932.839" data-end="937.779">So the audit that it gave back to us was the same audit that we got in the browser</span> <span data-start="937.779" data-end="940.96">extension, except this is on the command line.</span> <span data-start="940.96" data-end="945.36">So I find that this report is a little bit harder to digest than</span> <span data-start="945.36" data-end="947.42">the browser extension.</span> <span data-start="947.42" data-end="949.45">But you can see that it tells you the same warnings.</span> <span data-start="949.45" data-end="952.79">It says the controls and media elements should have labels.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="952.79" data-end="957.019">And then it points you to a node in the DOM tree.</span> <span data-start="957.019" data-end="964.38">It actually shows you the tree of items, selectors, that it actually</span> <span data-start="964.38" data-end="967.92">used to point you to that node in the browser.</span> <span data-start="967.92" data-end="969.399">So this is pretty cool.</span> <span data-start="969.399" data-end="972.589">But I'm not quite sure how I would use this in a project</span> <span data-start="972.589" data-end="973.589">yet.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="973.589" data-end="979.85">I will add that there is a grunt task for a11y that could be useful.</span> <span data-start="979.85" data-end="983.4">Ways that you could integrate automated testing for accessibility.</span> <span data-start="983.4" data-end="985.86">What if you ran it on every save?</span> <span data-start="985.86" data-end="988.18">So that you could check whether something was inaccessible?</span> <span data-start="988.18" data-end="990.49">It might be a little aggressive.</span> <span data-start="990.49" data-end="992.459">But you could also run it on every commit.</span> <span data-start="992.459" data-end="996.13">Maybe you wanted to check that you had a pre-commit hook for</span> <span data-start="996.13" data-end="999.42">git, and you could check whether something is broken.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="999.42" data-end="1002.149">More likely, you're going to run it on a deployment.</span> <span data-start="1002.149" data-end="1006.36">If you push out a build that's broken, I'm either not going to let it go forward or I</span> <span data-start="1006.36" data-end="1010.48">can use Travis on Github to say  —  hey, the build is broken and that person broke</span> <span data-start="1010.48" data-end="1012.899">it.</span> <span data-start="1012.899" data-end="1016.199">Which leads us to protractor, the end to end testing framework</span> <span data-start="1016.199" data-end="1017.42">for Angular.</span> <span data-start="1017.42" data-end="1020">I'm focusing on this because I worked on it, but the concepts are</span> <span data-start="1020" data-end="1022.769">similar for any framework.</span> <span data-start="1022.769" data-end="1029.15">Protractor is a node module that runs on top of Selenium web driver.</span> <span data-start="1029.15" data-end="1031.66">It fires up a browser programmatically, you tell it</span> <span data-start="1031.66" data-end="1037.579">where to go, and you set up your website so you can run tests against it and</span> <span data-start="1037.579" data-end="1040.949">assert that it's doing the right thing at the right time.</span> <span data-start="1040.949" data-end="1043.65">I wrote an accessibility plug-in for protractor that</span> <span data-start="1043.65" data-end="1046.22">I'll tell you about a little bit.</span> <span data-start="1046.22" data-end="1050.02">But protractor would be really useful  —  it's what's called end to end</span> <span data-start="1050.02" data-end="1051.02">testing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1051.02" data-end="1055.84">It's useful for testing multiple components on a page together, as</span> <span data-start="1055.84" data-end="1058.84">opposed to unit testing, which we'll talk about in a minute.</span> <span data-start="1058.84" data-end="1062.28">But some things that you could test for include focus management.</span> <span data-start="1062.28" data-end="1066.29">Like if you are writing a single page or client rendered app.</span> <span data-start="1066.29" data-end="1068.08">You could check for live updates.</span> <span data-start="1068.08" data-end="1072.14">Like, say your focus is in an input field, and the</span> <span data-start="1072.14" data-end="1075.72">act of typing filter something somewhere else on the screen  —  you want to</span> <span data-start="1075.72" data-end="1078.169">make sure those components are working together.</span> <span data-start="1078.169" data-end="1081.38">That might be a good thing to test for with end to end</span> <span data-start="1081.38" data-end="1082.38">testing.</span> <span data-start="1082.38" data-end="1083.38">Or color contrast.</span> <span data-start="1083.38" data-end="1084.92">Maybe you want to check the color contrast across</span> <span data-start="1084.92" data-end="1085.92">your whole app.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1110.13" data-end="1111.13">It's pretty simple.</span> <span data-start="1111.13" data-end="1117.85">It only has one view.</span> <span data-start="1117.85" data-end="1120.669">It has a list of users on the left site nav and when you</span> <span data-start="1120.669" data-end="1126.11">click on one, it opens the specific view in the primary column on the right.</span> <span data-start="1126.11" data-end="1129.809">There's a little share button, and if you tap that, it will open a bottom</span> <span data-start="1129.809" data-end="1134.78">sheet, which is kind of like a dialogue, in that it opens on top of things.</span> <span data-start="1134.78" data-end="1138.27">But it is a sort of drawer that comes up from the bottom.</span> <span data-start="1138.27" data-end="1141.19">It's kind of a mobile pattern in material design.</span> <span data-start="1141.19" data-end="1144.82">The idea with this, though, is that it is an interim element.</span> <span data-start="1144.82" data-end="1148.1">And so when it opens, for a keyboard user or a screen reader</span> <span data-start="1148.1" data-end="1150.15">user, we want to send our focus there.</span> <span data-start="1150.15" data-end="1154.26">Both so that they are alerted to new content, but also so their focus</span> <span data-start="1154.26" data-end="1157.64">is in the general location of this new content.</span> <span data-start="1157.64" data-end="1159.98">This would be a perfect thing to write a test for.</span> <span data-start="1159.98" data-end="1163.57">I want to assert that the first button in the bottom</span> <span data-start="1163.57" data-end="1165.32">sheet has focus.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1471.98" data-end="1475.22">Things you could test are  —  ARIA properties that need to change</span> <span data-start="1475.22" data-end="1479.39">with user interaction, keyboard operability, to make sure that tab</span> <span data-start="1479.39" data-end="1482.82">index is enabled, and keyboard commands work.</span> <span data-start="1482.82" data-end="1486.22">Text alternatives, making sure, for example, if you had an icon</span> <span data-start="1486.22" data-end="1490.241">button, and you wanted to make sure that it had a label, or it fell back to a</span> <span data-start="1490.241" data-end="1494.36">label or something  —  semantics as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1494.36" data-end="1498.02">So unit testing is a really great way  —  if you're not already doing unit testing,</span> <span data-start="1498.02" data-end="1499.559">you should be.</span> <span data-start="1499.559" data-end="1501.34">That's what I went to learn at my last job.</span> <span data-start="1501.34" data-end="1504.6">But accessibility fits in with that so well, because</span> <span data-start="1504.6" data-end="1508.43">you all of a sudden have test coverage across your whole app for</span> <span data-start="1508.43" data-end="1510.27">accessibility.</span> </p>
