data-start="1637.27" data-end="1639.34">shrink first it's gonna keep shrinking</span> <span data-start="1639.34" data-end="1642.1">until it hits its minimum size before</span> <span data-start="1642.1" data-end="1644.41">space starts taking getting taken away</span> <span data-start="1644.41" data-end="1647.92">from Otto so that's the difference in</span> <span data-start="1647.92" data-end="1649.21">the behavior at the end of the day they</span> <span data-start="1649.21" data-end="1651.31">all still shrink to a minimum size of</span> <span data-start="1651.31" data-end="1654.76">main content but the Otto will hold its</span> <span data-start="1654.76" data-end="1657.28">width while all the free space is</span> <span data-start="1657.28" data-end="1660.13">absorbed and taken away by fr sized</span> <span data-start="1660.13" data-end="1662.86">columns first that's the one thing to</span> <span data-start="1662.86" data-end="1665.62">keep in mind the second set of values</span> <span data-start="1665.62" data-end="1667.57">that I want to compare is actually fit</span> <span data-start="1667.57" data-end="1670.12">content and min content so again it's</span> <span data-start="1670.12" data-end="1673.81">orange versus gold so fit content and</span> <span data-start="1673.81" data-end="1676.09">min max actually behave very similarly</span> <span data-start="1676.09" data-end="1678.22">in that they are both a range of values</span> <span data-start="1678.22" data-end="1681.34">with a minimum and a maximum limit so</span> <span data-start="1681.34" data-end="1683.41">min max takes two arguments as you can</span> <span data-start="1683.41" data-end="1685.87">see here I've set it to a minimum size</span> <span data-start="1685.87" data-end="1688.96">of 200 a maximum size of 400 and we've</span> <span data-start="1688.96" data-end="1690.58">also covered what fit content does</span> <span data-start="1690.58" data-end="1692.62">earlier so I'm not gonna talk about that</span> <span data-start="1692.62" data-end="1695.65">so let's just do this resizing thing</span> <span data-start="1695.65" data-end="1697.9">again because isn't this what everybody</span> <span data-start="1697.9" data-end="1699.73">does now I'm just kidding so when</span> <span data-start="1699.73" data-end="1701.62">there's a lot of space fr just takes up</span> <span data-start="1701.62" data-end="1702.97">everything I think we've already</span> <span data-start="1702.97" data-end="1706.78">established that but when there isn't</span> <span data-start="1706.78" data-end="1709">enough space again fr is the first to</span> <span data-start="1709" data-end="1711.82">lose content now if we look at the first</span> <span data-start="1711.82" data-end="1714.34">example you'll notice that the moment fr</span> <span data-start="1714.34" data-end="1718.63">is done shrinking Auto and fit content</span> <span data-start="1718.63" data-end="1722.26">shrink at the same way so essentially</span> <span data-start="1722.26" data-end="1724.57">they behave very similarly it's the same</span> <span data-start="1724.57" data-end="1725.53">rate</span> <span data-start="1725.53" data-end="1727.75">but if you look at the second set where</span> <span data-start="1727.75" data-end="1730.9">this gold box is min content and then</span> <span data-start="1730.9" data-end="1734.32">it's Auto infant content so I'm going to</span> <span data-start="1734.32" data-end="1738.55">do this a bit slowly Auto will auto had</span> <span data-start="1738.55" data-end="1740.02">more space hadn't had free space</span> <span data-start="1740.02" data-end="1741.67">allocated to it so it's gonna give it up</span> <span data-start="1741.67" data-end="1744.57">first give up give up give up give up</span> <span data-start="1744.57" data-end="1749.5">when you hit they both they don't shrink</span> <span data-start="1749.5" data-end="1750.22">anymore</span> <span data-start="1750.22" data-end="1752.92">space starts getting taken away from min</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1752.92" data-end="1755.08">Max because min max is arranged between</span> <span data-start="1755.08" data-end="1757.36">400 and 200 so it can move between those</span> <span data-start="1757.36" data-end="1760.09">those values it gets taken away but at</span> <span data-start="1760.09" data-end="1762.91">some point auto and fit content also</span> <span data-start="1762.91" data-end="1765.7">start shrinking specifically what this</span> <span data-start="1765.7" data-end="1767.83">point is I can't tell you but what I can</span> <span data-start="1767.83" data-end="1769.39">tell you is that all three of these</span> <span data-start="1769.39" data-end="1771.67">items are going to hit their minimum</span> <span data-start="1771.67" data-end="1775.81">size at the same time so the moment it</span> <span data-start="1775.81" data-end="1781.09">goes goes goes hit at the same time so</span> <span data-start="1781.09" data-end="1784.9">the the minimum size is 200 so just to</span> <span data-start="1784.9" data-end="1787.75">prove a point it is 200 and min content</span> <span data-start="1787.75" data-end="1789.31">so I found this really really</span> <span data-start="1789.31" data-end="1791.89">interesting and it's the same it's the</span> <span data-start="1791.89" data-end="1794.05">same case if you compare Auto and min</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1794.05" data-end="1797.37">Max min max with fit it's the fact that</span> <span data-start="1797.37" data-end="1801.55">they behave similarly but there is a</span> <span data-start="1801.55" data-end="1805.12">variable weight of change now in a</span> <span data-start="1805.12" data-end="1807.64">growth this is in a shrink scenario in a</span> <span data-start="1807.64" data-end="1809.41">growth scenario when there's a lot of</span> <span data-start="1809.41" data-end="1811.93">space fit content is going to end up</span> <span data-start="1811.93" data-end="1815.08">getting capped at its maximum max</span> <span data-start="1815.08" data-end="1817.48">content size or whatever's inside fit</span> <span data-start="1817.48" data-end="1819.31">content for this particular example it's</span> <span data-start="1819.31" data-end="1822.01">max content size because do we like</span> <span data-start="1822.01" data-end="1824.17">boxers doesn't make up 200 pixels that's</span> <span data-start="1824.17" data-end="1825.12">fine</span> <span data-start="1825.12" data-end="1827.26">but if we look back at the second</span> <span data-start="1827.26" data-end="1831.79">example as we grow the moment we hit the</span> <span data-start="1831.79" data-end="1835.24">cap fit content stops because it's said</span> <span data-start="1835.24" data-end="1838.63">what Auto does is that it will hit its</span> <span data-start="1838.63" data-end="1840.94">max content width and then again it will</span> <span data-start="1840.94" data-end="1843.94">pause growing let min max finish going</span> <span data-start="1843.94" data-end="1846.79">to 400 before it starts taking all the</span> <span data-start="1846.79" data-end="1849.31">additional space so I think this is a</span> <span data-start="1849.31" data-end="1850.93">very interesting behavior that we've</span> <span data-start="1850.93" data-end="1852.85">never seen before this is something that</span> <span data-start="1852.85" data-end="1854.78">is relatively new</span> <span data-start="1854.78" data-end="1857.24">and I think there are a lot of</span> <span data-start="1857.24" data-end="1860.5">possibilities when it comes to more</span> <span data-start="1860.5" data-end="1863.36">editorial design because it allows us to</span> <span data-start="1863.36" data-end="1866.63">do designs that adapt better to a wider</span> <span data-start="1866.63" data-end="1869.51">range of viewport sizes so here I have</span> <span data-start="1869.51" data-end="1872.66">an example like maybe feature article</span> <span data-start="1872.66" data-end="1876.35">and this first bit is percentage sized</span> <span data-start="1876.35" data-end="1880.37">the bottom bit uses the newer like</span> <span data-start="1880.37" data-end="1882.95">variable sizing units or as I call them</span> <span data-start="1882.95" data-end="1885.53">they look fine at this width but the</span> <span data-start="1885.53" data-end="1887.3">moment you start to shrink and you hit</span> <span data-start="1887.3" data-end="1889.76">more extreme widths you can start to see</span> <span data-start="1889.76" data-end="1891.35">that this ends up having the same</span> <span data-start="1891.35" data-end="1893.57">problem as the cat example where you</span> <span data-start="1893.57" data-end="1896.51">know it doesn't work very well it image</span> <span data-start="1896.51" data-end="1899.36">to small content you squashed but if we</span> <span data-start="1899.36" data-end="1901.97">just have the ones that is sized with</span> <span data-start="1901.97" data-end="1904.58">the newest CSS properties here it's a</span> <span data-start="1904.58" data-end="1906.83">grid right okay and you can sort of see</span> <span data-start="1906.83" data-end="1908.9">the code it's not that straightforward</span> <span data-start="1908.9" data-end="1912.53">but what happens is that it functions a</span> <span data-start="1912.53" data-end="1914.81">lot better at the more extreme with</span> <span data-start="1914.81" data-end="1917.15">because of this variable sizing behavior</span> <span data-start="1917.15"
