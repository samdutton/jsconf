<p><span data-start="25.369" data-end="32.46">Thank you very much and welcome. I was just told that I'm actually, because of the transcription</span> <span data-start="32.46" data-end="44.129">over there, expressly forbidden to talk about Icelandic volcanoes.</span> <span data-start="44.129" data-end="49.329">Stephen Tyler once said there is something wrong with the world today, something is wrong</span> <span data-start="49.329" data-end="59.059">with our eyes, we are seeing things in a different way, these no sent words perfectly describe</span> <span data-start="59.059" data-end="64.259">how Internet Explorer was rendering websites in the past.</span> <span data-start="64.259" data-end="73.34">The same philosopher, in the same essay also said, I'm paraphrasing here, "Edge, yeah,</span> <span data-start="73.34" data-end="79.03">yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" — \{Laughter\}.</span> <span data-start="79.03" data-end="84.55">What I think he meant to tell us with this, as Microsoft we should build a new browser</span> <span data-start="84.55" data-end="90.3">and call it Microsoft Edge, in that sense the works of Aerosmith and Stephen Tyler,</span> <span data-start="90.3" data-end="100.59">have been a Da Vinci Code for us and much of Microsoft is inspired by it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="100.59" data-end="106.459">I'm the CTO in residence at the Microsoft Accelerator here in Berlin, like many of you</span> <span data-start="106.459" data-end="113.679">I was a web developer in the early 2000s, because of that my relationship with Internet</span> <span data-start="113.679" data-end="122.3">Explorer has always been complicated, like many of you I have written terrible code to</span> <span data-start="122.3" data-end="127.179">make sure that a website also worked in Internet Explorer that was already working perfectly</span> <span data-start="127.179" data-end="134.069">everywhere else. Like many of you I've hated it, I've thought it was the worse experience,</span> <span data-start="134.069" data-end="136.8">that's not a good place to be in.</span> <span data-start="136.8" data-end="142.98">Now, when you, actually when I started for Microsoft I was an Internet Explorer Evangelist</span> <span data-start="142.98" data-end="149.519">for a little while, I would speak at conferences like this, talk about Internet Explorer, when</span> <span data-start="149.519" data-end="158.92">my family asked what my yob was, I did drug trafficking, it raised fewer questions! \{Laughter\}</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="158.92" data-end="164.799">Things have changed quite a bit, on some fundamental level things are still very wrong, if you</span> <span data-start="164.799" data-end="177.98">go on Github and you search for IE sucks — when I saw that I was shocked, I didn't know what</span> <span data-start="177.98" data-end="181.909">to do with this information and at one put I thought actually that maybe I'm looking</span> <span data-start="181.909" data-end="191.959">at this all wrong, IE is the top level domain for Ireland the so just maybe what these people</span> <span data-start="191.959" data-end="196.62">are trying to say is that these people are not very big fans of the band U 2. I have</span> <span data-start="196.62" data-end="202.59">to admit at some point that I felt that Bono was a bit pretentious.</span> <span data-start="202.59" data-end="211.48">If you search Github for internet sucks you get 34,000 results, "Stop using this when</span> <span data-start="211.48" data-end="220.099">Internet Explorer no longer sucks." There is only one conclusion one can draw from this,</span> <span data-start="220.099" data-end="225.779">by and large developers are not completely satisfied with the experience of writing code</span> <span data-start="225.779" data-end="233.109">for Internet Explorer. This is a bad position to be in, I'm not going to make a bunch of</span> <span data-start="233.109" data-end="237.889">excuses, because really there are not very good excuses for this, I'm going attempt some</span> <span data-start="237.889" data-end="239.59">what of an explanation.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="239.59" data-end="247.079">IE is, in recent versions, a lot more standards compliant, if you used IE 11 it's a pretty</span> <span data-start="247.079" data-end="253.859">good browser, there has always been a lot of baggage that we have been carrying around</span> <span data-start="253.859" data-end="262.87">with us because of our legacy, IE has a 20 year legacy, IE 1 came out in 1995. This baggage</span> <span data-start="262.87" data-end="269.53">is a big problem, we are carrying around different document modes I'll explain what they are,</span> <span data-start="269.53" data-end="277.3">when we talked to the different developers out there, one this bigger group, very well-represented</span> <span data-start="277.3" data-end="281.58">here today, just your average web developer they're pushing us</span> <span data-start="281.58" data-end="286.09">to say look you have to build a more standard compliant browser you have to release updates</span> <span data-start="286.09" data-end="292.5">more frequently, we don't want to be stuck with outdated standards and stuff, enterprise</span> <span data-start="292.5" data-end="297.479">customers are pressurising us not to change anything, these are conflicting messages,</span> <span data-start="297.479" data-end="303.02">the reason they are doing that, it's not because they our mean or behind the times it's because</span> <span data-start="303.02" data-end="309.53">they have investment in the internet and internal websites and tools that they have spent millions</span> <span data-start="309.53" data-end="314.91">of dollars on building and we would break all of these sites if we didn't support the</span> <span data-start="314.91" data-end="319.5">broken implementations of web standards we had in old browsers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="319.5" data-end="326.25">The way we dealt with, we introduced document modes, you can force IE 11 to render a website</span> <span data-start="326.25" data-end="335.5">like IE 8, or 9 or 10 or alter versions, it may seem like a good solution, what it means,</span> <span data-start="335.5" data-end="341.22">instead of maintaining one browser we are maintaining 7 or 8 browsers, all of this baggage</span> <span data-start="341.22" data-end="346.3">really slows us down when we were thinking about a new version of our browser we figured</span> <span data-start="346.3" data-end="352.58">that the only way we could build a useful Powerful browser was to drop all the baggage,</span> <span data-start="352.58" data-end="365.199">we did a desperate step, we took the rendering engine, shock ware are JavaScript implementation,</span> <span data-start="365.199" data-end="370.539">copied and pasted code into a new repository and basically started over, we still have</span> <span data-start="370.539" data-end="377.259">internet explorer, if you go on windows 10 it has iterability in, we support that so</span> <span data-start="377.259" data-end="384.08">customers can use internet and internal tools, for all purposes Edge is the new IE browser</span> <span data-start="384.08" data-end="388.289">and default browser in Windows 10.</span> <span data-start="388.289" data-end="396.06">So, when we set out to build Edge, we had like one big guiding principle and this guiding</span> <span data-start="396.06" data-end="401.61">principle was we wanted the web to just work for everybody. Everybody, that includes of</span> <span data-start="401.61" data-end="406.58">course the users of the browser, but it also includes all of you the web developers. What</span> <span data-start="406.58" data-end="411.75">we mean by that, we want it to just work is we want you to no longer have to write code</span> <span data-start="411.75" data-end="418.09">that is specific to Internet Explorer or Edge, we want you to write code once without vendor</span> <span data-start="418.09" data-end="425.05">specific modifications and we want this to work consistently across Google Chrome, safari,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="425.05" data-end="431.47">Firefox and edge. In order to make that happen we had to do a couple of things, we had to</span> <span data-start="431.47" data-end="436.509">up our game in terms of web standard support and we've been working on that for a while,</span> <span data-start="436.509" data-end="441.949">but we really upped are game with Edge, we are also implementing forward looking standards,</span> <span data-start="441.949" data-end="454.539">what I mean by that, standards that are not officially standardising them yet, we are</span> <span data-start="454.539" data-end="458.34">adding support for pseudo standards I'm going to give you an example of that, what I mean</span> <span data-start="458.34" data-end="465.479">by that, things that a lot of browser implement that are not actually formally standardised,</span> <span data-start="465.479" data-end="469.8">we are adding support for that just to make sure that the web works consistently for everybody.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="469.8" data-end="474.9">Lastly, this was sort of the most satisfying part of it, we ripped out all of the baggage</span> <span data-start="474.9" data-end="481.68">of Internet Explorer, so we have no more backwards compatibility, there is no IE 7 mode in edge,</span> <span data-start="481.68" data-end="488.8">none of that, when we were done with building the first version of edge, we removed 220,000</span> <span data-start="488.8" data-end="496.939">unique lines of code from the IE code base, 6 document modes, IE 8 mode, IE 9 mode, but</span> <span data-start="496.939" data-end="503.71">we also removed but 300 APIs, just to give you some examples of this, we removed ActiveX</span> <span data-start="503.71" data-end="509.46">support, browser helper objects, VB script support, but we also removed small things</span> <span data-start="509.46" data-end="514.45">like attach grams, so you probably no, at event listener we had a non-standard version</span> <span data-start="514.45" data-end="520.099">of that, that's gone, we are really starting with a clean slate, no Microsoft proprietary</span> <span data-start="520.099" data-end="526.14">extensions in this any more, it's a really clean browser from the start \{Applause\}.</span> <span data-start="526.14" data-end="538.37">Thank you very much. At the same time we also added 300,000 new lines of code, these 300,000</span> <span data-start="538.37" data-end="544.99">new lines of code include 55 new web standards that we are supporting, but 4200 interoperability</span> <span data-start="544.99" data-end="551.41">fixes, these are tiny things and big things, in terms of tiny things stuff like where Chrome</span> <span data-start="551.41" data-end="556.389">has a slightly different interpretation of a web standard and we were trying to find</span> <span data-start="556.389" data-end="560.389">common ground where these specifications are not as clear as they should be, we want to</span> <span data-start="560.389" data-end="567.99">make sure that you never have to make sure about Edge doing a thing of its own.</span> <span data-start="567.99" data-end="571.45">When we set out to figure out what sort of features do we want to implement in Edge and</span> <span data-start="571.45" data-end="578.79">what we want to fix, we found that was very, very hard, over the years people have found</span> <span data-start="578.79" data-end="585.019">very clever ways of making websites work in IE, one of the ways serving different content</span> <span data-start="585.019" data-end="592.339">to the explorer, when it looked fancy and using a lot of CSS 3 in Chrome, we got a dumped</span> <span data-start="592.339" data-end="600.529">down version of CSS 2 with some IE-specification quirks, it was the reality, we are in part</span> <span data-start="600.529" data-end="606.11">or completely to blame for that, if you want to build a better browser you need to get</span> <span data-start="606.11" data-end="610.94">the same content as everybody else to figure out what's wrong with your implementation.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="610.94" data-end="620.18">The user agent string is used to identify a browser, the truth is the user agent string</span> <span data-start="620.18" data-end="621.67">is really a bag of lies.</span> <span data-start="621.67" data-end="630.43">These are the user agent strings of common browsers all browsers Identify themselves</span> <span data-start="630.43" data-end="636.779">as Mozilla 5.0, you know what that is, that's Netscape navigator, every browser says, "I'm</span> <span data-start="636.779" data-end="646.24">Netscape navigator", with Chrome, it's KHTML, comparable on Linux and Gecko the Firefox</span> <span data-start="646.24" data-end="654.6">rendering engine, they all lie about what they are. We are no exception here, we are</span> <span data-start="654.6" data-end="659.279">actually, now the worst of it all, but it was necessary to make sure we get the same</span> <span data-start="659.279" data-end="667.49">as everybody else. We are happily announcing that we are able web, Chrome, Gecko and safari.</span> <span data-start="667.49" data-end="672.029">\{Laughter\} \{Applause\}.</span> <span data-start="672.029" data-end="679.56">I know this is madness, we are not very happy about this, but in the end it is for the greater</span> <span data-start="679.56" data-end="685.779">good, but as a quick side note I want to encourage you that looking forward please do not use</span> <span data-start="685.779" data-end="690.12">agent user sniffing any more, if you have code on your server like regular expression,</span> <span data-start="690.12" data-end="694.81">that says, "If that is this browser I'm going to do server different content", don't do</span> <span data-start="694.81" data-end="700.79">that, that will always break along the line when new browsers are introduced, you will</span> <span data-start="700.79" data-end="705.709">serve them old content although they have better capabilities. Use feature detection</span> <span data-start="705.709" data-end="711.13">where possible, in part it's our fault we want to redeem ourselves and we need your</span> <span data-start="711.13" data-end="714.37">help to do that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="714.37" data-end="720.12">What we then did, we start to set out to find the things on the web that broke our browser,</span> <span data-start="720.12" data-end="726.01">we looked at the top 1,000 most popular websites, opened them up in an early build of edge and</span> <span data-start="726.01" data-end="737.17">fixed it, pretty simple. We took the Bing web crawler and we used it, used it to collect</span> <span data-start="737.17" data-end="744.54">information from millions of websites, like what features, what extensions, what web standards</span> <span data-start="744.54" data-end="751.67">do they use, we used it up in a head less version of the rendering engine and looked</span> <span data-start="751.67" data-end="759.75">to see where we didn't do things right. We took all the information and made 4,000 optimisations,</span> <span data-start="759.75" data-end="762.279">4,000 changes because of that.</span> <span data-start="762.279" data-end="767.579">I want to give you pretty interesting examples because of that, you will find they are a</span> <span data-start="767.579" data-end="770.759">bit different probably to what you might have expected. On</span> <span data-start="770.759" data-end="777.05">the left you see a screen shot of IE 11, on the right edge, the same page of Hawaiian</span> <span data-start="777.05" data-end="783.37">airlines, there is a bunch of icons that render correctly on the left they are not rendered</span> <span data-start="783.37" data-end="790.149">at all, the are not rendered at all, we are for once doing something right, we adhere</span> <span data-start="790.149" data-end="795.389">more strictly to the standard that applies to this than webkit does, Firefox actually</span> <span data-start="795.389" data-end="804.05">has the same probably, if you are serving a font file you have to honour the cross version</span> <span data-start="804.05" data-end="812.35">and installable files, it ignores this and it's why it works. We have chosen, it sounds</span> <span data-start="812.35" data-end="818.3">crazy, to make sure our mobile browser version renders it the same way as the mobile browsers</span> <span data-start="818.3" data-end="824.149">on iPhone I pad and Android so we have implemented the standard the same way that Chrome and</span> <span data-start="824.149" data-end="830.22">safari does, it works, you don't have to change anything.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="830.22" data-end="839.199">Another weird example, group on website, there is a minor difference in the way it's rendered,</span> <span data-start="839.199" data-end="845.92">group on using a CSS attribute called 'Webkit appearance', now webkit appearance is not</span> <span data-start="845.92" data-end="857.18">a web standard, an invention of Apple, we find a lot of mobile sites use it and we support</span> <span data-start="857.18" data-end="863.66">it with the vendor prefix so you don't have to touch your code at all it will just work.</span> <span data-start="863.66" data-end="869.11">Speaking of vendor prefixes we found another interesting thing, let me first say, what</span> <span data-start="869.11" data-end="877.139">we now do if we find a prefix CSS attribute or CSS selector and there is not an unprefixed</span> <span data-start="877.139" data-end="881.779">version and not a version that using the MS, Microsoft specific prefix we will actually</span> <span data-start="881.779" data-end="887.62">considered the other pre-fixed versions, we will use webkit prefixes if necessary.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="887.62" data-end="896.36">This, we did that because — \{Applause\} — thank you. Now, you can probably have like a divided</span> <span data-start="896.36" data-end="901.38">opinion about vendor prefixes, what actually is happening with vendor prefix is a lot of</span> <span data-start="901.38" data-end="907.49">websites use the Webkit prefix even though we have support for much of CSS 3, we don't</span> <span data-start="907.49" data-end="915.66">get to render it because people don't use the Microsoft prefix. We did one more, so</span> <span data-start="915.66" data-end="920.279">on this slide you see a subtle change in the use of gradients. And what we found was that</span> <span data-start="920.279" data-end="926.47">when Apple first introduced their gradient before it was standardised the syntax was</span> <span data-start="926.47" data-end="933.67">different from what was ultimately standardised. There were 2 versions. A lot of websites still</span> <span data-start="933.67" data-end="939.089">use and only use the obsolete Apple version of it we have decided to support that as well</span> <span data-start="939.089" data-end="944.13">just to make sure that websites render consistently. Let me make this absolutely clear I am not</span> <span data-start="944.13" data-end="950.779">encouraging you to use obsolete CSS syntax I am not encouraging you to use vendor prefix</span> <span data-start="950.779" data-end="954.129">where there is an unprefixed version, but just to make sure that everything renders</span> <span data-start="954.129" data-end="960.319">the same across all browsers we went to these lengths to make sure it all works.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="960.319" data-end="965.009">But besides this many, many thousand of small fixes like this me have also add a tonne of</span> <span data-start="965.009" data-end="972.24">new fixes stuff like WebAudio support, CSS filters, ECMAScript 2015 I will talk about</span> <span data-start="972.24" data-end="982.259">I in a second, http/2, SMID extension, and on top of that we support everything we have</span> <span data-start="982.259" data-end="991.199">also already supported with IE11, web GL web crypto, file API and so forth.</span> <span data-start="991.199" data-end="997.529">Now when you decided, to implement all of these features we also knew that we needed</span> <span data-start="997.529" data-end="1001.79">a new update strategy, you probably know, this is one of the main points with Internet</span> <span data-start="1001.79" data-end="1008.25">Explorer it's updated with the operating system. For us to introduce new features we had to</span> <span data-start="1008.25" data-end="1009.209">weight for a new service</span> <span data-start="1009.209" data-end="1016.16">pack or major release of the operating system. With Edge we have adopted the same update</span> <span data-start="1016.16" data-end="1021.649">model you will find in Chrome and Firefox today. We will actually update Edge independently</span> <span data-start="1021.649" data-end="1025.91">of the operating system we will do future updates along the way. It's the same ever</span> <span data-start="1025.91" data-end="1030.78">green version of Edge as you would expect with Chrome, we also don't talk about Edge</span> <span data-start="1030.78" data-end="1036.81">in a specific version it just Edge we will keep updating which I think is super important</span> <span data-start="1036.81" data-end="1038.31">for this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1038.31" data-end="1043.699">Now, people still obviously ask us look when are you going to implement feature X when</span> <span data-start="1043.699" data-end="1048.18">are you going to implement feature Y, even though we are a bigger company we have a lot</span> <span data-start="1048.18" data-end="1054.97">engineers, we have limited engineering resources we can't implement everything at once. We</span> <span data-start="1054.97" data-end="1060.33">prioritise and we have decided to be extremely open about this I am going to show you how</span> <span data-start="1060.33" data-end="1066.97">we are doing this. So this a site it's called modern.ie, you can go there now, we have a</span> <span data-start="1066.97" data-end="1073.5">page that says platform status on this list we first of all show you all of the different</span> <span data-start="1073.5" data-end="1078.85">web standards that we are currently tracking, and you can see the state of a their implementation.</span> <span data-start="1078.85" data-end="1082.679">You can see that some of them are in preview so we have a preview built on Internet Explorer</span> <span data-start="1082.679" data-end="1088.77">that's not stable yet you can download that see some of features in there some in development,</span> <span data-start="1088.77" data-end="1093.26">but some under consideration where we think about look this might make sense to implement</span> <span data-start="1093.26" data-end="1096.789">it we have to prioritise but eventually we won't implement this stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1096.789" data-end="1101.58">The other thing is we actually want to have an open discourse with you about which features</span> <span data-start="1101.58" data-end="1106">are important and which ones are not. This is user voice which is are customer feedback</span> <span data-start="1106" data-end="1113.299">portal you can see somebody here asks we should support OVG video audio formats here's a comment</span> <span data-start="1113.299" data-end="1117.44">from somebody on the engineering team saying it's under consideration we're looking at</span> <span data-start="1117.44" data-end="1122.38">it deciding on whether we want to implement this. We want to be more transparent about</span> <span data-start="1122.38" data-end="1130.7">it you can see the status of all the web standard support right there.</span> <span data-start="1130.7" data-end="1134.809">Now this is a JavaScript conference, I am fully aware of this, so I should probably</span> <span data-start="1134.809" data-end="1140">talk a little bit about JavaScript we have also done a lot of work round JavaScript in</span> <span data-start="1140" data-end="1146">Edge, we have also done a lot work with previous version of IE there some really cool powerful</span> <span data-start="1146" data-end="1153.63">new features in Edge. Now our JavaScript energy is called Chakra, and that is just-in-time</span> <span data-start="1153.63" data-end="1158.84">compiler like you have in other browsers, we have done a tonne of performance improvements</span> <span data-start="1158.84" data-end="1165.11">this where most developers get the most value where your applications runs faster everybody</span> <span data-start="1165.11" data-end="1178.73">wins. We have also added somebody like SIMD support we have added ECMAScript 2015 support.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1178.73" data-end="1186.38">Let me talk a bit about how Chakra works. Like any other JavaScript engine, when we</span> <span data-start="1186.38" data-end="1190.12">see a bunch of JavaScript on your page we parse it turn it into an abstract syntax tree</span> <span data-start="1190.12" data-end="1195.799">then we compile it into byte code then we have a byte code interpreter that runs JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1195.799" data-end="1200.94">for a bit but while we run the JavaScript we collect profiling information how office</span> <span data-start="1200.94" data-end="1206.46">in a function called, what types does it like a call site see and after a while we actually</span> <span data-start="1206.46" data-end="1212.09">pass that profiling information along to a just-in-time compiler, to an optimising just-in-time</span> <span data-start="1212.09" data-end="1219.7">compiler. It's also been semi-unique but Chakra we just-in-time compile on a separate thread</span> <span data-start="1219.7" data-end="1225.039">we're not blocking the UI thread or main thread while we're doing just-in-time complication.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1225.039" data-end="1230.4">This is a really cool feature, and it allows us to do more aggressive optimisation because</span> <span data-start="1230.4" data-end="1230.559">we're</span> <span data-start="1230.559" data-end="1237.57">not stalling the UI while we're compiling. Now one small down side of having a an aggressive</span> <span data-start="1237.57" data-end="1242.26">optimising compiler is that it takes longer before you break out of the interpreter start</span> <span data-start="1242.26" data-end="1247.69">running the machine code. So what we have done in Edge is implement a second just-in-time</span> <span data-start="1247.69" data-end="1254.84">compiler which is not as optimising it's much, much faster. You run your byte code for a</span> <span data-start="1254.84" data-end="1259.299">very short amount of time we will actually instantly just-in-time compile it using the</span> <span data-start="1259.299" data-end="1264.15">symbol, then after a while we while we'll send it to optimising if we think it will</span> <span data-start="1264.15" data-end="1270.659">make it faster. You have better performance right away but we have also done another thing</span> <span data-start="1270.659" data-end="1275">we have allowed the just-in-time compiler to use more tan one thread so if you have</span> <span data-start="1275" data-end="1279.46">a multi-core CPU which even mobile phones nowadays have you can actually make better</span> <span data-start="1279.46" data-end="1287.539">use of the CPU core that will give you better performance. One of the things that struck</span> <span data-start="1287.539" data-end="1295.77">me the most as really unexpected is we actually found that minifying JavaScript, the patterns</span> <span data-start="1295.77" data-end="1305.85">that mini fire make, doesn't allow the compiler to make as many up assumption. We analysed,</span> <span data-start="1305.85" data-end="1310.73">we found there were some tweaks we could do to make this much faster we running minified</span> <span data-start="1310.73" data-end="1320.46">code now. We also improved polymorphic inline caching that's where you optimise variable.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1320.46" data-end="1332.45">Also a great feature, we fully all know that when you have a animation on a site when you</span> <span data-start="1332.45" data-end="1336.669">are building a game you sometimes have stutter during animations so you are frames per second</span> <span data-start="1336.669" data-end="1342.71">drop from 60 to something else below that and go back up to 60. There is its in effect</span> <span data-start="1342.71" data-end="1347.1">that typically called by garbage collection pauses by running the garbage collection parallel</span> <span data-start="1347.1" data-end="1354.049">on multiple threads we can reduce the pauses and eliminate the stutter, you will see during</span> <span data-start="1354.049" data-end="1358.309">animation which is important for games that sort of stuff.</span> <span data-start="1358.309" data-end="1362.779">Now everybody likes benchmarks, but I want you to take these with a grain of salt because</span> <span data-start="1362.779" data-end="1369.11">the performance of a browser is much more than winning at some synthetic benchmark is</span> <span data-start="1369.11" data-end="1374.37">really about DOM performance about rendering, about JavaScript and many factors so this</span> <span data-start="1374.37" data-end="1379.029">does not mean Edge is the fastest browser in the world we still very happy we're very</span> <span data-start="1379.029" data-end="1386.73">good in these bench marks. So, actually Edge stable currently beats Apple Jetstream, Google</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1386.73" data-end="1394.029">Octane, and SunSpider and Firefox stable will not stay like this for very long it's a good</span> <span data-start="1394.029" data-end="1399.279">thing I want Chrome to beat us on this because this like the only browser war we can actually</span> <span data-start="1399.279" data-end="1403.15">all get behind it's the war for a better JavaScript performance because that is a war where we</span> <span data-start="1403.15" data-end="1408.89">all win, so I say bring it on.</span> <span data-start="1408.89" data-end="1413.36">\{applause\}</span> <span data-start="1413.36" data-end="1419.71">So one thing I want to talk about is SIMD, single instruction multi data it’s a very</span> <span data-start="1419.71" data-end="1425.32">technical things, it's a very cool thing this is making it's way into browsers. So when</span> <span data-start="1425.32" data-end="1432.5">you run and add instruction on a CPU you give it 2 parameters you give it a 5 or a 7, it</span> <span data-start="1432.5" data-end="1439.12">going to calculate sum of 5 and 7. Now what SIMD is it's CPU instructions that operate</span> <span data-start="1439.12" data-end="1447.23">on vectors you can give an SIMD operation 8 values for example. The SIMD instruction</span> <span data-start="1447.23" data-end="1452.32">will actually compute the result of that in one single instruction and often very few</span> <span data-start="1452.32" data-end="1460.75">cycles this critical for vector mathematics, for 3D graphics it as a huge impact on performance</span> <span data-start="1460.75" data-end="1466.919">specially with games graphics heavy applications we have worked with Intel, this also going</span> <span data-start="1466.919" data-end="1474.049">into other browsers, to implement SIMD extension into Edge I am going to show you a very quick</span> <span data-start="1474.049" data-end="1475.84">demo of this, a demo</span> <span data-start="1475.84" data-end="1483.07">built by Intel actually and when I start this you can see that this running at about 20</span> <span data-start="1483.07" data-end="1488.679">frames per second, it zooms in on the fractal you can see the performance is degrading as</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1488.679" data-end="1494.649">I zoom in when I enable SIMD or disable it again you can see the performance increase</span> <span data-start="1494.649" data-end="1501.75">significantly all the mathematical operation it can do it almost 4 times the speed. This</span> <span data-start="1501.75" data-end="1508.08">will be extremely helpful in writing scalable and fast games in JavaScript graphics heavy</span> <span data-start="1508.08" data-end="1509.77">applications.</span> <span data-start="1509.77" data-end="1516.48">Now the other thing we're implement with Edge, this both of these are by wait experimental.</span> <span data-start="1516.48" data-end="1525.059">We are also adding JZ support as you have at in Firefox. As addin.js a sub-set of JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1525.059" data-end="1535.77">language it's basically you can run C++ application in a JavaScript environment. What we can actually</span> <span data-start="1535.77" data-end="1549.1">do as add.js, we  just treat it as any other JavaScript code
now we have a special code for it we can actually</span> <span data-start="1549.1" data-end="1554.12">compile it differently and run it at almost native performance, I don't have a demo for</span> <span data-start="1554.12" data-end="1560.46">it I just want to show you this is also new in Edge you can go to about flags, and if</span> <span data-start="1560.46" data-end="1570.86">scroll done there's setting for JavaScript to enable new features, to enable addin.js</span> <span data-start="1570.86" data-end="1580.02">I also want to talk a bit about ECMAScript 2015, quick show of hand who here is excited</span> <span data-start="1580.02" data-end="1587.49">about ECMAScript 2015? Awesome. Excellent. So ECMAScript 2015 is a really, really cool</span> <span data-start="1587.49" data-end="1594.529">thing, since I am running a bit out of time I will show you this very, very briefly.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1594.529" data-end="1599.87">This is your typical JavaScript code, as you would write it today, and you can see for</span> <span data-start="1599.87" data-end="1605.83">example in this case, there's an anonymous function see the syntax for this is clunky</span> <span data-start="1605.83" data-end="1610.08">you have this problem where if you want to use this, inside of an anonymous function</span> <span data-start="1610.08" data-end="1614.59">it often doesn't refer to what you think it refers to in ECMAScript 2015 you can write</span> <span data-start="1614.59" data-end="1619.539">classes you have this arrow syntax is much nicer way of specifying anonymous functions</span> <span data-start="1619.539" data-end="1624.26">there a tonne of other stuff I can't get into I want to show you this real quick. We have</span> <span data-start="1624.26" data-end="1636.289">a tonne of support for UE 2015 you can see here in Edge, that Edge 13 has 80% ECMAScript</span> <span data-start="1636.289" data-end="1642.049">2015 support we're ahead of all the other browsers but what I am going to say I am going</span> <span data-start="1642.049" data-end="1650.22">to skip to another slide just to save sometime, basically what we want to do is we don't want</span> <span data-start="1650.22" data-end="1655.289">to be the only one of the first one to implement a specific standard because that is essentially</span> <span data-start="1655.289" data-end="1662.14">use less we want the web to work consistently across all browsers. We need to make sure</span> <span data-start="1662.14" data-end="1666.409">that we all work together as browser vendors to make that happen. One thing we did with</span> <span data-start="1666.409" data-end="1673.51">ECMAScript 2015 we already had such big support for it we're sharing our test suite for ES</span> <span data-start="1673.51" data-end="1679.96">2015 with everybody. So everybody writing ES 2015 implementation can run our test suite</span> <span data-start="1679.96" data-end="1686.669">to make sure their implementation adhere to the standard which is also quite new from</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1686.669" data-end="1694.809">Microsoft. I want to show you a bunch of things but I will skip ahead of this so \{laughter\}</span> <span data-start="1694.809" data-end="1703.789">there ok let me show at least this one. \{laughter\}</span> <span data-start="1703.789" data-end="1711.269">So over the years IE has given us a tonne of laughs, I think it's time to put an end</span> <span data-start="1711.269" data-end="1724.1">to this and to start working with a serious browser, thank you very much go to dev.modern.ie.</span> </p>
