<p><span data-start="12.961" data-end="13.961">So, this is who is not in the room: Building better products by engaging hard to reach</span> <span data-start="13.961" data-end="14.961">users.</span> <span data-start="14.961" data-end="15.961">Let's give a warm welcome to Ariba Jahan.</span> <span data-start="15.961" data-end="16.961">[ Applause ] ARIBA: Hi.</span> <span data-start="16.961" data-end="17.961">Just so you know, you'll see me stepping on and stepping off a stool here.</span> <span data-start="17.961" data-end="18.961">I'm 4 foot 11 inches so some adjustments needed to be made.</span> <span data-start="18.961" data-end="21.92">So, I'm gonna give you a second to kind of read some of these headlines that showcase</span> <span data-start="21.92" data-end="25.05">what's been happening in our industry.</span> <span data-start="25.05" data-end="31.45">So, this\h this is what we get when we don't challenge our assumptions.</span> <span data-start="31.45" data-end="34.629">Hi, I'm Ariba Jahan.</span> <span data-start="34.629" data-end="39.46">And today I'm here to share with you four ways you can challenge your assumptions to</span> <span data-start="39.46" data-end="41.93">avoid headlines like those.</span> <span data-start="41.93" data-end="47.73">And instead build better and more impactful products for your audience.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="47.73" data-end="50.48">And the four methods\h oh, okay.</span> <span data-start="50.48" data-end="58.37">And the four methods I'll share with you are helping us think through product development</span> <span data-start="58.37" data-end="60.67">in a new way at the ad council.</span> <span data-start="60.67" data-end="65.08">And I'm hoping they'll be helpful for you as you bring these back to your work.</span> <span data-start="65.08" data-end="73.32">So, for context, the Ad Council, we're a nonprofit organization that leverages the power of communication</span> <span data-start="73.32" data-end="78.99">to tackle the nation's biggest challenges like preventing wildfires and LGBTQ rights</span> <span data-start="78.99" data-end="84.75">awareness and diversity and inclusion and promoting girls in STEM.</span> <span data-start="84.75" data-end="90.89">We bring together industry leaders to develop campaigns to create social impact and create</span> <span data-start="90.89" data-end="93.55">action.</span> <span data-start="93.55" data-end="98.89">And as the director of innovation at the Ad Council, my responsibility is to facilitate</span> <span data-start="98.89" data-end="105.97">innovative thinking and work in our teams as well as cultivate a culture where experimentation</span> <span data-start="105.97" data-end="109.08">and curiosity can thrive.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="109.08" data-end="115.591">And I get to do that in many ways including training our whole staff on Splash Box, which</span> <span data-start="115.591" data-end="118.47">is our approach to innovation.</span> <span data-start="118.47" data-end="125.56">And it incorporates methodologies from LEAN as well as human centered design with mindsets</span> <span data-start="125.56" data-end="128.86">to cultivate in our teams.</span> <span data-start="128.86" data-end="135.209">And to date we've trained 80% of the organization, giving us a shared proposal and toolset to</span> <span data-start="135.209" data-end="136.209">innovate.</span> <span data-start="136.209" data-end="145.51">And as a way to bring the training\h the skills people learn at the training to life and make</span> <span data-start="145.51" data-end="151.84">them more tangible, we created a project where our new innovators can apply their skills</span> <span data-start="151.84" data-end="155.42">to create a digital prototype for one of our campaign issues.</span> <span data-start="155.42" data-end="161.209">So, today I'm really excited to share with you one of these digital prototype projects</span> <span data-start="161.209" data-end="167.7">where our assumptions got in the way and we had to use these\h the four methods I mentioned</span> <span data-start="167.7" data-end="172.23">to uncover our assumptions and to really challenge them.</span> <span data-start="172.23" data-end="177.879">So, the campaign issue we chose was teen bullying prevention.</span> <span data-start="177.879" data-end="182.25">And the task at hand was, well, how do we leverage the power of technology, what it</span> <span data-start="182.25" data-end="185.879">is today, to answer this big question?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="185.879" data-end="192.28">How might we influence teens to reduce peer mistreatment and empower one another by building</span> <span data-start="192.28" data-end="197.87">and perpetuating a more empathetic, supportive and inclusive culture?</span> <span data-start="197.87" data-end="203.43">Our target audience for this project were teens ranging from the ages 13 to 17 years</span> <span data-start="203.43" data-end="208.249">old who fell into the category of "Good eggs."</span> <span data-start="208.249" data-end="215.329">We defined" Good eggs 'as teens who believe they're good people and value kindness and</span> <span data-start="215.329" data-end="220.599">respect of one another and they want to be the best version of themselves.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="220.599" data-end="228.62">So, as you can imagine, we were really excited to contribute towards creating a more inclusive</span> <span data-start="228.62" data-end="230.299">world for our next generations.</span> <span data-start="230.299" data-end="235.68">So, as any good team, we dug in n and did a tremendous amount of research.</span> <span data-start="235.68" data-end="241.379">From reading every single research report we could get our hands on about Gen Z, and</span> <span data-start="241.379" data-end="245.879">interviewing teens, teachers, as well as issue experts.</span> <span data-start="245.879" data-end="251.59">And our research gave us so many insightful findings, that we were able to come up with</span> <span data-start="251.59" data-end="256.949">over a hundred ideas and 20 concepts.</span> <span data-start="256.949" data-end="264.05">And we then showed our strongest ideas to team to get some early feedback on which ideas</span> <span data-start="264.05" data-end="266.17">do we refine, how do we refine them?</span> <span data-start="266.17" data-end="270.639">And which ideas should we be leaving behind?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="270.639" data-end="276.22">After this many rounds of research and getting early user feedback directly from teens, we</span> <span data-start="276.22" data-end="278.759">felt pretty confident in our direction.</span> <span data-start="278.759" data-end="284.33">And we knew that whatever solution we create in order to solve for bullying has to solve</span> <span data-start="284.33" data-end="288">the three goals.</span> <span data-start="288" data-end="294.28">Our research told us that good eggs have an innate desire to create the change they wanted</span> <span data-start="294.28" data-end="295.86">to see in the world.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="295.86" data-end="307.18">We wanted to show them that and their actions, hoping they will adopt the kinder behaviors.</span> <span data-start="307.18" data-end="310.9">And two, we should double down on social media.</span> <span data-start="310.9" data-end="315.77">We found out that 91% of Gen Z are on social media.</span> <span data-start="315.77" data-end="321.18">So, we knew immediately that we needed to prioritize and emphasize the role of social</span> <span data-start="321.18" data-end="325.11">media in our digital solution.</span> <span data-start="325.11" data-end="328.259">And three, leverage the rise of CGI influencers.</span> <span data-start="328.259" data-end="336.68">See, at the time, four computer generated based influencers are garnered over 1 million</span> <span data-start="336.68" data-end="338.83">followers on Instagram.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="338.83" data-end="342.78">And we were kind of blown away by those and we need to do something with this.</span> <span data-start="342.78" data-end="349.99">Whether it's to do storytelling or to model good behaviors to teens in hopes that it works</span> <span data-start="349.99" data-end="351.699">for them.</span> <span data-start="351.699" data-end="361.08">So, keeping these three goals in mind, we refined our 20 concepts into five promising</span> <span data-start="361.08" data-end="362.349">ideas.</span> <span data-start="362.349" data-end="367.47">And then we took these ideas to teams to get some more validation and then start building</span> <span data-start="367.47" data-end="369.23">them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="369.23" data-end="376.639">And the main thing we learned at this round with teens is that we were wrong on all fronts.</span> <span data-start="376.639" data-end="380.71">What we focused on as goals were actually just assumptions.</span> <span data-start="380.71" data-end="383.9">Starting with the word bullying.</span> <span data-start="383.9" data-end="387.81">It turns out that the only people that use the word bullying is a bunch of adults who</span> <span data-start="387.81" data-end="389.469">want to end bullying.</span> <span data-start="389.469" data-end="392.849">[ Laughter ] And, you know, we learned that because we</span> <span data-start="392.849" data-end="399.229">talked to teens and when we asked them, hey, can you share your experience with bullying?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="399.229" data-end="401.37">They didn't have much to share.</span> <span data-start="401.37" data-end="408.02">But when we changed our wording and asked, can you share the last time someone hurt you?</span> <span data-start="408.02" data-end="410.219">Or maybe when you've hurt someone else?</span> <span data-start="410.219" data-end="416.03">They shared stories about being excluded, shaming, blaming.</span> <span data-start="416.03" data-end="419.27">And there was just so much more vulnerability involved.</span> <span data-start="419.27" data-end="425.49">So, it turned out that their language around mistreatment looked very different than ours.</span> <span data-start="425.49" data-end="430.169">And they're actually way more self aware than we give them credit for.</span> <span data-start="430.169" data-end="436.04">We asked them, can you think about a moment where you mistreated someone or you hurt someone.</span> <span data-start="436.04" data-end="443.27">And when they did that, they used words like regret, guilt, is upset as how they felt afterwards.</span> <span data-start="443.27" data-end="449.4">So, they're clearly fully aware of the implications of their actions.</span> <span data-start="449.4" data-end="455.419">And it turned out that even though 91% of Gen Z are on social, they value privacy and</span> <span data-start="455.419" data-end="458.669">authenticity way more than what we knew.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="458.669" data-end="463.86">To the point where they have two types of Instagram accounts.</span> <span data-start="463.86" data-end="468.349">One is called Finsta which is fake Instagram account.</span> <span data-start="468.349" data-end="471.659">And that is where they are their most authentic self.</span> <span data-start="471.659" data-end="475.49">Photos are unfiltered, they keep it private.</span> <span data-start="475.49" data-end="481.05">No crafted captions and they keep the number of people who can follow that account very</span> <span data-start="481.05" data-end="482.05">small.</span> <span data-start="482.05" data-end="488.36">And then they have the Rinsta, the real Instagram account where it's hyper curated, well crafted</span> <span data-start="488.36" data-end="489.479">captions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="489.479" data-end="497.659">Perhaps even song lyrics and that's where they want to have a lot of followers.</span> <span data-start="497.659" data-end="503.24">And when it came down to CGI influencers, only like a few teens knew what a CGI influencer</span> <span data-start="503.24" data-end="504.24">was.</span> <span data-start="504.24" data-end="508.379">And even the ones that followed them only did it out of curiosity for the character's</span> <span data-start="508.379" data-end="510.439">fashion.</span> <span data-start="510.439" data-end="515.159">And if you\h I'm not so sure if you can read it, but if you can look at their handwritten</span> <span data-start="515.159" data-end="521.409">feedback on the screen, you'll notice what they wanted instead was someone relatable.</span> <span data-start="521.409" data-end="523.899">Someone who might have had a tough childhood.</span> <span data-start="523.899" data-end="527.05">Someone who has gone through issues.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="527.05" data-end="528.77">And they also wanted someone funny.</span> <span data-start="528.77" data-end="532.769">I really think just wanted Kevin Hart.</span> <span data-start="532.769" data-end="538.48">[ Laughter ] So, our assumptions were checked.</span> <span data-start="538.48" data-end="540.12">You know?</span> <span data-start="540.12" data-end="545.3">And before I dive into the four tactics that allowed us to uncover these assumptions, I</span> <span data-start="545.3" data-end="547.43">want to talk about assumptions for a second.</span> <span data-start="547.43" data-end="557.65">You know, assumptions\h assumption is something we believe to be true without any evidence.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="557.65" data-end="566.16">And the reason it's so easy for our assumptions and biases to come into our work or to creep</span> <span data-start="566.16" data-end="572.06">up even after tremendous amount of research, is because our brain is constantly making</span> <span data-start="572.06" data-end="575.56">assumptions just in the interest of efficiency.</span> <span data-start="575.56" data-end="583.26">See, the thing is, over the course of 200,000 years, our brain has created several mental</span> <span data-start="583.26" data-end="588.889">shortcuts to help us cope and survive and deal with the tremendous amounts of innovation</span> <span data-start="588.889" data-end="590.589">in our world.</span> <span data-start="590.589" data-end="598.23">So, we end up having shortcuts that help us make sense of large amounts of information.</span> <span data-start="598.23" data-end="603.26">Shortcuts that help us determine what's important to remember and what to recall.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="603.26" data-end="606.589">Shortcuts that create explanations for us when we don't have enough meaning or when</span> <span data-start="606.589" data-end="608.79">there is not enough context.</span> <span data-start="608.79" data-end="610.66">And shortcuts that help us act quickly.</span> <span data-start="610.66" data-end="617.05">These ready shorts that help us remember how to ride a bike, know 2 plus 2, help us detect</span> <span data-start="617.05" data-end="625.66">joy or frustration in someone's voice and to run from perceived danger.</span> <span data-start="625.66" data-end="631.93">While all of those sound necessary, these are the same shortcuts that cause us to make</span> <span data-start="631.93" data-end="638">assumptions, make snap judgments, jump to conclusions and make decisions based on our</span> <span data-start="638" data-end="641.3">biases.</span> <span data-start="641.3" data-end="645.589">And these mental shortcuts are more commonly known as cognitive biases.</span> <span data-start="645.589" data-end="652.41">And the thing is, with 180 of these mental shortcuts active in our brain all the time,</span> <span data-start="652.41" data-end="658.09">it's kind of hard to spot when they're getting in the way or when they're active.</span> <span data-start="658.09" data-end="663.66">So, I'll call out three that got in our way and we didn't even notice it.</span> <span data-start="663.66" data-end="670.019">See, we have a mental shortcut that causes us to be easily influenced by what is stored</span> <span data-start="670.019" data-end="672.33">in our memory or what's familiar.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="672.33" data-end="677.829">And that's the way\h that's the reason why all of us use the word bullying to describe</span> <span data-start="677.829" data-end="679.84">that interaction.</span> <span data-start="679.84" data-end="683.35">Even without even questioning does that language even resonate?</span> <span data-start="683.35" data-end="686.209">Does it even work?</span> <span data-start="686.209" data-end="692.17">We have another mental shortcut that causes us to make judgments and impressions by relying</span> <span data-start="692.17" data-end="695.69">only on the information made available to us.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="695.69" data-end="702.38">And that's why when we see data like 91% of teens are on social media and they spend 9</span> <span data-start="702.38" data-end="704.94">hours consuming media, we're just like, oh my god.</span> <span data-start="704.94" data-end="708.66">They must be sharing everything and they're on it all the time.</span> <span data-start="708.66" data-end="711.69">Let's just like do everything social media related.</span> <span data-start="711.69" data-end="717.199">What we don't do is actively question, well, does this 91% do the same exact thing?</span> <span data-start="717.199" data-end="720.13">Did they all use the same features in the same exact way?</span> <span data-start="720.13" data-end="722.139">Do they all feel the same way?</span> <span data-start="722.139" data-end="725.41">We don't do that.</span> <span data-start="725.41" data-end="731.63">And the last mental shortcut I'll call out is that we're just naturally drawn to details</span> <span data-start="731.63" data-end="733.67">that confirm our own existing beliefs.</span> <span data-start="733.67" data-end="734.99">It's just what we do.</span> <span data-start="734.99" data-end="735.99">This is why we have friends.</span> <span data-start="735.99" data-end="737.509">This is how we make friends.</span> <span data-start="737.509" data-end="740.72">I'll look for someone who likes the same thing as I do.</span> <span data-start="740.72" data-end="742.42">Now we're friends.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="742.42" data-end="747.94">And the thing is, that same bias is what causes us to find things that validate us.</span> <span data-start="747.94" data-end="752.75">So, when we were super hyped up about CGI influencers, we ended up paying a lot more</span> <span data-start="752.75" data-end="757.91">closer attention to headlines like these that said, oh, my god, CGI influencers are the</span> <span data-start="757.91" data-end="760.67">future of the influencer marketing.</span> <span data-start="760.67" data-end="762.459">And that's what happens.</span> <span data-start="762.459" data-end="769.199">So, while great for survival, mental shortcuts are not great for innovation.</span> <span data-start="769.199" data-end="774.019">And that's how easy it is for mental shortcuts that are designed to help us cope to get in</span> <span data-start="774.019" data-end="777.21">the way of us making products that are right for our audience.</span> <span data-start="777.21" data-end="780.779">So, for the rest of my talk, I will focus on how we used\h is it jumping on the screen?</span> <span data-start="780.779" data-end="781.779">Because it's jumping here.</span> <span data-start="781.779" data-end="782.779">So, I just wanted to double check.</span> <span data-start="782.779" data-end="783.779">It's jumping?</span> <span data-start="783.779" data-end="784.779">Okay.</span> <span data-start="784.779" data-end="785.779">I'm gonna assume someone's gonna take care of that.</span> <span data-start="785.779" data-end="786.779">[ Laughter ] But I'll keep going.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="822.709" data-end="823.709">They feel like facts.</span> <span data-start="823.709" data-end="829.8">So, it's really good to have a diverse team in the room so that we can all help each other</span> <span data-start="829.8" data-end="833.649">spot each other's blind spots and challenge each other's assumptions.</span> <span data-start="833.649" data-end="840.649">So, for our project, in order to map assumptions, we started by asking ourselves questions around</span> <span data-start="840.649" data-end="843">teens' experiences with mistreatment.</span> <span data-start="843" data-end="847.69">So, we tried to figure out like how much do we know the audience?</span> <span data-start="847.69" data-end="849.399">What type of language do they use?</span> <span data-start="849.399" data-end="850.75">What's their lifestyle?</span> <span data-start="850.75" data-end="851.75">What brings them joy?</span> <span data-start="851.75" data-end="853.71">What are their priority, pain points?</span> <span data-start="853.71" data-end="856.79">And how do they use technology?</span> <span data-start="856.79" data-end="862.769">And then we asked ourselves, well, what do we believe to be true about teen mistreatment?</span> <span data-start="862.769" data-end="867.269">How does mistreatment show up in their lives and how do they solve it?</span> <span data-start="867.269" data-end="871.58">And is this a challenge they need solved by us?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="871.58" data-end="875.22">And just in general, what else do they know that we should know about and whose voices</span> <span data-start="875.22" data-end="877.66">have been heard?</span> <span data-start="877.66" data-end="882.459">When we did this, we had more questions than answers.</span> <span data-start="882.459" data-end="886.79">And despite all the research we did, we didn't know much about teens.</span> <span data-start="886.79" data-end="892">So, we took all of our assumptions and needed to figure out, where do we go from here?</span> <span data-start="892" data-end="900.779">So, to prioritize what we needed to dig into, we mapped on a 2x2 grid.</span> <span data-start="900.779" data-end="906.24">From known to unknown, and the Y axis was very important to not very important.</span> <span data-start="906.24" data-end="911.42">It and helped us tease out the critical uncertainties that we needed to figure out before going</span> <span data-start="911.42" data-end="914.86">any further.</span> <span data-start="914.86" data-end="921.45">To recap, mapping assumptions can really help us uncover our blind spots, what we believe</span> <span data-start="921.45" data-end="924.3">to be true versus what is actually true.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="924.3" data-end="927.769">And critical gaps in the team's overall knowledge.</span> <span data-start="927.769" data-end="932.339">And answering these questions about the audience and the challenge we're solving for is a great</span> <span data-start="932.339" data-end="936.959">way to know where to go next, what to explore before going any further or investing any</span> <span data-start="936.959" data-end="939.75">further in the project.</span> <span data-start="939.75" data-end="947.139">So, after rounds of interviewing with teens and doing brainstorms within our teams, we</span> <span data-start="947.139" data-end="950.94">had about 20 fleshed out concepts and we loved them all.</span> <span data-start="950.94" data-end="954.069">But we had no clue which idea would work.</span> <span data-start="954.069" data-end="960.259">And instead of just choosing an idea, just praying something works, we decided to test</span> <span data-start="960.259" data-end="962.92">five of our strongest concepts.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="962.92" data-end="969.241">So, we ran several experiments to explore Whether or not our ideas could create the</span> <span data-start="969.241" data-end="975.41">desired outcome we were hoping for and to garner any new knowledge.</span> <span data-start="975.41" data-end="982.029">And while mapping assumptions is a great place to start, testing hypothesis kind of allows</span> <span data-start="982.029" data-end="986.63">you to uncover all the invisible assumptions that we didn't even notice yet.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="986.63" data-end="991.44">So, to test multiple hypothesis, we do two things.</span> <span data-start="991.44" data-end="998.37">We created hypothesis statements to get really specific on what we were hope our ideas can</span> <span data-start="998.37" data-end="999.37">do.</span> <span data-start="999.37" data-end="1004.13">And then that helped us hone in on what are we hoping to uncover through test something</span> <span data-start="1004.13" data-end="1009.66">and then we identified our riskiest assumptions which were, what are the beliefs we're holding</span> <span data-start="1009.66" data-end="1015.87">about our ideas that if disproven completely break ours idea altogether?</span> <span data-start="1015.87" data-end="1024.41">So, in order to create these hypothesis statements, we reframed each of our ideas into a hypothesis</span> <span data-start="1024.41" data-end="1027.62">by using a Madeline framework like this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1027.62" data-end="1032.11">You fill in the parentheses with the relevant information in your project.</span> <span data-start="1032.11" data-end="1039.209">So, we believe this audience has a problem doing this.</span> <span data-start="1039.209" data-end="1043.039">We believe this solution can help.</span> <span data-start="1043.039" data-end="1047.18">They will do this engagement resulting in the desired outcome.</span> <span data-start="1047.18" data-end="1055.12">So, going back to our CGI project, this is an example, our assumptions and our hypothesis</span> <span data-start="1055.12" data-end="1061.45">is, we believe that teens have a problem noticing the impact of their actions which leads them</span> <span data-start="1061.45" data-end="1063.88">to mistreat each other.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1063.88" data-end="1070.809">We believe that a fictional CGI character whose life captures the dramatic realities</span> <span data-start="1070.809" data-end="1076.289">of the teen experience, including teachable moments where the character models kindness,</span> <span data-start="1076.289" data-end="1077.95">can help.</span> <span data-start="1077.95" data-end="1084.01">And we believe that teens will follow and relate to the character causing them to reflect</span> <span data-start="1084.01" data-end="1087.78">and adopt the modeled positive behaviors in real life.</span> <span data-start="1087.78" data-end="1091.82">So, it really gets the team to focus on, what are we doing here?</span> <span data-start="1091.82" data-end="1092.909">What are we hoping to do?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1092.909" data-end="1098.2">Versus getting tied up in the features and the color and the UI of the product.</span> <span data-start="1098.2" data-end="1103.11">So, we did that for all five ideas.</span> <span data-start="1103.11" data-end="1106.87">And then we needed to identify our riskiest assumption.</span> <span data-start="1106.87" data-end="1113.929">We did that by first asking, well, what must be true in order for this idea to work?</span> <span data-start="1113.929" data-end="1115.6">Like at all?</span> <span data-start="1115.6" data-end="1121.77">And what must be true in order for this idea to add value to the teens' lives?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1121.77" data-end="1126.4">And then when we answered these questions, we looked through them and tried to identify</span> <span data-start="1126.4" data-end="1132.21">the ones that, if disproven, completely breaks our idea.</span> <span data-start="1132.21" data-end="1137.97">So, going back to our CGI project, we came up with a lot of things that we're assuming</span> <span data-start="1137.97" data-end="1141.52">and hoping to be true in order for this idea to work.</span> <span data-start="1141.52" data-end="1147.57">And what really stood out to us as our riskiest assumption was our belief that teens will</span> <span data-start="1147.57" data-end="1149.64">resonate with the CGI character.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1149.64" data-end="1156.75">See, if teens don't relate or follow the CGI person, like this whole idea is irrelevant</span> <span data-start="1156.75" data-end="1159.7">and we're not going to do anything.</span> <span data-start="1159.7" data-end="1165.01">But what's great about testing is that we can know that without ever spending any time</span> <span data-start="1165.01" data-end="1170.84">investing in, developing and putting the CGI character together.</span> <span data-start="1170.84" data-end="1177.51">So, by the time we did this for each one of our ideas, we ended up with like a list of</span> <span data-start="1177.51" data-end="1182.83">elements and interactions that we were assuming teens would love and engage with.</span> <span data-start="1182.83" data-end="1184.27">But had no proof.</span> <span data-start="1184.27" data-end="1188">So, all of the\h all of them needed to be tested.</span> <span data-start="1188" data-end="1190.9">Like does anonymity really matter?</span> <span data-start="1190.9" data-end="1198.69">Do teens care about interacting with things in real time and user generated content?</span> <span data-start="1198.69" data-end="1205.32">And do they really value influencer oriented things?</span> <span data-start="1205.32" data-end="1210.21">And then we took those and we wanted to test them without having to build anything.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1210.21" data-end="1216.12">So, we used simple things like surveys and design prototypes to test all of those features</span> <span data-start="1216.12" data-end="1219.24">to figure out, like, where are we going?</span> <span data-start="1219.24" data-end="1227.159">So, to recap, the simple act of reframing an idea into a hypothesis is such a great</span> <span data-start="1227.159" data-end="1232.71">reminder that regardless of how exciting our ideas may sound, we don't really know yet</span> <span data-start="1232.71" data-end="1235.179">if any of them will work.</span> <span data-start="1235.179" data-end="1240.559">So, they need to be tested in order for us to move forward.</span> <span data-start="1240.559" data-end="1248.09">And to help prioritize what to even test first, we really hone in on the beliefs we're holding</span> <span data-start="1248.09" data-end="1255.02">on to about our ideas that if invalidated our idea needs to be scrapped.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1255.02" data-end="1260.89">And the thing is, being able to test our ideas before building anything is actually gave</span> <span data-start="1260.89" data-end="1264.39">us a lot of freedom from creativity.</span> <span data-start="1264.39" data-end="1269.671">It gave us the liberty to dream just a little bigger knowing that our audience would let</span> <span data-start="1269.671" data-end="1272.27">us know what to refine and what to leave behind.</span> <span data-start="1272.27" data-end="1274.419">So, let's go big.</span> <span data-start="1274.419" data-end="1281.47">So, testing multiple ideas with our users was super insightful.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1281.47" data-end="1285.21">But there's a limitation to how much we could learn through testing.</span> <span data-start="1285.21" data-end="1290.82">Because the thing is, when we have prototypes that we're showing and asking questions to</span> <span data-start="1290.82" data-end="1295.809">teens, they're only reacting to whatever we're giving them.</span> <span data-start="1295.809" data-end="1301.34">And that's why engaging and working with and empowering our users to create their own solutions</span> <span data-start="1301.34" data-end="1305.46">was so critical to see.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1305.46" data-end="1312.78">We coordinated with a high school in New York City and we\h we hosted three co creation</span> <span data-start="1312.78" data-end="1314.299">sessions.</span> <span data-start="1314.299" data-end="1319.77">And we really wanted to understand how do teens perceive bullying today?</span> <span data-start="1319.77" data-end="1323.74">What types of digital interactions do they even enjoy?</span> <span data-start="1323.74" data-end="1330.19">And that list of riskiest elements that we were so excited about?</span> <span data-start="1330.19" data-end="1333.15">We wanted to invalidate or validate some of them.</span> <span data-start="1333.15" data-end="1338.47">And lastly, we wanted to see how would teens solve this?</span> <span data-start="1338.47" data-end="1345.049">So, what you see up here is a snapshot of the solutions students came up with when we</span> <span data-start="1345.049" data-end="1350.309">asked them to design a digital tool that could help people be more mind and inclusive of</span> <span data-start="1350.309" data-end="1351.49">others.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1351.49" data-end="1356.33">And/or to help people avoid hurting someone's feelings.</span> <span data-start="1356.33" data-end="1360.99">We purposely didn't use words like teen or bullying because we didn't to want mislead</span> <span data-start="1360.99" data-end="1365.799">them or drive them in a direction that's not natural for them.</span> <span data-start="1365.799" data-end="1369.49">We then got our user feedback on these new ideas as well.</span> <span data-start="1369.49" data-end="1377.4">So, the co creation sessions validated some hypotheses while invalidating others.</span> <span data-start="1377.4" data-end="1385.17">And what we learned from teens directly helped us design three new cocreated prototypes.</span> <span data-start="1385.17" data-end="1389.97">And the thing about co creations is, you saw how insightful they were.</span> <span data-start="1389.97" data-end="1395.34">But they also uncovered ideas that we couldn't have come up with on our own.</span> <span data-start="1395.34" data-end="1401.419">For example, our students came up with this brilliant idea which they called In My Bag.</span> <span data-start="1401.419" data-end="1407.87">In my bag is a phrase teens use to indicate when they are feeling emotionally unavailable</span> <span data-start="1407.87" data-end="1409.15">or sad.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1409.15" data-end="1415.45">So, this is an app that would allow users to air drop or somehow alert their friends</span> <span data-start="1415.45" data-end="1422.2">when they are not feeling emotionally available and they want to be left alone.</span> <span data-start="1422.2" data-end="1427.14">And you can see the handwritten feedback from other students on this idea.</span> <span data-start="1427.14" data-end="1433.1">And their feedback on this idea was super enthusiastic and very validating.</span> <span data-start="1433.1" data-end="1435.68">They said thing like, it's fire.</span> <span data-start="1435.68" data-end="1439.59">And you can tell people around you how you're actually feeling.</span> <span data-start="1439.59" data-end="1440.59">See?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1440.59" data-end="1444.429">Their comments showed us that they wanted to be vulnerable.</span> <span data-start="1444.429" data-end="1447.26">And they wanted to share how they were feeling.</span> <span data-start="1447.26" data-end="1453.02">Which is contrary to the social pressure they have to be tough.</span> <span data-start="1453.02" data-end="1461.12">So, the ability to uncover new learnings about our audience and hear ideas that we couldn't</span> <span data-start="1461.12" data-end="1466.86">have ever come up with on our own, is what makes co creation so powerful.</span> <span data-start="1466.86" data-end="1473.34">And by creating space for our users to join us in the process, we get out of our own way.</span> <span data-start="1473.34" data-end="1478.35">So, it's been quite a journey.</span> <span data-start="1478.35" data-end="1483.02">From identifying opportunities and researching for insights to coming up with over a hundred</span> <span data-start="1483.02" data-end="1489.96">ideas to then testing those hypothesis with teens and then co designing some with them,</span> <span data-start="1489.96" data-end="1494.85">there were moments when our ideas were invalidated and our assumptions were checked.</span> <span data-start="1494.85" data-end="1498.77">and the thing is, that's what learning looks like.</span> <span data-start="1498.77" data-end="1504.01">And also we made progress, it didn't come easily.</span> <span data-start="1504.01" data-end="1509.399">We went out of our way to find a diverse mix of teens to interview and worked with our</span> <span data-start="1509.399" data-end="1513.94">local high school to organize these co creations.</span> <span data-start="1513.94" data-end="1519.029">And we needed parents to sign permission slips, we had to work around exam schedules, homework</span> <span data-start="1519.029" data-end="1525.779">schedules, and we had to be totally okay if a teen suddenly flaked on a phone interview.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1564.01" data-end="1569.23">Where we spend less time defending ideas and spend more time testing our hypothesis with</span> <span data-start="1569.23" data-end="1571.59">a diverse representation of our audience.</span> <span data-start="1571.59" data-end="1577.95">We spent less time looking for that one right answer.</span> <span data-start="1577.95" data-end="1582.72">And realized that we must create space for everyone to embrace the unknown and ambiguity</span> <span data-start="1582.72" data-end="1586.23">and just stay curious.</span> <span data-start="1586.23" data-end="1591.63">And instead of using language and reward systems in our workplace to heighten our sense of</span> <span data-start="1591.63" data-end="1597.19">fear or failure, let's just create a culture that's open to being wrong.</span> <span data-start="1597.19" data-end="1606.399">So, rounding off, I want you to remember that our brain has many mental shortcuts that are</span> <span data-start="1606.399" data-end="1610.61">really just constantly on and just trying to help us survive and hope and process the</span> <span data-start="1610.61" data-end="1612.27">world around us.</span> <span data-start="1612.27" data-end="1620.75">But those same shortcuts also make us do\h make decisions based on our biases, make snap</span> <span data-start="1620.75" data-end="1629.419">judgments, and make assumptions and miss critical information that others wouldn't miss.</span> <span data-start="1629.419" data-end="1636.179">So, while we'd all like to believe that we're not that biased or maybe we're not as biased</span> <span data-start="1636.179" data-end="1642.14">as the other people, that thought in itself is a bias.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1642.14" data-end="1644.57">It's called bias blind spot.</span> <span data-start="1644.57" data-end="1651.789">So, this bias blind spot can cause us to let our assumptions go unchecked and affecting</span> <span data-start="1651.789" data-end="1655.05">our ability to make the right product for our audience.</span> <span data-start="1655.05" data-end="1659.94">So, I want you to remember to do these four things.</span> <span data-start="1659.94" data-end="1664.309">Let's try to map our assumptions and unknowns about the challenge we're trying to tackle</span> <span data-start="1664.309" data-end="1667.45">and the people that we're trying to solve for, and the solutions that we think that</span> <span data-start="1667.45" data-end="1672.669">would help them so we can uncover the gaps of knowledge in our teams and figure out,</span> <span data-start="1672.669" data-end="1677.01">what do we have to really explore to move any forward?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1677.01" data-end="1682.51">Let's test multiple ideas to see if they really create the outcome we were hoping for?</span> <span data-start="1682.51" data-end="1686.46">And a great place to start with that is really going after the beliefs that we're holding</span> <span data-start="1686.46" data-end="1692.71">on to that if proven wrong can completely invalidate our idea.</span> <span data-start="1692.71" data-end="1697.83">And let's bring our audience more into our process by cocreating with them so that they</span> <span data-start="1697.83" data-end="1704.32">can solve the things themselves and show us ideas that we can't come up with on our own.</span> <span data-start="1704.32" data-end="1709.33">And let's be relentless in making sure that the people that we're trying to serve, that</span> <span data-start="1709.33" data-end="1715.29">their voices are heard and that we have a diverse team in place to hear them and that</span> <span data-start="1715.29" data-end="1719.69">we are making sure that we're aligned with our product, goals and ethics.</span> <span data-start="1719.69" data-end="1729.33">And lastly, nurture a team that seeks perspectives unlike their own, values testing and can stay</span> <span data-start="1729.33" data-end="1731.269">curious.</span> <span data-start="1731.269" data-end="1740.149">So, instead of fighting the 180 mental shortcuts, evolution has ingrained in us, Let's use these</span> <span data-start="1740.149" data-end="1745.85">four methods to uncover and challenge our assumptions so that we can make better and</span> <span data-start="1745.85" data-end="1747.12">more impactful products for our audience.</span> <span data-start="1747.12" data-end="1748.12">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="1748.12" data-end="1749.12">[ Applause ] >> Thank you.</span> </p>
