a year ago I think a</span> <span data-start="27.509" data-end="31.649">little my role as a front-end developer in the free market, both good me and</span> <span data-start="31.649" data-end="35.37">my colleagues have a lot of responsibility because everything</span> <span data-start="35.37" data-end="39.239">we do ends up impacting an unimaginable number of users for whom</span>

I think we have a motto or try to live a motto a</span> <span data-start="58.13" data-end="63.21">goal you feel please and all things and most</span> <span data-start="63.21" data-end="65.7">important for us to always put the needs of the user</span> <span data-start="65.7" data-end="70.159">first even above ours as developers</span> <span data-start="70.159" data-end="74.149">and speaking of users and always for more first a little bit comes</span> <span data-start="74.149" data-end="78.829">related so I want to tell you there I think talking about users and</span> <span data-start="78.829" data-end="84.079">happy users I think well I think we all know what a user is</span> <span data-start="84.079" data-end="88.67">happy we all want to be happy users and a happy user I think that</span> <span data-start="88.67" data-end="92.149">they love to have a website or fast, that is, even if they are part of a website or</span> <span data-start="92.149" data-end="96.289">fast a happy user but we really know</span> <span data-start="96.289" data-end="100.67">which is a fast website we call a fast website</span> <span data-start="100.67" data-end="104.6">here I distinguish from two categories on the one hand that the site is literally</span> <span data-start="104.6" data-end="109.31">fast, that is, let's say fast loading, the loading times are short and for the</span> <span data-start="109.31" data-end="112.189">another side is that the user perceives that the site is fast which does not mean</span> <span data-start="112.189" data-end="117.35">the site is fast but the user something happens to him what</span> <span data-start="117.35" data-end="123.92">understand that the site itself is fast and now that keyword comes in which is</span> <span data-start="123.92" data-end="127.62">perception speaking a little bit of perception I</span> <span data-start="127.62" data-end="132.9">would like us to go back to the year 993 jakob nielsen which is a group of</span> <span data-start="132.9" data-end="137.01">toys for those who don't know him they told us one of his books a little bit</span> <span data-start="137.01" data-end="142.17">about limits in perception, that is, how the user reacts over time to</span> <span data-start="142.17" data-end="146.52">the response for example an application or a website</span> <span data-start="146.52" data-end="150.68">about these times in perception are breaking points</span> <span data-start="150.68" data-end="156.33">the first one is 100 milliseconds 0.1 seconds which is in which the user goes</span> <span data-start="156.33" data-end="159.75">to feel that the response you are receiving is instantaneous</span> <span data-start="159.75" data-end="163.77">then we have a second which is from this point where we start a little</span> <span data-start="163.77" data-end="168.75">to give the user's attention his train of thought is going to start to stray</span> <span data-start="168.75" data-end="172.54">and and then it's already the 10 second limit</span> <span data-start="172.54" data-end="176.56">that if we really still have a user who is interested in complying</span> <span data-start="176.56" data-end="180.37">with the aim that I was wanting to do grace we will have lost</span> <span data-start="180.37" data-end="184.42">completely already start to even feel frustration about what you're having</span> <span data-start="184.42" data-end="187.989">performed I think we were all there I don't know who has endured and for today 10</span> <span data-start="187.989" data-end="193.09">seconds with a blank page then us understanding what they are</span> <span data-start="193.09" data-end="196.87">our limits and how the user understands and reacts to this I think that</span> <span data-start="196.87" data-end="200.05">a little bit we can realize where where we want more or less serves</span> <span data-start="200.05" data-end="205.49">showing him some kind of visual acid I think this happens around the</span> <span data-start="205.49" data-end="210.069">second the second we have to give the user give give</span> <span data-start="210.069" data-end="213.55">a wake up call that something is happening</span> <span data-start="213.55" data-end="217.489">ok understood more or less perception and</span> <span data-start="217.489" data-end="222.23">the times we have in our pothole let's say and let's see how we can</span> <span data-start="222.23" data-end="227.269">optimize for that we have to we have to understand what is going on we have</span> <span data-start="227.269" data-end="231.23">that knowing what is happening with rendering here is a little bit that is</span> <span data-start="231.23" data-end="234.53">what is render impact we know we are talking</span> <span data-start="234.53" data-end="238.76">so well what are we really talking about in very general terms</span> <span data-start="238.76" data-end="242.03">basically that is for example we organize an action click a link</span> <span data-start="242.03" data-end="247.55">whatever we get a url and we give sit on what happens up to what the</span> <span data-start="247.55" data-end="251.54">browser performs until complete rendering on screen to our page</span> <span data-start="251.54" data-end="256.519">web for example in very general terms but</span> <span data-start="256.519" data-end="260.48">it is simply the path that the browser takes is a series of</span> <span data-start="260.48" data-end="266">events that meet to reach this goal and that's in very terms</span> <span data-start="266" data-end="270.95">generic but what is this all about let's do the steps one by one are</span> <span data-start="270.95" data-end="275.21">seven steps they perform to fulfill the rendering puff and now we are going to see</span> <span data-start="275.21" data-end="277.73">there how to give criticism to the render impact that only they have also</span> <span data-start="277.73" data-end="283.49">heard first thing basically going to do is</span> <span data-start="283.49" data-end="286.939">generate a network request out a lot of things don't happen there's a in that</span> <span data-start="286.939" data-end="290.99">place you have a cpi connection it is good then finally send</span> <span data-start="290.99" data-end="296.119">http request here between a little and a little we have</span> <span data-start="296.119" data-end="299.419">about 600 milliseconds in which we don't have too much control</span> <span data-start="299.419" data-end="303.28">about what's going on ok let's imagine everything is fine with</span> <span data-start="303.28" data-end="307.56">the request the service what it is going to do is give us an answer</span> <span data-start="307.56" data-end="313.5">depending on our role a little as you want to have a little part in what</span> <span data-start="313.5" data-end="318.18">the answer may take time but well let's imagine it helps Serbian already</span> <span data-start="318.18" data-end="322.71">replied gave us in html now a few advance what would be the critic</span> <span data-start="322.71" data-end="326.15">rendering for the critical part that the user sorry that the browser</span> <span data-start="326.15" data-end="331.02">meets to reach the goal of rendering on screen and all this</span> <span data-start="331.02" data-end="335.99">starts with the html processing I imagine we have the answer that we</span> <span data-start="335.99" data-end="339.83">gave are 8000 is super simple what the browser is going to be it is going to be processed</span> <span data-start="339.83" data-end="345.499">from top to bottom what you need to do is translate it the</span> <span data-start="345.499" data-end="350.569">browser what it will do then is generate the gift to everyone I think we know</span> <span data-start="350.569" data-end="354.569">what is it is a node map in which</span> <span data-start="354.569" data-end="358.83">going to put together all those connections what it will be then is</span> <span data-start="358.83" data-end="361.289">translate for example is in any such encounter begins</span> <span data-start="361.289" data-end="365.52">voluntary title markets etc converts them into new maps
