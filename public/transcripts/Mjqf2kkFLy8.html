<p><span data-start="18.24" data-end="23.369">Hello? Hello, everybody. How is the day going? HTTP\h we have to do that again. How is the day going? HTTP headers for the responsible
developer. Let me tell you about my journey</span> <span data-start="23.369" data-end="28.39">on the web. I was one of these lucky people that had an Internet connection at home very</span> <span data-start="28.39" data-end="33.39">early because my father was a techsavvy person. But in the beginning, I had no idea what to</span> <span data-start="33.39" data-end="38.28">do with the Internet, I could Google or surf, that was it. I was whatever, 12 years old</span> <span data-start="38.28" data-end="44.19">and it was not that exciting. But then I discovered this website, woot.com. Any Germans around?</span> <span data-start="44.19" data-end="51.26">That was one of the first social networks in Germany. And there I was, 1999. This is</span> <span data-start="51.26" data-end="57.2">where I'm coming from, the middle of nowhere in Germany. And I found myself chatting to</span> <span data-start="57.2" data-end="63">people if Berlin. Mainly about music. This is when I found out for the first time that</span> <span data-start="63" data-end="66.61">the web actually connects people. It's not about Googling stuff, it's about connecting</span> <span data-start="66.61" data-end="69.97">people. Then I moved to Berlin and I had a different</span> <span data-start="69.97" data-end="75.891">job initially. In 2010 something interesting happened, I became a web developer. Which</span> <span data-start="75.891" data-end="81.18">was cool. But then the statement that the web connects people actually changed. We as</span> <span data-start="81.18" data-end="87.48">developers have a lot of power. And I 100% believe that we connect people. Because we</span> <span data-start="87.48" data-end="93.81">are building stuff for the Internet. We enable people. And we help people by the</span> <span data-start="93.81" data-end="100.87">stuff that we build. So, let me quickly introduce myself. Hey, I'm Stefan. I work for a company</span> <span data-start="100.87" data-end="106.83">called Twilio. We do communications as an API, S MS and phone calls, and check that</span> <span data-start="106.83" data-end="112.59">out. And the most important thing is, hey, I'm Stefan, and I want to be a responsible</span> <span data-start="112.59" data-end="116.649">developer. So, when we look at the global population,</span> <span data-start="116.649" data-end="122.47">you will find out that 1999, there I was in my little bubble north of Germany. Not much</span> <span data-start="122.47" data-end="127.899">going on. But where actually the most Internet users are coming from today? So, they're coming</span> <span data-start="127.899" data-end="135.069">from China, India and the United States. But this is just global statistics, right? But</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="135.069" data-end="142.689">I also do run a private blog. And only the last month I had 300 people from Brazil reading</span> <span data-start="142.689" data-end="149.019">articles. I had 100 people from Vietnam. And I had 80 people from South Africa. That gets</span> <span data-start="149.019" data-end="152.849">me really excited, right? Who am I? I'm writing stuff and people in Brazil are reading my</span> <span data-start="152.849" data-end="157.949">stuff. But in the end that really doesn't matter because we as web developers should</span> <span data-start="157.949" data-end="165.249">be building for everybody. And when responsive web design came up, I heard this sometime</span> <span data-start="165.249" data-end="170.879">way too often. We don't have users coming from a certain area. We don't have users that</span> <span data-start="170.879" data-end="176.18">use a certain device. When you say these kinds of statements, you're creating a chicken and</span> <span data-start="176.18" data-end="181.209">egg problem. When you don't build stuff that works for people under certain conditions,</span> <span data-start="181.209" data-end="185.909">these people won't use your stuff. But building a good website these days is</span> <span data-start="185.909" data-end="191.079">actually very, very hard. What do you have to do? You have to consider design. Colors</span> <span data-start="191.079" data-end="195.31">around the world are different. You have to bring up good content. You have to consider</span> <span data-start="195.31" data-end="200.15">web performance which is a big topic by itself. You have to make yourself accessible because</span> <span data-start="200.15" data-end="204.489">there maybe people that visit your sites with assistive technology. And you have to find,</span> <span data-start="204.489" data-end="210.7">what should I use, actually? Frameworks are a thing. You have to optimize the network</span> <span data-start="210.7" data-end="214.9">stack and you have to make it work on several devices. And there are many, many more factors</span> <span data-start="214.9" data-end="223.85">out there. And in the next 21 minutes I want to talk about the network stack. So, let's</span> <span data-start="223.85" data-end="228.139">talk about HTTP. So, basically when your browser makes a requests</span> <span data-start="228.139" data-end="234.209">for a resource, what it does, sends value pairs, these are called request headers. And</span> <span data-start="234.209" data-end="239.529">the server responds with another set of key value pairs and the actual resource that you're</span> <span data-start="239.529" data-end="244.879">asking for. So, we're dealing with responsive request headers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="244.879" data-end="250.279">And when I started preparation for this talk, it was trending, so I had to buy a dot Dev</span> <span data-start="250.279" data-end="255.609">domain. You can see the responsible dot div and the site, but it right now has JavaScript</span> <span data-start="255.609" data-end="263.53">disabled. You see when I refresh it, there is some stuff going on. First of all, the</span> <span data-start="263.53" data-end="271.06">script is hijacking, adding unicorns and stuff. But going to this, you can pretend to be my</span> <span data-start="271.06" data-end="276.16">site. You can track what I'm doing, pretending to be my unicorn, not responsible unicorn,</span> <span data-start="276.16" data-end="283.68">but my Dev site. I wanted to make it better just using headers.</span> <span data-start="283.68" data-end="293.32">And the web is scary place. A few months ago, this was in the news. Lots of websites were</span> <span data-start="293.32" data-end="298.039">mining cryptocurrency and the developers that built these sites didn't even know about this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="298.039" data-end="302.599">And the reason for that is when we're building for the web, we're relying on other people</span> <span data-start="302.599" data-end="307.759">building software. Open source is the thing and we're also thirdparties from different</span> <span data-start="307.759" data-end="313.71">domains. So, we always rely on others and our belief that the web has to be safe. The</span> <span data-start="313.71" data-end="319.9">biggest part of being safe is HTTPS. So, without HTTPS, what is possible is that</span> <span data-start="319.9" data-end="324.43">someone can Open up a public WiFi and you're browsing with HTTP, this person could pretend</span> <span data-start="324.43" data-end="329.99">to be the WiFi and get the requests and mess with you. Or get the passports that you're</span> <span data-start="329.99" data-end="341.47">sending over HTTP. HTTPS lets you use HTTP/2 and service workers and media. And in my bubble,</span> <span data-start="341.47" data-end="348.599">I think it's the standard. But there's a site out there called why no HTTPS and it is many,</span> <span data-start="348.599" data-end="356.86">many sites not enforcing HTTPS yet. When you go into the list, you find out that there's</span> <span data-start="356.86" data-end="363.689">a massive German media outlet not enforcing HTTPS which is surprising.</span> <span data-start="363.689" data-end="372.41">When you run on HTTPS, you want to ensure that it is always HTTPS and on a secure connection.</span> <span data-start="372.41" data-end="377.78">So, what you can do is you can set the strict transport security header which you can define</span> <span data-start="377.78" data-end="384.479">a max H property in seconds. This will tell the browser, hey, please only use this website</span> <span data-start="384.479" data-end="389.991">or these resources over HTTPS. You can define how wide it should range. And you can, if</span> <span data-start="389.991" data-end="394.74">you want to go the extra mile, you can define a preload director which basically allows</span> <span data-start="394.74" data-end="400.789">you to supplement your site to another site, which is called HTTPS preload. And the thing</span> <span data-start="400.789" data-end="407.62">about that is that browsers internally keep lists of websites that should only be on HTTPS.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="407.62" data-end="415.069">This is the configuration\hprofile in Chromium. It's thousands of sites that will never work</span> <span data-start="415.069" data-end="422.939">on HTTP. If you wonder why dot Dev domains are not over HTTP anymore, that's the reason.</span> <span data-start="422.939" data-end="430.069">They're in this file. But HTTPS is not only about security. What happens when you type</span> <span data-start="430.069" data-end="436.749">in the address of the browser? It the make an HTTPS request and could lead to a delay</span> <span data-start="436.749" data-end="442.219">of 35 seconds depending on the connection. And you can skip this request because the</span> <span data-start="442.219" data-end="449.789">browser knows we're going HTTPS. That's it. So, how is the support for HTTPS? We're pretty</span> <span data-start="449.789" data-end="455.4">green here. Pretty sweet. But enforcing HTTPS is not the easiest thing in the world when</span> <span data-start="455.4" data-end="462.419">dealing with big projects when a lot of people are putting a lot of source code in your codebase.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="462.419" data-end="470.499">How do you tackle this approach to go over HTTPS? When you run your site over HTTPS and</span> <span data-start="470.499" data-end="477.469">you make a request to an HTTP, it may be blocked by the browser. You can set a content security</span> <span data-start="477.469" data-end="485.46">header with the directive and this magically updates all the requests to be HTTPS and secure.</span> <span data-start="485.46" data-end="491.36">That is supercool. But this is not the main purpose of CSP. The main purpose of CSP is</span> <span data-start="491.36" data-end="496.29">that you want to limit what is allowed inside of your websites. And you can configure a</span> <span data-start="496.29" data-end="499.919">lot of things. So, this is the complete list of what is possible</span> <span data-start="499.919" data-end="505.039">with CSP. You can define where should fonts be loaded from, where should images be loaded</span> <span data-start="505.039" data-end="511.789">from. And a few cutting-edge things in there like this opener. Navigate too. And you can</span> <span data-start="511.789" data-end="518.139">basically trim down what is allowed in your website and you can avoid mining cryptocurrency</span> <span data-start="518.139" data-end="524.139">in your website because a thirdparty got hacked. You can use CSP with a meta element in your</span> <span data-start="524.139" data-end="530.76">HTML or you set a header like this. This is the head their I ship for my private</span> <span data-start="530.76" data-end="537.25">website. And includes all the thirdparties that I have. And coming up with this is actually</span> <span data-start="537.25" data-end="542.58">very, very hard. I deployed CSP three times and broke my site and rolled back. So, what</span> <span data-start="542.58" data-end="547.24">you want to do is you want to set a different header which is report only which then allows</span> <span data-start="547.24" data-end="553.66">you to define an HTTP end point and then you get all the warnings of requests that would</span> <span data-start="553.66" data-end="559.81">be blocked if this would be active. And you can start monitoring what is going on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="559.81" data-end="564.33">When you watch this\h when you have a detailed look at this, you will find out there is something</span> <span data-start="564.33" data-end="570.55">not right. I have unsafe in line and unsafe evil right there and it bothers me. But I'm</span> <span data-start="570.55" data-end="577.33">using a JavaScript a that inlines JavaScript JSON in the body so that the JavaScript framework</span> <span data-start="577.33" data-end="583.639">end gets the state. And I'm working on fixing that. It's not the easiest when dealing with</span> <span data-start="583.639" data-end="589.57">a framework. The way this should work is that inline scripts, when you have CSP enabled,</span> <span data-start="589.57" data-end="593.589">you have two ways You can either define a hashed value in your</span> <span data-start="593.589" data-end="600.149">CSP directive so that you can say, hey, this hashed value should be allowed in my website.</span> <span data-start="600.149" data-end="605.35">This is a little bit brittle, though, because now when you update your contents of the script,</span> <span data-start="605.35" data-end="610.519">then you have to change this header or your meta element in the edge. What you can do</span> <span data-start="610.519" data-end="615.721">is you can define a nonce value. Giving an ID and say, hey, this part is cool. Please</span> <span data-start="615.721" data-end="624.3">allow this. So, also support for CSP. CSP is out there in two levels. Level one, all</span> <span data-start="624.3" data-end="629.56">green. Pretty cool. Cutting edge stuff and more fancy stuff is a little bit jumpy still.</span> <span data-start="629.56" data-end="634.91">And there might be things missing. But you can have a look at that. So, I think this</span> <span data-start="634.91" data-end="639.649">technology is very exciting because it makes the web a safer place. How many websites use</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="639.649" data-end="649.279">CSP, there is a website that crawls the Internet and you can write search queries. And when</span> <span data-start="649.279" data-end="656.079">you do that, you will see that only 6% of the crawled websites use CSP. This is surprisingly</span> <span data-start="656.079" data-end="663.029">low, and I think we can do better. So, when you want to start working with CSP, start</span> <span data-start="663.029" data-end="668.6">in report mode. Monitor what is coming in and out. Don't break your site. And then only</span> <span data-start="668.6" data-end="674.14">when you are safe and you know that all your request resources are white listed, then you</span> <span data-start="674.14" data-end="682.029">can turn it off. For my site, I added a new route,/safe. And</span> <span data-start="682.029" data-end="694.44">then see that the unicorns are gone. And Chrome is saying I'm not reported yet. But I go to</span> <span data-start="694.44" data-end="699.73">CodePen and go to the framing site, Chrome will say, hey\hthis is not allowed for the</span> <span data-start="699.73" data-end="705.54">site. People cannot hijack my stuff which is pretty cool. This makes the website safer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="705.54" data-end="713.8">This is important, the web is important for people. I travel quite a bit a little bit.</span> <span data-start="713.8" data-end="720.329">I was in the Ukraine two months ago. I get off the plane and I get this message by my</span> <span data-start="720.329" data-end="726.86">mobile provider. It basically tells me this. And just because this is ridiculous, I get</span> <span data-start="726.86" data-end="732.87">six megabytes are for 2 Euros. But I have to use it in 24 hours. This didn't hold me</span> <span data-start="732.87" data-end="746.08">30 minutes. The web needs to be affordable. Don't request the same content over and over</span> <span data-start="746.08" data-end="753.68">and over again. You can set proper caching headers. Caching is very, very tricky.</span> <span data-start="753.68" data-end="758.37">And I'm only going briefly into it. I'm defining there in seconds a max H property and telling</span> <span data-start="758.37" data-end="765.36">it, this is how long this resource could be potentially cached. But this doesn't necessarily</span> <span data-start="765.36" data-end="770.55">mean that there are no requests flying because browser also revalidates if the resources</span> <span data-start="770.55" data-end="776.12">changed. So, what is cool, you can define an immutable directive, telling the browser,</span> <span data-start="776.12" data-end="785.74">hey, this is maybe a hashed style, hash. JSS or something. The browser will not revalidate</span> <span data-start="785.74" data-end="791.819">stuff. That's cool. You can save some requests. Unfortunately, the spot for immutable is not</span> <span data-start="791.819" data-end="797.67">that great anymore. It was supported in Edge, but now Edge switched to Chromium. If you</span> <span data-start="797.67" data-end="802.959">want to learn more about caching, highly recommend this article by Harry Roberts. It goes over</span> <span data-start="802.959" data-end="809">the directives and if you wanted to set proper caching control headers, check this out. It's</span> <span data-start="809" data-end="814.04">not only about requests, it's about sending the right data. What happens when your browser</span> <span data-start="814.04" data-end="822.69">requests HTML? It sends a header called accept encoding and tells the server, hey, this is</span> <span data-start="822.69" data-end="829.56">what I understand. Cool. And you see the DEFLATE and Boat LY. It's a different compression</span> <span data-start="829.56" data-end="835.72">algorithm. And I took a CSS file and compressed with two different compression algorithms.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="835.72" data-end="842.831">You can see that by itself it's a little bit smaller than Gzip. But surprisingly, people</span> <span data-start="842.831" data-end="849.3">are not using that often because what the whole industry things is that Boat LY compression</span> <span data-start="849.3" data-end="858.589">is so slow. Hard\hencode. With Gzip, the server compresses and makes a Gzip. It might be a</span> <span data-start="858.589" data-end="864.13">little bit slow. But when you say this sentence, what you're basically doing is you're comparing</span> <span data-start="864.13" data-end="868.93">apples with oranges. Let's look at Gzip and Boat LY. Gzip has nine</span> <span data-start="868.93" data-end="878.339">modes, Boat LY has 11. When you use these in default mode, Gzip runs in level 6 and</span> <span data-start="878.339" data-end="886.079">Boat LY runs in level 11. Between those, level 6 in Gzip is optimized for speed and compression</span> <span data-start="886.079" data-end="894.22">ratio. The other default is there to save the file size. When you tweak a little bit</span> <span data-start="894.22" data-end="899.529">and go not with the default mode, but rather level 4, it compresses better with the same</span> <span data-start="899.529" data-end="906.319">speed on the fly. You can set this. Maybe you have a build process in place, and you</span> <span data-start="906.319" data-end="912.16">don't to want compress it on the fly because you have a build process in place. You could</span> <span data-start="912.16" data-end="918.899">compress all the files and serve them to save some kilobytes. If you want to learn about</span> <span data-start="918.899" data-end="925.68">this topic, there is extensive research about what that means.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="925.68" data-end="932.149">What's the support? Pretty there. All the big sights like Facebook, Dropbox, they are</span> <span data-start="932.149" data-end="937.73">shipping Boat LY. And I would hope that we do more things with this. It's not only about</span> <span data-start="937.73" data-end="945.42">compression. It's about serving tailored media. They cost the mode amount of data on the web.</span> <span data-start="945.42" data-end="950.649">When you're doing frontend and you want to ship, for example, an image, a little bit</span> <span data-start="950.649" data-end="956.199">smaller than JPEG. You find yourself building things like this. This is a picture element.</span> <span data-start="956.199" data-end="962.81">Responsive images for several sizes and ships when the browser understands it. This is horrible,</span> <span data-start="962.81" data-end="969.149">right? You do feature detection, this will break when the next person comes in. But guess</span> <span data-start="969.149" data-end="974.42">what? The browser also tells the server what image formats they're going to send. So, what</span> <span data-start="974.42" data-end="979.629">you could do potentially for browsers that support WebP, is you could read this header</span> <span data-start="979.629" data-end="986.291">and serve a WebP image instead of a JPEG when the browser tells you that this works. But</span> <span data-start="986.291" data-end="991.61">you can go even further. When someone requests your website and you said, for example, the</span> <span data-start="991.61" data-end="997.189">accept CH header, this stands for client hint, you can tell the browser, hey, I would like</span> <span data-start="997.189" data-end="1002.649">to know how wide your viewport is and please tell me for the next 100 seconds. What happens</span> <span data-start="1002.649" data-end="1007.48">then for the additional image requests is that the browse her tell you dimensions of</span> <span data-start="1007.48" data-end="1013.96">the images. How cool is that? This means that you can use normal images without all the</span> <span data-start="1013.96" data-end="1017.839">responsive images stuff. But you have to give it a size attribute.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1017.839" data-end="1022.85">So, that the browser up front knows how this image is laid out. And this is then the request</span> <span data-start="1022.85" data-end="1028.39">that goes out. It will tell viewport with Nth of their image. And guess what? When you're</span> <span data-start="1028.39" data-end="1035.52">on a high pixel resolution display it will tell you the real size of the image. You can</span> <span data-start="1035.52" data-end="1041.69">then serve proper images via server-side generation or service worker which is pretty cool. I'm</span> <span data-start="1041.69" data-end="1047.329">excited about this. This is a little bit cutting edge. If you want to learn about client hints,</span> <span data-start="1047.329" data-end="1052.17">check out this resource. He does a lot of cool things around this topic.</span> <span data-start="1052.17" data-end="1058.08">So, I tweaked another side of my responsible Dev site. You see there, slash affordable.</span> <span data-start="1058.08" data-end="1065.93">You see that I'm shipping and also the image element is a JPEG. But serving web P without</span> <span data-start="1065.93" data-end="1077">any markup changes and tells me how big the image is. And without changing the viewport,</span> <span data-start="1077" data-end="1082.87">the server knows who resources to ship and what image would be the perfect fit here.</span> <span data-start="1082.87" data-end="1088.65">The web has to be affordable because the web is with us every day. Unfortunately, we reached</span> <span data-start="1088.65" data-end="1097.47">this state in the web right now. It's not playing? Here we go. This is made</span> <span data-start="1097.47" data-end="1112.641">by a former colleague of mine. This is where we are, right? We are web developers. This</span> <span data-start="1112.641" data-end="1118.88">is what we build. I believe that the web has to be respectful. And one of the most things</span> <span data-start="1118.88" data-end="1123.53">that we should honor more is time. And we should get the stuff that we shipped down</span> <span data-start="1123.53" data-end="1128.04">more quickly. So, what you can do is you can optimize the loading process for certain things,</span> <span data-start="1128.04" data-end="1133.95">and you can use link preload in your HTML oar set a header which then gives information</span> <span data-start="1133.95" data-end="1138.4">to the browser telling, hey, you will need these resources. Please start loading it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1138.4" data-end="1144.94">Because a person doesn't want to wait for a font to kick in and watch a blank screen.</span> <span data-start="1144.94" data-end="1148.51">When you use the HTTP header, you have to be a little bit careful though when you're</span> <span data-start="1148.51" data-end="1155.15">using certain proxy servers or CDNs. Think preload will lead to the server push command</span> <span data-start="1155.15" data-end="1159.25">which is then not taking the browser cache into consideration.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1159.25" data-end="1164.69">So, if you use this header, you have to use no push. This is great to speed up credit</span> <span data-start="1164.69" data-end="1170.8">calorie sources. How is the support today for link preload? It's pretty good. You can</span> <span data-start="1170.8" data-end="1176.47">add these things and optimize the loading process to get your fonts or header images</span> <span data-start="1176.47" data-end="1181.87">down quicker and optimize for the time of your visitors.</span> <span data-start="1181.87" data-end="1187.2">The next thing I want to talk about is the AMP reaction. So, two and a half years ago</span> <span data-start="1187.2" data-end="1191.51">I was giving a talk about AMP and how it works technically. Actually, versus very interesting</span> <span data-start="1191.51" data-end="1197.25">what they do. And when AMP was released, doing a lot of standard work and spec writing and</span> <span data-start="1197.25" data-end="1202.13">then the web ecosystem. What he did is when he saw that we need to come up with an alternative</span> <span data-start="1202.13" data-end="1207.42">very, very quickly because AMP is very JavaScriptdriven. And this is very cool because now two years</span> <span data-start="1207.42" data-end="1212.78">later what is slowly coming is the feature policy header. What you can do there is you</span> <span data-start="1212.78" data-end="1218.32">can define what should be allowed in your website. And there's a lot of cool stuff possible</span> <span data-start="1218.32" data-end="1221.65">that you can configure. It could be possible that a thirdparty script</span> <span data-start="1221.65" data-end="1228.18">coming from somewhere accesses\h wants to access my camera. I think this is cool that</span> <span data-start="1228.18" data-end="1232.32">you can block a lot of things that shouldn't be possible by default. Unfortunately, we're</span> <span data-start="1232.32" data-end="1237.18">now entering a little bit of cutting-edge technology here. But there are cool things</span> <span data-start="1237.18" data-end="1243.77">like unoptimized media and optimized images. You can limit yourself and tell the browser</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1243.77" data-end="1250.75">I don't want to ship, even accidently, massive images. You can then also define this for</span> <span data-start="1250.75" data-end="1255.9">iFrames. And there will be a JavaScript\h it's already shipping in Chromium browsers</span> <span data-start="1255.9" data-end="1260.2">there's also a JavaScript API that lets you access these values that came in via header.</span> <span data-start="1260.2" data-end="1265.521">This JavaScript API is still under discussion, though, so, please use that carefully. If</span> <span data-start="1265.521" data-end="1271.82">you had to look at this list very carefully, you might have noticed that there was one</span> <span data-start="1271.82" data-end="1276.04">thing missing in this huge list of things that you don't want to allow on your site.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1276.04" data-end="1281.2">What's the most annoying one on websites these days? Push notifications, right? People working</span> <span data-start="1281.2" data-end="1286.22">on these kinds of things figured out handling push notifications and disallowing them are</span> <span data-start="1286.22" data-end="1291.18">trickier than first thoughts. If you want to know how we go with these kinds of things,</span> <span data-start="1291.18" data-end="1297.781">you can follow this issue. What's the support for feature policy? We're not that bad. Which</span> <span data-start="1297.781" data-end="1302.12">is prettying with pretty cool. So, with these kinds of headers, I set up</span> <span data-start="1302.12" data-end="1307.05">another site,/respectful. And what you see is the permission dialogue is gone because</span> <span data-start="1307.05" data-end="1315.6">I don't allow it. And also, the JSConf PNG in the bottom and defined in CSS, I pushed</span> <span data-start="1315.6" data-end="1321.11">that to be loaded quicker which makes make the experience a little bit better. So, building</span> <span data-start="1321.11" data-end="1325.66">for the web is very, very, very hard these days. There are so many things to consider.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1325.66" data-end="1330.51">You have to think about the design, the content, web performance, accessibility, frameworks,</span> <span data-start="1330.51" data-end="1334.26">network and devices. And there's surely more things that you have to consider when you're</span> <span data-start="1334.26" data-end="1340.65">building for the web. So, all things headers, this 20minute rundown is not a complete one.</span> <span data-start="1340.65" data-end="1346.12">If you want a complete overview, my friend Shepp maintains this slide deck. This is a</span> <span data-start="1346.12" data-end="1351.27">massive resource if you want to know what HTTP headers are out there and you can Google</span> <span data-start="1351.27" data-end="1357.61">headers for hackers. And Andrew Betz give this is fantastic talk if you want to know</span> <span data-start="1357.61" data-end="1363.47">more. I really believe that the web has to be safe.</span> <span data-start="1363.47" data-end="1370.88">My mother shouldn't browse the web and mine cryptocurrency. People pay a different amount</span> <span data-start="1370.88" data-end="1375.82">of money depend on which situation they are and where they are in the world. And it has</span> <span data-start="1375.82" data-end="1381.91">to be respectful because nobody likes a person that is asking random questions and permissions</span> <span data-start="1381.91" data-end="1387.75">all the time. So, the web has to be safe, affordable and respectful so that it really</span> <span data-start="1387.75" data-end="1394.77">is for everybody. Thank you very much.</span> </p>
