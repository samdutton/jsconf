data-end="886.1">know I can tell I'm a mirrored it's very</span> <span data-start="886.1" data-end="889.22">confusing right so now and in fact just</span> <span data-start="889.22" data-end="891.26">to show you what that's doing I've set</span> <span data-start="891.26" data-end="896.38">the line which to be the length / 10</span> <span data-start="896.38"

better</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="913.85" data-end="915.589">I know can you believe it it's going to</span> <span data-start="915.589" data-end="918.38">get even better so now these branches</span> <span data-start="918.38" data-end="920.03">are all kind of a bit straight let's</span> <span data-start="920.03" data-end="923.78">make them a bit then d I know ok so</span> <span data-start="923.78" data-end="926.12">let's bend these up a bit right and not</span> <span data-start="926.12" data-end="927.74">as well as translating the origin you</span> <span data-start="927.74" data-end="930.53">can actually also rotate it and so I'm</span> <span data-start="930.53" data-end="933.379">going to rotate the origin well when</span> <span data-start="933.379"

data-end="1405.789">in dense right in the only thing i miss</span> <span data-start="1405.789" data-end="1407.71">boring the cut the branch object that</span> <span data-start="1407.71" data-end="1409.69">were in but we actually need to check to</span> <span data-start="1409.69" data-end="1414.33">see if it's got any children that it has</span> <span data-start="1414.33" data-end="1418.51">then we therefore each one of those as</span> <span data-start="1418.51" data-end="1424.9">well so here we cool and i thought this</span> <span data-start="1424.9" data-end="1427.99">game last is lazy oh look I made a</span> <span data-start="1427.99" data-end="1431.5">mistake I made any mistakes this place</span> <span data-start="1431.5" data-end="1436.18">probably add a semi boom probably see</span> <span data-start="1436.18" data-end="1439.3">what else is complaining about missing</span> <span data-start="1439.3" data-end="1441.9">saw another missing semicolon well I</span> <span data-start="1441.9" data-end="1444.94">like putting my semicolons in so I'm</span> <span data-start="1444.94" data-end="1446.8">going to put that in makes me feel</span> <span data-start="1446.8" data-end="1448.99">better alright so now what we got well</span> <span data-start="1448.99" data-end="1451.72">we should hopefully have a tree and I'm</span> <span data-start="1451.72" data-end="1453.64">here instead of calling branch where we</span> <span data-start="1453.64" data-end="1455.5">should probably draw our tree no idea if</span> <span data-start="1455.5" data-end="1457.12">this is going to work probably made some</span> <span data-start="1457.12" data-end="1459.73">mistakes she notice anything wave us run</span> <span data-start="1459.73" data-end="1462.31">it we run it and see what happens it's</span> <span data-start="1462.31" data-end="1465.37">the same as we had before except this</span> <span data-start="1465.37" data-end="1468.16">time that tree is getting drawn over and</span> <span data-start="1468.16" data-end="1470.05">over again but in exactly the same place</span> <span data-start="1470.05" data-end="1472.33">this means we can now make this tree</span> <span data-start="1472.33" data-end="1474.43">grow and I am running out of time let's</span> <span data-start="1474.43" data-end="1476.23">do it see how quickly i can do it well</span> <span data-start="1476.23" data-end="1478.72">i'm going to make a variable called</span> <span

data-end="1533.02">hopefully ah I've done I run now</span> <span data-start="1533.02" data-end="1535.27">hopefully it should grow there you go</span> <span data-start="1535.27" data-end="1537.57">it's

<p><span data-start="1537.57" data-end="1539.74">I've we have a problem everyone the</span> <span data-start="1539.74" data-end="1541.39">trees and stopping grown everyone that's</span> <span data-start="1541.39" data-end="1543.85">pretty serious oh my gods it stop it</span> <span data-start="1543.85" data-end="1548.68">I'll just going to need and i can see</span> <span data-start="1548.68" data-end="1550.81">you appreciate thank you only I could</span> <span data-start="1550.81" data-end="1552.52">hear you would be brilliant so instead</span> <span data-start="1552.52" data-end="1555.1">of just adding point 01 to it I wanted</span> <span data-start="1555.1" data-end="1557.89">to ease towards under there's this and</span> <span data-start="1557.89" data-end="1560.92">thick function you can do to make it</span> <span data-start="1560.92" data-end="1565.36">easier position I'm really running out</span> </p>

data-end="1584.14">eventually stopped when i get that it</span> <span data-start="1584.14" data-end="1585.76">doesn't look very realistic the growth</span> <span data-start="1585.76" data-end="1588.01">so i'm going to iron you know I need to</span> <span data-start="1588.01" data-end="1590.17">do i need to stall which generation</span> <span data-start="1590.17"

going</span> <span data-start="1638.11" data-end="1642.16">to use up here to set a delay and i'm</span> <span data-start="1642.16" data-end="1645.01">going to set that to be gen x 10 and so</span> <span data-start="1645.01" data-end="1646.54">now down here instead of just adding</span> <span data-start="1646.54" data-end="1651.57">anything to the growth i can say if oh</span> <span
