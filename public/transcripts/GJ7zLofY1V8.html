<p><span data-start="108.579" data-end="124.329">So, I</span> <span data-start="124.329" data-end="132.079">used to have this dream that was about creating robots that could help me with these chores</span> <span data-start="132.079" data-end="134.59">I had.</span> <span data-start="134.59" data-end="138.349">But then I grew up.</span> <span data-start="138.349" data-end="145.439">And I still have chores even more than before.</span> <span data-start="145.439" data-end="148.15">And now I have two cats.</span> <span data-start="148.15" data-end="150.069">Orson and Heckl.</span> <span data-start="150.069" data-end="156.599">And sometimes they had to be they had to wait for me to be fed.</span> <span data-start="156.599" data-end="160.379">Needless to say, I rarely get home early.</span> <span data-start="160.379" data-end="173.04">If I give them the day serving in the morning, they ate it by noon and when I get home at</span> <span data-start="173.04" data-end="174.659">night, they're hungry.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="174.659" data-end="183.569">So, I needed to figure out a way to give them their serving twice a day.</span> <span data-start="183.569" data-end="184.819">Right?</span> <span data-start="184.819" data-end="186.079">Okay?</span> <span data-start="186.079" data-end="195.719">And so, now I know that's why I decided to build this.</span> <span data-start="195.719" data-end="202.749">I know nowadays there are a lot of options that fill our needs.</span> <span data-start="202.749" data-end="209.639">But some are expensive, and I can't afford them.</span> <span data-start="209.639" data-end="214.18">That's the reason why I built the pet feeder.</span> <span data-start="214.18" data-end="223.87">So, then I started Googling similar projects that could guide me in the development.</span> <span data-start="223.87" data-end="226.379">I saw a lot of the examples.</span> <span data-start="226.379" data-end="232.719">Most of them were built, and the structure was just for one cup.</span> <span data-start="232.719" data-end="240.689">However, what I needed was something that could feed both cats at the same time.</span> <span data-start="240.689" data-end="249.68">Because I don't have much space in my home and because it's cheaper than having two machines,</span> <span data-start="249.68" data-end="250.68">right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="250.68" data-end="256.539">So, I knew that I will need a dispenser as a container.</span> <span data-start="256.539" data-end="259.789">Several motors to move the container legs.</span> <span data-start="259.789" data-end="263.409">And a microcontroller to run program.</span> <span data-start="263.409" data-end="267.55">But I didn't know which one.</span> <span data-start="267.55" data-end="270.65">Because there are a lot of it in the market.</span> <span data-start="270.65" data-end="280.629">So, I had to decide if I will use a Raspberry Pi or an Arduino or something else.</span> <span data-start="280.629" data-end="289.97">For some reason I thought that a Raspberry Pi would be the best option due to how easy</span> <span data-start="289.97" data-end="295.06">to work is its operating system.</span> <span data-start="295.06" data-end="304.61">So, someone lent me a Raspberry Pi which I had to configure it from scratch as well.</span> <span data-start="304.61" data-end="312.639">And I decided to use JavaScript develop the feeder because I'm learning to program with</span> <span data-start="312.639" data-end="313.639">this language.</span> <span data-start="313.639" data-end="322.84">So, I made research and found a platform called Johnny 5 that allows you to work in robotic</span> <span data-start="322.84" data-end="327.65">systems with JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="327.65" data-end="340.419">But before using Johnny 5, I installed RasPiO which is a plugin that allows you to use Johnny</span> <span data-start="340.419" data-end="345.83">5 in the Raspberry Pi.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="345.83" data-end="350.3">I used packages for run for all of this stuff.</span> <span data-start="350.3" data-end="352.639">I used NodeJS.</span> <span data-start="352.639" data-end="358.24">So, the configure of RasPiO and Johnny 5 is pretty easy.</span> <span data-start="358.24" data-end="365.55">You just have to start it and acquire the module in your JS file.</span> <span data-start="365.55" data-end="379.939">I'd never built something like that and my knowledge on the subject was new.</span> <span data-start="379.939" data-end="389.28">All I know from movies that there are conventions for connecting the wires.</span> <span data-start="389.28" data-end="400.819">So, all I wanted to do was not to burn my house because it would be terrible.</span> <span data-start="400.819" data-end="410.22">So, after the setup of the Raspberry Pi, the first thing I tried was to turn on tiny lights.</span> <span data-start="410.22" data-end="415.05">And to my surprise, it worked.</span> <span data-start="415.05" data-end="420.699">So thank you.</span> <span data-start="420.699" data-end="427.56">[ Applause ] So, I got into the world of several motors</span> <span data-start="427.56" data-end="429.879">and I tried to make one work.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="429.879" data-end="431.789">But that part wasn't that easy.</span> <span data-start="431.789" data-end="435.55">As I was suspecting.</span> <span data-start="435.55" data-end="441.949">So, the Raspberry Pi has a lot of pins to put the wires.</span> <span data-start="441.949" data-end="445.35">But you can't use any.</span> <span data-start="445.35" data-end="450.12">I connected wires to different pins on the server motor.</span> <span data-start="450.12" data-end="457.12">It didn't work until I found out that there are some things that need to be connected</span> <span data-start="457.12" data-end="458.55">to a specific pin.</span> <span data-start="458.55" data-end="464.02">For example, controlling the server module place.</span> <span data-start="464.02" data-end="473.37">So, to do that you need to connect to a PWN which is a pulse with modulation pin.</span> <span data-start="473.37" data-end="478.699">And the Raspberry Pi has just four of them.</span> <span data-start="478.699" data-end="482.229">So, I connected to a wire.</span> <span data-start="482.229" data-end="483.99">GPO18.</span> <span data-start="483.99" data-end="495.069">And the other wires must be connected to a 5volt pin and a ground pin.</span> <span data-start="495.069" data-end="504.68">So, during the process I learned that not all server modules are the same.</span> <span data-start="504.68" data-end="507.979">Some of them turn 45 degrees.</span> <span data-start="507.979" data-end="509.09">Others, 180 degrees.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="509.09" data-end="514.909">And there's some with continuous rotation.</span> <span data-start="514.909" data-end="521.56">I used all of them until I found the one I needed.</span> <span data-start="521.56" data-end="524.01">Okay.</span> <span data-start="524.01" data-end="534.09">You know that you must consider the weight of what you want to move.</span> <span data-start="534.09" data-end="539.66">So, I had to try several modules for different weights.</span> <span data-start="539.66" data-end="543.71">My house was full of servers.</span> <span data-start="543.71" data-end="548.38">But I chose the one that can receive 3.2 kilos.</span> <span data-start="548.38" data-end="549.38">So, I'm sorry.</span> <span data-start="549.38" data-end="557.52">[ Laughter ] Yes, that was a problem.</span> <span data-start="557.52" data-end="563.279">Because I can't stop I can't make it stop the server modules.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="563.279" data-end="570.76">And so, the food overflowed a lot of times all over the table.</span> <span data-start="570.76" data-end="572.829">That drove my cats crazy.</span> <span data-start="572.829" data-end="580.77">So, in fact, they heard the sound of the food getting out of the feeder and came running</span> <span data-start="580.77" data-end="585.25">to me and started meowing and at first it was very funny.</span> <span data-start="585.25" data-end="586.27">Okay.</span> <span data-start="586.27" data-end="595.139">But it turns out that to move a server motor with continuous rotation, you need to move</span> <span data-start="595.139" data-end="596.57">the blade clockwise.</span> <span data-start="596.57" data-end="609.11">So, it’s necessary to set the top speed of the server blades when you want to stop.</span> <span data-start="609.11" data-end="617.07">So, I set the feeder to give them the food twice a day.</span> <span data-start="617.07" data-end="622.209">For that I used an npm package.</span> <span data-start="622.209" data-end="625.48">You just have to set the minutes.</span> <span data-start="625.48" data-end="627.96">Every 15 minutes.</span> <span data-start="627.96" data-end="630.04">And then the hours.</span> <span data-start="630.04" data-end="631.18">That's it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="631.18" data-end="638.98">They eat at 8:15 and 9:15 p.m.</span> <span data-start="638.98" data-end="648.63">So, thanks to that, I left the pet feeder running.</span> <span data-start="648.63" data-end="654.37">And thanks to that, I realized that the feeder wasn't working properly because it was letting</span> <span data-start="654.37" data-end="658.029">out the food every hour.</span> <span data-start="658.029" data-end="663.25">So, they were crazy.</span> <span data-start="663.25" data-end="665.06">Yes.</span> <span data-start="665.06" data-end="672.36">They wanted to eat all the food they can see.</span> <span data-start="672.36" data-end="674.079">I'm sorry.</span> <span data-start="674.079" data-end="682.43">So, for I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was the problem.</span> <span data-start="682.43" data-end="691.23">And I found out that the library, the package wasn't working properly.</span> <span data-start="691.23" data-end="695.329">So, I replaced that package for another one.</span> <span data-start="695.329" data-end="699.16">And everything was all right.</span> <span data-start="699.16" data-end="702.72">So, the feeder was almost done.</span> <span data-start="702.72" data-end="708.699">But one day my cats got up really, really early.</span> <span data-start="708.699" data-end="711.42">Like 5 a.m.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="711.42" data-end="713.51">And they started mewing loudly.</span> <span data-start="713.51" data-end="716.91">I was a little bit sleepy.</span> <span data-start="716.91" data-end="720.86">And tried to get up and fill their bowls.</span> <span data-start="720.86" data-end="726.12">But I knew that if I didn't get up, they would keep crying.</span> <span data-start="726.12" data-end="735.089">And so, that was the point where I thought that I should include a new feature.</span> <span data-start="735.089" data-end="745.57">Send an email from the comfort of my bed and go back to sleep.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="745.57" data-end="752.68">So, I started looking for other packages.</span> <span data-start="752.68" data-end="763.22">And by the time I felt like this little cat sticking its nose in every package, his tongue.</span> <span data-start="763.22" data-end="768.28">Until I got the right one for this project.</span> <span data-start="768.28" data-end="777.38">So, to then develop this new feature, I found this package that allows you to set up the</span> <span data-start="777.38" data-end="778.87">configuration.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="778.87" data-end="784.43">It was very easy to include this package in my project.</span> <span data-start="784.43" data-end="794.3">And in this case, I wanted the feeder to start working only if I was the immediate sender.</span> <span data-start="794.3" data-end="801.47">So, this was the feeder before it became a robot.</span> <span data-start="801.47" data-end="806.61">And after a lot of time developing and testing yeah.</span> <span data-start="806.61" data-end="812.22">The feeder is called Sascha.</span> <span data-start="812.22" data-end="816.11">I finished it with this final structure.</span> <span data-start="816.11" data-end="819.13">That's awesome.</span> <span data-start="819.13" data-end="827.449">With the help of my friend because there are a lot of things that I can't do.</span> <span data-start="827.449" data-end="831.41">So, we included those.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="831.41" data-end="838.149">Before that it was just one tube.</span> <span data-start="838.149" data-end="848.06">I want to say this separation of those two is made by was made by that.</span> <span data-start="848.06" data-end="862.32">So, I can say that the dream that I had when I was a child came true.</span> <span data-start="862.32" data-end="888.139">[ Applause ] So, I'm building Sascha and getting all these</span> <span data-start="888.139" data-end="894.589">made me know I wanted to do more projects involving robotics.</span> <span data-start="894.589" data-end="900.37">That there are a lot of potential use cases of home automation that I would love to implement</span> <span data-start="900.37" data-end="908.87">like controlling nonsmart things like lights or the airconditioner.</span> <span data-start="908.87" data-end="913.99">Or controlling the temperature of the room.</span> <span data-start="913.99" data-end="924.339">So, I think that it's you can build this feeder just with a little JavaScript knowledge.</span> <span data-start="924.339" data-end="926.3">It's not too complicated.</span> <span data-start="926.3" data-end="934.529">And it's a nice activity to teach you how to code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="934.529" data-end="941.019">Even if there are parts that involve not coding like building the structure and gluing pieces,</span> <span data-start="941.019" data-end="949.88">et cetera, why is it a nice activity to code?</span> <span data-start="949.88" data-end="957.779">You can teach conditionals and setting up packages and the microcontroller so you can</span> <span data-start="957.779" data-end="963.11">introducing beginners to the art of setting up their computers.</span> <span data-start="963.11" data-end="977.959">I don't know much JavaScript because I started learning to program like two years ago.</span> <span data-start="977.959" data-end="984.939">But I'm sure that there are amazing projects to be built and to be shown.</span> <span data-start="984.939" data-end="992.889">Maybe those projects can inspire others other people to the things to facilitate chores</span> <span data-start="992.889" data-end="1000.85">or change how they interact with their home just with a little bit of code.</span> <span data-start="1000.85" data-end="1009.2">So, that's all I have.</span> </p>
