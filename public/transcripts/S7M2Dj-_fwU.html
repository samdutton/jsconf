data-start="1944.28" data-end="1947.37">see around this area here that things</span> <span data-start="1947.37" data-end="1949.2">are changed much is because in that part</span> <span data-start="1949.2" data-end="1951.99">of the frequency is being picked up by</span> <span data-start="1951.99" data-end="1954.419">like so I'm even like the background</span> <span data-start="1954.419" data-end="1960.63">noise so yeah just like the ambience</span> <span data-start="1960.63" data-end="1963.09">right like your body's receptive to that</span> <span data-start="1963.09" data-end="1965.49">so it's actually going to be translated</span> <span data-start="1965.49" data-end="1976.47">so you can see some of that well yeah</span> <span data-start="1976.47" data-end="1979.79">yeah and also is worth mentioning that</span> <span data-start="1979.79" data-end="1982.41">this headset in particular is also going</span> <span data-start="1982.41" data-end="1985.65">to pick up some emoji which is like the</span> <span data-start="1985.65" data-end="1988.77">muscular signals so let's do a little</span> <span data-start="1988.77" data-end="1992.91">experiment try blinking a couple of</span> <span data-start="1992.91" data-end="1996.81">times to</span> <span data-start="1996.81" data-end="2000.47">right regular horror yeah yeah so you</span> <span data-start="2000.47" data-end="2002.06">can see some of that being picked up</span> <span data-start="2002.06" data-end="2004.79">around here it gets very interesting</span> <span data-start="2004.79" data-end="2007.24">when you start seeing the frequency</span> <span data-start="2007.24" data-end="2011.03">categorize by different categorize by</span> <span data-start="2011.03" data-end="2013.79">different frequency bands so if you're</span> <span data-start="2013.79" data-end="2015.65">familiar with like data data alpha and</span> <span data-start="2015.65" data-end="2017.9">beta I can tell you for example</span> <span data-start="2017.9" data-end="2021.5">according to some experiment if you want</span> <span data-start="2021.5" data-end="2023.9">to measure hunger occurring to some</span> <span data-start="2023.9" data-end="2028.91">doctors some of the Delta band is going</span> <span data-start="2028.91" data-end="2031.04">to get lower and some of the alpha and</span> <span data-start="2031.04" data-end="2033.83">beta is going to get higher right so</span> <span data-start="2033.83" data-end="2036.32">this is also used to like measure</span> <span data-start="2036.32" data-end="2037.93">progress when it comes to like</span> <span data-start="2037.93" data-end="2042.89">concentration and meditation take a</span> <span data-start="2042.89" data-end="2045.2">screenshot take a screenshot yeah there</span> <span data-start="2045.2" data-end="2047.95">you go</span> <span data-start="2047.96" data-end="2050.03">this is just another way of showing</span> <span data-start="2050.03" data-end="2055.46">frequency in a 3-quart type of layout so</span> <span data-start="2055.46" data-end="2060.02">try to sleep in your jaw like like you</span> <span data-start="2060.02" data-end="2061.46">were like chewing something you can see</span> <span data-start="2061.46" data-end="2064.25">that being okay you can see that</span> <span data-start="2064.25" data-end="2068.57">actually the manifested here yeah yeah</span> <span data-start="2068.57" data-end="2077.27">but whatever you do okay thank you guys</span> </p>
