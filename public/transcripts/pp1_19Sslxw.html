<p><span data-start="0.229" data-end="1.29">All right, thanks everyone.</span> <span data-start="1.29" data-end="2.399">So as Katie said I'm David Whittaker and I spent about half my career teaching math,</span> <span data-start="2.399" data-end="3.5">which is something that made me think about confidence quite a bit and the other half</span> <span data-start="3.5" data-end="6.38">writing software and right now I work at Qualcomm and I'm a program manager and developer and</span> <span data-start="6.38" data-end="7.38">work on Node, Xpress, JS, that kind of stuff.</span> <span data-start="7.38" data-end="10.269">So let's talk about what we're going to cover today.</span> <span data-start="10.269" data-end="13.019">So I want to cover three main points.</span> <span data-start="13.019" data-end="16.97">First, you are not an imposter.</span> <span data-start="16.97" data-end="21.81">Second, feelings are not facts.</span> <span data-start="21.81" data-end="27.83">And third, I want to get over and break out of that self-doubt infinite loop.</span> <span data-start="27.83" data-end="33.03">So let's talk about some ways to do that.</span> <span data-start="33.03" data-end="39.37">Over four years ago, I was thinking about these thoughts, wondering what's happening</span> <span data-start="39.37" data-end="46.37">in my field, and where I fit in, and why I felt this way and so I made this really crude</span> <span data-start="46.37" data-end="52.16">diagram and it's not even aligned properly, but I just did it to help me understand my</span> <span data-start="52.16" data-end="58.129">own thoughts and it got a lot of traction and when Wil Wheaton retweeted it, I thought</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="58.129" data-end="61.3">I'd made it in the world.</span> <span data-start="61.3" data-end="63.09">I'm done.</span> <span data-start="63.09" data-end="70.2">So I kind of want to unpack this a little bit more, especially in the tech world, because</span> <span data-start="70.2" data-end="76.27">as we learn what's out there and the frameworks that are available and the new technology,</span> <span data-start="76.27" data-end="80.89">we know that the things that we don't know starts to get larger and larger.</span> <span data-start="80.89" data-end="87.5">And what I hope you'll leave with is it's the intersections of the things that you do</span> <span data-start="87.5" data-end="94.14">know and don't know, your inner perspective that brings you value.</span> <span data-start="94.14" data-end="100.31">Researchers tell us that about 70% of folks feel this way and I'd venture to guess that</span> <span data-start="100.31" data-end="107.45">in the tech world it's probably a lot more, because we're surrounded by smart people and</span> <span data-start="107.45" data-end="113.56">we are constantly bombarded with new thoughts and new ideas.</span> <span data-start="113.56" data-end="115.03">So let's look a little bit differently.</span> <span data-start="115.03" data-end="120.75">I like to think of confidence as on a spectrum and any given day we'll move back and forth</span> <span data-start="120.75" data-end="124.78">on this spectrum, depending on where we are in our lives and in our career.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="124.78" data-end="129.96">So on the left here we have the, you know, very low confidence, my work's never good</span> <span data-start="129.96" data-end="131.5">enough.</span> <span data-start="131.5" data-end="133.03">Everyone knows more than I do.</span> <span data-start="133.03" data-end="135.42">I don't belong.</span> <span data-start="135.42" data-end="141.12">And on the right, we have the really high, maybe overly confident person, who's always</span> <span data-start="141.12" data-end="147.89">perfect and thinks they're smarter than everyone, and they should be the one in charge.</span> <span data-start="147.89" data-end="150.56">Now I want to talk about what reality is.</span> <span data-start="150.56" data-end="159.219">So the real competence, so if we have a mismatch here between the way  â€”  the way you feel about</span> <span data-start="159.219" data-end="165.909">the world, your confidence in your work, and your actual competence, then there's a danger</span> <span data-start="165.909" data-end="171.04">here of what we're calling Imposter Syndrome.</span> <span data-start="171.04" data-end="175.019">Of course there could be a mismatch in the other connection, which is the Dunning Kruger</span> <span data-start="175.019" data-end="180.469">effect, where you're really highly confident but not really highly competent.</span> <span data-start="180.469" data-end="187.04">So today we're going to talk about this particular mismatch, where you have a low confidence</span> <span data-start="187.04" data-end="193.109">going into something, but really you are very competent, which I venture to guess most of</span> <span data-start="193.109" data-end="195.93">you are.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="195.93" data-end="200.56">So some signs that we see here, you know, downplaying accomplishments, you're feeling</span> <span data-start="200.56" data-end="205.09">that everything you're doing that is successful is luck, you're not sure if you're good enough</span> <span data-start="205.09" data-end="212.54">to work here, everyone seems really smarter than me, this could all lead to some negative</span> <span data-start="212.54" data-end="213.73">impacts.</span> <span data-start="213.73" data-end="219.889">Your work suffers, you may even suffer physical things, like ulcers, back pain, migraines,</span> <span data-start="219.889" data-end="230.269">anxiety, relationship issues, all because of this fear and anxiety.</span> <span data-start="230.269" data-end="237.34">In 2011 Dr. Valerie Young, talked about five confidence types which I like to call personas</span> <span data-start="237.34" data-end="243.43">that kind of embody the different ways that Imposter Syndrome can manifest itself.</span> <span data-start="243.43" data-end="247.139">The first way we see here is this perfectionist.</span> <span data-start="247.139" data-end="252.36">Someone who sets extremely high expectations for themselves impossible to reach, and every</span> <span data-start="252.36" data-end="256.29">time they make a small mistake, they question their own competence.</span> <span data-start="256.29" data-end="262.33">The expert, someone who feels like they have to know everything complete all the details</span> <span data-start="262.33" data-end="267.291">before they'll even start a project, apply for a job or do anything, they're afraid to</span> <span data-start="267.291" data-end="274.94">ask questions, even, because asking questions might reveal a bit of their own incompetence.</span> <span data-start="274.94" data-end="280.91">The natural genius when they grow up, things came easy, so when things don't come easy,</span> <span data-start="280.91" data-end="287.83">feel like they are a failure, the soloist must do everything on their own and if I have</span> <span data-start="287.83" data-end="296.14">to ask for help, I'm not confident and finally the super human who feels like I really have</span> <span data-start="296.14" data-end="301.94">to compensate for my incompetence by working really hard around the clock.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="301.94" data-end="306.4">So which one of these do you most relate to?</span> <span data-start="306.4" data-end="309.64">This is me.</span> <span data-start="309.64" data-end="314.81">At least at some point and I kind of move back and forth between these things.</span> <span data-start="314.81" data-end="317.62">So I want to talk a little bit about bias.</span> <span data-start="317.62" data-end="325.93">And bias is a lot like a colored lens that changes the inputs that we get from the real</span> <span data-start="325.93" data-end="331.23">world, and stores them in our brain in a different way than we actually received them.</span> <span data-start="331.23" data-end="333.25">But we don't know this happens.</span> <span data-start="333.25" data-end="339.49">And you see that red dot, the congruent belief, is something that is already consistent with</span> <span data-start="339.49" data-end="342.66">our current belief system, our current feelings.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="342.66" data-end="347.66">That is fast-tracked right to the right, right into the brain, yes, I knew that was correct,</span> <span data-start="347.66" data-end="348.91">goes right over there.</span> <span data-start="348.91" data-end="353.3">The other ones take a little bit more time and when we get a congruent belief that makes</span> <span data-start="353.3" data-end="357.9">our belief system even bigger, even stronger.</span> <span data-start="357.9" data-end="359.49">This is called confirmation bias.</span> <span data-start="359.49" data-end="365.89">We'll even look for things that are consistent with our current beliefs.</span> <span data-start="365.89" data-end="371.94">And the confirmation bias will also take contradictory beliefs and just reject them completely.</span> <span data-start="371.94" data-end="377.46">We won't even bring them in as a proper input.</span> <span data-start="377.46" data-end="384.26">So I like this cartoon, it says, I love your work: Oh, they're family, they're supposed</span> <span data-start="384.26" data-end="387.82">to say that, oh, they're friends they have to say that, they're strangers, they have</span> <span data-start="387.82" data-end="388.82">to say that.</span> <span data-start="388.82" data-end="396.05">And when I saw this tweet, I like to read the comments and one person said, oh, you</span> <span data-start="396.05" data-end="405.56">missed a frame and so they created this frame.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="405.56" data-end="411.71">This is confirmation bias, both sides of it, and really like their response.</span> <span data-start="411.71" data-end="418.31">So to compensate for this, what I want you to do is create a positive feedback board.</span> <span data-start="418.31" data-end="423.961">So any time you get some positive feedback, I know it may not register correctly, write</span> <span data-start="423.961" data-end="425.25">it down.</span> <span data-start="425.25" data-end="429.97">Put it on your wall, and just save it there for later.</span> <span data-start="429.97" data-end="433.42">You shouldn't expect other people to write these notes for you, but write them for yourself.</span> <span data-start="433.42" data-end="435.93">Just write your note, you did a great job on that project.</span> <span data-start="435.93" data-end="438.932">It doesn't how you feel about it on that point, just write it on your wall.</span> <span data-start="438.932" data-end="448.33">The next time you need a boost of confidence, look at your positive feedback board.</span> <span data-start="448.33" data-end="450.15">Next I want to talk about self-doubt.</span> <span data-start="450.15" data-end="454.59">Now, if you've ever seen the awkward Yeti, you'll note that all of their cartoons have</span> <span data-start="454.59" data-end="457.65">a brain and a heart.</span> <span data-start="457.65" data-end="464.97">So the brain is saying to the heart the feelings: Maybe it would be easier if we put this down.</span> <span data-start="464.97" data-end="471.49">So what I want to kind of talk about is that this self-doubt becomes this coping mechanism</span> <span data-start="471.49" data-end="475.55">that helps us deal with the fact that we may not be able to live up to this high standard</span> <span data-start="475.55" data-end="478.42">that we've set for ourselves.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="478.42" data-end="486.75">And let's go through what happens with someone that has maybe a lower confidence.</span> <span data-start="486.75" data-end="489.06">First they're going to have some uneasy feeling.</span> <span data-start="489.06" data-end="492.24">They'll start to question themselves.</span> <span data-start="492.24" data-end="495.11">You know, I don't know what I'm doing here.</span> <span data-start="495.11" data-end="496.11">I don't know what I'm doing.</span> <span data-start="496.11" data-end="497.11">Do I belong?</span> <span data-start="497.11" data-end="500.23">I'm really not as smart as everyone else.</span> <span data-start="500.23" data-end="503.61">And that leads to this negative internal talk.</span> <span data-start="503.61" data-end="507.4">I'm not  â€”  I'm an imposter, I'm probably going to fail at this.</span> <span data-start="507.4" data-end="513.81">I'm not good enough, I shouldn't even start, because I can't even do it right.</span> <span data-start="513.81" data-end="520.709">And even if the event leads to success, the success is discounted as luck.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="520.709" data-end="527.569">And if there's failure, well, then the loop starts over again.</span> <span data-start="527.569" data-end="533.04">But let's look at someone with higher confidence, yes, they have self-doubt, yes they have uneasy</span> <span data-start="533.04" data-end="537.68">feelings and yes, they question themselves.</span> <span data-start="537.68" data-end="542.7">But here's how the difference happens: How they respond to this self-questioning.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="542.7" data-end="544.05">This self-questioning is the key.</span> <span data-start="544.05" data-end="546.24">It means wait, I need to pay attention here.</span> <span data-start="546.24" data-end="548.43">It means something is wrong.</span> <span data-start="548.43" data-end="554.56">What can I do about it and what I do is I see this as an opportunity to learn.</span> <span data-start="554.56" data-end="556.819">I have a growth mind set.</span> <span data-start="556.819" data-end="561.329">I view this as a challenge, something that I can take on, I'm going to start researching,</span> <span data-start="561.329" data-end="564">gather evidence, ask questions.</span> <span data-start="564" data-end="568.11">I'm going to look at maybe there's a bias here and I'm going to try to break that bias,</span> <span data-start="568.11" data-end="573.199">I'm going to try to create some goals thinking maybe there's something I can do better here</span> <span data-start="573.199" data-end="578.23">and try to do it better next time.</span> <span data-start="578.23" data-end="580.199">They're OK with failure.</span> <span data-start="580.199" data-end="584.68">If you think about 0 us in the software world we always talk about fail fast.</span> <span data-start="584.68" data-end="588.98">They know if they fail fast, they'll learn from that opportunity and iterate and do it</span> <span data-start="588.98" data-end="590.759">better next time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="590.759" data-end="595.25">And if they do have success, they take it on, they accept it, they own it, they know</span> <span data-start="595.25" data-end="603.49">that this is something I did and they allow themselves to increase their own self-esteem</span> <span data-start="603.49" data-end="606.24">and their confidence will grow.</span> <span data-start="606.24" data-end="608.329">So very similar concepts.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="608.329" data-end="615.8">A couple weeks ago, I was talking to a sky diver and there's no way I could ever do this.</span> <span data-start="615.8" data-end="620.649">If I ever saw land like that, there's no way, way too scared.</span> <span data-start="620.649" data-end="625.889">Falling is  â€”  afraid of heights, afraid of falling, there's no way I could do this.</span> <span data-start="625.889" data-end="630.66">And what he said in response to that really stuck with me.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="630.66" data-end="637.73">It's not that I no longer have fear, I just know how to manage it better.</span> <span data-start="637.73" data-end="640.529">That's the same with highly confident folks.</span> <span data-start="640.529" data-end="646.04">They still have fear, they just know how to manage it better.</span> <span data-start="646.04" data-end="653.61">So what I've done to help us move from maybe a lower confidence to a higher confidence,</span> <span data-start="653.61" data-end="656.87">is to create a growth mind set worksheet.</span> <span data-start="656.87" data-end="659.839">This is just some of the questions that you'll see on the worksheet.</span> <span data-start="659.839" data-end="665.47">This will help you journal and write about your thoughts and feelings.</span> <span data-start="665.47" data-end="668.42">Questions about what do you think is going to go well?</span> <span data-start="668.42" data-end="670.43">What do you think will go well?</span> <span data-start="670.43" data-end="672.529">How have you prepared yourself for this?</span> <span data-start="672.529" data-end="677.72">And there's a before something happens and an after something happens part of this journal.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="677.72" data-end="682.819">You know, we used to say when we were a kid, I can draw, I can draw, give me a piece of</span> <span data-start="682.819" data-end="689.199">paper and then as we start learning about masterpieces and the complexity of art and</span> <span data-start="689.199" data-end="692.62">brushes and things like that, we start to say, well, I can't draw.</span> <span data-start="692.62" data-end="694">I can't draw.</span> <span data-start="694" data-end="697.18">But it's not that we can't draw.</span> <span data-start="697.18" data-end="698.8">You can draw if you want to.</span> <span data-start="698.8" data-end="700.95">It's just you need to practice, right?</span> <span data-start="700.95" data-end="705.149">So the right answer is, I can't draw well right now.</span> </p>
