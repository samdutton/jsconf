data-start="375.84" data-end="378.51">green screen so I'm going to take a</span> <span data-start="378.51" data-end="380.61">brief aside and talk about how green</span> <span data-start="380.61" data-end="384.66">screening is done so this is</span> <span data-start="384.66" data-end="386.58">traditionally quite an expensive thing</span> <span data-start="386.58" data-end="388.62">to compute because you need to iterate</span> <span data-start="388.62" data-end="392.4">out of every pixel inside an image tests</span> <span data-start="392.4" data-end="395.04">whether it's green this is

data-start="397.69" data-end="399.22">and this is one of the ways that weather</span> <span data-start="399.22" data-end="400.33">presenters are put in front of their</span> <span data-start="400.33" data-end="403.18">interactive weather maps so yeah this is</span> <span data-start="403.18" data-end="406.75">quite expensive in a 1920 by 1080 image</span> <span data-start="406.75" data-end="409.75">at about two million pixels at 25 frames</span> <span data-start="409.75" data-end="411.85">per second that's 15 million pixels per</span> <span data-start="411.85" data-end="415">second we need to process but web</span> <span data-start="415" data-end="416.98">fortunately web GL shaders pride a</span> <span data-start="416.98" data-end="418.36">really convenient way to do this</span> <span data-start="418.36" data-end="421.15">efficiently so a WebGL shader is a chunk</span> <span data-start="421.15" data-end="424.03">of code which runs on the GPU and</span> <span data-start="424.03" data-end="425.83">they're typically written in a c-lite</span> <span data-start="425.83" data-end="428.2">language called GLSL and they describe</span> <span data-start="428.2" data-end="429.97">operations which get run in parallel</span> <span data-start="429.97" data-end="431.83">across many processing units on the GPU</span> <span data-start="431.83" data-end="434.02">and this makes them perfect for doing</span> <span data-start="434.02" data-end="435.7">simple operations across many many</span> <span data-start="435.7" data-end="441.13">pixels so back to the code I'm going to</span> <span data-start="441.13" data-end="443.89">now create a color threshold node so</span> <span data-start="443.89" data-end="446.67">this is similar to the source nodes</span> <span data-start="446.67" data-end="449.77">except it's an effect and you pass into</span> <span data-start="449.77" data-end="452.53">it a definition and this describes what</span> <span data-start="452.53" data-end="456.1">that effect should do we then disconnect</span> <span data-start="456.1" data-end="457.9">the video node from destination and</span> <span data-start="457.9" data-end="459.61">connect to the color threshold node then</span> <span data-start="459.61" data-end="460.78">connect the call threshold node to the</span> <span data-start="460.78" data-end="464.53">destination so quickly I'll give you a</span> <span data-start="464.53" data-end="466.18">brief look into what one of those</span> <span data-start="466.18" data-end="468.67">definitions look like and this is super</span> <span data-start="468.67" data-end="470.29">complicated and don't worry about if you</span> <span data-start="470.29" data-end="471.85">don't understand any of it it's it's</span> <span data-start="471.85" data-end="474.55">mostly shader code and so the bit in the</span> <span data-start="474.55" data-end="475.93">white box is the fragment shader code</span> <span data-start="475.93" data-end="479.5">that does our green streaming so the</span> <span data-start="479.5" data-end="480.94">video context has a bunch of effects</span> <span data-start="480.94" data-end="483.73">built in but it also is quite a nice</span> <span data-start="483.73" data-end="485.08">environment for playing around and</span> <span data-start="485.08" data-end="486.22">experimenting with building your own</span> <span data-start="486.22" data-end="492.1">shaders so back to the code we've</span> <span data-start="492.1" data-end="494.05">created that graph which looks like this</span> <span data-start="494.05" data-end="496.15">r2 image nodes we have a video node</span> <span data-start="496.15" data-end="497.41">which is now connected the effect nodes</span> <span data-start="497.41" data-end="499.63">then connect to the destination and that</span> <span data-start="499.63" data-end="504.1">results in this which is much better we</span> <span data-start="504.1" data-end="509.72">can see our space caps again thank you</span> <span data-start="509.73" data-end="512.53">yeah so we're going to take you walk</span> <span data-start="512.53" data-end="514.72">through that route one more time we're</span> <span data-start="514.72" data-end="515.95">going to introduce transitions because</span> <span data-start="515.95" data-end="517.39">transitions are really important in</span> <span data-start="517.39" data-end="519.67">video editing so a transition is how you</span> <span data-start="519.67" data-end="521.11">might move from one video clip to the</span> <span data-start="521.11" data-end="524.41">next so rather than just doing a</span> <span data-start="524.41" data-end="525.46">straight cut you might have like a</span> <span data-start="525.46" data-end="527.26">crossfade we might have a star light you</span> <span data-start="527.26" data-end="529.48">might do something a bit more jazzy so</span> <span data-start="529.48" data-end="532.78">we're going to create a new video note</span> <span data-start="532.78" data-end="536.77">and this is created using the same</span> <span data-start="536.77" data-end="539.53">source the first video note but we're</span> <span data-start="539.53" data-end="541.06">having we have this dispaly at the end</span> <span data-start="541.06" data-end="543.4">in this 10.5 and that tells the video</span> <span data-start="543.4" data-end="545.77">context how far in for that source video</span> <span data-start="545.77" data-end="547.93">to seek before it starts playing back so</span> <span data-start="547.93" data-end="549.88">this is how you can sort of cut up pre</span> <span data-start="549.88" data-end="551.8">existing video files but using this</span> <span data-start="551.8" data-end="555.37">library so you can create a transition</span> <span data-start="555.37" data-end="556.6">note and this is really similar to get</span> <span data-start="556.6" data-end="558.54">effect mode except we pass in a</span> <span data-start="558.54" data-end="562.72">transition definition and then we call</span> <span data-start="562.72" data-end="564.25">transition on it so this is going to</span> <span data-start="564.25"

data-start="708.67" data-end="714.55">yourself so most browsers are limited to</span> <span data-start="714.55" data-end="716.71">about six to eight simultaneous HTTP</span> <span data-start="716.71" data-end="719.65">connections for domain and if you have</span> <span data-start="719.65" data-end="721.089">many clips to play that you want to play</span> <span data-start="721.089" data-end="722.89">back to back a naive way of doing this</span> <span data-start="722.89" data-end="724.39">to make sure they all play properly is</span> <span data-start="724.39" data-end="727.27">to create HTML video elements for each</span> <span data-start="727.27" data-end="728.8">of those clips of front and set them pre</span> <span data-start="728.8" data-end="731.74">loading but this

website</span> <span data-start="734.8" data-end="737.5">really slow and responsive so the</span> <span data-start="737.5" data-end="739.21">solution to this is the video context</span> <span data-start="739.21" data-end="740.83">will load clips just in time so</span> <span data-start="740.83" data-end="743.26">all HTML media elements they create</span> <span data-start="743.26"

to sync</span> <span data-start="755.17" data-end="758.11">everything to in the video context and</span> <span data-start="758.11" data-end="759.55">the natural fit for this would seem to</span> <span data-start="759.55" data-end="763.23">be the video current time attribute</span> <span data-start="763.23" data-end="764.92">unfortunately the rightest updates</span> <span data-start="764.92" data-end="768.88">varies between browsers so if you're</span> <span data-start="768.88" data-end="771.13">doing things that require frame accurate</span> <span data-start="771.13"

of a second it can break things so</span> <span data-start="779.38" data-end="780.55">the solution to this was to use a</span> <span data-start="780.55" data-end="782.769">requestanimationframe as a master time</span> <span data-start="782.769" data-end="784.63">source which gave us millisecond level</span> <span data-start="784.63" data-end="789.55">accuracy and frame accurate updates this</span> <span data-start="789.55" data-end="791.47">doesn't come without its own problems so</span> <span data-start="791.47" data-end="793.87">if you switch tabs the crest animation</span> <span

data-end="803.74">to keep playing in the background but</span> <span data-start="803.74" data-end="805.45">the video context won't both do that if</span> <span data-start="805.45" data-end="808.66">it only is a requestanimationframe so</span> <span data-start="808.66" data-end="810.64">the solution we came up for this is — as</span> <span data-start="810.64" data-end="812.05">soon as you switch

as</span> <span data-start="816.1" data-end="818.38">accurate as a requestanimationframe but</span> <span data-start="818.38" data-end="821.29">it will give you enough timing to keep</span> <span
