<p><span data-start="30.23" data-end="33.1"><span class="speaker">Claudia</span>: Thank you very much for having me here today.</span> <span data-start="33.1" data-end="36.25">I'm so excited to be at JSConf Europe.</span> <span data-start="36.25" data-end="39.01">It is a dream come true.</span> <span data-start="39.01" data-end="45.05">My name is Claudia Hernandez, I'm from Mexico and a huge fan of Alice in Wonderland and</span> <span data-start="45.05" data-end="48.74">I work at Daily motion.</span> <span data-start="48.74" data-end="54.76">If you have comments, suggestions or complaints, you can find me on Twitter as before.</span> <span data-start="54.76" data-end="56.61">Don't hesitate.</span> <span data-start="56.61" data-end="61.61">Enough about me, because you are not here for me, so, for the following three minutes,</span> <span data-start="61.61" data-end="65.18">I'm — 30 minutes, I'm going to be your own personal white rabbit because I'm going to</span> <span data-start="65.18" data-end="72.28">drag you with me into the rabbit hole at show you some really weird things going on in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="72.28" data-end="77.11">One things first: I'm not an expert, but I'm a really, really curious person and I love</span> <span data-start="77.11" data-end="78.21">to know how things work.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="78.21" data-end="82.67">This is one of the main reasons that I decided to do this talk.</span> <span data-start="82.67" data-end="86.09">Most of the things that you're going to be seeing in the following slides are things</span> <span data-start="86.09" data-end="90.03">that I have come across and, at the beginning, I didn't understand what was going on.</span> <span data-start="90.03" data-end="95.08">So, the beauty of JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="95.08" data-end="99.99">JavaScript is a kind of language where nothing is what it is.</span> <span data-start="99.99" data-end="108.55">Because math.min is not math.max because in JavaScript, everything is what it isn't.</span> <span data-start="108.55" data-end="117.63">Contrary-wise, what is is not in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="117.63" data-end="122.82">Two totally different totally similar looking — it's not what it actually is.</span> <span data-start="122.82" data-end="123.82">What is going on?</span> <span data-start="123.82" data-end="135.129">I'm not going to go into detail in believes examples, but if you're curious about them,</span> <span data-start="135.129" data-end="141.129">they have to do with inconsistencies in floating point numbers in JavaScript and other languages</span> <span data-start="141.129" data-end="145.03">and knowing the difference between primitive and reference types.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="145.03" data-end="148.739">The thing with JavaScript is that JavaScript is very easy to learn.</span> <span data-start="148.739" data-end="153.9">Everyone can do a console.log in their browser but it is harder to learn in a deeper and</span> <span data-start="153.9" data-end="155.11">meaningful way.</span> <span data-start="155.11" data-end="160.7">This is our first part through Wonder land.</span> <span data-start="160.7" data-end="165.609">NaN literally stands for: not a number.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="165.609" data-end="168.449">Bess what?</span> <span data-start="168.449" data-end="169.65">Type of NaN is number.</span> <span data-start="169.65" data-end="174.76">It is going — what is going on?</span> <span data-start="174.76" data-end="178.459">NaN is the returned value of of a mathematical operation that failed.</span> <span data-start="178.459" data-end="187.109">We try to do operations both eperands are not number, or we do things that are not defined</span> <span data-start="187.109" data-end="193.23">like dividing zero by zero or get the square route of a negative number, we will also get</span> <span data-start="193.23" data-end="194.23">NaN.</span> <span data-start="194.23" data-end="200.93">NaN is trying to tell us something along the lines of, "I tried to perform this mat mallal</span> <span data-start="200.93" data-end="202.531">operation so I failed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="202.531" data-end="204.15">Here's this fail number instead.</span> <span data-start="204.15" data-end="207.939">Back"maybe the label NaN is misleading.</span> <span data-start="207.939" data-end="213.65">Maybe it would be easier to think of it as "bad number, failed number, invalid" more</span> <span data-start="213.65" data-end="215.26">than not a number.</span> <span data-start="215.26" data-end="220.819">Because bottom line, NaN is of numeric type but it represents a value that could not represent</span> <span data-start="220.819" data-end="222.329">a valid number.</span> <span data-start="222.329" data-end="229.129">In JavaScript, mathematical operations can lead to an error or crash.</span> <span data-start="229.129" data-end="232.629">So what if we wanted to know if a value is equal to NaN or not?</span> <span data-start="232.629" data-end="236.01">If this was your first guess, let me tell you something.</span> <span data-start="236.01" data-end="242.04">Actually, NaN is not equal to, greater than, or less than anything, including itself.</span> <span data-start="242.04" data-end="244.68">But why is that you may be wondering?</span> <span data-start="244.68" data-end="247.439">So NaN is not only a JavaScript thing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="247.439" data-end="255.889">NaN is defined by the standard called the IEEE754, and, to keep things short, because</span> <span data-start="255.889" data-end="264.06">this is a 30-minute talk, basically, what this standard tells us is there are 16,777,214</span> <span data-start="264.06" data-end="268.419">different floating point values as NaNs.</span> <span data-start="268.419" data-end="269.569">What does this mean?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="269.569" data-end="274.699">This means there are so many different representations of NaN that it is highly unlikely that one</span> <span data-start="274.699" data-end="278.34">NaN is equal to another NaN.</span> <span data-start="278.34" data-end="280.449">Nan is not equal to NaN.</span> <span data-start="280.449" data-end="289.74">I think we agree that NaN stands for "not a number" so the only way if we know if a</span> <span data-start="289.74" data-end="293.74">value is NaN or not is to use the JavaScript built-in function is NaN.</span> <span data-start="293.74" data-end="300.62">Now let's talk about sorting arrays because that's always fun.</span> <span data-start="300.62" data-end="305.889">Can you spot what is seriously wrong in this code?</span> <span data-start="305.889" data-end="313.43">In my world, 235 and 33 after the number 4, but in JavaScript, things are not what they</span> <span data-start="313.43" data-end="314.43">seem.</span> <span data-start="314.43" data-end="315.93">What is going on?</span> <span data-start="315.93" data-end="318.639">JavaScript is doing lexicographical sorting.</span> <span data-start="318.639" data-end="319.639">What is that?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="319.639" data-end="331.159">It is likes dictionary-like alphabetic type sorting, not numerical</span> <span data-start="331.159" data-end="333.44">at all.</span> <span data-start="333.44" data-end="337.659">For every character in the strings, it is comparing the unicode value.</span> <span data-start="337.659" data-end="341.729">It is the unicode ID of any character.</span> <span data-start="341.729" data-end="347.55">So, in this example, we have a colour array red and blue, we call the sort blue, red is</span> <span data-start="347.55" data-end="353.4">coming before red, because of alphabetical sorting, but we have a numerical array with</span> <span data-start="353.4" data-end="358.49">80 and nine and this will be the exact same thing we call third method with those numbers</span> <span data-start="358.49" data-end="359.96">as strings.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="359.96" data-end="363.729">Basically, 80 has that smaller unicode point value.</span> <span data-start="363.729" data-end="370.039">In a more simple way, we can say that 80 is lexicographically less than nine and it starts</span> <span data-start="370.039" data-end="371.979">to make more sense now.</span> <span data-start="371.979" data-end="379.009">If you want to know the point value of any character, you can use the string code, the</span> <span data-start="379.009" data-end="380.009">method.</span> <span data-start="380.009" data-end="387.78">25 and 33 are indeed lexicographically less than four.</span> <span data-start="387.78" data-end="395.47">When we're trying to sort an array, lexicographical sorting is not the first thing we want.</span> <span data-start="395.47" data-end="400.74">What we are missing here is that the third method can take us a parameter compare function,</span> <span data-start="400.74" data-end="407.83">so if a compare function is given, if a is smaller than b, we return -1.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="407.83" data-end="415.65">If a is greater than b, we return one, and b comes before a, and in any other case, we</span> <span data-start="415.65" data-end="425.531">return a and b and zero — if you're as curious as I am, you wonder what is the algorithm</span> <span data-start="425.531" data-end="430.71">behind that native sort method in JavaScript, and the answer is that actually it depends</span> <span data-start="430.71" data-end="436.669">on the JavaScript engine, because the standard doesn't impose a certain algorithm to be used</span> <span data-start="436.669" data-end="439.75">so every JavaScript engine is free to use whatever they want.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="439.75" data-end="448.58">Out of curiosity, if you want to know, Spidermonkey for Firefox is a combination of algorithms</span> <span data-start="448.58" data-end="454.12">insertions for small arrays for performance, and V8 Chrome is using Quick sort Sort and</span> <span data-start="454.12" data-end="455.12">Insertion Sort.</span> <span data-start="455.12" data-end="462.849">There's an a fun fact for you people who love computer science.</span> <span data-start="462.849" data-end="468.97">Now that we have finally provided the compare function, we can have a numerical sort.</span> <span data-start="468.97" data-end="471.61">The tilde operator.</span> <span data-start="471.61" data-end="475.65">How many have used this operator before?</span> <span data-start="475.65" data-end="478.11">A few of you.</span> <span data-start="478.11" data-end="483.08">This is a bit-wise operator.</span> <span data-start="483.08" data-end="484.08">What is that?</span> <span data-start="484.08" data-end="487.909">It's an operator that would take a number, transform it into a sequence of bits and then</span> <span data-start="487.909" data-end="492.551">it will do some kind of operation on it and it will turn back an integer as a result and</span> <span data-start="492.551" data-end="494.199">it is very important.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="494.199" data-end="501.46">Now, maybe just maybe, you're familiar with the bit-wise and the but those are not the</span> <span data-start="501.46" data-end="509.44">same as the logical "and" or "or".</span> <span data-start="509.44" data-end="516.06">Today I'm going to be talking about the bitwise not.</span> <span data-start="516.06" data-end="518.94">What it is doing is inverting the bits in a sequence.</span> <span data-start="518.94" data-end="525.06">I know we normally don't do these kind of specific to be operations in our applications,</span> <span data-start="525.06" data-end="526.63">so let me put it this way.</span> <span data-start="526.63" data-end="529.19">The operator is just doing this small algorithm.</span> <span data-start="529.19" data-end="532.7">It's adding one and then changing the sign.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="532.7" data-end="538.32">We can pass the -2 and get along.</span> <span data-start="538.32" data-end="544.87">Et cetera the million-dollar question here is what actual use in real life can we give</span> <span data-start="544.87" data-end="545.87">to these operators?</span> <span data-start="545.87" data-end="552.76">So, one of it is by using a double tilde operator, bitwise, and we can truncate using numbers</span> <span data-start="552.76" data-end="558.17">and this is quicker than using math trunk.</span> <span data-start="558.17" data-end="565.32">We can use other bitwise operators to do the same thing, and, as I told you, this is faster.</span> <span data-start="565.32" data-end="574.8">Another thing we can use with the bitwise is imagine that we want to know if someone</span> <span data-start="574.8" data-end="578.05">is coming to the tea-party that we want to have later.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="578.05" data-end="584.61">So you know, the array function these index methods.</span> <span data-start="584.61" data-end="589.88">The way this method works is that it will give us the position of an element if it was</span> <span data-start="589.88" data-end="595.16">found on an array and, if it was not found, it would just return -1.</span> <span data-start="595.16" data-end="601.39">A lot of developers have used this method, and they will do a lot of these things.</span> <span data-start="601.39" data-end="611.72">They will compare it if the index method is bigger — all of this can be simplified by</span> <span data-start="611.72" data-end="614.079">using the tilde operator.</span> <span data-start="614.079" data-end="619.089">Basically what is happening here is that the let me was not found, the index method will</span> <span data-start="619.089" data-end="625.19">turn back a -1, then we will pass this -1 to the tilde operator and it will transform</span> <span data-start="625.19" data-end="628.36">it into a false zero.</span> <span data-start="628.36" data-end="632.16">It will mean that the element was actually found in any other case.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="632.16" data-end="636.81">Now, before you start getting angry at me, I know that this is not very code-friendly</span> <span data-start="636.81" data-end="645.37">but don't worry because ES7 has a new function called includes which will return us a Boolean</span> <span data-start="645.37" data-end="647.79">that will save whether the element was found or not.</span> <span data-start="647.79" data-end="649.11">Don't worry about.</span> <span data-start="649.11" data-end="651.199">ES7 has our backs.</span> <span data-start="651.199" data-end="652.5">Cool.</span> <span data-start="652.5" data-end="659.98">Let's talk about for loops they can be fun.</span> <span data-start="659.98" data-end="668.279">I once saw this in a JavaScript book and I don't get what it means, what's going on.</span> <span data-start="668.279" data-end="672.27">Now let me bring you back to those days when you're learning about JavaScript variables,</span> <span data-start="672.27" data-end="675.45">and loops, and you were so eager to learn everything.</span> <span data-start="675.45" data-end="679.67">Let me remind you something basic about JavaScript and for loops.</span> <span data-start="679.67" data-end="686.449">For loops have three parts, an initialisation, condition, and iteration part.</span> <span data-start="686.449" data-end="689.949">They're optional in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="689.949" data-end="697.74">You can take the first part, declare variables outside a loop and it doesn't matter or you</span> <span data-start="697.74" data-end="702.54">can remove the condition for it, and if you do that, JavaScript will automatically consider</span> <span data-start="702.54" data-end="708.13">it as true and it is up to you to break the loop, or you can even take the iteration for</span> <span data-start="708.13" data-end="714.05">a farther away, and this this case, the condition part is acting at the same time as a iteration</span> <span data-start="714.05" data-end="715.05">part.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="715.05" data-end="723.339">Once this I drops until zero, it will be a false zero and get in the way of the loop.</span> <span data-start="723.339" data-end="724.44">You can remove everything.</span> <span data-start="724.44" data-end="728.95">If you do that, as I told you before, the cognition part will be automatically considered</span> <span data-start="728.95" data-end="735.399">as true, and basically what we are looking for is just an infinite loop.</span> <span data-start="735.399" data-end="738.56">So, cool.</span> <span data-start="738.56" data-end="740.25">Let's talk about .</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="740.25" data-end="747.5">This is variable that has been declared but has no value on it.</span> <span data-start="747.5" data-end="751.94">It is part of the window object.</span> <span data-start="751.94" data-end="757.99">So, what would happen if we wanted to be really clever and define undefine?</span> <span data-start="757.99" data-end="762.83">Actually, the result of this piece of code actually depends on the browser that you're</span> <span data-start="762.83" data-end="769.329">running it, so, for older browsers from internet explorer 8 and below, you could redefine on</span> <span data-start="769.329" data-end="770.329">define.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="770.329" data-end="774.209">This has already been solved for modern browsers.</span> <span data-start="774.209" data-end="780.46">Now I get it: while it is becoming less and less of a problem, we have to take, I mean</span> <span data-start="780.46" data-end="784.54">we have to care about these kind of issues because if you support older browsers, there</span> <span data-start="784.54" data-end="787.779">is a possibility that people might try to define your own defines.</span> <span data-start="787.779" data-end="793.089">The thing with JavaScript is that JavaScript rarely runs in isolation.</span> <span data-start="793.089" data-end="799.53">We often run it with other libraries, with external code, so just be careful.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1003.279" data-end="1008.32">So in this first case, the first part is just a false, which is a Boolean type which is</span> <span data-start="1008.32" data-end="1015.019">a primitive type, and an empty array is automatically formed by JavaScript into a string.</span> <span data-start="1015.019" data-end="1017.779">So these actually give us a string false or string true.</span> <span data-start="1017.779" data-end="1022.91">These work the exact same way for numbers: we can convert numbers into strings using</span> <span data-start="1022.91" data-end="1024.62">this technique.</span> <span data-start="1024.62" data-end="1028">So what if we wanted to do bigger numbers because we're not going to add one plus one</span> <span data-start="1028" data-end="1030.01">plus infinity.</span> <span data-start="1030.01" data-end="1036.35">We can transform into strings every single detail and then concatenate those details</span> <span data-start="1036.35" data-end="1053.85">back and transform the whole thing back into a number, so 123 actually looks like this</span> <span data-start="1053.85" data-end="1059.93">in alphanumeric JavaScript.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1138.03" data-end="1145.12">The constructor part is just getting that constructor for functions.</span> <span data-start="1145.12" data-end="1149.89">And the constructor of functions can actually take a parameter, a string, that will return</span> <span data-start="1149.89" data-end="1153.95">back and a new function with that string as its Buddy.</span> <span data-start="1153.95" data-end="1159.43">So now, you can finally get the last part is just out executing that new function.</span> <span data-start="1159.43" data-end="1167.19">So basically, it will give us in our browser another 1, and the code behind it is the code</span> <span data-start="1167.19" data-end="1173.99">actually used to make this work, and it does work.</span> <span data-start="1173.99" data-end="1177.18">So, yes — if you're interesting interested in that technique, you can find a lot of converters</span> <span data-start="1177.18" data-end="1181.94">online and I encourage you to check the open source — the code source, sorry, and there</span> <span data-start="1181.94" data-end="1195.63">are jsfuckdemo, JScrewIt, and the most well known is JSFuck from Martin.</span> <span data-start="1195.63" data-end="1197.31">There is no limit to this.</span> <span data-start="1197.31" data-end="1206.92">I came across this repository called JS screwed rewriting the whole JS library using this</span> <span data-start="1206.92" data-end="1209.63">alphanumeric technique.</span> <span data-start="1209.63" data-end="1212.16">This is the source code.</span> <span data-start="1212.16" data-end="1216.07">A lot of people have way too much time on their hands — not like me!</span> <span data-start="1216.07" data-end="1222.33">At this point, you might be wondering like Claudia, I would never write JavaScript that</span> <span data-start="1222.33" data-end="1223.33">way.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1276.11" data-end="1281.98">It doesn't work because the context of the function that is inside the function is no</span> <span data-start="1281.98" data-end="1283.85">longer in the same context.</span> <span data-start="1283.85" data-end="1291.66">A lot of developers have actually solved this issue with other — by adding new variables</span> <span data-start="1291.66" data-end="1301.68">such as that equals this, but actually, there is one thing: arrow functions don't have a</span> <span data-start="1301.68" data-end="1307.19">arguments, they don't have super and they don't have new targets.</span> <span data-start="1307.19" data-end="1312.2">Any reference to them will just lexically resolve up.</span> <span data-start="1312.2" data-end="1321.59">We can rewrite the — we will reference the full contents and we will have something being</span> <span data-start="1321.59" data-end="1323.89">displayed.</span> <span data-start="1323.89" data-end="1332.47">What if we wanted to be really, really stubborn and we actually wanted to — since arrow functions</span> <span data-start="1332.47" data-end="1338.09">don't have a context at all, there's nothing the bind method can actually grab on.</span> </p>
