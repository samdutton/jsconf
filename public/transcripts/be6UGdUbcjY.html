data-end="585.23">lot more widely available than WebGL and</span> <span data-start="585.23" data-end="588.98">it's a lot more it's much much easier to</span> <span data-start="588.98" data-end="590.509">use like writing shaders is actually</span> <span data-start="590.509" data-end="594.589">really hard now so here's an example so</span> <span data-start="594.589" data-end="596.779">so back when when the 2d canvas first</span> <span data-start="596.779" data-end="598.519">kind of came around with like you know</span> <span data-start="598.519" data-end="600.8">the beginning of html5 and you could</span> <span data-start="600.8" data-end="602.839">access video with it there was some</span> <span data-start="602.839" data-end="604.55">examples of somebody doing like chroma</span> <span data-start="604.55" data-end="606.319">keying or you know kind of a green</span> <span data-start="606.319" data-end="608.66">screen effect so here's some code that I</span> <span data-start="608.66" data-end="612.769">kind of grabbed from from that I'm just</span> <span data-start="612.769" data-end="614.24">going to kind of highlight it right and</span> <span data-start="614.24" data-end="617.569">point out the kind of key components</span> <span data-start="617.569" data-end="620.029">right so just kind of the way that the</span> <span data-start="620.029" data-end="621.62">browser gives you access to the video</span> <span data-start="621.62" data-end="623.66">pixels the first thing you have to do is</span> <span data-start="623.66" data-end="625.399">you have to take your video element</span> <span data-start="625.399" data-end="626.629">right which is this kind of video</span> <span data-start="626.629" data-end="628.61">variable here and you draw it to your</span> <span data-start="628.61"

data-end="636.259">pixels from the video but you can access</span> <span data-start="636.259" data-end="638.269">the pixels from the canvas so first you</span> <span data-start="638.269" data-end="640.25">have to draw it to a canvas then you get</span> <span data-start="640.25" data-end="642.529">the pixels from the canvas right then</span> <span data-start="642.529" data-end="644.24">you go through the pixel the pixel data</span> <span data-start="644.24" data-end="646.22">a process is at one pixel at a time and</span> <span data-start="646.22" data-end="648.079">you you check there's like a distance</span> <span data-start="648.079" data-end="650.179">function here that tells you whether or</span> <span data-start="650.179" data-end="652.73">not you know it's the color matches and</span> <span data-start="652.73" data-end="654.86">then you set the alpha channel 20 right</span> <span data-start="654.86" data-end="656.269">because you get your red blue green blue</span> <span data-start="656.269" data-end="657.98">and alpha and alpha is your transparency</span> <span data-start="657.98" data-end="661.16">challenge channel and then you put the</span> <span data-start="661.16" data-end="663.769">image back into once you've processed it</span> <span data-start="663.769" data-end="665.509">you display the image by putting that</span> <span data-start="665.509" data-end="666.19">array</span> <span data-start="666.19" data-end="670.54">get into the into the display

<span data-start="673.87" data-end="676">what I did but it didn't work and the</span> <span data-start="676" data-end="677.65">reason is there's a couple of reasons</span> <span data-start="677.65" data-end="678.76">the first reason is what we're doing</span> <span data-start="678.76" data-end="681.64">here is we're doing with copy a copy and</span> <span data-start="681.64" data-end="684.22">and allocate process one pixel at a time</span> <span data-start="684.22" data-end="686.65">and the cpu with tons of these memory</span> <span data-start="686.65" data-end="689.14">accesses that a little bit slow and then</span> <span data-start="689.14" data-end="691.57">a third copy right because the thing is</span> <span data-start="691.57" data-end="693.34">that when you when you copy when you get</span> <span data-start="693.34" data-end="695.29">the image data from your canvas it</span> <span data-start="695.29" data-end="697.27">doesn't let you get the image data into</span> <span data-start="697.27" data-end="699.79">an existing array it makes a new array</span> <span data-start="699.79" data-end="702.19">so if you were to have a high definition</span> <span data-start="702.19" data-end="704.86">video right that's 1280 pixels by 720</span> <span data-start="704.86" data-end="707.83">pixels by and the four bytes per pixel</span> <span data-start="707.83" data-end="710.38">because red green blue and alpha you</span> <span data-start="710.38" data-end="711.55">know you're looking at about three and a</span> <span data-start="711.55" data-end="713.41">half megabytes right so that's three and</span> <span data-start="713.41" data-end="715.59">a half megabytes copied three x plus</span> <span data-start="715.59" data-end="718.78">allocated and then garbage collected 30</span> <span data-start="718.78" data-end="721.12">times a second right and that'll slow</span> <span data-start="721.12" data-end="722.65">you down plus and that's not even with</span> <span data-start="722.65" data-end="723.85">the processing and this is just one</span> <span data-start="723.85" data-end="726.88">effect right so we tried it it didn't</span> <span data-start="726.88" data-end="728.08">really work we were getting really slow</span> <span data-start="728.08" data-end="729.88">frame rates you can see there's a couple</span> <span data-start="729.88" data-end="731.02">demos out there that do it with these</span> <span data-start="731.02"

<p><span data-start="742.12" data-end="744.64">WebGL is much much faster it processes</span> <span data-start="744.64" data-end="747.52">things in parallel there's a there's</span> <span data-start="747.52" data-end="749.92">kind of fewer of the video copies and</span> <span data-start="749.92" data-end="753.1">the applications and once you've got</span> <span data-start="753.1" data-end="756.13">your data on the GPU access to it within</span> <span data-start="756.13" data-end="758.8">the GPU is very very very fast and it</span> <span data-start="758.8" data-end="760.75">processes depends on what kind of</span> <span data-start="760.75" data-end="762.19">hardware you have but it processes many</span> <span data-start="762.19" data-end="765.46">pixels all at the same time right so now</span> <span data-start="765.46" data-end="766.93">how about this no thing right so i</span> <span data-start="766.93" data-end="768.58">talked about nodes it has nothing to do</span> <span data-start="768.58" data-end="770.89">with no Jas it's just a coincidence that</span> <span data-start="770.89" data-end="773.71">it's called that by the way it works is</span> <span data-start="773.71" data-end="775.33">kind of we have three or four different</span> <span data-start="775.33" data-end="777.64">kinds of nodes right you start off with</span> <span data-start="777.64" data-end="780.22">your source node which that accesses</span> <span data-start="780.22" data-end="782.23">your image source right so that can be a</span> <span data-start="782.23" data-end="784.15">video it can be an image it can be a</span> <span data-start="784.15" data-end="786.1">canvas really anything you want right</span> <span data-start="786.1" data-end="788.17">and you can make a number of those right</span> <span data-start="788.17" data-end="790.96">you can even actually access a pixel</span> <span data-start="790.96" data-end="793.48">array if you have that or dis ting web</span> </p>

<span data-start="909.669" data-end="913.449">it's pretty cool there's also a</span> <span data-start="913.449" data-end="915.879">transform nodes which are cool which is</span> <span

data-end="1186.65">know your</span> <span data-start="1186.65" data-end="1189.37">it's not weight is served in an that way</span> <span data-start="1189.37" data-end="1191.54">so what's it look like how do we use it</span> <span data-start="1191.54" data-end="1193.85">so like I said try to keep the API</span> <span data-start="1193.85" data-end="1195.83">pretty simple so we start with creating</span> <span data-start="1195.83" data-end="1197.06">this source node I'm not going to go</span> <span data-start="1197.06" data-end="1200.27">over too much code here so we create the</span> <span data-start="1200.27" data-end="1202.07">first thing as we create a new seriously</span> <span data-start="1202.07" data-end="1204.59">instance and that's your composition you</span> <span data-start="1204.59" data-end="1206.24">can access a video element just like you</span> <span data-start="1206.24" data-end="1208.49">have a team access any video element and</span> <span data-start="1208.49" data-end="1210.17">you create a source node by calling</span> <span data-start="1210.17" data-end="1212.48">seriously dot source that's it you've</span> <span data-start="1212.48" data-end="1216.14">got your source node pretty simple an</span> <span data-start="1216.14" data-end="1219.08">effect note very symbol similar right</span> <span data-start="1219.08" data-end="1220.85">you just we've already got our source</span> <span data-start="1220.85" data-end="1223.13">node right you carry a blur equals</span> <span data-start="1223.13" data-end="1225.77">seriously affect Direction blur so</span> <span data-start="1225.77" data-end="1227.42">you've got a string look up of all the</span> <span data-start="1227.42" data-end="1230">different effects in the library and</span> <span data-start="1230" data-end="1232.4">then you just kind of tweak the values</span> <span data-start="1232.4" data-end="1235.43">by just setting them on the object so</span> <span data-start="1235.43" data-end="1238.55">those are setters and getters and you</span> <span data-start="1238.55" data-end="1240.17">know they validate so you know if you</span> <span data-start="1240.17" data-end="1242.18">say blur amount and blur needs to be</span> <span data-start="1242.18" data-end="1244.43">between 0 and 1 and you give me you know</span> <span data-start="1244.43" data-end="1247.85">one and a half it just becomes one it we</span> <span data-start="1247.85" data-end="1249.53">try to be you know intelligent here and</span> <span data-start="1249.53" data-end="1253.64">make it easy um what else target note</span> <span data-start="1253.64" data-end="1256.07">right so target you always almost always</span> <span data-start="1256.07" data-end="1258.47">want to help put to a canvas you can</span> <span data-start="1258.47" data-end="1261.65">output to a byte array or a pixel you</span> <span data-start="1261.65" data-end="1264.97">know a pixel array or to an existing a</span> <span data-start="1264.97" data-end="1267.65">web GL texture but for the most part you</span> <span data-start="1267.65" data-end="1269.9">output directly to canvas you create</span> <span data-start="1269.9" data-end="1272.33">canvas that I put it in the in the DOM</span> <span data-start="1272.33" data-end="1274.52">and just create your target on the</span> <span data-start="1274.52" data-end="1278.33">canvas and the next step is to string</span> <span data-start="1278.33" data-end="1279.71">them all together right because we want</span> <span data-start="1279.71" data-end="1281.9">to create that node graph so you just</span> <span data-start="1281.9" data-end="1283.64">kind of connect your nodes by saying</span> <span data-start="1283.64" data-end="1286.43">blurred source is your source target</span> <span data-start="1286.43" data-end="1290.21">outsources your blur and then go so go</span> <span data-start="1290.21" data-end="1292.07">is pretty good so we have a couple of</span> <span data-start="1292.07" data-end="1293.21">options here for you how you actually</span> <span data-start="1293.21" data-end="1295.94">render so if you want to take any given</span> <span data-start="1295.94" data-end="1298.01">target node or the whole composition you</span> <span data-start="1298.01" data-end="1300.59">could just call target render right so</span> <span data-start="1300.59" data-end="1302.45">if you have a game loop for example and</span> <span data-start="1302.45" data-end="1304.13">you want to do other stuff in your game</span> <span data-start="1304.13" data-end="1305.87">loop and you want to use seriously j/s</span> <span data-start="1305.87" data-end="1308.93">as kind of the post-processing pass on</span> <span data-start="1308.93" data-end="1311.15">your game right you you're going to want</span> <span data-start="1311.15" data-end="1312.38">to run your own Trollope but you can</span> <span data-start="1312.38" data-end="1315.23">call it sir target render or you can</span> <span data-start="1315.23" data-end="1317.6">just say go and what go does go is great</span> <span data-start="1317.6" data-end="1319.37">because it then it monitors all of your</span> <span data-start="1319.37" data-end="1319.8">source</span> <span data-start="1319.8" data-end="1321.18">all of your you know whether it's your</span> <span data-start="1321.18" data-end="1323.67">videos and images as they get connected</span> <span data-start="1323.67" data-end="1325.98">and disconnected or as they play and all</span> <span data-start="1325.98" data-end="1328.79">of your your inputs so back when I said</span> <span data-start="1328.79" data-end="1332.16">like you know blur amount is your point</span> <span data-start="1332.16" data-end="1334.41">eight if you want to animate blur all</span> <span data-start="1334.41" data-end="1337.05">you got to do is you change it to 0.7 or</span> <span data-start="1337.05" data-end="1339.45">something else and once you use go it'll</span> <span data-start="1339.45" data-end="1341.25">automatically redraw but it will not</span> <span data-start="1341.25" data-end="1342.96">redraw while that stuff is not changing</span> <span data-start="1342.96" data-end="1347.67">just to be an efficient so we could</span> <span data-start="1347.67" data-end="1349.47">there's also kind of an easier way like</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1349.47" data-end="1351.69">I said polymorphism is really important</span> <span data-start="1351.69" data-end="1354.36">here so this is an example where we</span> <span data-start="1354.36" data-end="1357.6">create all their elements in in HTML in</span> <span data-start="1357.6" data-end="1360.51">the DOM and we can wire it up we can get</span> <span data-start="1360.51" data-end="1361.8">I'm going to hide I want to highlight</span> <span data-start="1361.8" data-end="1364.2">the code here so instead of actually</span> <span data-start="1364.2" data-end="1366.57">creating a source node we can create our</span> <span data-start="1366.57" data-end="1369.12">chroma key node right there's a chroma</span> <span data-start="1369.12" data-end="1372.27">key example and just set source is the</span> <span data-start="1372.27" data-end="1374.85">string is the ID of the video and what</span> <span data-start="1374.85" data-end="1376.89">else is really cool so split is our</span> <span data-start="1376.89" data-end="1378.27">effect node which which i'm going to</span> <span data-start="1378.27" data-end="1380.55">show you in a second and you can just</span> <span data-start="1380.55" data-end="1383.22">link that up to an actual input element</span> <span data-start="1383.22" data-end="1385.59">and it will watch the input element for</span> <span data-start="1385.59" data-end="1387.33">you so it's really fast to create</span> <span data-start="1387.33" data-end="1389.64">interfaces on these things I think like</span> <span data-start="1389.64" data-end="1392.28">a if you were creating a final</span> <span data-start="1392.28" data-end="1394.8">production of a piece you'd probably</span> <span data-start="1394.8" data-end="1396.96">build your own interfaces or you'd have</span> <span data-start="1396.96" data-end="1400.83">things on you know animate over time and</span> <span data-start="1400.83" data-end="1402.66">interact other things but a lot of times</span> <span data-start="1402.66" data-end="1405.09">for experimenting you just want to you</span> <span data-start="1405.09" data-end="1408.15">know wire that up to a range slider and</span> <span data-start="1408.15" data-end="1410.1">go right so that's pretty cool that</span> <span data-start="1410.1" data-end="1411.6">works pretty well so here's what that</span> <span data-start="1411.6" data-end="1414.84">looks like right so here we got our</span> <span data-start="1414.84" data-end="1417.12">video of a dog right and I created two</span> <span data-start="1417.12" data-end="1420.06">so we split the input of our dog video</span> <span data-start="1420.06" data-end="1423.57">to two different nodes 1 which is the</span> <span data-start="1423.57" data-end="1426">chroma key node right and then one is</span> <span data-start="1426" data-end="1428.37">straight into the split right so right</span> <span data-start="1428.37" data-end="1430.35">now the split is set at zero so we can</span> <span data-start="1430.35" data-end="1431.52">just kind of move I don't know why my</span> <span data-start="1431.52" data-end="1438.01">dogs not playing well that's not good</span> <span data-start="1438.02" data-end="1441.85">there you go</span> <span data-start="1441.86" data-end="1444.32">there you go so we can just kind of drag</span> <span data-start="1444.32" data-end="1447.11">our split effect and it's got an angle</span> <span data-start="1447.11" data-end="1450.41">parameter on it right and then we can we</span> <span data-start="1450.41" data-end="1454.26">can make the edge fuzzy if we want to</span> <span data-start="1454.27" data-end="1458.63">just kind of drag that around so that's</span> <span data-start="1458.63" data-end="1460.34">it's a it's pretty easy if you just kind</span> <span data-start="1460.34" data-end="1462.92">of want to play with the effects and see</span> <span data-start="1462.92" data-end="1464">what works and it wasn't really very</span> <span data-start="1464" data-end="1466.64">much code and the dog just kind of</span> <span data-start="1466.64" data-end="1468.29">looped some plays and you know and he's</span> <span data-start="1468.29" data-end="1471.44">fine he's very happy so okay let's move</span> <span data-start="1471.44" data-end="1475.64">back over here all right so a couple of</span> <span data-start="1475.64" data-end="1478.64">tips just some things to be aware of if</span> <span data-start="1478.64" data-end="1481.45">you're using this first thing is</span> <span data-start="1481.45" data-end="1485.059">preprocessed what you can so you know</span> <span data-start="1485.059" data-end="1486.5">we're doing a lot of these processing</span> <span data-start="1486.5" data-end="1487.94">and you'll see some more options what</span> <span data-start="1487.94" data-end="1489.53">you can do is a lot of color effects and</span> <span data-start="1489.53" data-end="1493.19">things like that you know if you have a</span> <span data-start="1493.19" data-end="1494.809">color fact that's the same on every</span> <span

data-start="1506.809" data-end="1508.64">video then great do that you'll save</span> <span data-start="1508.64" data-end="1511.97">some cpu cycles and you know and you</span> <span data-start="1511.97" data-end="1513.32">might even depending on what the effect</span> <span data-start="1513.32" data-end="1516.19">is you might even get a better output</span> <span

data-start="1567.44" data-end="1570.53">but the slowest thing that the</span> <span data-start="1570.53" data-end="1572.96">bottleneck tends to be the upload of the</span> <span data-start="1572.96" data-end="1575.45">video frame from the video element into</span> <span data-start="1575.45" data-end="1579.89">the GPU and once you get above 960 x 540</span> <span data-start="1579.89"

data-end="1624.74">but here the size is more important in</span> <span data-start="1624.74" data-end="1628.28">the pixels okay so moving on it's time</span> <span data-start="1628.28" data-end="1629.929">for some demos right let's get to the</span> <span data-start="1629.929" data-end="1633.5">good stuff okay um all right so i need</span> <span data-start="1633.5" data-end="1635.9">to give myself camera access hang on</span> <span data-start="1635.9" data-end="1639.08">thank you all right so all this stuff</span> <span data-start="1639.08" data-end="1641.24">works great with getusermedia hang on</span> <span data-start="1641.24" data-end="1644.72">there we go okay how are we doing all</span> <span data-start="1644.72" data-end="1647.3">right so one thing we can do is I showed</span> <span data-start="1647.3" data-end="1649.429">you that split effective before right we</span> <span data-start="1649.429" data-end="1651.62">do ourselves a good old Star Wars wipe</span> <span data-start="1651.62" data-end="1655.4">effect right to the fish well as a fish</span> <span data-start="1655.4" data-end="1657.559">video not playing I don't know that fish</span> <span data-start="1657.559" data-end="1658.61">video is supposed to be playing but</span> <span data-start="1658.61" data-end="1662.69">imagine it's playing and you know that's</span> <span data-start="1662.69" data-end="1665.03">that works back and forth it's a very</span> <span data-start="1665.03" data-end="1666.74">simple little effect you can do just</span> <span data-start="1666.74" data-end="1668.87">kind of replicate some of the stuff</span> <span data-start="1668.87" data-end="1671.659">we've seen in the cinema here's another</span> <span data-start="1671.659" data-end="1673.73">one oh this is fun this is an ASCII text</span> <span data-start="1673.73" data-end="1680.63">effect that's pretty good and that works</span> <span data-start="1680.63" data-end="1682.76">on the fish to another Fisher move in</span> <span data-start="1682.76" data-end="1685.79">there you go alright so ASCII fish is</span> <span data-start="1685.79" data-end="1688.7">very important okay what else you got Oh</span> <span data-start="1688.7" data-end="1691.909">chroma key this is fun so this is um</span> <span data-start="1691.909" data-end="1694.13">this is a blue screen effect I was</span> <span data-start="1694.13" data-end="1695.21">telling you about I happen to have</span> <span data-start="1695.21" data-end="1699.72">behind me a great big blue screen and</span> <span data-start="1699.73" data-end="1701.99">yeah so that works so that's pretty good</span> <span data-start="1701.99" data-end="1703.669">so works for a blue screen green screen</span> <span data-start="1703.669" data-end="1705.74">and it was like</span> <span data-start="1705.74" data-end="1707.75">code for this is super short like I set</span> <span data-start="1707.75" data-end="1709.1">up the chroma key note i showed you</span> <span data-start="1709.1" data-end="1710.66">before and i'll have to do is set the</span> <span data-start="1710.66" data-end="1714.14">color from green to blue and it's a</span> <span data-start="1714.14" data-end="1716.36">pretty good effect it's um the some of</span> <span data-start="1716.36" data-end="1718.91">the demos that you see out there for the</span> <span data-start="1718.91" data-end="1721.34">2d canvas they do kind of this distance</span> <span data-start="1721.34" data-end="1723.14">model where they say all right I've you</span> <span data-start="1723.14" data-end="1724.52">know as long as my color is within a</span> <span data-start="1724.52" data-end="1726.41">certain range of my target color Wilkie</span> <span data-start="1726.41" data-end="1728.36">it out but this uses a little bit more</span> <span data-start="1728.36" data-end="1730.07">complicated model involving the</span> <span data-start="1730.07" data-end="1732.86">saturation of the the pixels loop or</span> <span data-start="1732.86" data-end="1735.14">high saturation and so it can even do</span> <span data-start="1735.14" data-end="1736.67">things like it can detect things like</span> <span data-start="1736.67" data-end="1739.52">glass that's semi-transparent so if I if</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1739.52" data-end="1742.34">I had some you know there's I have</span> <span data-start="1742.34" data-end="1743.24">another video where there's a guy</span> <span data-start="1743.24" data-end="1744.53">blowing bubbles in front of a green</span> <span data-start="1744.53" data-end="1746.03">screen and you can kind of see the</span> <span data-start="1746.03" data-end="1747.95">bubbles and it extracts the green so</span> <span data-start="1747.95" data-end="1749.54">it's pretty cool and shadows and stuff</span> <span data-start="1749.54" data-end="1752.12">so that's pretty good definitely play</span> <span data-start="1752.12" data-end="1752.96">with that that's a big one for</span> <span data-start="1752.96" data-end="1757.46">compositing um what else oh yeah TV</span> <span data-start="1757.46" data-end="1758.929">glitch effect this is one of my</span> <span data-start="1758.929" data-end="1762.08">favorites we do a little channel change</span> <span data-start="1762.08" data-end="1766.55">hang on there you go so hop the TV</span> <span data-start="1766.55" data-end="1768.95">glitch effect this one this is my</span> <span data-start="1768.95" data-end="1770.78">favorite TV glitch i think is going to</span> <span data-start="1770.78" data-end="1773.48">be the page curl of a 21st century right</span> <span data-start="1773.48" data-end="1775.37">so I guys I want you all to go out there</span> <span data-start="1775.37" data-end="1777.65">and throw TV glitch affected everything</span> <span data-start="1777.65" data-end="1779.42">and it's great because we don't really</span> <span data-start="1779.42" data-end="1781.85">have TVs like this anymore and i love</span> <span data-start="1781.85" data-end="1783.77">how in movies they always have analog</span> <span data-start="1783.77" data-end="1786.29">you know TV glitch on digital signals so</span> <span data-start="1786.29" data-end="1788.929">go do lots of that that's good explore</span> <span data-start="1788.929" data-end="1793.79">it play with it um what else ok so this</span> <span data-start="1793.79" data-end="1795.62">is this is not actually affect this is a</span> <span data-start="1795.62" data-end="1796.94">thing this is a trend if you see those</span> <span data-start="1796.94" data-end="1801.67">movies this is a still from Transformers</span> <span data-start="1801.67" data-end="1804.99">7 or something I don't know</span> <span data-start="1804.99" data-end="1807.63">and they do this thing now where they</span> <span data-start="1807.63" data-end="1810.69">make all these movies they did it in it</span> <span data-start="1810.69" data-end="1812.64">did it in this hot tub time machine they</span> <span data-start="1812.64" data-end="1814.47">did it great movie they did an iron man</span> <span data-start="1814.47" data-end="1816.42">2 I don't have a picture that but you</span> <span data-start="1816.42" data-end="1818.07">notice these guys everything is either</span> <span data-start="1818.07" data-end="1821.4">blue or orange so they do this kind of</span> <span data-start="1821.4" data-end="1823.83">digital color timing the digital color</span> <span data-start="1823.83" data-end="1825.09">correction actually is interesting a</span> <span data-start="1825.09" data-end="1826.26">little bit of history that started with</span> <span data-start="1826.26" data-end="1828">some I think it was oh brother where art</span> <span data-start="1828" data-end="1830.25">thou was the first movie where they they</span> <span data-start="1830.25" data-end="1832.02">really just scanned in the whole film</span> <span data-start="1832.02" data-end="1833.7">into a computer and they digitally color</span> <span data-start="1833.7" data-end="1835.26">corrected it and now everything is</span> <span data-start="1835.26" data-end="1836.76">digitally color corrected and now</span> <span data-start="1836.76" data-end="1838.26">they're making everything to be blue and</span> <span data-start="1838.26" data-end="1839.76">orange and it's ridiculous and it's</span> <span data-start="1839.76" data-end="1842.85">terrible and you know you can do that</span> <span data-start="1842.85" data-end="1844.83">too so now I'm going to I'll show you</span> <span data-start="1844.83" data-end="1847.34">what it looks like I turn it on and off</span> <span data-start="1847.34" data-end="1849.66">so there's my skin it's all kind of</span> <span data-start="1849.66" data-end="1852.27">orange and the toggle it so that's it</span> <span data-start="1852.27" data-end="1854.37">off it's a subtle effect here it works</span> <span data-start="1854.37" data-end="1857.22">with the fish too right so that's what</span> <span data-start="1857.22" data-end="1858.74">the fish are supposed to look like and</span> <span data-start="1858.74" data-end="1863.22">here we get me make the orange pop so if</span> <span data-start="1863.22" data-end="1865.02">you want to explore that cliche also</span> <span data-start="1865.02" data-end="1866.64">please go do that maybe it could</span> <span data-start="1866.64" data-end="1868.83">probably use some TV glitch but I didn't</span> <span data-start="1868.83" data-end="1871.41">have time for that okay what else oh</span> <span data-start="1871.41" data-end="1875.73">yeah this is a fun one okay this one is</span> <span data-start="1875.73" data-end="1877.74">so this is an interactive video</span> <span data-start="1877.74" data-end="1879.51">experiment I played with this is a music</span> <span data-start="1879.51" data-end="1882.179">video I can't hang out have to do that</span> <span data-start="1882.179" data-end="1889.06">here I have to click the play button</span> <span data-start="1889.07" data-end="1892.909">okay so this is a video by the band okay</span> <span data-start="1892.909" data-end="1896.649">go so this I use for a color replacement</span> <span data-start="1896.649" data-end="1899.09">so okay goes great if you go to</span> <span data-start="1899.09" data-end="1901.429">seriously Jas org I have another demo</span> <span data-start="1901.429" data-end="1904.25">from Ok Go that I did they're great they</span> <span data-start="1904.25" data-end="1906.83">did the video the guys on the treadmills</span> <span data-start="1906.83" data-end="1908.84">if you don't know who they are and</span> <span data-start="1908.84" data-end="1910.1">they're just great to work with because</span> <span data-start="1910.1" data-end="1911.63">they make these really colorful videos</span> <span data-start="1911.63" data-end="1912.889">and they put it out there for you to</span> <span data-start="1912.889" data-end="1915.409">mess with so this is this kind of here</span> <span data-start="1915.409" data-end="1917.059">let me go back a little bit this</span> <span data-start="1917.059" data-end="1918.47">colorful video so I built this thing</span> <span data-start="1918.47" data-end="1920.48">where the more you move the mouse it</span> <span data-start="1920.48" data-end="1923.33">just kind of changes the color and it's</span> <span data-start="1923.33" data-end="1924.98">got a great little filter on it based on</span> <span data-start="1924.98" data-end="1927.44">kind of a range of hue and saturation so</span> <span data-start="1927.44" data-end="1931.159">it changes it excludes the skin tone and</span> <span data-start="1931.159" data-end="1935.12">kind of the ground and stuff and it only</span> <span data-start="1935.12" data-end="1937.159">filters out the wall so I built this</span> <span data-start="1937.159" data-end="1939.2">little demo where you have to keep</span> <span data-start="1939.2" data-end="1940.549">moving the mouse and the more you move</span> <span data-start="1940.549" data-end="1942.74">the mouse the more changes the color but</span> <span data-start="1942.74" data-end="1944">if you stop moving the mouse you don't</span> <span data-start="1944" data-end="1947.899">touch it it kind of fades out to grey so</span> <span data-start="1947.899" data-end="1949.879">this is kind of a little experiment and</span> <span data-start="1949.879" data-end="1953">and each scene as they change each scene</span> <span data-start="1953" data-end="1955.61">has a different kind of different kind</span> <span data-start="1955.61" data-end="1957.74">of settings on it so I use popcorn jjs</span> <span data-start="1957.74" data-end="1959.75">to create each scene and change the</span> <span data-start="1959.75" data-end="1964.25">settings on the hue/saturation node so</span> <span data-start="1964.25" data-end="1967.639">that's pretty cool so I like that uh so</span> <span data-start="1967.639"
