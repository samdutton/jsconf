data-end="303.629">interact with music videos it's like you</span> <span data-start="303.629" data-end="306">watch it and that's it so there is a</span> <span data-start="306" data-end="308.099">place for improvement there is a place</span> <span data-start="308.099" data-end="310.44">to do something interesting in there we</span> <span data-start="310.44" data-end="312.99">can take the basic idea of rotoscoping</span> <span data-start="312.99" data-end="316.65">and take it into the browser so if we</span> <span data-start="316.65" data-end="318.3">take a look at these part of the video</span> <span data-start="318.3" data-end="321.06">of heartens by Paramore we can see that</span> <span data-start="321.06" data-end="323.069">there are free layers we see a</span> <span data-start="323.069"

behind</span> <span data-start="340.38" data-end="342.96">the scenes we got this which is really</span> <span data-start="342.96" data-end="345.84">funny to watch what they did was</span> <span data-start="345.84" data-end="348.06">actually they recorded this video they</span> <span data-start="348.06" data-end="350.449">reverse it so it's actually reversed</span> <span data-start="350.449" data-end="354.06">they remove that green background fill</span> <span data-start="354.06" data-end="356.43">it with this kind of yellow and blue</span> <span data-start="356.43" data-end="359.46">animations put themselves and on top of</span> <span data-start="359.46" data-end="362.58">that the other animations so we can do</span> <span data-start="362.58" data-end="364.5">something like this we can begin with</span> <span data-start="364.5" data-end="367.02">this we can remove the green background</span> <span data-start="367.02" data-end="369.539">and add something else there is</span> <span data-start="369.539" data-end="371.219">something called chroma key and it's</span> <span data-start="371.219" data-end="375.09">really common in movies like Avengers so</span> <span data-start="375.09" data-end="378.09">what they do is they record a movie with</span> <span data-start="378.09" data-end="380.639">a green or blue background white green</span> <span data-start="380.639" data-end="383.219">and blue or not because it's Percy B</span> <span data-start="383.219" data-end="385.74">well we cannot really use well because</span> <span data-start="385.74" data-end="388.349">our faces have a tendency to be red so</span> <span data-start="388.349" data-end="390.509">we have to choose either green or blue</span> <span data-start="390.509" data-end="392.639">which has the two colors we don't</span> <span data-start="392.639" data-end="395.399">usually have on our skin and of course</span> <span data-start="395.399" data-end="396.3">if we will use</span> <span data-start="396.3" data-end="397.65">the green background we don't wear a</span> <span data-start="397.65" data-end="400.68">green if we use blue we can wear please</span> <span data-start="400.68" data-end="403.169">and once you've got that once you got</span> <span data-start="403.169" data-end="405.419">that blue or green background you need</span> <span data-start="405.419" data-end="408.12">really good light and I mean really good</span> <span data-start="408.12" data-end="408.599">light</span> <span data-start="408.599" data-end="412.039">and that means use not natural light</span> <span data-start="412.039" data-end="414.84">natural light is like that level for</span> <span data-start="414.84" data-end="417.15">animations if you have ever work on in</span> <span data-start="417.15" data-end="419.879">stop-motion animation or even work on</span> <span data-start="419.879" data-end="421.62">something like chroma key you will</span> <span data-start="421.62" data-end="423.27">understand that natural light is</span> <span data-start="423.27" data-end="426.81">horrible simply because these kind of</span> <span data-start="426.81" data-end="429.389">animations take so much time that maybe</span> <span data-start="429.389" data-end="432.03">you expect any towers working on it and</span> <span data-start="432.03" data-end="434.699">in those eight hours the earth moves</span> <span data-start="434.699" data-end="437.639">around the Sun so suddenly only shadows</span> <span data-start="437.639" data-end="440.069">move and that is a disaster so we don't</span> <span data-start="440.069" data-end="442.56">want really this kind of natural light</span> <span data-start="442.56" data-end="444.539">we prefer these lights whenever we work</span> <span data-start="444.539" data-end="447.12">with animations or in this case with</span> <span data-start="447.12" data-end="449.37">chroma key so let me see</span> <span data-start="449.37" data-end="451.259">chroma key now let's make chroma key</span> <span data-start="451.259" data-end="453.509">with the users camera because again we</span> <span data-start="453.509" data-end="454.949">are in the web we can actually enjoy</span> <span data-start="454.949" data-end="458.58">this so to do this what we need to do is</span> <span data-start="458.58" data-end="461.279">to take the users input camera and take</span> <span data-start="461.279" data-end="463.199">that input and put it into a video tab</span> <span data-start="463.199" data-end="466.229">now we cannot edit a video tag so we</span> <span data-start="466.229" data-end="468.9">need to copy that into a canvas and then</span> <span data-start="468.9" data-end="471.33">process that canvas and what we will do</span> <span data-start="471.33" data-end="474.09">is remove the green or the blue and</span> <span data-start="474.09" data-end="476.88">replace that with something else so</span> <span data-start="476.88" data-end="479.069">first step take the users camera input</span> <span data-start="479.069" data-end="481.279">to do this we actually use getusermedia</span> <span data-start="481.279" data-end="484.289">which is really simple to use and it's</span> <span data-start="484.289" data-end="486.629">available a loss in every browser this</span> <span data-start="486.629" data-end="488.61">will return a promise and then we can</span> <span data-start="488.61" data-end="489.919">work on it</span> <span data-start="489.919" data-end="493.62">so we got our B data with an ID of video</span> <span data-start="493.62" data-end="496.44">and we copy all this streaming from the</span> <span data-start="496.44" data-end="499.169">camera into that video and if it doesn't</span> <span data-start="499.169" data-end="501.99">work we just throw an error message and</span> <span data-start="501.99" data-end="509.639">we get something like this anywhere it's</span> <span data-start="509.639" data-end="512.31">kind of ok so you got your video tag you</span> <span data-start="512.31" data-end="515.159">accept the job prompt assess would you</span> <span data-start="515.159" data-end="518.579">allow using your video and perfect so</span> <span data-start="518.579" data-end="522.269">let's copy that into a canvas tag so we</span> <span data-start="522.269" data-end="524.91">get to create our canvas with an ID of</span> <span data-start="524.91" data-end="528.53">canvas because I'm really creative and</span> <span data-start="528.53" data-end="531.71">then we basically allow 2d context and</span> <span data-start="531.71" data-end="534.62">we create a function like this so what</span> <span data-start="534.62" data-end="536.6">this function will do is it will take</span> <span data-start="536.6" data-end="539.27">all the information from our video from</span> <span data-start="539.27" data-end="541.88">the top left corner on to the bottom</span> <span data-start="541.88" data-end="544.25">right corner and it will copy it into</span> <span data-start="544.25" data-end="548.09">our canvas now if you only use this code</span> <span data-start="548.09" data-end="550.76">we will have one issue that is that only</span> <span data-start="550.76" data-end="553.64">we will see the first frame of the video</span> <span data-start="553.64" data-end="556.16">copy into the canvas and then the video</span> <span data-start="556.16" data-end="558.29">will keep on a streaming but it canvas</span> <span data-start="558.29" data-end="560.48">one refresh so we need to refresh the</span> <span data-start="560.48" data-end="563.24">canvas all the time there are so many</span> <span data-start="563.24" data-end="565.31">great performance talk in this</span> <span data-start="565.31" data-end="567.2">conference that's why mine is not</span> <span data-start="567.2" data-end="569.6">performant we are going to do a set time</span> <span data-start="569.6" data-end="573.56">out of zero so we do it the time out the</span> <span data-start="573.56" data-end="576.2">zero we get something like this we get</span> <span data-start="576.2" data-end="578.06">the prompt will you share your camera</span> <span data-start="578.06" data-end="580.46">with this website years and then we get</span> <span data-start="580.46" data-end="582.32">the videos on the left the original</span> <span data-start="582.32"

<span data-start="612.86" data-end="615.74">tiniest part of a video or an image like</span> <span data-start="615.74" data-end="619.25">this a pixel has information in this</span> <span data-start="619.25" data-end="622.1">case or shibi information so if we take</span> <span data-start="622.1" data-end="624.32">a look at this pink we are actually</span> <span data-start="624.32" data-end="628.16">taking a look at this red blast screen</span> <span data-start="628.16" data-end="632.93">plus this blue and all those free audio</span> <span data-start="632.93" data-end="634.55">returns this pink</span> <span data-start="634.55" data-end="639.56">an RGB goes from 0 to 255 0 being black</span> <span data-start="639.56" data-end="642.71">and 255 being the strongest rather</span> <span data-start="642.71" data-end="644.54">stronger screen and the strongest blue</span> <span data-start="644.54" data-end="647.03">so in this case we got a really strong</span> <span data-start="647.03" data-end="650.36">red a kind of dark green and a kind of</span> <span data-start="650.36" data-end="653.51">in the middle blue under so through the</span> <span data-start="653.51" data-end="655.46">alpha Channel and I know this sounds</span> <span data-start="655.46" data-end="657.5">weird because there is not such a thing</span> <span data-start="657.5" data-end="660.95">as transparency in videos but anyway</span> <span data-start="660.95" data-end="661.769">when we ask</span> <span data-start="661.769" data-end="663.86">information in will return the alpha-2</span> <span data-start="663.86" data-end="667.8">so what we will do right now is we will</span> <span data-start="667.8" data-end="670.739">ask for every pixel information of every</span> <span data-start="670.739" data-end="673.439">frame that our video is getting and we</span> <span data-start="673.439" data-end="675.329">will ask for the red value of the green</span> <span data-start="675.329" data-end="678.959">value w value and the Alpha value and</span> <span data-start="678.959" data-end="682.739">then we will turn that alpha value into</span> <span data-start="682.739" data-end="686.519">zero so that will be the trick so we</span> <span data-start="686.519" data-end="688.17">find the green pixels and we'll read</span> <span data-start="688.17" data-end="690.509">them with them to find the good pixels</span> <span data-start="690.509" data-end="692.189">we need to take a look at the</span> <span data-start="692.189" data-end="694.259">information of the video so to do that</span> <span data-start="694.259" data-end="697.11">we use get image data get image data</span> <span data-start="697.11" data-end="698.91">will return all the information from</span> <span data-start="698.91" data-end="702.499">every part of the video in an RGB a way</span> <span data-start="702.499" data-end="705.389">plus it will return the height and the</span> <span data-start="705.389" data-end="708.569">width of the video so when I cancel not</span> <span data-start="708.569" data-end="711.119">that I get this which is okay the width</span> <span data-start="711.119" data-end="714.749">of the video is 480 the the height is</span> <span data-start="714.749" data-end="719.1">480 the with a 640 and here it is the</span> <span data-start="719.1" data-end="722.699">1.2 million array because yeah why</span> <span data-start="722.699" data-end="724.86">wouldn't you need the 1.2 million all</span> <span data-start="724.86" data-end="727.92">right when is this 1.2 million because</span> <span data-start="727.92" data-end="729.779">it seems like a random number it's</span> <span data-start="729.779" data-end="732.089">actually the width of the video multiply</span> <span data-start="732.089" data-end="733.98">the height of the video multiply 4</span> <span data-start="733.98" data-end="736.709">because 4 is the number of information</span> <span data-start="736.709" data-end="739.139">that you get from each pixel the red the</span> <span data-start="739.139" data-end="741.779">green the blue and the alpha so if you</span> <span data-start="741.779" data-end="745.429">open that if it is so you open it again</span> <span data-start="745.429" data-end="749.339">and again and again and suddenly you get</span> <span data-start="749.339" data-end="752.249">to the important part so in this part it</span> <span data-start="752.249" data-end="754.559">looks like random numbers again but we</span> <span data-start="754.559" data-end="758.399">can find a sequence the sequence is 255</span> <span data-start="758.399" data-end="760.589">so we know that video doesn't have</span> <span data-start="760.589" data-end="763.079">transparency so that must be the Alpha</span> <span data-start="763.079" data-end="765.509">and if that is the alpha that means of</span> <span data-start="765.509" data-end="768.749">we can identify the others is rgbi your</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="768.749" data-end="770.79">GPA you should be a of every pixel</span> <span data-start="770.79" data-end="773.759">beginning from the top left so if we</span> <span data-start="773.759" data-end="776.279">take a look at the first pixel we get</span> <span data-start="776.279" data-end="779.04">this value which is equal to this her</span> <span data-start="779.04" data-end="782.669">GPA so what get there is something like</span> <span data-start="782.669" data-end="783.48">blueish</span> <span data-start="783.48" data-end="788.399">yeah because it's 55 red 74 of blue and</span> <span data-start="788.399" data-end="792.929">86 of green of sorry 74 of green and</span> <span data-start="792.929" data-end="795.059">ethicists of blue 16 of lewisham is</span> <span data-start="795.059" data-end="796.019">really dark</span> <span data-start="796.019" data-end="798.899">those are really low values and the one</span> <span data-start="798.899" data-end="803.189">of the alpha so let's go through all</span> <span data-start="803.189" data-end="805.829">that data and let's find the green</span> <span data-start="805.829" data-end="808.529">pixels and we need to identify them we</span> <span data-start="808.529" data-end="810.899">identify the red values the green values</span> <span data-start="810.899" data-end="813.48">and the blue values and then we ask if</span> <span data-start="813.48" data-end="815.73">the Green is greater than the blue and</span> <span data-start="815.73" data-end="817.98">it will Green is greater than the red if</span> <span data-start="817.98" data-end="819.869">that is the case I'm going to turn the</span> <span data-start="819.869" data-end="823.139">opacity value to syrup and then I have</span> <span data-start="823.139" data-end="825.48">to return this new information to our</span> <span data-start="825.48" data-end="829.98">cameras so this gets us something like</span> <span data-start="829.98" data-end="837.629">this which looks really bad I mean it</span> <span data-start="837.629" data-end="840.119">works but we cannot really happy on</span> <span data-start="840.119" data-end="842.22">celebrating because of that so we need</span> <span data-start="842.22" data-end="844.049">to improve it there are two things that</span> <span data-start="844.049" data-end="845.85">are really wrong in there first one is a</span> <span data-start="845.85" data-end="848.819">right that is natural light that's why I</span> <span data-start="848.819" data-end="850.92">say natural light is not the devil you</span> <span data-start="850.92" data-end="852.929">don't do natural light you can see that</span> <span data-start="852.929" data-end="855.269">it's like a lot of light coming from one</span> <span data-start="855.269" data-end="858.299">side and nothing from the other and then</span> <span data-start="858.299" data-end="861.089">we need to remove the colors only if the</span> <span data-start="861.089" data-end="864.569">greens are bigger than 100 why because</span> <span data-start="864.569" data-end="866.759">as you can see part of my hair has been</span> <span data-start="866.759" data-end="869.369">taken away I mean hair is not green as</span> <span data-start="869.369" data-end="872.509">far as I know but it's brown and</span> <span data-start="872.509" data-end="876.42">basically browns and grays have a value</span> <span data-start="876.42" data-end="879.36">of red green and blue so even though if</span> <span data-start="879.36" data-end="881.699">those values are really low the computer</span> <span data-start="881.699" data-end="883.559">will is still identified it's only has</span> <span data-start="883.559" data-end="885.839">only one more pixel screen and it will</span> <span data-start="885.839" data-end="887.549">pick it a screen even though we listen</span> <span data-start="887.549" data-end="890.009">so whenever it is too dark whenever the</span> <span data-start="890.009" data-end="892.829">value is too close to zero we really</span> <span data-start="892.829" data-end="895.11">cannot trust it so we won't remove</span> <span data-start="895.11" data-end="897.959">values that are lower than 100 because</span> <span data-start="897.959" data-end="900.059">those are dark values and we are not</span> <span data-start="900.059" data-end="902.49">sure if they are really green off or if</span> <span data-start="902.49" data-end="906.629">they art may be grounds or grace so we</span> <span data-start="906.629" data-end="912.029">get something like this in return so I</span> <span data-start="912.029" data-end="914.249">kind of worked better we have now no</span> <span data-start="914.249" data-end="918.209">natural light we have to remove only the</span> <span data-start="918.209" data-end="920.999">greens if they are bigger than 100 so as</span> <span data-start="920.999"
