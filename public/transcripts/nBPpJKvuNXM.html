data-start="118.27" data-end="119.89">the internet were created a long long</span> <span data-start="119.89" data-end="121.9">time ago and on the fundamental level</span> <span data-start="121.9" data-end="125.53">they're a little bit flawed because the</span> <span data-start="125.53" data-end="127.6">internet was originally conceived and</span> <span data-start="127.6" data-end="129.64">created as a completely decentralized</span> <span data-start="129.64" data-end="132.55">network that no single authority can</span> <span data-start="132.55" data-end="136.66">control and the web as well was thought</span> <span data-start="136.66" data-end="140.23">of as kind of a cyberspace where every</span> <span data-start="140.23"

data-start="163" data-end="165.13">largely dependent on big corporations</span> <span data-start="165.13" data-end="168.76">that run our infrastructure like giant</span> <span data-start="168.76" data-end="171.04">data centers and they provide many</span> <span data-start="171.04" data-end="174.989">useful services like email for example</span> <span data-start="174.989" data-end="178.239">it wasn't always like that though at</span> <span data-start="178.239" data-end="180.4">first people set up and run their own</span> <span data-start="180.4" data-end="182.11">email servers and control their own</span> <span data-start="182.11" data-end="187.54">communications this approach was not</span> <span data-start="187.54" data-end="190.42">scalable so so natural consequence was</span> <span data-start="190.42" data-end="192.37">that a lot of small commercial email</span> <span data-start="192.37" data-end="195.88">email providers sprang up at first they</span> <span data-start="195.88"

data-end="202.51">that it was a great feeling</span> <span data-start="202.51" data-end="204.28">to just create your accounts and get</span> <span data-start="204.28" data-end="207.31">access to whole

to</span> <span data-start="214.51" data-end="217.209">use the internet the more our services</span> <span data-start="217.209" data-end="219.489">are consolidated around just a few of</span> <span
