data-start="155.37" data-end="159.45">work all right okay so brief history on</span> <span data-start="159.45" data-end="161.03">this I kind of got involved in this</span> <span data-start="161.03" data-end="163.62">about a year and a half ago I started</span> <span data-start="163.62" data-end="165.03">working with a place in Portland Oregon</span> <span data-start="165.03" data-end="167.61">called casa diablo it's a world's first</span> <span data-start="167.61" data-end="169.14">vegan strip club and we're trying to</span> <span data-start="169.14" data-end="171.18">kind of modernize the strip club</span> <span data-start="171.18" data-end="174.72">industry and so this is kind of grown</span> <span data-start="174.72" data-end="177.93">from the little sensor situation that</span> <span data-start="177.93" data-end="179.76">we've created in the private area so</span> <span data-start="179.76" data-end="181.23">that we can kind of monitor who's back</span> <span data-start="181.23" data-end="184.079">there whether they've paid that sort of</span> <span data-start="184.079" data-end="186.48">thing so it's turned into something</span> <span data-start="186.48" data-end="187.59">that's a lot of fun for a lot of people</span> <span data-start="187.59" data-end="189.42">in my whole thing is trying to make a</span> <span data-start="189.42" data-end="190.92">little more accessible for people you</span> <span data-start="190.92" data-end="192.569">know like software developers kind of</span> <span data-start="192.569" data-end="195.15">usually look at hardware they're like</span> <span data-start="195.15" data-end="197.79">that's hard you know so it's really not</span> <span data-start="197.79" data-end="199.049">that hard and I guess that's what we're</span> <span data-start="199.049" data-end="203.76">going to try to illustrate today um the</span> <span data-start="203.76" data-end="204.78">one thing I didn't realize is we're</span> <span data-start="204.78" data-end="206.13">probably gonna need like a computer or</span> <span data-start="206.13" data-end="208.68">two for you guys so I don't know if you</span> <span data-start="208.68" data-end="210.6">guys have your laptop's like grab that</span> <span data-start="210.6" data-end="223.69">and so let me see here</span> <span data-start="223.7" data-end="230.2">right</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="230.21" data-end="232.04">I guess is going to be more of like a</span> <span data-start="232.04" data-end="233.78">classroom demonstration that an actual</span> <span data-start="233.78" data-end="235.22">talk but so go ahead an open up your</span> <span data-start="235.22" data-end="239.99">black box is and we've got everything we</span> <span data-start="239.99" data-end="241.97">need maybe you guys can show what you've</span> <span data-start="241.97" data-end="247.16">got in here LEDs jumpers wires we're all</span> <span data-start="247.16" data-end="250.93">familiar with wires yeah okay arduino</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="250.93" data-end="253.52">USB cable some screws you don't need</span> <span data-start="253.52" data-end="256.4">those right now that is the ultrasonic</span> <span data-start="256.4" data-end="259.91">sensor and I actually manufactured these</span> <span data-start="259.91" data-end="261.83">for you now just the just the cabling</span> <span data-start="261.83" data-end="265.64">and so I guess what we're going to do is</span> <span data-start="265.64" data-end="270.95">get your bread boards out and open up</span> <span data-start="270.95" data-end="288.05">your pin packaging</span> <span data-start="288.06" data-end="291.03">and what we're going to do is we're</span> <span data-start="291.03" data-end="292.919">going to take our ultrasonic sensor and</span> <span data-start="292.919" data-end="294.66">you can pretty much pick anywhere that</span> <span data-start="294.66" data-end="296.55">you want to place it but see if I have</span> <span data-start="296.55" data-end="308.85">mine yeah so plug it in make sure you</span> <span data-start="308.85" data-end="312.57">plug it in I figure out the best way to</span> <span data-start="312.57" data-end="317.82">show everyone here but with the</span> <span data-start="317.82" data-end="321.19">breadboard you'll want to plug it in</span> <span data-start="321.2" data-end="323.7">yeah like that well not necessarily on</span> <span data-start="323.7" data-end="325.5">the inside but just so that each pin is</span> <span data-start="325.5" data-end="330.33">in its own number slot not just a mine</span> <span data-start="330.33" data-end="333.12">doesn't have that but yours do yeah I</span> <span data-start="333.12" data-end="338.21">just plug it right in that was the goal</span> <span data-start="338.21" data-end="340.74">yeah just anywhere as long as it's each</span> <span data-start="340.74" data-end="345.63">pin has its own way all right and then</span> <span data-start="345.63" data-end="349.62">we get our dreams out a couple of our</span> <span data-start="349.62" data-end="353.64">jumpers and on these to explain what</span> <span data-start="353.64" data-end="354.63">these guys are these are little</span> <span data-start="354.63" data-end="356.58">ultrasonic sensors and for those of you</span> <span data-start="356.58" data-end="358.38">who are at node copter this is the same</span> <span data-start="358.38" data-end="359.7">type of sensor that's in the bottom of</span> <span data-start="359.7" data-end="361.47">the copters that that pings the floor</span> <span data-start="361.47" data-end="364.229">and sees how far away it is and we're</span> <span data-start="364.229" data-end="365.4">going to use that tape that same</span> <span data-start="365.4" data-end="367.89">mechanism to detect if someone has</span> <span data-start="367.89" data-end="373.62">walked in front of the alarm so we're</span> <span data-start="373.62" data-end="375.51">going to go from there's four pins on</span> <span data-start="375.51" data-end="377.7">this there's VCC which is your your</span> <span data-start="377.7" data-end="379.65">power ground and then there's the</span> <span data-start="379.65" data-end="382.8">trigger and the echo pin so go and plug</span> <span data-start="382.8" data-end="387.3">it in and from VCC we can go to on our</span> </p>

anyone familiar with Fermata yeah</span> <span data-start="628.6" data-end="630.79">it's pretty handy it's kind of like a</span> <span data-start="630.79" data-end="632.35">communication protocol that you can just</span> <span data-start="632.35" data-end="634.93">upload to the Arduino once and then you</span> <span data-start="634.93" data-end="636.16">can take all of your programming and</span> <span data-start="636.16" data-end="638.02">just move it up into javascript</span> <span data-start="638.02" data-end="639.64">something like that i'm not actually</span> <span data-start="639.64" data-end="643.12">going to demo that today i wanted to</span> <span data-start="643.12" data-end="645.16">kind of bring the demo down a little bit</span> <span data-start="645.16" data-end="647.23">and make it as basic as possible and</span> <span data-start="647.23" data-end="649.36">kind of prove that it's not as difficult</span> <span data-start="649.36" data-end="652.12">as
