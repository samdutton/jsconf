<p><span data-start="59.229" data-end="68.689">So I will also not tell you what it all says but it talks about localisation of a calendar</span> <span data-start="68.689" data-end="76.759">that we did at Booking.com, so these are almost all — these are part of the languages that</span> <span data-start="76.759" data-end="80.5">we localised in, it was 42.</span> <span data-start="80.5" data-end="85.64">We did not localise in Klingon even though I really wanted to.</span> <span data-start="85.64" data-end="97.13">Let me tell you what my talk is not about, about things we already know, that date and</span> <span data-start="97.13" data-end="99.759">time is difficult.</span> <span data-start="99.759" data-end="104.24">If you really want to know what we all think that's incorrect about time there is a cool</span> <span data-start="104.24" data-end="113.771">article called Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Time and, if that's not enough, there's</span> <span data-start="113.771" data-end="119.549">still More Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Time and you can look them up.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="119.549" data-end="122.31">Very, very cool.</span> <span data-start="122.31" data-end="129.81">As I said, I was working at Booking.com and we had this calendar that we used for people</span> <span data-start="129.81" data-end="136.75">that own an apartment or a small hotel, and where they can see their reservations, change</span> <span data-start="136.75" data-end="142.05">the prices and things like that but the problem was it wasn't actually a calendar, it was</span> <span data-start="142.05" data-end="148.26">like this infinite scrolling list where you couldn't see any data on, you have to click</span> <span data-start="148.26" data-end="153.629">three times before you can get the real data, so we got a lot of feedback from our users</span> <span data-start="153.629" data-end="162.04">that it didn't really look like our calendars that they were using the competitor with the</span> <span data-start="162.04" data-end="169.31">red logo, which I cannot tell, so we decided to change the calendar.</span> <span data-start="169.31" data-end="176.51">We did some user research about what we wanted to do and so we did implementation and we</span> <span data-start="176.51" data-end="178.569">started out with making some sketches.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="178.569" data-end="184.2">This sketch was made by someone else this morning, but it's still a cool sketch, but</span> <span data-start="184.2" data-end="194.24">we started out with some sketches and implemented our front end and then actually we used Perl</span> <span data-start="194.24" data-end="198.42">at Booking.com so we had some Perl code and you actually don't want to touch a lot of</span> <span data-start="198.42" data-end="204.73">that so we tried to just use the code that was already there and that was it for the</span> <span data-start="204.73" data-end="205.73">calendar.</span> <span data-start="205.73" data-end="207.15">But then we needed to localise.</span> <span data-start="207.15" data-end="215.511">There are 42 different countries at Booking.com and even more regions so if you are German</span> <span data-start="215.511" data-end="223.12">you will know this date format is not really how it looks in Germany and also you are used</span> <span data-start="223.12" data-end="227.12">that the euro sign is at the end.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="227.12" data-end="228.519">Things like that.</span> <span data-start="228.519" data-end="236.299">If you look at the US, it will actually — a week will start at Sunday; the date format</span> <span data-start="236.299" data-end="238.06">is completely different.</span> <span data-start="238.06" data-end="239.799">The price is dollars.</span> <span data-start="239.799" data-end="246.099">And for those dates things, we actually decided to use Moment.js.</span> <span data-start="246.099" data-end="252.4">Also not to talk about Moment.js, I will briefly go through it, what we did use, but Moment.js</span> <span data-start="252.4" data-end="257.95">has very good localisation data as well.</span> <span data-start="257.95" data-end="266.28">This morning Matt was talking about js-joda and date — it's not the right name — date</span> <span data-start="266.28" data-end="271.73">functions, it should be, and about the ECMAScript temporal proposals, if you want to know about</span> <span data-start="271.73" data-end="276.26">those, just go and watch his talk when it's online.</span> <span data-start="276.26" data-end="282.53">So we had this — say we have this sketch, we implement this sketch, and we wanted to</span> <span data-start="282.53" data-end="286.39">add the names of the weeks all along the top.</span> <span data-start="286.39" data-end="291.68">We need to know: well, what does the first day of the week start with?</span> <span data-start="291.68" data-end="294.98">It starts with Sunday or Monday?</span> <span data-start="294.98" data-end="300.92">You can easily get that with Moment.js, with locale data, you can get the first day of</span> <span data-start="300.92" data-end="307.19">the week and return with a 0 or 1 and then you can get the names of the week in the locale</span> <span data-start="307.19" data-end="314.641">which you've selected which will in this case generate Sunday through Saturday, and we use</span> <span data-start="314.641" data-end="316.65">that at the top.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="316.65" data-end="324.19">Then we needed to get the first day of the month — well, first day of the calendar which</span> <span data-start="324.19" data-end="327.78">is interesting because it's not the first day of the month.</span> <span data-start="327.78" data-end="335.74">So we used — we could just use start of month and then start of week, and then get the number</span> <span data-start="335.74" data-end="341.82">of the date, and the same goes for the end of the month.</span> <span data-start="341.82" data-end="343.49">Then just fill them all out.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="343.49" data-end="351.31">So that was easily to generate the first part of the calendar.</span> <span data-start="351.31" data-end="360.1">Then I needed to find what kind of format does this country use?</span> <span data-start="360.1" data-end="367.63">It's not always — it wasn't very easy to find but it was somewhere in a more private variable</span> <span data-start="367.63" data-end="373.69">called long date format, and then we used a capital L, and that was basically it.</span> <span data-start="373.69" data-end="379.1">So I'm going to go through this very fast but just to get a sense of what we were kind</span> <span data-start="379.1" data-end="382.16">of working with.</span> <span data-start="382.16" data-end="388.28">This was basically the localisation then for all the languages, very easily.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="388.28" data-end="394.54">So then we went on the testing and just going through the languages to see if everything</span> <span data-start="394.54" data-end="402.25">is okay, and then I hit the bump that I always forget, and that is RTL, which stands for</span> <span data-start="402.25" data-end="404.51">right to left languages.</span> <span data-start="404.51" data-end="415.12">Those are languages like Arabic or Hebrew so if you have this calendar it's not only</span> <span data-start="415.12" data-end="418.46">this script that goes from right to left, you actually want to change everything from</span> <span data-start="418.46" data-end="424.09">right to left so for example you want to switch the right column to the left, and then also</span> <span data-start="424.09" data-end="436.59">switch everything around as well so that your Monday also starts on the right side, your</span> <span data-start="436.59" data-end="439.02">week.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="439.02" data-end="444.83">So this is all done in CSS, so you just change your float left to your float right, your</span> <span data-start="444.83" data-end="447.91">margin left to your margin right.</span> <span data-start="447.91" data-end="452.74">If you have something inline or inline block it will automatically go right.</span> <span data-start="452.74" data-end="460.02">The only thing is the two arrows, we switch the functionality around because if you click</span> <span data-start="460.02" data-end="464.17">on the left arrow you want to go to a month in the future instead of the past.</span> <span data-start="464.17" data-end="470.8">We could have just rotated the arrows which would have been easy with CSS.</span> <span data-start="470.8" data-end="479.55">So we just clicked through everything, fixed a few bugs and then we went on to more testing.</span> <span data-start="479.55" data-end="485.11">If you want to know about unit testing at Booking.com, you can give me a few beers later</span> <span data-start="485.11" data-end="488.49">on and I will tell you a whole lot about unit testing at Booking.com.</span> <span data-start="488.49" data-end="492.2">I don't work there anymore so I can now tell you everything I know.</span> <span data-start="492.2" data-end="497.47">[Laughter] But what we did was we added just a whole</span> <span data-start="497.47" data-end="503.69">bunch of our users into a beta group, not asking them, because why would you ask them?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="503.69" data-end="508.83">Just put them in a beta and then add a feedback at the top where they could do a thumbs up</span> <span data-start="508.83" data-end="514.45">and a thumbs down and get a little bit of feedback, just a text area.</span> <span data-start="514.45" data-end="518.599">What do you want to know about users giving you feedback?</span> <span data-start="518.599" data-end="520.479">It is not always that useful.</span> <span data-start="520.479" data-end="528.029">Most of the time it's just very short strings like — well, these were the positive ones.</span> <span data-start="528.029" data-end="534.79">"We finally have a much better overview and love the new interface."</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="534.79" data-end="544.5">But they already give you a long thing about how their life is and how good the calendar</span> <span data-start="544.5" data-end="549.99">is in their life and how they finally found the right person that they want to be with</span> <span data-start="549.99" data-end="553.81">just because you have the new calendar.</span> <span data-start="553.81" data-end="557.149">There's weird stories in there which I will not show.</span> <span data-start="557.149" data-end="562.949">But there's also just some bad things like, "Hate it, bring the old one back", without</span> <span data-start="562.949" data-end="565.639">saying why they hate it, and, "Who made this?"</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="565.639" data-end="573.829">Smiling chocolate ice cream, I think.</span> <span data-start="573.829" data-end="580.91">But if you really dig into the feedback you will find some obscure things that they will</span> <span data-start="580.91" data-end="585.04">tell you which you have to dig through your code to figure out what was actually going</span> <span data-start="585.04" data-end="586.209">on.</span> <span data-start="586.209" data-end="591.75">Because these are bug reports and not in the sense that you yourself would write a bug</span> <span data-start="591.75" data-end="598.25">report but, "Hey listen, your reservation is not showing up", and great, what now, because</span> <span data-start="598.25" data-end="601.71">I cannot contact the person really.</span> <span data-start="601.71" data-end="607.81">So what I did do is I saved not enough data.</span> <span data-start="607.81" data-end="609.38">That was a big mistake for me.</span> <span data-start="609.38" data-end="615.82">I just saved their user ID and the language that they selected and I should have done</span> <span data-start="615.82" data-end="620.79">the user agent and a whole bunch of other things but I was lazy and I implemented too</span> <span data-start="620.79" data-end="622.68">late, which is a mistake.</span> <span data-start="622.68" data-end="626.519">Don't be too lazy with these kind of things.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="626.519" data-end="632.5">So I had two things to work with, to do some bug fixing and those four examples that I</span> <span data-start="632.5" data-end="636.17">will just give you, that I just gave you, I will go through them because these were</span> <span data-start="636.17" data-end="642.11">the four most interesting things that I found and which caused me a lot of detective work</span> <span data-start="642.11" data-end="645.629">to figure out what it was.</span> <span data-start="645.629" data-end="652.06">We had some reservation data on our calendar as well so it showed you more than just a</span> <span data-start="652.06" data-end="657.41">blue bar, it showed you the name and things like that but one person — it's just one random</span> <span data-start="657.41" data-end="660.88">person said: well, my reservations aren't showing up.</span> <span data-start="660.88" data-end="664.709">They gave a little bit more data about which specific reservation that didn't show up and</span> <span data-start="664.709" data-end="670.04">it was in October 2016, this is reservation, the 15th or 16th, it just wasn't there for</span> <span data-start="670.04" data-end="671.63">him.</span> <span data-start="671.63" data-end="676.329">And it was weird because I had tested it, it was working, that's how it usually goes,</span> <span data-start="676.329" data-end="683.149">it works on my machine, but for him it didn't work and you don't want that because they</span> <span data-start="683.149" data-end="687.439">will get overbookings and lawsuits.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="687.439" data-end="691.98">So first off, just looking through my code to see if I could figure out anything which</span> <span data-start="691.98" data-end="696.55">was a problem and then I thought: well, it must be some localisation thing because that's</span> <span data-start="696.55" data-end="704.16">mostly where the problems originate at Booking.com and I figured out this person lives in Brazil.</span> <span data-start="704.16" data-end="710.31">So first step: changing the language to Portuguese.</span> <span data-start="710.31" data-end="715.74">Specifically Brazilian Portuguese because we have that in the website.</span> <span data-start="715.74" data-end="717.569">I couldn't reproduce the bug.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="717.569" data-end="728.279">So next step: I changed the time zone on my laptop to be minus 3 because I saw that they</span> <span data-start="728.279" data-end="734.98">were based in the capital, and it still didn't show up.</span> <span data-start="734.98" data-end="736.7">I couldn't reproduce the bug.</span> <span data-start="736.7" data-end="740.459">Then a colleague sitting next to me said: here's the bug, I have it.</span> <span data-start="740.459" data-end="741.459">What?</span> <span data-start="741.459" data-end="742.459">What did you do?</span> <span data-start="742.459" data-end="745.37">He said: well, I switched to Portuguese, changed the time zone to minus 3.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="745.37" data-end="750.509">Well, okay, let's just check out any other settings that we might have and we couldn't</span> <span data-start="750.509" data-end="757.579">figure it out for a very long time until I noticed there's a Wiki page on time in Brazil</span> <span data-start="757.579" data-end="766.22">which gives you a lot of weird data like their Summer Time is different when they have carnival</span> <span data-start="766.22" data-end="774.68">during the time when they would normally switch to Summer Time but also that not their entire</span> <span data-start="774.68" data-end="779.879">country adheres to Summer Time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="779.879" data-end="786.209">I thought it couldn't be Summer Time, it's October, but I was just forgetting one of</span> <span data-start="786.209" data-end="791.779">the falsehoods I believe about time which is Summer Time is always true in my summer,</span> <span data-start="791.779" data-end="798.74">which is not true for their hemisphere, of course, because Summer Time starts in October.</span> <span data-start="798.74" data-end="807.259">So my colleague selected capital of Brazil as his time zone and I selected a city just</span> <span data-start="807.259" data-end="814.309">north of Brazil, and that city north of Brazil didn't adhere to Summer Time and the capital</span> <span data-start="814.309" data-end="821.869">did adhere to it, so I found a crappy piece of code that I wrote which compared two different</span> <span data-start="821.869" data-end="828.35">dates and there was one thing that says "add one day", and I learned that in Moment.js</span> <span data-start="828.35" data-end="835.82">"add one day" does not mean add one day; it sort of does, but it just adds 24 hours.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="835.82" data-end="843.089">Compared with this, it basically meant the day was never going to be the same because</span> <span data-start="843.089" data-end="849.99">the day would be one day, and day 3 would be midnight.</span> <span data-start="849.99" data-end="854.36">By the way, smart quotes, not fun.</span> <span data-start="854.36" data-end="855.819">The day there.</span> <span data-start="855.819" data-end="856.819">Sorry.</span> <span data-start="856.819" data-end="862.85">So I just switched them around and that was fixed.</span> <span data-start="862.85" data-end="865.55">[Laughter] Great.</span> <span data-start="865.55" data-end="872.139">I could also fix my code to make it better, but I was leaving anyway.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="956.19" data-end="958.379">Why jQuery UI date picker?</span> <span data-start="958.379" data-end="965.319">Well, because we had already used it and we are just re-using things.</span> <span data-start="965.319" data-end="975.389">At first, it's not a big problem but you cannot see what date and what month it is so you</span> <span data-start="975.389" data-end="981.029">have to get the date format for a moment to see: okay, this is month, day, year.</span> <span data-start="981.029" data-end="984.999">Then, if you want to change that, if you want to connect it with the date picker you can</span> <span data-start="984.999" data-end="990.309">do parse date and then it says month, day, year, and you add the date.</span> <span data-start="990.309" data-end="993.459">But this gives an error.</span> <span data-start="993.459" data-end="998.98">This does not work because jQuery UI uses this format.</span> <span data-start="998.98" data-end="1008.98">Month, day, year, lower case, and then the year changes to yy, so I created a little</span> <span data-start="1008.98" data-end="1011.059">script for it.</span> <span data-start="1011.059" data-end="1015.019">I already did this, so it was before the bug showed up.</span> <span data-start="1015.019" data-end="1022.98">So I created a script, put it — by the way, I hope you will not need it — but the problem</span> <span data-start="1022.98" data-end="1025.91">with this script led in this part.</span> <span data-start="1025.91" data-end="1030.69">If you were here a couple of talks before about regular expressions, this is a very</span> <span data-start="1030.69" data-end="1037.67">easy regular expression, it kind of finds the slashes and dashes in the day format,</span> <span data-start="1037.67" data-end="1040.151">you have to figure out where the delimiters are.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1040.151" data-end="1045.45">If you are from Germany you've probably already figured out a problem because most complaints</span> <span data-start="1045.45" data-end="1048.38">come from German users.</span> <span data-start="1048.38" data-end="1054.68">It also needed a dot because the format in Germany mostly is a dot in between, so I thought:</span> <span data-start="1054.68" data-end="1063.43">well, what the hell, let's just change it to /W and then be done with it.</span> <span data-start="1063.43" data-end="1068.99">Most people didn't report a bug anymore except for one country, and I told you that I saved</span> <span data-start="1068.99" data-end="1074.26">the language of the country, and I actually saved the full language name, so I saved this</span> <span data-start="1074.26" data-end="1077.63">for the country that was the problem.</span> <span data-start="1077.63" data-end="1081.7">So I thought: okay, which language is that?</span> <span data-start="1081.7" data-end="1085.311">So I used my very great tool for that, Google Translate.</span> <span data-start="1085.311" data-end="1090.46">Google Translate said: okay, I've detected this is Slovenian.</span> <span data-start="1090.46" data-end="1093.26">Are there any in the room by the way?</span> <span data-start="1093.26" data-end="1097.01">Any Slovakians in the room?</span> <span data-start="1097.01" data-end="1104.78">So the top one is Slovakian, and the bottom one is Slovenian.</span> <span data-start="1104.78" data-end="1105.96">It's a slight difference.</span> <span data-start="1105.96" data-end="1111.18">So after I checked it's Slovenian and thought: still not seeing the bug — and then it says</span> <span data-start="1111.18" data-end="1118.61">in the bottom, "Did you mean this?", and I'm like, "No, not really!"</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1118.61" data-end="1125.3">So Google Translate does know that this word is in Slovak because if you just change the</span> <span data-start="1125.3" data-end="1130.28">word to Slovak, it translates it, so what was the problem here?</span> <span data-start="1130.28" data-end="1135.31">The date delimiter was dot space.</span> <span data-start="1135.31" data-end="1138.53">Great.</span> <span data-start="1138.53" data-end="1145.75">So just adding a plus to my regular expression fixed everything.</span> <span data-start="1145.75" data-end="1151.36">Maybe something else is broken but at least it fixed this.</span> <span data-start="1151.36" data-end="1155.64">The last thing that I want to show you has nothing to do with date or time; it has something</span> <span data-start="1155.64" data-end="1159.54">to do with the prices that weren't showing up properly.</span> <span data-start="1159.54" data-end="1165.06">So we have the reservation, we have the number, we also showed the prices.</span> <span data-start="1165.06" data-end="1169.73">Showed up perfectly fine.</span> <span data-start="1169.73" data-end="1179.24">We checked and nobody ever had a price that was higher than 99,000 euros, so should be</span> <span data-start="1179.24" data-end="1181">fine.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1181" data-end="1186.13">But yeah, not always.</span> <span data-start="1186.13" data-end="1197.51">So this was 1 million Indonesian Rupiah, I think, so it's not always just about dates</span> <span data-start="1197.51" data-end="1202.8">and times, it's also about prices, it's about changing the colours, it's about cultural</span> <span data-start="1202.8" data-end="1205.65">differences as well.</span> <span data-start="1205.65" data-end="1212.21">I think I went a little bit too fast but my conclusion to wrap this up is a couple of</span> <span data-start="1212.21" data-end="1217.04">things: so do not make any assumptions.</span> <span data-start="1217.04" data-end="1221.96">That's basically what a lot of people have already said at a number of different conferences</span> <span data-start="1221.96" data-end="1226.76">but even if you read all the assumptions that people make about date and time there's a</span> <span data-start="1226.76" data-end="1230.61">lot of assumptions that you are probably going to make.</span> <span data-start="1230.61" data-end="1232.96">And localisation is not just translation.</span> <span data-start="1232.96" data-end="1237.41">Translation is a part of localisation.</span> </p>
