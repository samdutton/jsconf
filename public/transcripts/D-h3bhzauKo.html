My talk is</span> <span data-start="1786.749" data-end="1794.336">simplifying, though I would have liked to see a talk titled</span> <span data-start="1794.527" data-end="1797.609">simplifying complex talk titles  with fewer words.

The  second half of this talk is</span> <span data-start="1819.518" data-end="1823.245">exactly what I'm talking about  today, except in the more</span> <span data-start="1823.246" data-end="1825.598">general sense.       I want to talk about it,</span> <span data-start="1825.739" data-end="1831.737">though.  Not in the context of  React or you or angular or any</span> <span data-start="1832.098" data-end="1834.946">of the last frameworks that came out last week.  But I want to</span> <span data-start="1835.139" data-end="1839.063">talk about it in a  framework-less context.  This is</span> <span data-start="1839.564" data-end="1842.751">an idea that doesn't just apply  to any framework or no framework</span> <span data-start="1842.956" data-end="1845.712">in general, but really any  programming language as well.</span> <span data-start="1845.974" data-end="1852.077">We can see how it could help us  simplify our UIs.  So I'm a</span> <span data-start="1856.389" data-end="1859.766">pianist, and I have been playing for about 20 years.  This is the</span> <span data-start="1860.127" data-end="1865.099">approach that I take to software development.  I made the analogy</span> <span data-start="1865.44" data-end="1870.154">that if software is music, then  developers are composers.  We're</span> <span data-start="1870.477" data-end="1874.52">taking that music, and we're  composing it in a way that is</span> <span data-start="1874.831" data-end="1878.123">applicable to any language or  any platform.  And we do so in a</span> <span data-start="1878.478" data-end="1881.808">variety of ways.  However,  music's interesting, because</span> <span data-start="1881.809" data-end="1885.462">with music, you have music  notation, which you just saw</span> <span data-start="1885.754" data-end="1890.315">there.  Let's go back and see  it.  So this stuff right here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1890.614" data-end="1894.12">This music notation is hundreds  and hundreds of years old.</span> <span data-start="1894.121" data-end="1899.755">However, the exact same notation is used today to represent music</span> <span data-start="1899.89" data-end="1908.268">from classical, romantic,  whatever the hell Bjork is.  You</span> <span data-start="1908.408" data-end="1912.056">can give a musician who  understands how to read sheet</span> <span data-start="1912.186" data-end="1915.953">music, and they will be able to  play it.  And this works for all</span> <span data-start="1916.546" data-end="1919.849">instruments, and you know, all  musicians of all levels.  So I</span> <span data-start="1924.803" data-end="1929.36">was wondering, what is the music notation of user interfaces?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1929.76" data-end="1934.013">What do all user interfaces have in common, and how can we</span> <span data-start="1934.014" data-end="1936.014">represent that</span> <span data-start="1938.687" data-end="1940.968">declaratively?      So when we're working with</span> <span data-start="1941.097" data-end="1945.643">software, we usually deal with  APIs.  Good APIs have three main</span> <span data-start="1946.354" data-end="1949.759">qualities.  They're well  documented.  You can read the</span> <span data-start="1949.937" data-end="1952.302">documentation and understand  exactly what's happening with</span> <span data-start="1952.431" data-end="1955.588">the API.  They are very  predictable.  The API is going</span> <span data-start="1955.903" data-end="1960.743">to work the exact same way every time.  And they're also</span> <span data-start="1960.878" data-end="1965.062">testable.  You can test against  an API.  They provide mocks for</span> <span data-start="1965.063" data-end="1970.634">you or have a test database or  something like that.  So user</span> <span data-start="1971.414" data-end="1976.359">interfaces, though? User  interfaces are really complex.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1976.36" data-end="1981.094">I mean, does anyone find  developing user interfaces easy?</span> <span data-start="1981.415" data-end="1985.217">Those of you watching online, no one raised their hand, which is</span> <span data-start="1985.218" data-end="1987.817">good, because I would have  called them out if they did.  We</span> <span data-start="1988.007" data-end="1992.539">have to deal with something  called a human API.  That's all</span> <span data-start="1992.724" data-end="1997.652">of you, all of our clients,  everyone we work with.  Human</span> <span data-start="1997.653" data-end="2000.692">API is undocumented or  unpredictable, and we're</span> <span data-start="2001.462" data-end="2005.262">untestable.  And we're also  extremely buggy.  If you don't</span> <span data-start="2005.263" data-end="2008.699">believe me, turn on an American  news network, and you'll see</span> <span data-start="2008.823" data-end="2012.705">proof of that.  So I work for  Microsoft.  By the way, I'm not</span> <span data-start="2013.084" data-end="2017.408">relating Microsoft to any of  this terrible API stuff, I</span> <span data-start="2017.678" data-end="2023.117">promise.  And at Microsoft, we  have more than 50,000 software</span> <span data-start="2023.26" data-end="2026.867">engineers throughout the world,  and at least 7 designers, I'm</span> <span data-start="2028.402" data-end="2029.281">sure.   [ Laughter ]</span> <span data-start="2029.282" data-end="2033.421">And we also serve one and a half billion customers.  I think this</span> <span data-start="2033.8" data-end="2039.158">is just for windows.  It might  be more than that.  When we're</span> <span data-start="2039.617" data-end="2042.965">developing user interfaces for  1.5 billion people, we have to</span> <span data-start="2042.966" data-end="2046.148">imagine all the different ways a user could use the user</span> <span data-start="2046.598" data-end="2049.524">interface.  And you know, this  is different cultures and</span> <span data-start="2049.642" data-end="2053.016">languages.  You wonder why  diversity is so important in</span> <span data-start="2053.396" data-end="2057.66">tech? We have to reach the 1.5  billion people.  So we don't</span> <span data-start="2058.094" data-end="2063.633">develop software for just one  person.  However, when we're</span> <span data-start="2063.634" data-end="2067.162">developing software with just  the happy path in mind, that's</span> <span data-start="2067.352" data-end="2070.011">essentially what we're doing.   We're assuming that there's this</span> <span data-start="2070.228" data-end="2073.492">ideal user who's using our  applications in the exact way</span> <span data-start="2073.657" data-end="2075.657">that we want them to.  But this  never</span> <span data-start="2078.634" data-end="2080.918">happens.       We're going to take a look</span> <span data-start="2081.049" data-end="2084.853">at the code example, but I don't want you to read too deeply into</span> <span data-start="2085.225" data-end="2088.244">the code.  I just want to see if you relate to this.  We're going</span> <span data-start="2088.834" data-end="2096.178">to create a sample F where we  query the flickr API and then</span> <span data-start="2096.716" data-end="2099.256">the results.  Similar to what  Dan was doing with movies in his</span> <span data-start="2099.409" data-end="2104.491">last talk.  So it's pretty  simple right? We do a fetch.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2104.61" data-end="2109.463">Then when we get the data, we  show it.  Are there any bugs</span> <span data-start="2109.797" data-end="2113.74">here? Are we done? Well..      Let's say the data takes a</span> <span data-start="2113.925" data-end="2117.791">long time to load.  Okay.  So  now we have to set this loading</span> <span data-start="2117.792" data-end="2121.939">flag, loading is true.  And once we finish loading data, then we</span> <span data-start="2122.46" data-end="2126.96">have to set loading to false.   Are we done? No.  What if we</span> <span data-start="2127.152" data-end="2132.085">have an error.  Well, we have to hide the loading screen, show</span> <span data-start="2132.252" data-end="2137.589">the error, right? But, are we  home free yet? No.  Because, we</span> <span data-start="2137.749" data-end="2143.484">also have to make sure that we  clear the error once we try to</span> <span data-start="2143.642" data-end="2147.191">search again.  As you can see,  the complexity is getting bigger</span> <span data-start="2147.379" data-end="2153.458">and bigger.  Now my onserve to  vent handler is getting</span> <span data-start="2153.861" data-end="2156.569">extremely huge.  I'm sure many  of you can relate to this code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2156.977" data-end="2160.254">Many of you will say yeah, some  of my code looks like that.</span> <span data-start="2160.411" data-end="2164.239">Sure.  What if your boss comes  to you and says we want the use</span> <span data-start="2164.43" data-end="2167.432">tore be able to cancel the  search, because, you know,</span> <span data-start="2168.232" data-end="2170.232">sometimes it takes too</span> <span data-start="2172.471" data-end="2174.474">long.   Sometimes they want to search</span> <span data-start="2174.475" data-end="2177.362">for something else.  That logic  gets crazier.  I don't know if</span> <span data-start="2177.565" data-end="2182.744">you can read that.  I'll zoom in for you.  But there's a lot of</span> <span data-start="2183.229" data-end="2188.794">complexity in just one event  handler.  You might know this as</span> <span data-start="2188.795" data-end="2192.046">spaghetti code, where our code  quickly gets unmanageable.  Some</span> <span data-start="2192.252" data-end="2196.534">of you might see your engineers  and think I don't do spaghetti</span> <span data-start="2196.681" data-end="2200.98">code.  All of my code is modular and layered and separation of</span> <span data-start="2201.241" data-end="2206.549">concerns.  You might not write  spaghetti code, but you might</span> <span data-start="2207.351" data-end="2210.531">write lasagne code, which is  spaghetti code in layers.  This</span> <span data-start="2210.532" data-end="2213.745">is called the bottom-up  approach.  That approach is</span> <span data-start="2214.191" data-end="2220.784">whenever you have an event like  onclick or on change, you do all</span> <span data-start="2220.996" data-end="2226.265">of the logic in that event.  And that can refer to so many</span> <span data-start="2226.266" data-end="2228.913">different actions, and some of  those actions might change the</span> <span data-start="2229.07" data-end="2232.65">states.  But you have to choose  which actions are executed,</span> <span data-start="2233.14" data-end="2236.933">otherwise you might edit the  state in a wrong way, and you</span> <span data-start="2238.306" data-end="2244.616">have to ad if statements.   There's a lot of downsides to</span> <span data-start="2244.849" data-end="2249.046">this.  This bottom-up code is  difficult to test.  All the</span> <span data-start="2249.365" data-end="2251.772">application logic lives in your  mind.  So when you're writing</span> <span data-start="2251.773" data-end="2254.863">your tests, you have to output  it from the developer's mind on</span> <span data-start="2255.269" data-end="2258.55">to the tests.  And it makes it  really hard to work with other</span> <span data-start="2258.738" data-end="2261.014">developers.  The code is  difficult to understand.  The</span> <span data-start="2261.015" data-end="2264.01">code that I just showed you for  showing and hiding the gallery,</span> <span data-start="2264.17" data-end="2267.353">if you were to try to parse that as a brand-new developer working</span> <span data-start="2267.503" data-end="2272.515">on the project, you would find  it really difficult to do so.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2273.012" data-end="2276.556">The code will contain bugs, for  sure, because there's going to</span> <span data-start="2276.793" data-end="2279.467">be edge cases that you might not have considered.  It will also</span> <span data-start="2279.468" data-end="2283.915">be difficult to enhance, just  like we've seen with</span> <span data-start="2284.346" data-end="2287.731">cancellation.  And features,  such as cancellation, make the</span> <span data-start="2287.732" data-end="2290.964">code work.  They explode the  potential possible states and</span> <span data-start="2291.133" data-end="2293.133">actions that could happen in</span> <span data-start="2295.124" data-end="2298.357">your application.       Here's an intuition for</span> <span data-start="2298.358" data-end="2302.039">moving forward.  We have a  realization that UI components</span> <span data-start="2302.201" data-end="2306.145">are not independent.  We have  frameworks that they isolate</span> <span data-start="2306.329" data-end="2308.613">components and say these  components fit in their nice</span> <span data-start="2308.96" data-end="2311.79">little box, and we can stick  them in the page</span> <span data-start="2317.81" data-end="2319.662">anywhere.   Everything they see on the</span> <span data-start="2319.663" data-end="2323.128">screen is in the exact same  context, and we have to</span> <span data-start="2323.603" data-end="2326.463">coordinate from components to  component.  So another</span> <span data-start="2326.665" data-end="2329.2">realization is that actions,  which is what happens when you</span> <span data-start="2329.608" data-end="2336.245">do an event, are based both on  the events executed, and the</span> <span data-start="2336.246" data-end="2338.246">current state of</span> <span data-start="2340.241" data-end="2344.384">the context.   And it's also that this event</span> <span data-start="2345.174" data-end="2347.665">action paradigm is too simple to represent all the possible</span> <span data-start="2348.128" data-end="2351.798">states our app can be in.       So, what's</span> <span data-start="2359.222" data-end="2360.739">the solution?  Standard statecharts.  I know a</span> <span data-start="2360.74" data-end="2364.553">lot of you may have heard these  before or studied them in</span> <span data-start="2364.791" data-end="2367.554">school.  Even though you might  know what these are, you</span> <span data-start="2367.693" data-end="2370.722">probably haven't applied them to user interfaces and actual</span> <span data-start="2371.227" data-end="2375.28">software.  So, looking up  material for this could be a</span> <span data-start="2375.281" data-end="2379.604">little complicated.  I'm a  visual person, and I'm going to</span> <span data-start="2379.605" data-end="2381.605">do it in a very</span> <span data-start="2387.87" data-end="2390.396">visual way.   First you have an initial state.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2390.556" data-end="2393.785">Then you have a finite number of states, which represents the</span> <span data-start="2393.936" data-end="2397.851">states that the app could be in. When an app is in one state, it</span> <span data-start="2398.133" data-end="2400.98">can't be in the other state at  the same time.  You have a</span> <span data-start="2401.412" data-end="2405.535">finite number of events, such as fetching, resolving, or</span> <span data-start="2405.536" data-end="2409.916">rejecting a promise.  You have a mapping from state to state</span> <span data-start="2410.237" data-end="2413.639">based on these events.  So for  example, when you're fetching a</span> <span data-start="2413.795" data-end="2417.284">promise and it resolves, you go  to the fulfilled state.  And</span> <span data-start="2417.66" data-end="2422.43">same way with reject and  rejected state.  And you have a</span> <span data-start="2423.51" data-end="2426.498">finite number of final states.   User interfaces can be</span> <span data-start="2430.772" data-end="2433.526">continuous.  We could keep using them.  It doesn't say we're</span> <span data-start="2433.647" data-end="2437.492">done, so go uninstall Instagram  because you're not going to need</span> <span data-start="2438.84" data-end="2443.181">it.  If you go to this site,  it's going to say promises are</span> <span data-start="2443.34" data-end="2446.533">just a state machine.  That  should give you a big clue with</span> <span data-start="2446.867" data-end="2449.793">what we're working with here.       So the original app that I</span> <span data-start="2450.109" data-end="2454.051">showed you, the gallery app can  be modelled as the state machine</span> <span data-start="2454.052" data-end="2457.616">right here.  So we start in the  idle state, and then we go to</span> <span data-start="2457.89" data-end="2461.704">search.  Then we're in the  searching state.  If we try to</span> <span data-start="2462.112" data-end="2465.366">search again, it loops back.   It's like hold on.  We're</span> <span data-start="2465.942" data-end="2469.236">already searching.  We can  either resolve or reject the</span> <span data-start="2469.237" data-end="2472.003">search results.  And from those  two states, we could</span> <span data-start="2475.429" data-end="2479.8">search again.  This is clearly  seen by the arrows going from</span> <span data-start="2479.801" data-end="2482.85">success or failure back to  searching again.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2482.851" data-end="2487.754">So, the machine that  —  the  state machine that I envision</span> <span data-start="2487.957" data-end="2495.13">looks sort of like this.  It's a JSON object.  I like JSON better</span> <span data-start="2495.402" data-end="2499.12">than blackbox functions because  you can enumerate all the</span> <span data-start="2499.121" data-end="2502.453">possible states and actions and  be able to transition from one</span> <span data-start="2502.623" data-end="2505.357">to the other with nice, simple  function right here.  For</span> <span data-start="2505.634" data-end="2509.384">example, if we're in the  searching state, and I get a</span> <span data-start="2509.634" data-end="2515.924">resolve, then I just look it up  in this JSON object.  This</span> <span data-start="2518.31" data-end="2520.31">searching,</span> <span data-start="2521.704" data-end="2526.314">on resolve, success.  In type script, it's a record.</span> <span data-start="2526.534" data-end="2533.388">I guess it's the same in C#.  In PHP, they call for help.  I</span> <span data-start="2533.616" data-end="2537.992">don't know.  So here's an  example of what I just showed</span> <span data-start="2539.346" data-end="2543.487">you.  If I were to search for  iceland  —  let's search for</span> <span data-start="2543.717" data-end="2547.803">goats first.  Let's say I don't  want to search for goats.  I'll</span> <span data-start="2548.147" data-end="2550.923">just cancel that.  Let's search  for Iceland</span> <span data-start="2560.917" data-end="2565.146">instead.  When we do the event  of selecting a photo, we have a</span> <span data-start="2565.147" data-end="2568.612">state transition that goes from  gallery to photo.  We can exit</span> <span data-start="2568.613" data-end="2575.659">that, search again, cancel,  search.  Let's cancel that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2576.089" data-end="2578.915">Iceland.  And so you see it goes from state to state, and no</span> <span data-start="2578.916" data-end="2582.727">matter how many times I try to  break this app, it's not going</span> <span data-start="2582.728" data-end="2587.386">to deviate from this state  machine that I have here.  And</span> <span data-start="2587.921" data-end="2591.733">you see there was a few extra  things such as done searching,</span> <span data-start="2591.734" data-end="2596.279">actions over here.  When I'm  update the items? We're going to</span> <span data-start="2597.649" data-end="2600.289">discuss that in a little further detail.  And also this is part</span> <span data-start="2600.29" data-end="2603.801">of an article that I wrote which gives an introduction to finite</span> <span data-start="2603.802" data-end="2610.405">state machines.       So I use visual studio</span> <span data-start="2610.406" data-end="2614.35">share.  I work on it and I also  have to use it.  It's called dog</span> <span data-start="2615.195" data-end="2619.892">fooding.  Anyway.. and this is  sort of what it looks like.  And</span> <span data-start="2620.378" data-end="2626.441">so, I don't know if we have  Sarah and Burke in here.  Here's</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2627.359" data-end="2633.975">Burke right now.  You can think  of it as Google docs for</span> <span data-start="2634.343" data-end="2637.434">collaborative coding.  It's in  preview in Microsoft.  And I</span> <span data-start="2637.988" data-end="2640.243">have no control over what  they're typing, and they're</span> <span data-start="2640.548" data-end="2643.325">typing this in realtime.  With  this live share, we can</span> <span data-start="2643.489" data-end="2645.895">collaboratively code in the  exact same document at the same</span> <span data-start="2646.021" data-end="2648.999">time.  These are a complex  series of events that are</span> <span data-start="2649.323" data-end="2653">happening at the same time, and  so we have to manage all of</span> <span data-start="2653.627" data-end="2656.518">these possible events and all  the possible states that this</span> <span data-start="2657.403" data-end="2664.376">could be in.  I have no idea..      Oh God.  Good luck breaking</span> <span data-start="2665.252" data-end="2670.654">the demo.  It probably will,  though.  Ha ha.  Anyway! I'm</span> <span data-start="2670.655" data-end="2676.816">going to end this before it gets too crazy..</span> <span data-start="2676.817" data-end="2682.425">One of the big things I have to  work on in liveshare is this</span> <span data-start="2682.426" data-end="2685.732">whole sign-in flow.  You would  think that signing in is easy</span> <span data-start="2685.733" data-end="2689.714">and, you know, signing in,  signing out, all of that.  But</span> <span data-start="2689.715" data-end="2693.046">it's actually not.  Once you  start drawing it out, it becomes</span> <span data-start="2693.764" data-end="2696.195">a lot more complex.  So for  example, there could be a</span> <span data-start="2696.836" data-end="2700.279">sign-in failure.  You know,  especially from Iceland.  I'm so</span> <span data-start="2700.696" data-end="2703.781">glad that worked in Iceland.   All of our servers are based in</span> <span data-start="2704.025" data-end="2707.328">the United States.  So when you  have a sign-in success, then you</span> <span data-start="2707.747" data-end="2711.783">go to the signin state.  From  there you could go do two</span> <span data-start="2712.12" data-end="2715.224">things.  You could either share  a session or join a session.  So</span> <span data-start="2716.173" data-end="2720.906">what I did was a couple months  back, I refactored this part of</span> <span data-start="2721.112" data-end="2724.565">the app so that it uses an  explicit state machine just like</span> <span data-start="2725.006" data-end="2727.958">this.  We were getting a lot of  bugs.  We were saying what if</span> <span data-start="2727.959" data-end="2732.249">we're in the middle of sharing  and the user signs out? What if</span> <span data-start="2732.738" data-end="2737.728">we join the session, and then we decide to share a session at the</span> <span data-start="2737.976" data-end="2743.769">same time? That shouldn't be  allowed.  We had all of these</span> <span data-start="2745.075" data-end="2748.447">if/else and switch statements,  so I decided there has to be a</span> <span data-start="2748.732" data-end="2755.4">better way.  I did the simpl  JSON object approach.  The state</span> <span data-start="2755.648" data-end="2760.362">machine that I set up? It was  very easy to add telemetry to</span> <span data-start="2761.378" data-end="2764.904">it.  I added telemetry, and I  get this nice visual showing</span> <span data-start="2764.905" data-end="2768.236">exactly the frequency of how  users go from state to state.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2768.237" data-end="2771.84">So you could see obviously, most of the users go through this</span> <span data-start="2771.841" data-end="2774.822">initializing and then signing in state, and then you could either</span> <span data-start="2775.474" data-end="2778.813">externally sign in, or you could sign out.  And then you could</span> <span data-start="2778.947" data-end="2785.006">see that users tend to go to  either joining or sharing, you</span> <span data-start="2785.234" data-end="2789.52">know? At about the same  frequency.  And yeah.  So it</span> <span data-start="2789.521" data-end="2793.695">clearly shows, too, how many  users go to the error state and</span> <span data-start="2793.877" data-end="2798.159">how many users go to the success state for each of these states</span> <span data-start="2798.607" data-end="2802.537">as well.  Now, these are very  powerful insights.  Because</span> <span data-start="2803.581" data-end="2807.598">while telemetry will only tell  you an atomic bit of data, here</span> <span data-start="2807.924" data-end="2810.961">is telemetry that tells you the  entire user flow of what's</span> <span data-start="2811.579" data-end="2814.506">happening.  We could limit this  to user and be able to see a</span> <span data-start="2814.507" data-end="2817.165">nice path of what the user  actually did in the app.  So</span> <span data-start="2817.166" data-end="2821.21">it's sort of like, you know,  like the funnel diagrams, except</span> <span data-start="2821.38" data-end="2825.434">even crazier.       We could also use state</span> <span data-start="2825.924" data-end="2829.269">machines for integration  testing.  And so this gets a</span> <span data-start="2829.591" data-end="2832.201">little bit into graph theory, so bear with me a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2835.705" data-end="2840.302">Here we would be using a  shortest path algorithm.  You</span> <span data-start="2840.303" data-end="2846.06">could choose your favorite one.  It sounds like an</span> <span data-start="2850.039" data-end="2853.201">Icelandic name.   Any of these formulas for</span> <span data-start="2853.599" data-end="2856.977">finding the shortest path.  And  so, for those who don't know,</span> <span data-start="2856.978" data-end="2860.078">the shortest path is just going  from one state to the other with</span> <span data-start="2860.079" data-end="2864.262">the minimal cost.  So you could  imagine each of these arrows</span> <span data-start="2864.476" data-end="2867.932">have a wait.  And so you just  want to minimize, you know, how</span> <span data-start="2868.123" data-end="2871.713">long it takes to get from one  path to the other.  Sort of like</span> <span data-start="2871.859" data-end="2875.265">in Google maps, finding the  shortest ETA from one point to</span> <span data-start="2875.592" data-end="2879.738">the other.  So analytics would  provide these waits.  And this</span> <span data-start="2882.603" data-end="2885.95">heaped represents all the happy  paths a user could take.  If we</span> <span data-start="2885.951" data-end="2890.231">want a user to, let's say, share a session, and get to the shared</span> <span data-start="2890.706" data-end="2894.931">state, we would imagine the user going from signed in to sharing</span> <span data-start="2894.932" data-end="2899.537">to shared.  Just that simple.   These could be automatically</span> <span data-start="2899.904" data-end="2902.931">generated from the JSON  structure just like this.  But,</span> <span data-start="2903.721" data-end="2909.679">remember, we're not just dealing with the happy paths.  So, we</span> <span data-start="2910.073" data-end="2913.349">would do a death first search  algorithm to find all the other</span> <span data-start="2914.032" data-end="2916.878">paths a user could take.  Some  of you might be thinking these</span> <span data-start="2917.364" data-end="2920.216">algorithm things, I didn't think I would need them.  You sort of</span> <span data-start="2920.431" data-end="2922.431">do; they're really</span> <span data-start="2928.082" data-end="2930.73">helpful.  And so, these  represent all the possible user</span> <span data-start="2931.086" data-end="2934.554">flows.  You can imagine a user  getting from state A to state C</span> <span data-start="2934.555" data-end="2937.816">might not take the easiest  route.  They might take a longer</span> <span data-start="2938.098" data-end="2943.954">route to get all the way to C.   And it reveals all the edge</span> <span data-start="2944.36" data-end="2946.532">cases.   When you model every single</span> <span data-start="2946.912" data-end="2949.739">possible state with every single possible action, and you get all</span> <span data-start="2950.381" data-end="2955.655">of these flows, you're going to  basically have 100,000% test</span> <span data-start="2955.656" data-end="2958.854">coverage for anything that could possibly happen in your app.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2959.082" data-end="2961.864">And of course these could all be automatically generated.  I</span> <span data-start="2962.232" data-end="2965.217">caution against this, because  you would be generating</span> <span data-start="2965.785" data-end="2968.878">integration tests  —  it would  generate a lot of integration</span> <span data-start="2969.434" data-end="2972.546">tests, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but when you're doing</span> <span data-start="2972.947" data-end="2975.63">continuous integration, you  don't want your tests to take</span> <span data-start="2976.044" data-end="2979.402">four hours long.       It makes software bugs</span> <span data-start="2979.403" data-end="2983.139">visually clear by drawing a map  and putting them on the diagram.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2983.14" data-end="2986.172">You can see when I do this  event, I'm going to the wrong</span> <span data-start="2986.552" data-end="2989.784">state.  Or maybe I have an  unhandled event, which does</span> <span data-start="2989.918" data-end="2993.09">nothing.  Or maybe I have a  missing transition.  That's</span> <span data-start="2993.356" data-end="2998.792">shown here, too.  For example,  Dan was showing the example</span> <span data-start="2998.983" data-end="3002.048">where when you click a movie, it just waits and waits, and then</span> <span data-start="3002.405" data-end="3005.197">you get the next movie, and  there's no loading state.  You</span> <span data-start="3005.528" data-end="3008.201">can clearly see that in the  state transition diagram.  And</span> <span data-start="3008.681" data-end="3013.629">also, my favorite, race  conditions.  These are just made</span> <span data-start="3014.548" data-end="3018.646">completely nil and void with  state machines, because you</span> <span data-start="3018.647" data-end="3022.131">explicitly say, when I get this  event, I go to this state.  If I</span> <span data-start="3022.332" data-end="3026.047">get another event after that  that I don't care about, it's</span> <span data-start="3026.341" data-end="3029.738">not going to cause a race  condition, because I will ignore</span> <span data-start="3030.182" data-end="3033.019">that event.  And that's what  state machines can help with.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3033.208" data-end="3038.91">Now I want to talk about  Harold statecharts.  This could</span> <span data-start="3039.111" data-end="3041.653">go on for hours and hours,  because there's so much</span> <span data-start="3041.879" data-end="3045.109">information here.  I'm going to  give an overview of what these</span> <span data-start="3045.11" data-end="3047.951">are and how these extend state  machines in order to improve the</span> <span data-start="3048.378" data-end="3052.28">way we look at user interfaces.  Because, user interfaces can get</span> <span data-start="3052.615" data-end="3056.362">complex, and finite state  machines might not solve</span> <span data-start="3056.675" data-end="3060.599">everything.  So with  statecharts, they are similar to</span> <span data-start="3061.36" data-end="3065.023">state machines.  They are an  extension of it.  Except we can</span> <span data-start="3065.536" data-end="3069.212">have actions with Harel  statecharts, too.  They actually</span> <span data-start="3070.223" data-end="3076.53">do things to the state and the  app.  We can have guards which</span> <span data-start="3076.531" data-end="3080.446">prevent states from going from  one to the other if something</span> <span data-start="3080.632" data-end="3082.762">doesn't match the condition.  If I'm trying to search for</span> <span data-start="3082.934" data-end="3086.349">something, and the user didn't  give me a search query, then I'm</span> <span data-start="3086.548" data-end="3090.383">not going to transition to the  next state.  That could be</span> <span data-start="3090.951" data-end="3093.185">declaratively modelled as well.  There's the idea of nested</span> <span data-start="3100.076" data-end="3104.082">states.  This is parallel  states.  It is not concurrent</span> <span data-start="3104.262" data-end="3107.205">states where an app can be in  two states at the same time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3107.399" data-end="3110.531">It's more a way of simplifying  the number of states you have so</span> <span data-start="3110.961" data-end="3114.271">your state machine doesn't look  all crazy.  And also, history,</span> <span data-start="3114.272" data-end="3119.543">which is a very common feature  that many users would want in</span> <span data-start="3119.768" data-end="3125.228">order to go back to their safe  state.  So I created this</span> <span data-start="3125.229" data-end="3129.214">library called X states which  models finite state machines and</span> <span data-start="3131.091" data-end="3134.459">statecharts in a declarative  way, so that all you would have</span> <span data-start="3134.46" data-end="3138.464">to do is use this JSON structure to model your state machine, and</span> <span data-start="3138.465" data-end="3142.488">then you would get the next  state by calling transition on</span> <span data-start="3142.746" data-end="3147.577">the current state and the  action.  It's functional, and</span> <span data-start="3147.804" data-end="3151.23">it's going to work in any  framework or no framework at</span> <span data-start="3151.231" data-end="3154.575">all.  It also has the notion of  actions, so it will return you</span> <span data-start="3154.943" data-end="3158.918">an object telling you, these are the next actions that you're</span> <span data-start="3159.15" data-end="3161.844">going to take once you  transition to a state.  It also</span> <span data-start="3162.299" data-end="3165.91">has guards, so you could pass in some external state, and it will</span> <span data-start="3166.4" data-end="3171.055">validate against that external  state and say, Okay, this</span> <span data-start="3171.237" data-end="3176.132">condition is met.  So you go on  to the next state.  It also has</span> <span data-start="3176.476" data-end="3180.19">hierarchy so you can represent  and compose machines easily.  It</span> <span data-start="3180.342" data-end="3182.342">has</span> <span data-start="3183.939" data-end="3189.119">orthogonality so you can  represent parallel states and</span> <span data-start="3189.802" data-end="3191.867">also represent remembered  states.  If you're doing a</span> <span data-start="3191.868" data-end="3194.876">payment flow and you're asking  for cash or card, the user can</span> <span data-start="3195.196" data-end="3198.709">switch between them, and the  user gets to the review page.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3198.897" data-end="3203.091">You want to remember if the user chose cash or card.  So you go</span> <span data-start="3203.731" data-end="3206.783">to method.history, and it would  remember that.  And this is a</span> <span data-start="3207.497" data-end="3212.063">purely functional, no side  effect type of thing.  And so</span> <span data-start="3212.333" data-end="3215.116">you can imagine the applications of where you could apply this.</span> <span data-start="3215.528" data-end="3222.266">One example of where you would  use orthoganal states is this</span> <span data-start="3222.429" data-end="3228.58">example.  Say you have bold,  italic, or underline.  A user</span> <span data-start="3228.772" data-end="3231.711">can use all or none of them, and it's represented by all of these</span> <span data-start="3231.882" data-end="3236.608">eight states.  And you can  imagine if we add more options</span> <span data-start="3237.837" data-end="3242.732">such as align left, align  center, justify, it's going to</span> <span data-start="3242.733" data-end="3249.461">explode into even more states.   With orthogonal statecharts, we</span> <span data-start="3250.133" data-end="3254.167">just have this succinct  representation of these possible</span> <span data-start="3254.168" data-end="3258.738">states, so that we know we can  go from bold on to after,</span> <span data-start="3258.886" data-end="3262.183">italics on to off, and same way  with underline, and we can</span> <span data-start="3262.184" data-end="3265.58">represent all of those at the  same time.  And also, hierarchy</span> <span data-start="3265.581" data-end="3269.703">helps to reduce the number of  arrows that you have in your</span> <span data-start="3269.845" data-end="3272.226">finite state machine.  So for  example, both the success and</span> <span data-start="3272.227" data-end="3276.734">failure states, we could search  again and go back to the</span> <span data-start="3277.047" data-end="3280.816">searching state.  We could  simplify this by just nesting</span> <span data-start="3280.817" data-end="3284.471">them in a single state, the  search state.  This is fully</span> <span data-start="3284.681" data-end="3289.078">supported by X state, and yeah.  So, you could imagine how this</span> <span data-start="3290.871" data-end="3296.832">would simplify just really  complex state machines.  So, I</span> <span data-start="3296.833" data-end="3302.556">released X state about six  months ago at React rally, and</span> <span data-start="3302.936" data-end="3305.892">since then, there has been a lot of development and a lot of</span> <span data-start="3305.893" data-end="3312.422">people actually using it to make projects such as React automa</span> <span data-start="3312.903" data-end="3316.385">and others.  And pretty soon,  I'm going to be releasing</span> <span data-start="3316.386" data-end="3321.41">another version, minor version.  Don't worry; nothing crazy, of</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3322.189" data-end="3324.19">Xstate where we improved the  user</span> <span data-start="3328.56" data-end="3334.223">ergonomics.  It's full SCXML.   It's not sexy.  Code is not sexy</span> <span data-start="3334.7" data-end="3336.7">at all.  A</span> <span data-start="3339.211" data-end="3343.827">Reactive interpreter,  visualization interpreter, and a</span> <span data-start="3344.025" data-end="3347.234">lot more examples.       In order to show you what</span> <span data-start="3347.389" data-end="3351.06">I'm talking about, here is an  example of a visualization tool.</span> <span data-start="3351.585" data-end="3356.999">That same JSON object that you  passed into xstate and the same</span> <span data-start="3357.157" data-end="3360.682">one I used for my gallery app,  this is one example of where you</span> <span data-start="3360.861" data-end="3362.861">would</span> <span data-start="3366.027" data-end="3369.965">use this.  My initial state is  start, and I can hover over this</span> <span data-start="3370.609" data-end="3374.517">search action, and go to this  state.  Then I could see the</span> <span data-start="3374.518" data-end="3378.54">possible different actions  —   sorry, events that I could take</span> <span data-start="3378.541" data-end="3383.005">from this state.  So let's say I have a search success.  And so,</span> <span data-start="3383.006" data-end="3387.66">I go into the gallery view.  And then I choose to search again,</span> <span data-start="3387.661" data-end="3389.661">or I could select a</span> <span data-start="3395.961" data-end="3400.356">photo.  So, I can visually see  what's happening in my state</span> <span data-start="3400.357" data-end="3404.85">machine by pasting in that JSON  object.  That's hard to do with</span> <span data-start="3404.851" data-end="3408.142">just a function, so that's why I decided to do it in a more</span> <span data-start="3408.143" data-end="3410.894">declarative way.  I'm going to  be releasing this soon.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3410.895" data-end="3414.876">I want you all to enjoy the rest of the conference before I</span> <span data-start="3415.06" data-end="3418.254">release it, so you can have time to play with it afterwards.</span> <span data-start="3418.762" data-end="3427.395">That's my excuse, at least.   It's not out yet.</span> <span data-start="3427.559" data-end="3431.503">Now, it would be, you know, sort of remiss of me to not talk</span> <span data-start="3431.504" data-end="3437">about sort of the downsides of  state machines and statecharts,</span> <span data-start="3437.213" data-end="3441.961">but the truth is that you all  are already creating finite</span> <span data-start="3441.962" data-end="3444.603">state machines and statecharts  in your app already, and you</span> <span data-start="3444.785" data-end="3448.705">don't even know it.  However,  the ones that you're creating</span> <span data-start="3448.706" data-end="3452.102">are implicit.  They're full of  bugs.  They're incomplete.  And</span> <span data-start="3452.62" data-end="3454.62">that's just the nature of</span> <span data-start="3457.525" data-end="3461.973">how we code.  So the advantage  of finite state machines and</span> <span data-start="3462.117" data-end="3467.273">modeling them in a very explicit way is that you reduce a lot of</span> <span data-start="3467.274" data-end="3472.748">complexity up front just by  getting rid of your if/else</span> <span data-start="3473.06" data-end="3475.471">statements and getting rid of  your switch statements and</span> <span data-start="3475.472" data-end="3479.229">having a direct mapping.   However, that quickly explodes</span> <span data-start="3479.67" data-end="3482.903">into many, many different  states.  So statecharts help</span> <span data-start="3482.904" data-end="3486.793">manage that with a little higher complexity cost up front.  But</span> <span data-start="3486.95" data-end="3490.276">in the long run, you will see it will be very easy to add</span> <span data-start="3490.666" data-end="3494.076">features, remove features, and  handle different actions and</span> <span data-start="3494.303" data-end="3498.827">different possible modes of your application.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3498.972" data-end="3502.51">So, of course, there's a lot of  advantages to using statecharts,</span> <span data-start="3502.773" data-end="3508.739">and the ones I am going to quote are not actually from me.</span> <span data-start="3508.74" data-end="3512.857">They're from NASA.  A few years  ago, NASA had to send this</span> <span data-start="3512.858" data-end="3517.452">little vehicle right here all  the way to Mars.  And they did</span> <span data-start="3517.453" data-end="3522.068">so using statecharts.  So the  advantages that they said was,</span> <span data-start="3522.069" data-end="3526.276">first of all, there's visualized modeling.  So you could both</span> <span data-start="3526.277" data-end="3530.557">model and examine the model of a state chart using visual tools.</span> <span data-start="3531.042" data-end="3535.076">You get these precise diagrams  that tell you exactly what's</span> <span data-start="3535.077" data-end="3538.796">going to happen when certain  conditions are met, when you're</span> <span data-start="3538.797" data-end="3542.202">in a certain state, and this  event happens.  When you're</span> <span data-start="3542.203" data-end="3544.812">sending something to Mars, you  can't exactly just send it there</span> <span data-start="3544.956" data-end="3550.136">and hope that it work works,  right? You have to be absolutely</span> <span data-start="3550.137" data-end="3553.009">sure that your billion dollar  project is going to handle every</span> <span data-start="3553.509" data-end="3559.155">single possible state.  And so  they also use state charts for</span> <span data-start="3559.156" data-end="3562.491">automatic code generation.  I'm  not a fan, but you could see how</span> <span data-start="3562.993" data-end="3568.145">it could be beneficial.  Also,  comprehensive test coverage.  By</span> <span data-start="3568.146" data-end="3572.025">using state charts, they were  able to generate just all of</span> <span data-start="3572.026" data-end="3575.939">these integration tests where  they could test each and every</span> <span data-start="3575.94" data-end="3579.495">one, and ensure that every  single state was being hit, and</span> <span data-start="3579.496" data-end="3585.61">every single possible action or  event was being handled.  Also,</span> <span data-start="3585.611" data-end="3589.324">you know, being on a big  project, you have a lot of</span> <span data-start="3589.325" data-end="3593.638">requirement changes.  We want to add this to the rover.  We want</span> <span data-start="3593.639" data-end="3596.672">to remove this functionality.   We want to change the way this</span> <span data-start="3596.862" data-end="3600.749">works.  And when you're working  on a big project, and you have</span> <span data-start="3600.75" data-end="3604.326">these late breaking requirement  changes, then things can get</span> <span data-start="3604.327" data-end="3608.726">really stressful.  With state  charts, since you could clearly</span> <span data-start="3608.727" data-end="3611.793">see the full flow of your  application, you could easily</span> <span data-start="3611.794" data-end="3615.606">add and remove features without  worrying what's going to break,</span> <span data-start="3615.764" data-end="3620.767">what's going to change, what's  going to be affected.  So there</span> <span data-start="3620.768" data-end="3627.412">are some disadvantages as well.      And the disadvantage is that</span> <span data-start="3627.413" data-end="3630.941">my screen just went black.  I  guess that means there are no</span> <span data-start="3632.067" data-end="3635.398">disadvantages.  Ha ha.   Anyway..</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3635.399" data-end="3638.812">Since the rest of my slides are  forked, I want to show you this</span> <span data-start="3638.813" data-end="3643.451">real quick.  I gave a talk about one and a half years ago.</span> <span data-start="3643.452" data-end="3646.3">It was at</span> <span data-start="3649.561" data-end="3653.18">JSConf Iceland.  This is where I saw the primary use case for</span> <span data-start="3653.181" data-end="3656.248">using state machines and  statecharts.  There was this</span> <span data-start="3656.249" data-end="3662.585">really complex UI design that I  really wanted to model, and I</span> <span data-start="3662.945" data-end="3666.935">found it pretty difficult  without using an explicit state</span> <span data-start="3667.256" data-end="3670.557">machine or state chart.  So what I'm doing here, there's three</span> <span data-start="3670.558" data-end="3675.341">different states.  This one.   This one.  And there's different</span> <span data-start="3675.675" data-end="3677.675">actions as well.  So</span> <span data-start="3679.638" data-end="3684.976">the user could pan right, but  just a little bit.  So I handle</span> <span data-start="3684.977" data-end="3690.512">that as a transition from going  to state A, back to state A if</span> <span data-start="3690.513" data-end="3693.409">they didn't move far enough.  Of course, if they move far enough,</span> <span data-start="3693.726" data-end="3697.35">it goes to the next state  successfully.  And also, it</span> <span data-start="3697.49" data-end="3702.489">handles, like, if I'm going up,  and I decide to go left and</span> <span data-start="3702.641" data-end="3705.528">right, it's not going to do  anything, because we're already</span> <span data-start="3705.686" data-end="3710.52">going up and down.  So it knows  when this event happens, don't</span> <span data-start="3710.521" data-end="3714.046">try to go to a different state,  because we're already</span> <span data-start="3720.028" data-end="3723.677">transitioning to one state.       I also wanted to mention two</span> <span data-start="3724.08" data-end="3726.08">very good resources.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3728.843" data-end="3734.334">The first one is on  spectrum.oi/statecharts.  This</span> <span data-start="3734.335" data-end="3737.359">is a community where we talk  about statecharts, their</span> <span data-start="3737.36" data-end="3741.231">possible applications, and how  they're used everywhere.</span> <span data-start="3741.232" data-end="3745.824">Statecharts are nothing new.   They're invented by David Harel</span> <span data-start="3746.124" data-end="3751.29">in 1987, which is what? 30 years ago? This is not cutting-edge</span> <span data-start="3751.458" data-end="3755.284">stuff.  If people are asking why aren't we using statecharts</span> <span data-start="3755.413" data-end="3759.315">everywhere now? Well, the thing  is, they are in embedded systems</span> <span data-start="3759.624" data-end="3763.793">or systems programming.  People  do use statecharts in order to</span> <span data-start="3763.794" data-end="3768.325">model their applications.  We  don't, quite yet, but I think</span> <span data-start="3768.511" data-end="3776.797">it's about time that we catch up to it.  And so, Eric Mogansen</span> <span data-start="3776.916" data-end="3781.21">made a wonderful resource called the unfinished world of</span> <span data-start="3781.211" data-end="3784.306">statecharts.  Over here, if you  want to learn more information,</span> <span data-start="3784.453" data-end="3786.453">there's a well</span> <span data-start="3789.21" data-end="3791.21">wealth of</span> <span data-start="3794.532" data-end="3796.532">information here.  I really want to</span> <span data-start="3799.759" data-end="3803.114">encourage you to revisit your  application and the way you</span> <span data-start="3803.115" data-end="3807.465">think about things, and actually try to visualize things.  You</span> <span data-start="3807.466" data-end="3810.895">will see that by visualizing  your application, all of its</span> <span data-start="3810.896" data-end="3813.681">possible states, all the events  that could happen, that you're</span> <span data-start="3814.545" data-end="3818.069">going to have a clearer  representation of the possible</span> <span data-start="3818.524" data-end="3823.115">bugs, the possible features that you might have, the user</span> <span data-start="3823.452" data-end="3825.561">improvements, and everything  else.  So I want to thank you</span> <span data-start="3826.028" data-end="3828.817">all for having me.   Unfortunately, I can't show you</span> <span data-start="3829.052" data-end="3831.802">my last slide, because it's not  working, but thank you.</span> <span data-start="3837.921" data-end="3839.921">[ Applause ]    >> That was so awesome! I</span> <span data-start="3839.975" data-end="3844.617">have a question for you.  I  thought it was really</span> <span data-start="3846.027" data-end="3849.296">interesting, and I also want to  apply this to what I do in</span> <span data-start="3849.541" data-end="3853.901">working with UIs.  Do I have to  completely refactor my app so I</span> <span data-start="3854.245" data-end="3858.038">can get the advantages of what  you just talked about with</span> <span data-start="3859.277" data-end="3861.998">finite state machines?     >> DAVID: That's a really</span> <span data-start="3862.648" data-end="3866.897">good question.  With Redux, you  have to pull everything out, but</span> <span data-start="3867.547" data-end="3871.815">with statecharts, you don't.   Statecharts can't model</span> <span data-start="3872.147" data-end="3874.834">absolutely everything, and  neither can finite state</span> <span data-start="3875.259" data-end="3881.4">machines.  So what you could do  is you could write a separate</span> <span data-start="3881.963" data-end="3884.278">finite state machine that  represents your app, use that to</span> <span data-start="3884.697" data-end="3888.693">create tests, and once you see  all the tests are passing, then</span> <span data-start="3889.101" data-end="3892.472">you slowly start moving it in.

So, I've got a talk about</span> <span data-start="4206.688" data-end="4208.688">end-to-end testing, and why the</span> <span data-start="4211.38" data-end="4213.858">game has changed.  I actually  have a little story to share as</span> <span data-start="4214.08" data-end="4216.8">well that's kind of personal,  but it means a lot to be</span> <span data-start="4222.474" data-end="4227.47">here today.  My name is Will,  and this is my wife, Diane.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="4227.471" data-end="4232.294">This is us on Amelia island.  It was a really great time.  I</span> <span data-start="4238.269" data-end="4244.582">appreciated that JSConf welcomed us and our family.  I appreciate</span> <span data-start="4245.276" data-end="4248.224">that that tradition has  continued here today.  I had a</span> <span data-start="4248.225" data-end="4251.202">question at the time that I was  trying to figure out the answer</span> <span data-start="4251.497" data-end="4256.136">to.  How do you it's your front  end? I think we've got answers</span> <span data-start="4256.285" data-end="4259.08">about how to test our unit  tests, how to test our</span> <span data-start="4259.202" data-end="4262.654">functions, our classes, and our  UI components in isolation.  I</span> <span data-start="4262.655" data-end="4266.094">think it becomes more difficult  when we try to integrate all of</span> <span data-start="4266.095" data-end="4270.935">these things and put it all  together.  A lot can go wrong,</span> <span data-start="4271.232" data-end="4276.663">whether it's our UI or web APIs  or our back-end or database or</span> <span data-start="4276.825" data-end="4280.033">even our deployments.  When you  put those things together,</span> <span data-start="4280.034" data-end="4282.944">anything can break down, and we  can have all the unit tests in</span> <span data-start="4282.945" data-end="4287.788">the world, and they won't help  us in most cases.  So the type</span> <span data-start="4288.557" data-end="4296.198">of tests to emphasize this are  called end-to-end tests, from</span> <span data-start="4296.199" data-end="4299.747">one end all the way back.  I had a lot of great conversations at</span> <span data-start="4299.748" data-end="4304.564">the conference.  Sorry.  Move my mouse off.  I had a lot of great</span> <span data-start="4305.343" data-end="4307.343">conversations, but one stuck  out.  I</span> <span data-start="4310.317" data-end="4314.866">met this person Nicholas Boll,  and he talked to me for hours.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="4314.867" data-end="4319.77">His wife was at the conference  and she was quickly becoming</span> <span data-start="4319.771" data-end="4322.964">friends with my wife while  hanging out and talking about</span> <span data-start="4323.201" data-end="4326.508">testing.  We talked about the  tests his team had written.</span> <span data-start="4326.509" data-end="4330.462">They had thousands and thousands of unit tests.  Lots and lots of</span> <span data-start="4330.836" data-end="4335.077">integration tests, and maybe a  thousand or so end-to-end tests.</span> <span data-start="4335.28" data-end="4339.421">They were testing an Enterprise  app, which is an app that does</span> <span data-start="4339.544" data-end="4342.999">way too many things.  I was so  impressed with all the things</span> <span data-start="4343" data-end="4346.342">they had to say about their  stack and tools and all the</span> <span data-start="4346.756" data-end="4351.469">effort they put in that I  applied to work at his company.</span> <span data-start="4351.973" data-end="4357.519">We moved to Colorado and joined  his team.  He and his wife</span> <span data-start="4357.52" data-end="4363.108">helped us off the moving truck,  helped us settle in and invited</span> <span data-start="4363.328" data-end="4369.132">us in for the holidays.  Now we  hang out so much together today.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="4377.32" data-end="4380.738">So when I joined this team,  I found they were using a tool</span> <span data-start="4380.91" data-end="4383.08">that I was actually quite  familiar with,</span> <span data-start="4386.949" data-end="4391.819">se  Selenium.  It lets us test  apps from the point of view of</span> <span data-start="4391.82" data-end="4395.417">the browser.  It's a little old, but it's done a lot of wonderful</span> <span data-start="4395.762" data-end="4399.549">things and let us do things that we otherwise might not be able</span> <span data-start="4399.55" data-end="4403.225">to do.  It's go this java  service that just listens for</span> <span data-start="4403.468" data-end="4406.906">commands.  And you write test  code in any language, actually,</span> <span data-start="4406.907" data-end="4411.992">and more often than not, not  JavaScript.  And that language</span> <span data-start="4411.993" data-end="4417.384">would usually use a library to  speak the language of Selenium.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="4417.961" data-end="4421.68">It sends the command to the  service, and the service would</span> <span data-start="4421.681" data-end="4425.553">cue the commands and try to send them to any given browsers, real</span> <span data-start="4426.477" data-end="4430.314">browsers.  There was a number of different abstractions and</span> <span data-start="4430.883" data-end="4434.376">interfaces where things could go wrong.  It could be that your</span> <span data-start="4434.377" data-end="4438.001">test code has an issue, or  you're using the API different.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="4438.002" data-end="4444.862">And all the different APIs work  with Selenium, and they all work</span> <span data-start="4445.188" data-end="4449.613">with JavaScript.  They are all  different.  They could have</span> <span data-start="4449.614" data-end="4453.543">issues or you could use them  differently.  They are sending</span> <span data-start="4454.563" data-end="4457.992">command drivers to the browser,  and the drivers could have bugs.</span> <span data-start="4458.14" data-end="4462.762">There are so many ways for this  to have bugs just with this</span> <span data-start="4466.317" data-end="4468.107">architecture.       So the greatest complexity</span> <span data-start="4468.108" data-end="4474.117">of all is our app.  I find that  as we write modern JavaScript</span> <span data-start="4474.33" data-end="4479.281">apps, we're doing a lot of  things now in the browser.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="4479.282" data-end="4482.312">We're making the different API  calls from the page loads.</span> <span data-start="4482.313" data-end="4485.366">Those come back in different  timings, different orders</span> <span data-start="4485.64" data-end="4490.369">sometimes.  That can cause just  different behaviors in our front</span> <span data-start="4490.37" data-end="4494.208">end.  When the user interacts  with our UI, that makes more</span> <span data-start="4494.404" data-end="4498.932">calls.  More things happen.  All these things happen</span> <span data-start="4499.622" data-end="4502.981">asynchronously.  So we are  rendering.  It could finish at</span> <span data-start="4503.297" data-end="4506.683">any time, and we don't really  necessarily know when it is, at</span> <span data-start="4507.136" data-end="4511.105">least from our test code's point of view.  As humans, it's</span> <span data-start="4511.559" data-end="4515.346">intuitive to us.  But when we  run our test code, it does</span> <span data-start="4515.347" data-end="4519.551">exactly what we tell it to.  If  it clicks a button and starts to</span> <span data-start="4520.245" data-end="4523.331">rerender, and we try to do the  next thing, we need to be</span> <span data-start="4523.864" data-end="4526.671">careful about knowing that it  finished rendering, or we might</span> <span data-start="4526.672" data-end="4533.464">get something unexpected.       So, the greater problem of</span> <span data-start="4533.465" data-end="4538.683">all is when we take the Selenium architecture and combine it with</span> <span data-start="4538.872" data-end="4542.586">the complexity of our apps.   It's really a recipe for frees</span> <span data-start="4547.427" data-end="4551.482">frustration.  We run a commit,  push it to the build, and</span> <span data-start="4551.901" data-end="4556.318">sometimes it would fail, usually in an end-to-end test.  We would</span> <span data-start="4556.667" data-end="4559.939">run that build again, because it was a test that shouldn't have</span> <span data-start="4560.097" data-end="4563.525">broken anything.  And it would  pass.  We would see this over</span> <span data-start="4563.526" data-end="4567.047">and over again, where different  commits randomly fail different</span> <span data-start="4567.185" data-end="4571.308">tests.  We call this flakeyness. The problem might be something</span> <span data-start="4571.713" data-end="4575.581">with the Selenium architecture.  Often it was a combination of</span> <span data-start="4575.759" data-end="4580.01">that and the complexity of our  app working in different</span> <span data-start="4580.011" data-end="4582.734">performance characteristics.   Particularly when we're on build</span> <span data-start="4583.922" data-end="4588.511">environments, they're  virtualized, things would slow</span> <span data-start="4588.777" data-end="4593.036">down.  Anything could make it  work a little slower in one part</span> <span data-start="4593.321" data-end="4598.122">of the stack at any given time,  and something would fail.  We</span> <span data-start="4598.344" data-end="4602.186">had a build job that would just  run all the tests, and it would</span> <span data-start="4602.187" data-end="4605.789">flush out dozens and dozens of  tests that just failed a lot.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="4606.299" data-end="4609.407">Even with that, we just kept  tripping over this issue over</span> <span data-start="4609.408" data-end="4614.854">and over again.  Tests that  would fail once in a while.  Why</span> <span data-start="4615.177" data-end="4619.827">do we keep doing this? Well,  these tests we found to be</span> <span data-start="4620.375" data-end="4623.037">extremely valuable.  You can  have all the unit tests in the</span> <span data-start="4623.609" data-end="4626.089">world, but if everything  integrates and something breaks</span> <span data-start="4626.224" data-end="4629.229">down, you're going to have a  really bad time.  And worst of</span> <span data-start="4629.558" data-end="4632.763">all, your user is going to have  a bad time.  At the end of the</span> <span data-start="4632.991" data-end="4635.873">day, everything you do is about  building a user experience,</span> <span data-start="4637.208" data-end="4639.925">building values so somebody can  do their job or that part of</span> <span data-start="4640.098" data-end="4643.169">their job, or make that one  thing easier that gives them joy</span> <span data-start="4643.286" data-end="4649.724">and makes them happier or more  productive.  We invested into</span> <span data-start="4650.901" data-end="4654.101">making this better, the flakey  finder.  And we tried to make</span> <span data-start="4654.293" data-end="4658.434">our tests better in a lot of  ways.  One example, we wrote</span> <span data-start="4658.733" data-end="4662.116">some test helpers that would try a command, and if something</span> <span data-start="4662.243" data-end="4666.611">didn't work right, it would  retry it a number of times for a</span> <span data-start="4667.445" data-end="4671.058">certain time out.  This is  called an implicit wait, built</span> <span data-start="4671.803" data-end="4675.715">into the API, so you don't have  to do that manually in the code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="4675.848" data-end="4682.481">We also found that it helped to  mock some service once in a</span> <span data-start="4682.482" data-end="4686.164">while, mock services to test  large data and certain</span> <span data-start="4686.358" data-end="4689.562">scenarios.  Things like that.   Doing that, we wrote some of our</span> <span data-start="4689.691" data-end="4693.661">own service mocking libraries to make that process easier.  We</span> <span data-start="4694.133" data-end="4697.676">invested as much as we could  into making the developer</span> <span data-start="4697.677" data-end="4701.037">experience of using and running  our tests better.  So we keep</span> <span data-start="4701.299" data-end="4703.299">doing it, despite how painful</span> <span data-start="4712.045" data-end="4714.045">it was.       So, after a while, I joined</span> <span data-start="4714.17" data-end="4719.815">a new time and got Selenium up  and running there.  That went</span> <span data-start="4719.816" data-end="4724.57">all right.  Ran into some of the same issues, and just this past</span> <span data-start="4724.749" data-end="4729.028">fall in October, I was consult consulting on a project.  We had</span> <span data-start="4729.353" data-end="4733.329">run into a serious quality  problem.  We didn't have a</span> <span data-start="4733.476" data-end="4737.91">dedicated QA team.  As much as  we smoke tested our app on every</span> <span data-start="4738.288" data-end="4742.126">single commit, there were always use cases we missed and we</span> <span data-start="4742.276" data-end="4745.259">didn't know what happened.  We  decided to write more tests.  I</span> <span data-start="4745.398" data-end="4749.88">pulled the story to write the  end-to-end test.  I pulled out</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="4750.05" data-end="4756.09">Selenium, and the first thing I  had to do on my year-old mac</span> <span data-start="4756.448" data-end="4764.952">book was install java.  So the  next tool I tried was Cyprus.</span> <span data-start="4765.269" data-end="4768.155">And Cyprus was something that I  had actually held off on using</span> <span data-start="4771.043" data-end="4774.477">for a while.  It had been closed source up until May of last</span> <span data-start="4774.903" data-end="4779.568">year, and in private beta until  October.  They had built a</span> <span data-start="4779.569" data-end="4783.377">company around some of the  premium CI features.  Now that</span> <span data-start="4783.846" data-end="4787.125">it's open-sourced, everything  that you need is right up there</span> <span data-start="4787.39" data-end="4791.385">on GitHub.  If the team stopped  doing what they're doing, the</span> <span data-start="4791.656" data-end="4795.004">community could pick it up and  run with it.  I waited to use</span> <span data-start="4795.568" data-end="4798.653">this until it was open and  freely available.  Something</span> <span data-start="4798.654" data-end="4803.046">that was MIT licensed and ready  to go.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="4803.183" data-end="4809.385">So I actually used it for maybe  two hours, and I was honestly</span> <span data-start="4809.386" data-end="4816.811">blown away.  I was so shocked by how different and better my</span> <span data-start="4816.812" data-end="4819.957">developer experience was that I  wrote a proposal to a conference</span> <span data-start="4820.139" data-end="4824.296">after just working on it for a  couple of hours, and here I am.</span> <span data-start="4828.842" data-end="4831.022">[ Laughter ]     I have a few downloads that</span> <span data-start="4831.206" data-end="4834.611">I will run through to show you  how to install it, set it up,</span> <span data-start="4834.612" data-end="4838.283">what some of the tests look  like.  I don't want to get hung</span> <span data-start="4838.284" data-end="4841.542">up on the syntax or commands.  I just want to give you an idea of</span> <span data-start="4841.783" data-end="4846.272">what it's like.  The first thing you do is you MPM install it.</span> <span data-start="4846.863" data-end="4850.842">This actually will do a download from one of their  —  from their</span> <span data-start="4850.843" data-end="4857.719">website and pull down the right  cypress app.  It will pull down</span> <span data-start="4857.84" data-end="4860.63">based on your operating system  and your CPU architecture.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="4865.06" data-end="4868.662">Next you open it.

When it runs, there's a pop-up</span> <span data-start="4875.596" data-end="4879.837">to say hey, to help get you  started, we put some files in</span> <span data-start="4880.079" data-end="4882.581">the file system, and you might  want to take a look at that.</span> <span data-start="4884.105" data-end="4886.458">The files are basically  examples.  This is just nice.</span> <span data-start="4886.586" data-end="4891.963">There is an example like  fixture.  There's example</span> <span data-start="4892.5" data-end="4896.117">plugin.  Custom commands, and an example spec.  The example spec</span> <span data-start="4896.575" data-end="4899.176">is a kitchen sink of all the  different commands you might</span> <span data-start="4899.465" data-end="4903.388">want, and gives you a quick  reference.  You can go to their</span> <span data-start="4903.623" data-end="4906.966">docs, but it's all right there.  It gives you a little head-start</span> <span data-start="4907.116" data-end="4909.479">with what you might want to try  to do.</span> <span data-start="4909.48" data-end="4914.14">The nice thing is, it's  —   from there, it starts to get</span> <span data-start="4914.548" data-end="4920.899">very familiar.  If you've ever  done BDD style tests, the syntax</span> <span data-start="4921.168" data-end="4925.921">is going to look very, very  familiar.  Let me make this a</span> <span data-start="4928.106" data-end="4935.149">little bigger.  Oh yes.  Cool.   All right.  So this is just part</span> <span data-start="4935.486" data-end="4938.962">of a spec file.  And the first  thing is there's this top-level</span> <span data-start="4939.68" data-end="4943.061">describe.  We're describing our  app or some view in our app, and</span> <span data-start="4943.196" data-end="4947.554">we can have the eaches, and do  things before every test.  And</span> <span data-start="4948.15" data-end="4954.163">most commonly will load the  page, load a route on our app.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="4954.286" data-end="4959.154">We can have nested describes in  mocha.  And we can have our</span> <span data-start="4960.022" data-end="4964.223">it/shoulds.  It should do a  thing.  It should focus on the</span> <span data-start="4964.415" data-end="4970.341">to do field.  And from there we  can start using the cypress API.</span> <span data-start="4970.863" data-end="4975.598">We are doing focus, which is  look at what's focused in the</span> <span data-start="4975.732" data-end="4979.905">window.  And then it says it  should have the class new to do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="4980.465" data-end="4982.469">There's something interesting  about the should, and this</span> <span data-start="4982.624" data-end="4988.443">whole, you'll see some chaining  here.  There's a reason why hay</span> <span data-start="4988.652" data-end="4993.664">the use that style.  The should  has a context of I'm try to do a</span> <span data-start="4993.837" data-end="4996.74">should on something that was  focused.  The should will keep</span> <span data-start="4996.741" data-end="5000.757">trying until it's true or until  there's a time-out.  This is</span> <span data-start="5000.886" data-end="5005.237">nice, because when we first load our page, the first thing that's</span> <span data-start="5005.238" data-end="5008.385">focused might just be the window or document.  That thing has not</span> <span data-start="5008.951" data-end="5012.979">rendered that has that class.   It's going to keep retrying</span> <span data-start="5012.98" data-end="5016.88">until it passes.  This permeates all of their APIs, and having</span> <span data-start="5016.881" data-end="5022.647">that context and doing things  more intelligently by nature.</span> <span data-start="5023.26" data-end="5026.339">I'll show you one other example. This is an example that is quite</span> <span data-start="5026.92" data-end="5031.148">common where you try to get  something based on selector.</span> <span data-start="5032.968" data-end="5035.765">It's using</span> <span data-start="5039.588" data-end="5043.185">Jquery under the hood.  And then we just type in a little thing</span> <span data-start="5043.186" data-end="5048.809">we want to do, and another thing I'll point out is instead of</span> <span data-start="5048.81" data-end="5054.148">having to embrace the key codes, having to know what key code,</span> <span data-start="5054.149" data-end="5058.928">they just use enter with curly  braces.  It's nice and</span> <span data-start="5058.929" data-end="5060.929">convenient that</span> <span data-start="5063.055" data-end="5065.372">way.       From here, I want to show</span> <span data-start="5065.541" data-end="5069.069">you what running the test and  debugging the test looks like.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="5069.183" data-end="5073.112">All the other stuff is  relatively familiar to Selenium.</span> <span data-start="5073.236" data-end="5077.7">This is where it starts to take  off.  So the first thing is you</span> <span data-start="5077.993" data-end="5082.471">can run it headlessly.  By  default, it runs headless</span> <span data-start="5088.591" data-end="5094.047">ly.  It is recording by default. So you can replay the recording</span> <span data-start="5094.048" data-end="5097.869">and all the tests, if you want.  Here is where it starts to get</span> <span data-start="5098.335" data-end="5100.807">different.  There's an electron  app.  The first thing that</span> <span data-start="5101.002" data-end="5104.31">happens when you load the  electron app, there's a yellow</span> <span data-start="5104.848" data-end="5107.97">warning that says, Hey, can you  make sure you're running your</span> <span data-start="5109.057" data-end="5112.657">web server.  It will check that  when this app electron app runs</span> <span data-start="5112.888" data-end="5116.306">to make sure you're running your web server.  I can't tell you</span> <span data-start="5116.495" data-end="5120.623">how many times I forgot to run  my local dev server when I'm</span> <span data-start="5120.862" data-end="5126.108">running my test.  It tells you  right away.  And you can also</span> <span data-start="5127.807" data-end="5132.309">choose which browser, whatever  version of Chrome or firefox and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="5132.673" data-end="5136.138">Edge and all of that eventually. I'll get to that.  And then you</span> <span data-start="5136.352" data-end="5138.536">run your spec.  From here we get into the test</span> <span data-start="5147.285" data-end="5151.169">runner.  This is running in a  browser, a sandbox browser</span> <span data-start="5151.589" data-end="5154.964">environment.  The test runner,  there's our test on the left, a</span> <span data-start="5154.965" data-end="5158.033">header on the top that has this  information about what tests</span> <span data-start="5158.034" data-end="5161.435">have passed, which have failed,  how long it's been running.  We</span> <span data-start="5161.436" data-end="5164.904">can stop and replay it.  There's a URL preview.</span> <span data-start="5164.905" data-end="5173.249">There's a target icon, that's  adomadom a dom selector</span> <span data-start="5174.112" data-end="5176.112">playground.  There's view port information at</span> <span data-start="5176.176" data-end="5179.518">the top.  On the right is our  app.  This might seem like a</span> <span data-start="5179.757" data-end="5182.838">little thing, but just having it right in the same window is very</span> <span data-start="5183.643" data-end="5186.32">convenient.  And there's a very  good reason why they put this</span> <span data-start="5186.701" data-end="5188.701">all in the same</span> <span data-start="5192.152" data-end="5193.878">window.       So that thing on the left</span> <span data-start="5193.879" data-end="5198.846">where our commands and tests are logged, that's called the</span> <span data-start="5199.404" data-end="5201.699">command log.  This thing is  cool.  When we click on anything</span> <span data-start="5201.825" data-end="5205.658">in there, expand one of our  tests, we see all the commands</span> <span data-start="5205.959" data-end="5212.959">that our test tried to execute.      If we click on any of the</span> <span data-start="5213.297" data-end="5217.813">commands, it will jump to that  part of the test.  It takes DOM</span> <span data-start="5218.199" data-end="5222.076">snapshots throughout the test.   We can jump around in our test</span> <span data-start="5222.397" data-end="5225.854">sequentially or out of order,  and replay the state of our dom</span> <span data-start="5226.001" data-end="5231.415">and see what's going on in our  app without having to  —  without</span> <span data-start="5232.556" data-end="5236.491">much effort.  And you'll see  this thing at the bottom of our</span> <span data-start="5236.636" data-end="5240.936">app that says before and after.  Certain have commands such as</span> <span data-start="5241.659" data-end="5246.325">before and after.  Typing is one of them.  If you go to type new</span> <span data-start="5247.306" data-end="5251.69">todo, you hit before, you can  see what's going on, and then</span> <span data-start="5252.054" data-end="5256.931">click the after and see what was after the typed command.  This</span> <span data-start="5257.109" data-end="5263.295">ability to walk through the dom  snapshots just by click</span> <span data-start="5263.637" data-end="5266.69">something a night and day  difference from anything I</span> <span data-start="5266.837" data-end="5270.355">experienced with Selenium.  The  workflow I was used to is</span> <span data-start="5270.731" data-end="5274.19">setting up a debugger, setting  up a trigger point and hoping to</span> <span data-start="5274.315" data-end="5279.98">stop at the right point and  running into default time-outs</span> <span data-start="5280.623" data-end="5285.538">and test reloading and all of  the lockouts that were</span> <span data-start="5285.805" data-end="5287.93">frustrating.       If you write really good</span> <span data-start="5288.074" data-end="5290.947">tests about your app like this,  you can actually sort of</span> <span data-start="5291.332" data-end="5294.668">document how your app works.   And a new user or new person on</span> <span data-start="5294.921" data-end="5297.248">the team could look at it and  get a good understanding of all</span> <span data-start="5297.633" data-end="5301.284">the things it does and how it  behaves and what it looks like.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="5301.457" data-end="5305.32">All of that.       So, let's talk about</span> <span data-start="5306.001" data-end="5308.869">debugging, like really  debugging.  The first thing is</span> <span data-start="5309.005" data-end="5314.321">when we click on those things in the test runner, any of those</span> <span data-start="5314.518" data-end="5318.544">things we click, they have some  context of there's a DOM element</span> <span data-start="5318.917" data-end="5323.191">involved or a network request.   If you click, they get logged in</span> <span data-start="5323.317" data-end="5326.846">the console.  Normally I would  have to set a break point and</span> <span data-start="5327.166" data-end="5330.505">write the logs.  Just with a  click, we can get that and start</span> <span data-start="5330.853" data-end="5332.853">playing with it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="5335.137" data-end="5339.205">DOM debugging, you can inspect  the state of the DOM in any of</span> <span data-start="5339.206" data-end="5343.376">these snapshots.   It's not necessarily replaying</span> <span data-start="5343.671" data-end="5347.212">all your different Redux states, for example, your true app</span> <span data-start="5347.413" data-end="5351.99">state.  It's just going based on the DOM.  I have found in</span> <span data-start="5352.683" data-end="5356.689">reality, with an app using React and Redux, I was interact and</span> <span data-start="5357.827" data-end="5360.881">things would sort of work.  And  there are hooks to potentially</span> <span data-start="5361.433" data-end="5365.932">do things like inject Redux  state and snapshot that stuff.</span> <span data-start="5366.169" data-end="5370.68">I haven't gotten to that yet;  I'm not sure anybody has.  But</span> <span data-start="5371.155" data-end="5377.78">there are crazy anyonings  —   things we can do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="5377.781" data-end="5381.76">I found it really awesome that I only needed to run this one</span> <span data-start="5382.23" data-end="5386.311">browser, this one app and this  one debugger to debug my tests</span> <span data-start="5386.312" data-end="5389.601">and app code.  This replay is  showing hitting a break point in</span> <span data-start="5389.975" data-end="5393.514">my test code here and hitting a  break point in my app code.</span> <span data-start="5393.909" data-end="5397.964">And being able to jump between  those two contexts.  I was used</span> <span data-start="5398.345" data-end="5402.987">to having a debugger, hopefully  in node and another in the dev</span> <span data-start="5403.285" data-end="5406.054">tools for my app, and I would be bouncing around between the two.</span> <span data-start="5406.56" data-end="5412.297">There's this cognitive load that comes with, which one am I in?</span> <span data-start="5412.673" data-end="5415.681">Where am I? Bouncing back and  forth and windows switching and</span> <span data-start="5415.923" data-end="5418.936">all of that.  When you start to  take this very challenging thing</span> <span data-start="5419.379" data-end="5423.37">that we do every day and you put it in a single place and make it</span> <span data-start="5423.499" data-end="5425.499">that much easier, it starts to  make it</span> <span data-start="5433.671" data-end="5436.628">fun again.       I mentioned we had to write</span> <span data-start="5437.194" data-end="5440.247">our own implicit waits.  There's a four-second time-out, which is</span> <span data-start="5440.948" data-end="5444.17">plenty.  You can override that.  There's direct access to the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="5444.959" data-end="5450.416">DOM.  In Selenium, everything  was being serialized, so you're</span> <span data-start="5451.013" data-end="5454.144">always getting a serialized  version of the DOM.  You're</span> <span data-start="5454.524" data-end="5458">actually dealing with a DOM  that's in your app from your</span> <span data-start="5458.207" data-end="5461.389">test code, and you just have it. It's just nice.  And there's</span> <span data-start="5461.695" data-end="5468.347">service mocking libraries built  in.  They just made it easy to</span> <span data-start="5468.567" data-end="5473.3">define things you want to match  on like method or parameter and</span> <span data-start="5473.424" data-end="5476.752">have it return fixture data.   It's just rolled up.  That's the</span> <span data-start="5476.891" data-end="5481.302">thing overall.  It rolls up all  this tooling that we would</span> <span data-start="5482.099" data-end="5484.865">normally be cobbling together  ourselves, sign on for the</span> <span data-start="5485.019" data-end="5488.379">request stuff, service mocking,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="5492.044" data-end="5496.381">Jquery, mocha and chai.  It  takes care of all of that for us</span> <span data-start="5496.55" data-end="5502.207">so we don't have to select them  ourselves, and it becomes one</span> <span data-start="5502.554" data-end="5505.551">cohesive package that is well  documented on their site.</span> <span data-start="5514.958" data-end="5519.429">On their blog and docs, they have tidbits like this.  When</span> <span data-start="5519.729" data-end="5522.49">you start to extend the  time-out, which is a common</span> <span data-start="5522.872" data-end="5525.982">trap, something didn't work.  It wasn't ready yet.  So we'll</span> <span data-start="5526.186" data-end="5529.48">extend the time-out.  There's a  catch to that, especially if you</span> <span data-start="5529.609" data-end="5534.473">do it universally.  There are  things, tidbits that are not</span> <span data-start="5534.597" data-end="5539.352">specific to cypress.  There's a  book in here about how to write</span> <span data-start="5539.541" data-end="5542.107">good end-to-end tests that could apply to Selenium or whatever</span> <span data-start="5542.314" data-end="5544.992">other tool you want to use.  I  like that.  I like that they're</span> <span data-start="5546.562" data-end="5551.543">a little opinionated and they  share these things right in</span> <span data-start="5552.33" data-end="5554.33">their docs.  It's nice that they went</span> <span data-start="5562.144" data-end="5564.572">that far.       There are trade-offs.  I</span> <span data-start="5564.758" data-end="5567.765">have been talking about how  awesome it is, but I want to</span> <span data-start="5568.085" data-end="5571.969">talk about what it lacks.  It's  a new tool, new technology, a</span> <span data-start="5572.166" data-end="5575.259">new thing to bring into your  team.  There's always a cost to</span> <span data-start="5575.372" data-end="5582.52">that.  I take that very  carefully.  It has a style of</span> <span data-start="5582.662" data-end="5586.097">chaining, and I don't like  chaining, but there's a reason</span> <span data-start="5586.29" data-end="5589.068">for it.  They like to maintain  the context of what you're doing</span> <span data-start="5589.588" data-end="5594.043">so they can intelligently tell  what you're doing next.  They're</span> <span data-start="5594.197" data-end="5599">up front about their trade-offs. They have a whole doc dedicated</span> <span data-start="5599.403" data-end="5604.852">to this.  They mention permanent and temporary trade-offs.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="5604.853" data-end="5610.079">Permanent is that it runs in a  single browser tab.  If it opens</span> <span data-start="5610.281" data-end="5614.761">other tabs, you will not be able to test those things in cypress.</span> <span data-start="5614.875" data-end="5619.288">They didn't try to support every browser out of the gate.  They</span> <span data-start="5619.629" data-end="5623.477">just chose Chrome-based  browsers.  They are working on</span> <span data-start="5624.253" data-end="5628.017">Firefox.  They are fixing issues on that, squashing some bugs,</span> <span data-start="5628.161" data-end="5631.551">and they will have that as soon  as they can.  And I'm sure that</span> <span data-start="5632.264" data-end="5634.494">Edge and so forth will be next.  That's something</span> <span data-start="5642.536" data-end="5645.775">that is very important.  I would suggest still having some</span> <span data-start="5645.776" data-end="5649.526">Selenium tests just for those  situations that cypress cannot</span> <span data-start="5649.667" data-end="5654.017">do.  I find that 99% of the  value of the tests is easily</span> <span data-start="5654.018" data-end="5657.743">covered by cypress, making sure  we exercise all the views and</span> <span data-start="5658.403" data-end="5662.03">interactions that we care about, testing each work flow once.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="5662.031" data-end="5667.341">The user wants to do A, B, C.   Test those things.</span> <span data-start="5667.342" data-end="5669.415">Testing the UI components at  least once is really important.</span> <span data-start="5683.562" data-end="5684.822">They basically re-invented  the wheel, and any time you do</span> <span data-start="5684.823" data-end="5688.318">that, you will have your own set of bugs and challenges.  I think</span> <span data-start="5688.319" data-end="5690.936">they tried to not only     They basically re-invented</span> <span data-start="5691.497" data-end="5694.899">reinvent Selenium but add a  comprehensive developer</span> <span data-start="5694.9" data-end="5701.874">experience on top of it.  That  is crazy.  If I would have ever</span> <span data-start="5701.875" data-end="5705.869">met the original author years  ago, I would tell him good luck.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="5706.022" data-end="5708.577">I don't think it's possible.   Don't feel bad if you fail.</span> <span data-start="5708.578" data-end="5712.46">Here he is, with what started as an experiment.</span> <span data-start="5712.461" data-end="5715.884">He got it working, and he's  built a team around it.  There's</span> <span data-start="5716.003" data-end="5718.003">six full-time devs on</span> <span data-start="5721.226" data-end="5723.962">it now.   The open-source community is</span> <span data-start="5724.079" data-end="5726.672">growing and others have made  contributions.  There's going to</span> <span data-start="5726.8" data-end="5733.01">be bugs and issues.  There's  going to be the trade-offs I</span> <span data-start="5733.32" data-end="5736.742">mentioned.  I'm really glad that they made it anyway.</span> <span data-start="5736.743" data-end="5742.49">So I would definitely say when  it comes to end-to-end testing</span> <span data-start="5742.491" data-end="5745.669">and our ability to test the user experiences, the game has</span> <span data-start="5745.987" data-end="5754.227">changed.  I would encourage  everyone to not just think about</span> <span data-start="5754.588" data-end="5757.246">unit coverages, but user  experience</span> <span data-start="5761.26" data-end="5766.249">coverage.  If you're new to  this, do this.  Write a smoke</span> <span data-start="5766.594" data-end="5770.383">test.  Test the main work flow.  Do the happy path.  Make sure</span> <span data-start="5770.521" data-end="5774.488">that's good.  That is going to  give you 90% of the value.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="5774.489" data-end="5776.806">You're going to cover your build and deployments and that one</span> <span data-start="5776.949" data-end="5779.639">thing that your app is supposed  to do.  From there you can start</span> <span data-start="5779.805" data-end="5784.13">to cover more things.  But that  is the one thing that you could</span> <span data-start="5784.301" data-end="5792.646">do in maybe a day.  I think I  had  —  I think I had the first</span> <span data-start="5792.647" data-end="5796.512">app tested in an hour or two,  and I went from</span> <span data-start="5803.294" data-end="5805.555">there.       I like to say this, don't</span> <span data-start="5805.673" data-end="5809.457">let your users test an app.  If  you're not automating these</span> <span data-start="5809.633" data-end="5813.406">things, that's what you're  doing.  You can have a QA team</span> <span data-start="5813.702" data-end="5816.864">or smoke testing this yourself  in your own browser, but there's</span> <span data-start="5816.992" data-end="5820.347">no way you can catch all the  things that the automated tests</span> <span data-start="5820.606" data-end="5824.294">can catch as quickly as they can catch.  If you do them manually,</span> <span data-start="5825.221" data-end="5829.701">what's your dev cycle? These  things can run very quickly and</span> <span data-start="5829.921" data-end="5831.921">catch so much</span> <span data-start="5833.253" data-end="5836.406">more.       So atlas law.  Any</span> <span data-start="5837.146" data-end="5840.068">application that can do  JavaScript eventually will,</span> <span data-start="5840.267" data-end="5844.53">right? That's a good thing.  I  was working in visual studio</span> <span data-start="5844.646" data-end="5848.912">code, and I thought wow.  I  remember when atom came out.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="5849.059" data-end="5854.098">Before I was using sublime.   Everyone loves sublime.  Or at</span> <span data-start="5854.225" data-end="5858.977">least they used to love sublime. And then atom came out.  And oh,</span> <span data-start="5859.136" data-end="5863.136">this is rendering JavaScript in  editor? This is fast and crazy.</span> <span data-start="5863.875" data-end="5870.275">And visual studio code? I'm  thinking when I use visual</span> <span data-start="5870.434" data-end="5876.488">studio code in atom, I'm using  pluginplugins.  There are</span> <span data-start="5877.105" data-end="5882.797">eco-systems of tools, because  they're written in JavaScript,</span> <span data-start="5882.798" data-end="5889.805">and things we're familiar with.  With cypress, it's still evolve</span> <span data-start="5891.024" data-end="5894.113">evolving.  We're in the early  stages of seeing that eco-system</span> <span data-start="5894.624" data-end="5897.771">expand and grow and become  something beyond what the</span> <span data-start="5898.989" data-end="5903.663">original authors intended.       I really want to thank the</span> <span data-start="5904.067" data-end="5907.441">cypress team.  They did an  amazing job.  They definitely</span> <span data-start="5907.442" data-end="5910.664">ran into all the problems that I experienced with Selenium, and</span> <span data-start="5910.783" data-end="5914.802">said they wanted to do better.   And they have.  They've built</span> <span data-start="5915.249" data-end="5918.248">something that not only is  written in JavaScript, but tried</span> <span data-start="5918.712" data-end="5921.57">to solve the developer  experience and tried to make it</span> <span data-start="5921.716" data-end="5924.482">smoother and make it encouraging for us to write the tests that</span> <span data-start="5924.64" data-end="5927.604">are not always easy.  I think  they've done a terrific job.  If</span> <span data-start="5927.871" data-end="5931.665">you  —  I think their docs are  great.

We</span> <span data-start="10130.495" data-end="10134.469">were looking for ways to use  augmented reality in one of our</span> <span data-start="10135.097" data-end="10138.198">marketing campaigns.  I took the liberty to do the research on my</span> <span data-start="10138.599" data-end="10143.969">own and see what's possible.  I  got really excited about the</span> <span data-start="10143.97" data-end="10147.264">many years that it has gone  back, and wanted to share with</span> <span data-start="10147.839" data-end="10151.411">my team to help them appreciate  what it is today, and do my</span> <span data-start="10151.556" data-end="10153.643">actual job of reporting back  what's possible today and</span> <span data-start="10158.704" data-end="10160.704">in the future.       So what is possible in</span> <span data-start="10164.823" data-end="10168.977">the future? I want to make a  quick disclaimer that all this</span> <span data-start="10169.174" data-end="10173.273">research I did was on my own.   It's all public knowledge, and</span> <span data-start="10173.602" data-end="10175.685">with that being said, I'm  speaking on behalf of myself and</span> <span data-start="10176.019" data-end="10179.809">not on behalf of my company or  any of the organizations I'm a</span> <span data-start="10180.017" data-end="10182.652">part of.       So let's step back into</span> <span data-start="10183.487" data-end="10187.049">1901.  This is a time before  airplanes, before traditional</span> <span data-start="10187.476" data-end="10191.602">color photography that we know,  and nearly a decade before the</span> <span data-start="10191.603" data-end="10197.924">first talking motion picture.   Yet, before all of these</span> <span data-start="10198.664" data-end="10200.664">technological advances, we had a</span> <span data-start="10204.823" data-end="10211.332">visionary author who envisioned  a world in a book called "the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="10211.333" data-end="10216.549">Master Key," and he put on a  pair of spectacles that would</span> <span data-start="10216.911" data-end="10220.678">overlay a character marker.  He  is looking around and can judge</span> <span data-start="10220.835" data-end="10225.694">a person on a single look.   These were really deep sci-fi</span> <span data-start="10226.111" data-end="10229.383">thoughts back in 1901.  I can't  imagine how he could have come</span> <span data-start="10229.384" data-end="10237.424">up with the idea.  If the name L Frank Baum rings a bell, he's</span> <span data-start="10238.061" data-end="10244.742">also the author of the wizard of Oz.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="10244.743" data-end="10251.7">Fast forward to 1968.  We have  built a plane and orbited the</span> <span data-start="10252.055" data-end="10256.838">moon.  And we also have the  first head-mounted display.</span> <span data-start="10257.153" data-end="10263.854">This was developed by Ivan  Sutherland.  You can see him</span> <span data-start="10264.533" data-end="10268.489">spinning around, and all he can  see is a simple wire cube.</span> <span data-start="10268.49" data-end="10271.641">After this hard work, you saw a  visionary cube in space.  And</span> <span data-start="10271.784" data-end="10275.921">this was a really important  precursor to AR.  As you can</span> <span data-start="10276.273" data-end="10280.988">see, there have been so many  advancements with head-mounted</span> <span data-start="10281.37" data-end="10287.062">displays these days.  And now  looking at 2018, we have a</span> <span data-start="10287.063" data-end="10292.555">rocket orbiting into space with  a car that is out there</span> <span data-start="10292.915" data-end="10297.369">floating.  But we also have all  of these advancements in</span> <span data-start="10297.37" data-end="10301.003">augmented reality.  Everyone is  talking about it being the next</span> <span data-start="10301.795" data-end="10306.096">big thing.  Technologists and  investors alike are speculating</span> <span data-start="10306.097" data-end="10311.357">on when this will blow up.       So what's happening? There</span> <span data-start="10312.004" data-end="10316.12">is rich history that dates  augmented reality back to at</span> <span data-start="10316.121" data-end="10320.607">least 1901.  So, if you look at  this chart from Google trends,</span> <span data-start="10321.05" data-end="10326.183">in case you haven't used it  before, the Y  axis is the</span> <span data-start="10326.661" data-end="10333.393">search enjin   —  engine from 0  to 10 and the X is time.  So I</span> <span data-start="10333.563" data-end="10336.981">did a search for 200 years.  As  you can see, there's interesting</span> <span data-start="10337.977" data-end="10343.634">activity going on here.   Suddenly in the summer of 2016,</span> <span data-start="10344.346" data-end="10349.514">we see a huge peak, and people  are curious about the mysterious</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="10350.372" data-end="10356.483">AR thing.  This is when Pokemon  go was released.  People</span> <span data-start="10356.899" data-end="10361.514">wondered, whoa! What is augment augmented reality, and what else</span> <span data-start="10361.717" data-end="10365.306">is possible with this thing?  This was probably the most</span> <span data-start="10365.511" data-end="10369.998">popular AR application, although it's not fully AR capable, and</span> <span data-start="10369.999" data-end="10378.373">they're working on that fully AR Pokemon go soon.  But this</span> <span data-start="10378.624" data-end="10383.458">opened the public's eyes into  the possibility of AR and showed</span> <span data-start="10383.679" data-end="10387.317">the potential for its scale.       Later, around the fall of</span> <span data-start="10387.688" data-end="10390.833">2017, we have another peak  that's starting to rise.  It's</span> <span data-start="10391.543" data-end="10398.641">not as high as Pokemon Go, this  was from AR core and ARKit that</span> <span data-start="10399.594" data-end="10401.883">were released around the same  time.  These are developer kits</span> <span data-start="10402.098" data-end="10405.938">that will allow people to build  experiences such as Pokemon Go</span> <span data-start="10406.17" data-end="10410.109">in a much easier and more  streamlined way.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="10410.11" data-end="10416.88">So a quick definition, ARCore is a platform for building AR apps</span> <span data-start="10416.881" data-end="10425.277">on Android, and ARKit is Apple's version for building AR on iOs.</span> <span data-start="10425.636" data-end="10429.044">Looking back, this is as far  back as you can go.  There is</span> <span data-start="10429.045" data-end="10432.1">some activity going on.  People  are actually interested and</span> <span data-start="10432.28" data-end="10436.084">aware of augmented reality.   Especially around 2009.  So that</span> <span data-start="10436.325" data-end="10439.922">was almost ten years ago.  And  why does it seem like it's such</span> <span data-start="10439.923" data-end="10445.879">a new thing now? This is when AR tool kit was released for web.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="10445.999" data-end="10451.101">It's an open-sourced tool kit.   If you want to compare it to</span> <span data-start="10452.611" data-end="10457.965">ARCore and ARKit, and allowed  developers to build AR</span> <span data-start="10458.35" data-end="10461.334">applications.  The output would  be Flash-based.</span> <span data-start="10461.335" data-end="10465.201">This is one of the reasons it  didn't take on.  Users have to</span> <span data-start="10465.202" data-end="10469.163">install a plugin, and they have  to use their web cam in a weird</span> <span data-start="10469.474" data-end="10473.164">way that does not feel natural  compared to a mobile device,</span> <span data-start="10473.305" data-end="10475.891">where you can take it around  with you, and it makes more</span> <span data-start="10475.892" data-end="10482.031">sense to point at what you want  to project your AR object on to.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="10482.032" data-end="10488.747">So, this really shows its  state.  This publication about</span> <span data-start="10488.748" data-end="10493.481">it describes what AR tool kit  is.  It shows AR tool kit in</span> <span data-start="10493.663" data-end="10498.691">action.  It's marker-based, so  they have this code where it</span> <span data-start="10498.692" data-end="10502.562">will project the object from the code.  And then in the</span> <span data-start="10503.089" data-end="10507.416">documentation, you can also see  that it's using windows XP and</span> <span data-start="10507.641" data-end="10511.343">telling you how to use a web cam on your computer.</span> <span data-start="10511.344" data-end="10515.414">Later in 2009, we have the  introduction of augmented</span> <span data-start="10516.094" data-end="10521.799">reality into the real world.   Esquire published this issue, it</span> <span data-start="10522.015" data-end="10525.302">was an augmented reality  special, and on the front cover,</span> <span data-start="10525.607" data-end="10529.896">you had this QR code you could  scan, and something magical</span> <span data-start="10530.104" data-end="10534.448">happens.  Robert Downey Jr.  Comes out of the screen and</span> <span data-start="10535.006" data-end="10539.688">starts acknowledging you.  As  you saw in the previous screen,</span> <span data-start="10539.689" data-end="10543.1">there were 12 pages of AR  content and lots of publications</span> <span data-start="10543.548" data-end="10547.069">were talking about it, and it  was becoming more noticeable to</span> <span data-start="10547.446" data-end="10550.961">consumers.       So fast forwarding to today,</span> <span data-start="10551.236" data-end="10561.095">we have back in 2012, Google  hangouts foments</span> <span data-start="10562.721" data-end="10565.785">filters, which was long before  snap</span> <span data-start="10571.797" data-end="10579.107">chat.  We have Pokemon Go, and  Ikea's furniture app from the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="10579.108" data-end="10581.108">Apple store.   What's making this possible is</span> <span data-start="10581.449" data-end="10586.629">we have much more powerful  devices, much more powerful</span> <span data-start="10586.772" data-end="10592.909">browsers that will soon be  capable of AR.  Hopefully future</span> <span data-start="10593.23" data-end="10596.723">support on the web will help to  bring this technology to the</span> <span data-start="10597.257" data-end="10599.362">masses.       So let's go back to basics</span> <span data-start="10599.607" data-end="10601.979">and talk about what defines  augmented reality</span> <span data-start="10605.326" data-end="10610.359">apps.  So ARCore, again, is the  kit that allows developers to</span> <span data-start="10610.36" data-end="10615.586">use these defining features in  applications.  And these</span> <span data-start="10615.961" data-end="10619.082">defining features include motion tracking, which allows the</span> <span data-start="10619.083" data-end="10623.092">device to understand and track  its position relative to the</span> <span data-start="10623.093" data-end="10626.28">real world.  So a scare crow  that you can place into the</span> <span data-start="10626.484" data-end="10629.582">world and move around and looks  stationary just like the people</span> <span data-start="10629.884" data-end="10634.343">next to it.  And environmental  understanding so the device can</span> <span data-start="10634.344" data-end="10638.677">detect the size and location.   Previously it was only</span> <span data-start="10639.4" data-end="10643.664">horizontal surfaces, but with  the new release, you can place</span> <span data-start="10645.162" data-end="10648.556">it on textured surfaces.  There  was a demo of placing things on</span> <span data-start="10648.893" data-end="10652.726">the snow, like around the tree.  And then light estimation, which</span> <span data-start="10652.727" data-end="10655.063">allows the device to estimate  the lighting conditions.  This</span> <span data-start="10655.395" data-end="10659.974">helps brings objects to life.   The Subtleties like shadows and</span> <span data-start="10659.975" data-end="10663.494">brightness can really make an  object in the real world look</span> <span data-start="10668.632" data-end="10672.405">real.       So, previously we had a</span> <span data-start="10673.464" data-end="10678.592">platform called tango, which  allowed augmented reality on</span> <span data-start="10678.593" data-end="10681.982">powerful devices, but we decided we wanted to bring this to the</span> <span data-start="10682.204" data-end="10685.983">masses.  That's when we focused  our efforts from late last year</span> <span data-start="10686.313" data-end="10691.317">on ARCore, which will make  augmented reality possible on</span> <span data-start="10691.318" data-end="10695.314">more Android devices.  So that  is a huge challenge, but a</span> <span data-start="10695.315" data-end="10698.902">really big opportunity.  The  fact that there are 2 billion</span> <span data-start="10699.179" data-end="10703.24">plus active devices running on  Android.  And each of these has</span> <span data-start="10703.241" data-end="10706.405">their own unique hardware  requirements and specs that we</span> <span data-start="10706.655" data-end="10709.968">have to make sure align and  provide the same high quality</span> <span data-start="10710.123" data-end="10712.7">experience that we want all  users to have.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="10712.701" data-end="10716.91">So currently, with the most  recent release, it works on 100</span> <span data-start="10717.461" data-end="10720.922">million devices including 13  unique models.  And we're</span> <span data-start="10720.923" data-end="10724.676">working with partners to make  sure that more devices can</span> <span data-start="10724.677" data-end="10728.753">support this.       Going back to ARKits.  This</span> <span data-start="10728.754" data-end="10732.498">is the software developer kit  allowing developers to use the</span> <span data-start="10733.086" data-end="10738.155">same essential features in iOS  11.  It's very similar to the</span> <span data-start="10738.585" data-end="10744.817">three basic AR features that  ARCore suggests.  Those are</span> <span data-start="10745.066" data-end="10750.864">essential AR features, not like  AR core.  They can be described</span> <span data-start="10751.161" data-end="10758.432">for any augmented reality app.   And the device compatibility,</span> <span data-start="10759.15" data-end="10761.15">most recent Apple devices.</span> <span data-start="10765.623" data-end="10771.944">So with iPhone 6S and above, and some of the newer iPads.</span> <span data-start="10771.945" data-end="10775.413">Let's talk about building for  web.  All of this allows you to</span> <span data-start="10775.414" data-end="10779.563">build native apps, and this is a JS conference, so you are</span> <span data-start="10779.564" data-end="10782.479">probably bored thinking about  building an app.  We want to</span> <span data-start="10782.682" data-end="10784.682">build for web.  So let's see</span> <span data-start="10789.137" data-end="10793.225">what's possible.  ARCore has an  experiment exploring the</span> <span data-start="10793.441" data-end="10795.792">possibilities of web support,  and it will lower the barrier to</span> <span data-start="10796.477" data-end="10799.836">enter, which people can build  apps and release them out to the</span> <span data-start="10800.206" data-end="10805.405">web.  This is a pre-standards  experimentation, just trying to</span> <span data-start="10805.628" data-end="10810.066">see what's possible.  It's  basically a wrapper of chromium</span> <span data-start="10810.067" data-end="10813.862">extending web VR features, so  it's really</span> <span data-start="10817.521" data-end="10822.418">scalable.  So they have this  cool demo called article, which</span> <span data-start="10822.419" data-end="10830.419">you can download on get  GitHub  and run it on the server.  It's</span> <span data-start="10830.42" data-end="10836.477">super easy.       ARCore is not one single</span> <span data-start="10836.901" data-end="10842.785">entity.  You're building a web  app with AR capabilities.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="10842.786" data-end="10845.295">You're running it on the  experimental browser that is</span> <span data-start="10845.535" data-end="10849.959">supposed to emulate what the web standards might look like.</span> <span data-start="10849.96" data-end="10852.786">Currently they have experimental browsers that work on Android</span> <span data-start="10859.749" data-end="10862.537">and iOS.       And most of the examples on</span> <span data-start="10862.686" data-end="10871.805">the web AR for ARCore demos are  built with 3JS.  It's a popular</span> <span data-start="10872.575" data-end="10876.271">library used since 2010.  Some  of Google's projects have</span> <span data-start="10879.583" data-end="10884.407">used it, and all of these other  cool Google and non-gilt</span> <span data-start="10884.408" data-end="10889.556">experiments you see here.  It  allows you to create 3D shapes,</span> <span data-start="10889.791" data-end="10893.025">animations, complex scenes, and  gives you tools to make this</span> <span data-start="10893.46" data-end="10896.333">easier.  3D modeling concepts  are really hard.</span> <span data-start="10896.334" data-end="10901.961">So this is one of the tools that it provides.  It's an in-browser</span> <span data-start="10902.13" data-end="10906.392">shape editor or scene editor.   It allows you to control all the</span> <span data-start="10906.522" data-end="10911.357">different parameters.  And it's  a really good way to start</span> <span data-start="10911.358" data-end="10915.47">learning 3D modeling, especially if you haven't been paying</span> <span data-start="10915.471" data-end="10922.159">attention in math class.  You  have to relearn mapping and</span> <span data-start="10922.16" data-end="10924.16">matrix multiplication, and  sometimes it's</span> <span data-start="10930.183" data-end="10933.39">overwhelming.  With time, you  can make 3D creations like this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="10933.96" data-end="10938.203">If you are having trouble, you  can download some models on poly</span> <span data-start="10941.066" data-end="10944.286">and find these different kinds  of cheese burgers.  Search for</span> <span data-start="10944.287" data-end="10947.035">the term, and you will find  items tagged with that</span> <span data-start="10947.165" data-end="10952.231">description.  And if you really  like these cheeseburgers, you</span> <span data-start="10952.232" data-end="10955.081">can put them together, start  throwing them in the air, and</span> <span data-start="10955.082" data-end="10960.263">that's your AR app.     So just to highlight what's</span> <span data-start="10960.264" data-end="10965.73">possible with 3JS, this is one  of the apps that my team has</span> <span data-start="10966.219" data-end="10968.219">built, and it helps people</span> <span data-start="10974.439" data-end="10983.17">find the direction prayer for.   This is basically just usek web</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="10986.005" data-end="10990.419">RTC to use the camera and  navigation APIs.  And basically</span> <span data-start="10990.42" data-end="10995.852">it's projecting this into space  rather than as we have learned</span> <span data-start="10995.997" data-end="10999.629">as an essential AR feature.  It  doesn't allow you to place it on</span> <span data-start="11000.171" data-end="11006.488">to a detected surface.  It's a  kind of faux AR, but it's  —  I</span> <span data-start="11006.655" data-end="11010.41">guess you can compare it to  Pokemon Go, where you're not</span> <span data-start="11012.28" data-end="11016.443">really throwing the Pokeball on  to the Pokemon.  It's not on the</span> <span data-start="11016.775" data-end="11020.71">floor.  Sometimes it's floating  around.  So that's kind of one</span> <span data-start="11021.072" data-end="11024.65">distinction of what's possible  with 3JS and how we need to</span> <span data-start="11028.25" data-end="11035.858">bridge the gap.  There is a  library called 3.AR.JS, which</span> <span data-start="11036.154" data-end="11039.518">detects the device compatibility and interfaces with a web VR</span> <span data-start="11039.977" data-end="11044.94">extension that is exposed by the experimental browsers.  That's</span> <span data-start="11044.941" data-end="11048.184">what is allowing you to throw  things on to surfaces and detect</span> <span data-start="11048.705" data-end="11051.537">it with precision.       So putting it all together,</span> <span data-start="11051.942" data-end="11055.167">you can create useful apps.  For example, this living room</span> <span data-start="11058.874" data-end="11062.172">modeling.  There's useful things you can do for consumers,</span> <span data-start="11062.295" data-end="11065.549">especially if it's available for the web.  People can reach these</span> <span data-start="11066.015" data-end="11071.431">experiences from a link, and  access them if their device is</span> <span data-start="11071.851" data-end="11076.293">compatible.       So, again, the web AR and AR</span> <span data-start="11076.465" data-end="11081.031">core implementation is an  experiment to explore what is</span> <span data-start="11081.194" data-end="11086.392">possible and what might be  potential web standards.  There</span> <span data-start="11086.59" data-end="11090.382">are more possibilities.  Moz://a has their possibility, and there</span> <span data-start="11091.03" data-end="11096.076">are a lot of commonalties in the pre-standards proposals right</span> <span data-start="11096.311" data-end="11100.419">now.  Things are starting to  align, and hopefully we have</span> <span data-start="11101.215" data-end="11104.713">standards, too.  I think one of  the most popular ones might be</span> <span data-start="11104.987" data-end="11110.102">the marker-based ar.js.  If you  recognize the markers from my</span> <span data-start="11110.523" data-end="11115.779">earlier slides, it's because  it's based on AR tool kit.  So</span> <span data-start="11116.99" data-end="11120.34">it goes way back.  With all of  these standards that are not</span> <span data-start="11120.587" data-end="11123.943">fully in place, why should we  care now? What if it changes and</span> <span data-start="11124.129" data-end="11128.979">it stresses you out to learn all of these new things? With 3D</span> <span data-start="11129.174" data-end="11132.672">modeling, it's a big concept to  grasp, and if you start learning</span> <span data-start="11133.154" data-end="11138.629">it now, there's a lot to catch  up on.  People have been 3D</span> <span data-start="11138.63" data-end="11141.983">modeling for decades.  If you're interested, start equipping</span> <span data-start="11142.115" data-end="11144.45">yourself with the basic  knowledge to get started.  And</span> <span data-start="11144.451" data-end="11148.503">people are already building  really cool stuff right now.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="11148.737" data-end="11152.574">Some sources of inspiration, there are ARCore-specific</span> <span data-start="11155.912" data-end="11160.643">examples.  There's an ARKit  version at the bottom there.</span> <span data-start="11160.644" data-end="11165.139">One of my favorites is here,  which just features some of</span> <span data-start="11165.59" data-end="11170.088">Google's  —  I am not biased or  anything  —  some of Google's AR</span> <span data-start="11170.26" data-end="11172.879">experiments.  But one of the  reasons I love it so much is</span> <span data-start="11172.88" data-end="11175.957">half of the experiments were  created by women.  So that's</span> <span data-start="11175.958" data-end="11181.303">awesome to show that  representation in the web XR</span> <span data-start="11181.645" data-end="11186.4">community.

It started</span> <span data-start="11837.133" data-end="11841.194">with conceptual sketches on  paper, like all good ideas</span> <span data-start="11841.911" data-end="11846.336">start.  And the whole concept  was thoroughly determined before</span> <span data-start="11846.643" data-end="11850.677">we started coding anything.  So  that helped us really keep</span> <span data-start="11850.798" data-end="11852.798">things in scope.  And we did</span> <span data-start="11856.963" data-end="11859.717">one thing well.       The next step was doing some</span> <span data-start="11859.903" data-end="11868.703">web mock-ups just to get a gist  of how the animation would look</span> <span data-start="11868.827" data-end="11876.638">like.

<p><span data-start="11906.774" data-end="11911.29">This took like 30 minutes to do. And it was so good to have this</span> <span data-start="11911.291" data-end="11919.503">with the project proposal.       Okay.  Back to the</span> <span data-start="11919.893" data-end="11922.431">presentation.  The biggest  unknown factor in the whole</span> <span data-start="11922.76" data-end="11924.856">project was how to render stuff  from the</span> <span data-start="11928.666" data-end="11933.8">light facade, but it had been  done before.  So we got access</span> <span data-start="11933.801" data-end="11937.565">to node.js server access code  written</span> <span data-start="11943.054" data-end="11948.498">by Owen Hendley.   The networking part was also</span> <span data-start="11949.033" data-end="11951.392">pretty straightforward.  We used</span> <span data-start="11955.696" data-end="11959.729">socket.io, and you press and  make a blob, and it sends the</span> <span data-start="11959.952" data-end="11963.991">event to all connected  participants.  And it also</span> <span data-start="11963.992" data-end="11969.84">contains some rudimentary game  logic and input sanitizing and</span> <span data-start="11969.958" data-end="11971.958">UX</span> <span data-start="11976.28" data-end="11979.027">throttling.       So when we set that up, we</span> <span data-start="11979.309" data-end="11985.131">faced some real-world problems.  The server had to be located in</span> <span data-start="11985.654" data-end="11988.556">the basement with the rest of  the controllers, that meant we</span> <span data-start="11988.557" data-end="11993.219">had to go up and down and up and down endlessly in our feedback</span> <span data-start="11993.354" data-end="11995.369">loop.  This is a video of one of</span> <span data-start="11998.662" data-end="12000.662">those times.

And this was online,  we wanted to allow more people</span> <span data-start="12024.501" data-end="12030.969">to participate.  So we decided  to set up our live stream.  With</span> <span data-start="12031.639" data-end="12036.508">our limited budget, we picked up the phone and duct taped it to</span> <span data-start="12036.509" data-end="12039.425">the ceiling of the hotel lobby  across from the</span> <span data-start="12048.373" data-end="12051.701">location.  But soon, people  started complaining about the</span> <span data-start="12051.702" data-end="12054.627">tourist bus blocking the view.   And also the staff at the</span> <span data-start="12058.776" data-end="12064.077">hotel, they were not pleased  about the unidentified phone</span> <span data-start="12064.078" data-end="12066.993">that was possibly broadcasting  their conversations to the</span> <span data-start="12067.312" data-end="12070.009">internet.      >> Yeah.

We</span> <span data-start="12076.361" data-end="12081.642">had to connect our computer  through six unmarked ether net</span> <span data-start="12081.904" data-end="12085.495">cables, and had to be done in  correct order for it to work.</span> </p>

Now this is actually a very</span> <span data-start="12152.576" data-end="12155.819">funny story, because somebody  found a way to override our</span> <span data-start="12156.037" data-end="12161.688">color scheme.  We had like a  very limited color scheme.  You</span> <span data-start="12162.071" data-end="12164.911">could not draw black, for  instance.  So you could not</span> <span data-start="12164.912" data-end="12168.271">clear the screen or something  like that.  But somebody found a</span> <span data-start="12168.463" data-end="12176.744">way to override it, and were  suddenly able to draw arbitrary</span> <span data-start="12176.912" data-end="12180.084">buffers of images.

We  approached him and after</span> <span data-start="12250.544" data-end="12255.145">negotiations, he surrendered and told us all about how he did it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="12255.64" data-end="12259.306">He sent his code and a lot of  comments on our code, which was</span> <span data-start="12259.307" data-end="12265.686">very fun to read.

And that was a great way to show off the feature that we</span> <span data-start="12420.656" data-end="12426.457">were using wind force and wind  direction to render.  So we just</span> <span data-start="12426.75" data-end="12431.065">looked on the bright side.   There were a</span> <span data-start="12434.772" data-end="12438.849"> —  were not a lot of people  outside trying it out, mostly</span> <span data-start="12439.248" data-end="12442.463">inside.

And doesn't have  any vulnerabilities, especially</span> <span data-start="13821.394" data-end="13824.581">nothing that can be hacked with  a banana.  You know I thought of</span> <span data-start="13825.063" data-end="13828.804">everything.  It uses HTTPS, and  I don't have to pay a dime for</span> <span data-start="13828.958" data-end="13835.579">that.  It uses HSPS, which just  makes sure there's no</span> <span data-start="13835.733" data-end="13839.138">downgrading of the traffic.   This is typically what blocks</span> <span data-start="13839.139" data-end="13844.435">you from going to Google.com  when there's a public Wi-Fi with</span> <span data-start="13844.862" data-end="13846.862">a captive</span> <span data-start="13849.206" data-end="13854.019">model.  I don't allow mixed  content.  So no HTTP content on</span> <span data-start="13854.02" data-end="13859.805">a website that is certified  HTTPS.  I sanitize the HTML.  So</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="13860.334" data-end="13863.628">I allow people to put a mark  down, but I will make sure to</span> <span data-start="13863.629" data-end="13867.403">send it before it goes to the  page.  And there is no room for</span> <span data-start="13867.897" data-end="13871.711">SQL injections, because I'm not  using a real database.</span> <span data-start="13871.712" data-end="13876.332">So there's no way to have the  injections.  And I'm not talking</span> <span data-start="13878.199" data-end="13882.355">about NoSQL databases, but I'm  literally using a plain start,</span> <span data-start="13882.55" data-end="13887.648">because I don't believe this  will scale.  But turns out that</span> <span data-start="13888.042" data-end="13889.982">developing secure web  applications isn't as secure as</span> <span data-start="13889.983" data-end="13894.88">I thought.  So I contacted my  buddy, Bob Allison.  And he took</span> <span data-start="13894.881" data-end="13900.388">a stab at the application and  figured out a bunch of security</span> <span data-start="13900.551" data-end="13903.282">vulnerabilities that I would  like to share with you.  Now</span> <span data-start="13903.462" data-end="13906.147">it's really warm.  So I will  take this off.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="13906.148" data-end="13908.148">All right.  So, if we go</span> <span data-start="13926.38" data-end="13930.57">to this page.  I will set an  HTTP cookie to maintain the</span> <span data-start="13930.729" data-end="13933.138">session.  It's just a way that allows you</span> <span data-start="13933.139" data-end="13938.676">to to maintain session state  throughout multiple sessions by</span> <span data-start="13938.677" data-end="13945.107">setting a value either by HTTP  headers or via JavaScript.  If</span> <span data-start="13945.292" data-end="13947.292">we go into the console here, we</span> <span data-start="13950.17" data-end="13953.999">can access that.  I have one  that is called off token.  This</span> <span data-start="13954.263" data-end="13959.223">is what is called a JWT or JSON</span> <span data-start="13963.246" data-end="13966.781">web token.  We can see that it  has three different parts, a</span> <span data-start="13967.176" data-end="13970.397">header, a red part, a purple  part which is like the payload,</span> <span data-start="13970.398" data-end="13973.69">and then it has a signature.   That's generated by an algorithm</span> <span data-start="13974.016" data-end="13977.134">that is specified in the header  using a secret.  If we look</span> <span data-start="13977.569" data-end="13981.695">here, it says invalid signature, because I was smart enough not</span> <span data-start="13982.887" data-end="13987.72">to use "secret" as my secret,  but there is a vulnerability in</span> <span data-start="13988.925" data-end="13990.925">my app around this that</span> <span data-start="13992.914" data-end="13995.031">we can exploit.  There are  different algorithms that you</span> <span data-start="13995.032" data-end="14000.574">can use, and one of them that is mandatory in the spec is none.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="14000.847" data-end="14002.847">Disregard the</span> <span data-start="14008.208" data-end="14011.17">signature.  If we do this, and  let's have fun.  We switched the</span> <span data-start="14011.369" data-end="14016.609">role to Admin.  And then I copy  this part.  And this is just</span> <span data-start="14016.61" data-end="14020.886">basic code.  This is just plain  data.  Don't think this is</span> <span data-start="14021.177" data-end="14024.687">secure or something.  And I will set this as an off</span> <span data-start="14029.708" data-end="14033.16">token.  We can refresh the page, and we will see that we are now</span> <span data-start="14033.161" data-end="14035.161">in Admin mode.  And that is  because I'm</span> <span data-start="14038.648" data-end="14043.519">taking the JWT as a single  source of truth.  If I say I'm</span> <span data-start="14043.9" data-end="14046.799">an Admin, I am.  That in  combination with the algorithm</span> <span data-start="14046.967" data-end="14050.512">that is none, we can kind of  just switch anything.  And I</span> <span data-start="14050.694" data-end="14054.258">wouldn't have had to log in in  the first place.  I could have</span> <span data-start="14054.646" data-end="14057.778">generated this with any user  name and sign in as anyone.  How</span> <span data-start="14057.779" data-end="14063.128">can we protect ourselves from  that? You can set cookies via</span> <span data-start="14063.35" data-end="14070.341">JavaScript or HTTP headers.  And you can declare cookies as HTTP</span> <span data-start="14070.342" data-end="14076.593">only.  They will still be sent  by the browser, but you will not</span> <span data-start="14077.013" data-end="14083.347">be able to access and manipulate them.  And an assigned cookie</span> <span data-start="14084.04" data-end="14087.834">means I could not manipulate  without knowing the token and</span> <span data-start="14088.189" data-end="14091.212">that it's secured.  But there's  another thing I should have</span> <span data-start="14091.632" data-end="14093.632">done, and that</span> <span data-start="14095.807" data-end="14100.366">revolves around jaws.  I'm using the library on node, but I'm</span> <span data-start="14100.367" data-end="14104.006">using an old version, and that  one has two flaws that the newer</span> <span data-start="14104.188" data-end="14106.643">one fixes.  On the one hand, the library</span> <span data-start="14107.003" data-end="14110.509">should provide you with a way to white list algorithms.  In this</span> <span data-start="14110.657" data-end="14114.987">case, I'm in the secure version  of this, I'm saying that I only</span> <span data-start="14115.824" data-end="14119.881">allow HS256 tokens versus  nothing else.  And then the</span> <span data-start="14119.997" data-end="14123.41">other thing is in this library,  for example, if the secret is</span> <span data-start="14123.411" data-end="14128.027">set to something that is not  null, the library will not</span> <span data-start="14128.34" data-end="14131.698">accept none as an algorithm.   But that's only in the newer</span> <span data-start="14131.902" data-end="14135.476">libraries.  So the bottom line  here is stay up to date.  You</span> <span data-start="14135.678" data-end="14141.834">don't want to be the next  Equifax.  There was an older</span> <span data-start="14142.074" data-end="14145.206">version of an implementation  that was known to be vulnerable</span> <span data-start="14145.437" data-end="14148.652">and them not getting around to  updating it.  You don't want to</span> <span data-start="14148.653" data-end="14153.159">be in the news far that.       This is a social network, so</span> <span data-start="14153.51" data-end="14156.62">we can post stuff.  Let me jump  back here and post something.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="14156.621" data-end="14163.941">This is marked, so I can write  something like hi, JSConf</span> <span data-start="14164.076" data-end="14167.385">Iceland.  And I will post this  and look at the traffic.  We</span> <span data-start="14170.925" data-end="14176.504">will see that  —  if I make this  bigger, there's an HTTP post why</span> <span data-start="14178.107" data-end="14183.992">here that sets the token along  and sends the form data in the</span> <span data-start="14184.181" data-end="14187.294">bottom.  This is nice, because  it's really easy to implement.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="14188.396" data-end="14193.027">I'm literally submitting a form  asynchronously.  But the</span> <span data-start="14193.41" data-end="14197.838">combination of form and cookies  is also something that can cause</span> <span data-start="14198.015" data-end="14202.126">a request forgery attack by  hackers.  To give you an idea of</span> <span data-start="14202.266" data-end="14209.478">how this works and what this is, this is  —  sometimes it's</span> <span data-start="14209.479" data-end="14218.728">written as XXRF or CSRF, but  typically pronounced "c-surf."</span> <span data-start="14218.729" data-end="14222.632">If you get back to the page and  refresh here, you see that the</span> <span data-start="14222.822" data-end="14226.58">attacker was able to post on my  behalf on the page.  The reason</span> <span data-start="14226.581" data-end="14230.795">why this works is the browser is super eager to send all of these</span> <span data-start="14230.796" data-end="14234.853">cookies along on every request.  If we look at the code that</span> <span data-start="14235.016" data-end="14240.874">hacked us here, it, on body  unload, it will submit the form</span> <span data-start="14241.036" data-end="14244.171">that we have here.  In this case it is visible, but it could have</span> <span data-start="14244.326" data-end="14249.775">been hidden.  There is an input  tag with a message we want to</span> <span data-start="14249.947" data-end="14253.143">send.  It could be hidden.  It  doesn't have to be visible.  And</span> <span data-start="14253.454" data-end="14256.67">then hit submit.  This is the  danger about this, because the</span> <span data-start="14257.004" data-end="14259.913">browser is super eager to send  this.  So let's talk about how</span> <span data-start="14260.057" data-end="14262.057">we can</span> <span data-start="14264.667" data-end="14268.905">fix this.  Let me find my slides again.  Apparently it was hacked</span> <span data-start="14269.325" data-end="14272.738">twice by this application.   Let's navigate and talk about</span> <span data-start="14272.739" data-end="14277.737">what happened here.   When I clicked on the link here,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="14278.022" data-end="14283.556">I'm using a target blank here.   The attacker's page can access</span> <span data-start="14283.557" data-end="14288.836">my page window by using  window.opener.application, and</span> <span data-start="14288.837" data-end="14291.777">rewrite that application.  In  that case, the attacker page was</span> <span data-start="14292.376" data-end="14296.172">navigating me to another  harmless page, but this could</span> <span data-start="14296.173" data-end="14302.56">have just as well been a  redirection to a phishing page</span> <span data-start="14303.574" data-end="14310.635">that looks like your page.   Someone could put in a page</span> <span data-start="14311.478" data-end="14315.445">filling that redirects the  original browser to a phishing</span> <span data-start="14315.601" data-end="14318.643">page.  Luckily, protecting  yourself from that is pretty</span> <span data-start="14318.894" data-end="14326.451">straightforward.  You want to  use the rel attribute and set it</span> <span data-start="14326.68" data-end="14330.447">to no opener and no defer.  You  don't want to provide access to</span> <span data-start="14331.205" data-end="14335.3">window.opener, and there is no  refer because some browsers</span> <span data-start="14336.11" data-end="14343.79">don't support no opener.  Namely IE and older versions of Edge.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="14344.215" data-end="14350.339">You want to use the no refer as  well.  Plus there are some</span> <span data-start="14350.34" data-end="14354.273">JavaScript scripts that allow  you to circumvent this as well.</span> <span data-start="14354.581" data-end="14361.244">To get back to the CSRF  attacks, the approach is</span> <span data-start="14361.999" data-end="14366.723">relatively straight-forward as  well.  The basic idea is that</span> <span data-start="14366.935" data-end="14374.891">you will generate a new cookie  called</span> <span data-start="14377.822" data-end="14381.166">_CSRF.  You pass it as a cookie  and embed it into the page that</span> <span data-start="14381.167" data-end="14385.57">is supposed to have form  submission and a hidden input</span> <span data-start="14386.081" data-end="14390.29">field.  When you submit the post request, in this case, you will</span> <span data-start="14390.291" data-end="14394.539">check if the value in the cookie equals the same value that is</span> <span data-start="14394.54" data-end="14397.824">either passed in the request  body and the request query</span> <span data-start="14397.825" data-end="14399.825">parameters or in one of</span> <span data-start="14402.367" data-end="14404.367">the headers like the ones in the</span> <span data-start="14407.161" data-end="14411.379">example which are the wins that  the CSRF library checks for.  In</span> <span data-start="14411.38" data-end="14415.826">that case, that works.  If it's  not the case, it's likely</span> <span data-start="14416.117" data-end="14419.952">someone will perform a CSRF  attack against you.  They are</span> <span data-start="14420.185" data-end="14424.509">not able to read the cookie  since the browser auto-submits</span> <span data-start="14424.665" data-end="14428.603">this, so they will not be able  to pass this as a header.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="14430.456" data-end="14435.406">Let's talk about Sammy.  The  reason is, to first give you</span> <span data-start="14435.751" data-end="14438.283">background about little bobby  tables, if you're not familiar</span> <span data-start="14438.742" data-end="14444.359">with that, it comes from this  comic, which is a joke about</span> <span data-start="14445.587" data-end="14449.81">squill injections who named  their family like a squill</span> <span data-start="14451.067" data-end="14454.955">injections, and the principle  being Mac, because they lost the</span> <span data-start="14455.149" data-end="14458.315">student records because they  were not sanitizing the input.</span> </p>

I would be</span> <span data-start="14462.507" data-end="14465.962">really impressed if someone  knows this by heart.  This is</span> <span data-start="14466.328" data-end="14471.662">the myspace or Sammy worm.  Some of you might be familiar with</span> <span data-start="14471.855" data-end="14478.501">this.

If the access</span> <span data-start="14491.405" data-end="14496.443">code points at your Myspace  profile, that's not smart idea.</span> <span data-start="14496.776" data-end="14500.778">The cool thing about this attack is it shows a couple of things</span> <span data-start="14501.141" data-end="14504.777">that people used to circumvent</span> <span data-start="14510.501" data-end="14513.817">the protection.  One thing they  said is they don't allow script</span> <span data-start="14513.961" data-end="14518.578">tags, didn't allow JavaScript  call-in in URLs and stuff, but</span> <span data-start="14519.059" data-end="14521.059">they did allow in-line</span> <span data-start="14525.598" data-end="14530.702">CSS.  And because he wasn't  allowed to use quotes, he took</span> <span data-start="14530.703" data-end="14536.631">all of his code, wrapped it into an evaland put it into another</span> <span data-start="14536.632" data-end="14538.632">HTML attribute, and that would  be</span> <span data-start="14541.926" data-end="14544.522">evaluated.   They have lists of words,</span> <span data-start="14549.806" data-end="14553.728">like this.       But, what Sammy just did, he</span> <span data-start="14553.729" data-end="14557.908">turned this into strings, split  them by a plus, and recon</span> <span data-start="14565.967" data-end="14569.067">catinated them.  And then  there's the other thing.  You</span> <span data-start="14569.262" data-end="14572.005">say I could block eval, and  that's fine.  Those are all ways</span> <span data-start="14572.902" data-end="14575.753">to evaluate code.  The last one  is from a project that I'm not</span> <span data-start="14576.006" data-end="14579.544">sure if I can name the name,  because I'm not sure if it</span> <span data-start="14580.153" data-end="14585.237">violates a code of conduct, but  talk to Martin, and he can tell</span> <span data-start="14585.448" data-end="14589.117">you the name.

But the</span> <span data-start="14589.118" data-end="14592.393">bottom line is there are a bunch of ways to write the same code</span> <span data-start="14593.086" data-end="14596.483">in JavaScript.

Shout out to Guy from Sneak who actually</span> <span data-start="14654.833" data-end="14657.653">showed this to me.  Let's do  some fun stuff with</span> <span data-start="14662.522" data-end="14664.822">encoding.   This here is literally the same</span> <span data-start="14665.511" data-end="14668.473">as a closing parentheses.  And a colon is</span> <span data-start="14671.505" data-end="14676.127">the same as this.  We don't have the closing pieces anymore, but</span> <span data-start="14676.128" data-end="14680.098">we're getting there.  Now we can use a quirkiness in the browser,</span> <span data-start="14680.099" data-end="14686.239">and actually write this here.   And what this will do, let's</span> <span data-start="14686.24" data-end="14689.068">first try this.  It works.  And  the reason why this works is</span> <span data-start="14689.069" data-end="14694.561">that the browser  —  so first of  all, the HTML sanitizer will see</span> <span data-start="14695.087" data-end="14697.201">this, and it doesn't see</span> <span data-start="14705.025" data-end="14710.896">JavaScript: JavaScript: But I think you</span> <span data-start="14710.897" data-end="14715.21">meant a semi colon, so I'll be a good guy and insert this.  So</span> <span data-start="14715.211" data-end="14719.331">this is valid, and it doesn't  complain about that, and we can</span> <span data-start="14719.508" data-end="14721.508">do anything afterwards.  We've</span> <span data-start="14724.293" data-end="14728.35">seen this work.  The bottom line here is encoding can be</span> <span data-start="14728.624" data-end="14731.79">dangerous.  Don't trust any code that your user</span> <span data-start="14736.702" data-end="14741.365">can modify.   Don't trust CSS.  And Greg just</span> <span data-start="14741.694" data-end="14745.439">tweeted about this two days ago. Really don't trust it.  There's</span> <span data-start="14745.602" data-end="14750.061">a bunch of stuff you can do, and I highly recommend you check out</span> <span data-start="14750.204" data-end="14754.919">the blog post in this tweet.       Let's talk about another</span> <span data-start="14756.331" data-end="14761.661">thing, and that's JSON with  padding.  It's being used less</span> <span data-start="14762.264" data-end="14768.612">these days.  But basically it's  a way to circumvent samor</span> <span data-start="14768.613" data-end="14773.247">general policy.  The way it  works is you define a global</span> <span data-start="14773.248" data-end="14780.708">function.  If you just Jquery's  JSON p method, but it's a call</span> <span data-start="14780.839" data-end="14784.965">function that has to be global,  and you expect the data to be</span> <span data-start="14785.173" data-end="14791.02">passed into the code.  And you  inject a script tag with the J</span> <span data-start="14792.401" data-end="14795.443">son P URL.  You define the name</span> <span data-start="14800.156" data-end="14805.106">of the function in this case,  it's called got post.  It will</span> <span data-start="14805.495" data-end="14808.411">take the name and wrap the data  into a function called with that</span> <span data-start="14808.803" data-end="14815.267">name.  If you use that, but you  write poor JSONP, now this is</span> <span data-start="14815.91" data-end="14821.44">getting fun.  My JSONP end point does not verify what I pass as a</span> <span data-start="14822.187" data-end="14825.419">call-back, and that means that  we can  —  I'm in the wrong</span> <span data-start="14825.42" data-end="14828.969">place.  We can generate  arbitrary JavaScript here, and</span> <span data-start="14829.36" data-end="14832.801">this gets really fun.  I'm going to first show it to you and then</span> <span data-start="14833.018" data-end="14837.806">explain what's going on.  This  is a bit of a longer code</span> <span data-start="14837.93" data-end="14841.251">snippet, so I will copy this.   So I'm going to press this and</span> <span data-start="14841.534" data-end="14845.076">click this button.  And nothing  happens.  But if I refresh the</span> <span data-start="14845.286" data-end="14850.503">page, we get this.  And I can  refresh as many times as I want.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="14850.852" data-end="14856.774">It will stay like this.  The  reason why this is happening, if</span> <span data-start="14856.979" data-end="14862.854">we go to application, I  installed a service worker.  If</span> <span data-start="14863.033" data-end="14866.15">you don't know what service  workers are, they're an API from</span> <span data-start="14866.364" data-end="14870.751">the browser that allows you to  handle the network proxies so</span> <span data-start="14870.924" data-end="14874.513">that you can  —  it's made for  things like offline available</span> <span data-start="14874.732" data-end="14880.606">apps so you can cache your web website and your resources and</span> <span data-start="14881.172" data-end="14883.951">handle which ones you want to  cache and which ones you don't.</span> <span data-start="14884.545" data-end="14888.651">It can do pretty much anything  because it can intercept the</span> <span data-start="14888.783" data-end="14892.743">network requests.  The browsers  are smart enough to be sure a</span> <span data-start="14893.268" data-end="14896.219">service worker can only be  installed from your domain.  But</span> <span data-start="14896.563" data-end="14903.158">if your domain has a vulnerable  JSONP interaction, then you have</span> <span data-start="14903.282" data-end="14907.902">a problem like this.  We can see the call-back parameter here is</span> <span data-start="14912.31" data-end="14917.567">really long.  We can see what's  actually happening.  I'm</span> <span data-start="14918.507" data-end="14921.431">creating a service worker  script.  And the data, I don't</span> <span data-start="14921.554" data-end="14926.707">care about.  I just commented.   We just reply with a hack and a</span> <span data-start="14926.858" data-end="14930.024">script tag injected.  This is an obvious attack, but you could do</span> <span data-start="14930.402" data-end="14934.069">it in a less obvious way as  well.  You could actually fetch</span> <span data-start="14934.217" data-end="14937.755">the page, inject the script tag, and send that to the user, and</span> <span data-start="14937.756" data-end="14942.357">the user will not recognize  this.  Especially not a common</span> <span data-start="14943.115" data-end="14945.63">user with the dev tools to check the service worker</span> <span data-start="14954.902" data-end="14958.282">install? Open that, and you will see how many people actually</span> <span data-start="14958.283" data-end="14962.016">install service workers.  You  have no idea what these service</span> <span data-start="14962.017" data-end="14965.829">workers do.  It's sort of a  dangerous attack.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="14965.83" data-end="14969.028">Let's actually remove this or I  will forget about it.</span> <span data-start="14973.217" data-end="14976.844">Unregister.  If we reload this  now, and you don't want to</span> <span data-start="14977.028" data-end="14980.798">explain your customers, go to  your browser and click on</span> <span data-start="14981.181" data-end="14984.731">application in the dev tools and click on unregister on this</span> <span data-start="14985.174" data-end="14989.281">thing called service worker.       So far we've seen different</span> <span data-start="14989.405" data-end="14993.692">attacks, and we should fix all  of these and also all the other</span> <span data-start="14993.837" data-end="14997.585">attacks that we have in there.   There is a new super hero in</span> <span data-start="14997.771" data-end="15001.955">town that allows you to protect  yourself against some of these,</span> <span data-start="15002.835" data-end="15007.413">and that's called content  security Policy, or CSP.  All</span> <span data-start="15007.766" data-end="15012.012">that I'm doing is injecting an  HTTP header.  We can see if I</span> <span data-start="15012.31" data-end="15014.844">click on any of these, and  refresh, nothing</span> <span data-start="15024.097" data-end="15029.657">happens.  23   —  if we open  this, we will see a bunch of</span> <span data-start="15029.785" data-end="15035.902">errors.  What does that actually mean? Content security policy is</span> <span data-start="15036.092" data-end="15040.812">just an HTTP header that you can define rules that the browser</span> <span data-start="15040.813" data-end="15044.237">should play by for your  resources.  These can be things</span> <span data-start="15044.238" data-end="15050.874">like by default.  For scripts  and styles, I only want the</span> <span data-start="15050.875" data-end="15053.993">things that have the following  non-s.  This can't be hard coded</span> <span data-start="15054.162" data-end="15058.162">by the attacker.   That means no more in line</span> <span data-start="15059.503" data-end="15063.924">scripts unless they have this  HTML attribute, no in line</span> <span data-start="15064.08" data-end="15068.085">styles.  And that's why the  attacks don't work.  And</span> <span data-start="15068.705" data-end="15074.359">blocking objects here, image  source, I'm only specifying</span> <span data-start="15074.689" data-end="15080.248">self, and the user.  I only  allow Google fonts.  I block all</span> <span data-start="15080.639" data-end="15085.447">mixed content, so no HTTP  content on my page.  And I</span> <span data-start="15085.605" data-end="15090.45">specify a report URI, and it  will be pinged with every</span> <span data-start="15090.612" data-end="15093.05">violation.  There are tools you  can point this against.  You can</span> <span data-start="15093.206" data-end="15096.471">point this against any end point on your server, and this will</span> <span data-start="15096.676" data-end="15099.876">report it.  There's a  report-only flag, and that</span> <span data-start="15100.06" data-end="15102.724">allows you to say that you want  to only get the information that</span> <span data-start="15103.075" data-end="15106.113">something has been violated, but you don't block the actual</span> <span data-start="15106.288" data-end="15109.121">content.  This is great for  transitioning into it,</span> <span data-start="15109.258" data-end="15112.079">especially if you want to test  this first in a local</span> <span data-start="15118.01" data-end="15121.503">environment or something.  CSP  should not be your security</span> <span data-start="15121.729" data-end="15125.912">strategy, it should be your  safety net.  Writing of really</span> <span data-start="15126.829" data-end="15131.325">strong CSP is hard, and there's  a great paper by Google about</span> <span data-start="15131.451" data-end="15139.725">this, like about the dangers  about this.  You should still</span> <span data-start="15139.873" data-end="15146.461">care about the attacks.       A couple of other things</span> <span data-start="15146.903" data-end="15151.121">that you should look out for.   You should disallow framing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="15151.424" data-end="15155.524">Most websites don't have a  legitimate reason to be allowing</span> <span data-start="15156.033" data-end="15160.26">to be iframed, what an attacker  can do is place your page with</span> <span data-start="15160.991" data-end="15165.245">an opacity of zero above their  page and line up buttons so that</span> <span data-start="15165.369" data-end="15169.71">they  —  user thinks they're  interacting with their page, but</span> <span data-start="15170.218" data-end="15174.338">they're really interacting with  your page.

And you don't want to</span> <span data-start="15209.608" data-end="15211.608">make their job</span> <span data-start="15215.368" data-end="15219.596">easier.

Don't just assume that it's a</span> <span data-start="15226.591" data-end="15229.915">string.  There are some partial  libraries that will parse things</span> <span data-start="15230.117" data-end="15233.498">like objects as well.  If you do that, the result is that you</span> <span data-start="15233.68" data-end="15237.212">could, for example, have a NoSQL injection.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="15237.213" data-end="15241.765">Other things? Consider security  audits, especially if your code</span> <span data-start="15241.766" data-end="15245.705">base has never had a security  audit.

That's how I learned most of the stuff is</span> <span data-start="15258.846" data-end="15262.288">when I had to go through a  security audit with a feature.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="15263.188" data-end="15266.002">And then stay up to date  with versions.  You don't want</span> <span data-start="15266.767" data-end="15272.888">to be the next Equifax.

[ Applause ]</span> <span data-start="17572.651" data-end="17582.358"Audience member: Hi.  I'm Andy.  And I work at shopify.  Today I'm going to be</span> <span data-start="17582.359" data-end="17586.301">giving you a whirlwind  introduction to TypeScript.  A</span> <span data-start="17586.302" data-end="17589.303">brief disclaimer, most of the  stuff I'm going to talk about</span> <span data-start="17590.224" data-end="17593.5">today is TypeScript-specific,  but TypeScript is not the only</span> <span data-start="17593.749" data-end="17598.696">way to bring types into your  JavaScript.  There are other</span> <span data-start="17599.087" data-end="17601.841">options.  I first started with  flow, and we switched to</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="17602.025" data-end="17604.851">TypeScript at work, so that's  what I do most of the time.  But</span> <span data-start="17605.409" data-end="17609.382">they're all great.       Okay.  So first, I want to</span> <span data-start="17609.383" data-end="17612.466">give you a little bit of why to  use types.  This is probably the</span> <span data-start="17612.609" data-end="17616.936">most important, and then we'll  dive into TypeScript syntax to</span> <span data-start="17617.208" data-end="17620.726">hopefully make it less scary to  get started.  I really want to</span> <span data-start="17621.061" data-end="17623.48">talk about two main reasons that you would want to use types in</span> <span data-start="17624.25" data-end="17628.487">your project.  The first one is  if you're working on a large</span> <span data-start="17628.618" data-end="17632.014">application, as that application grows, it's impossible to keep</span> <span data-start="17632.307" data-end="17634.922">in your own mind everything  that's happening.  If you're</span> <span data-start="17635.246" data-end="17639.934">working on a small library, like maybe the overhead of types is</span> <span data-start="17639.935" data-end="17644.368">overkill.  Be  but if you're  working on a large application,</span> <span data-start="17644.543" data-end="17647.427">it will get to the point that  you can't keep track of all of</span> <span data-start="17647.713" data-end="17649.939">the changes that are happening  to functions or other interfaces</span> <span data-start="17650.127" data-end="17653.827">in your application, but the  compiler can keep track of that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="17654.267" data-end="17658.909">It's like having a super-powered buddy on your team who will keep</span> <span data-start="17659.115" data-end="17660.836">track of everything that's  happening.</span> <span data-start="17660.837" data-end="17663.594">The second thing is that it's  really hard to keep</span> <span data-start="17663.8" data-end="17666.42">documentation up to date,  whether it be comments in your</span> <span data-start="17666.563" data-end="17670.541">code, or whether it be a read me or whatever else.  The nice</span> <span data-start="17670.542" data-end="17673.839">thing about types is they make  your code a little more</span> <span data-start="17674.857" data-end="17677.33">self-documenting.  Since the  compiler is going to be</span> <span data-start="17677.331" data-end="17680.459">enforcing those types, it's a  lot harder to get them out of</span> <span data-start="17680.777" data-end="17683.49">date.  It's definitely possible  and easy to do things that still</span> <span data-start="17683.669" data-end="17686.788">make it hard to understand, but  it's a little bit of a help to</span> <span data-start="17686.958" data-end="17689.462">make your code easier to jump  into.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="17689.463" data-end="17694.098">All right.  So, basic types. We're going to start going</span> <span data-start="17694.099" data-end="17697.785">pretty fast through syntax here  to give an overview.  So here is</span> <span data-start="17697.934" data-end="17704.736">like sort of a hello_world of  primitive types in TypeScript.</span> <span data-start="17705.115" data-end="17708.883">It looks like normal JavaScript, but you have a colon and the</span> <span data-start="17708.884" data-end="17712.131">name of a type, which is how  you're going to annotate your</span> <span data-start="17712.655" data-end="17715.074">variables.  That actually isn't  necessary a lot of the time.  I</span> <span data-start="17715.792" data-end="17719.038">more often than not don't have  to add explicit annotations to</span> <span data-start="17719.33" data-end="17724.413">my code, because TypeScript is  very good at inferring what I</span> <span data-start="17724.705" data-end="17726.687">mean.       You can also see here, this</span> <span data-start="17726.688" data-end="17730.203">is where the benefit starts  coming in.  This screen shot is</span> <span data-start="17730.688" data-end="17735.442">from visual studio code, but  it's a reflex of the error that</span> <span data-start="17736.444" data-end="17740.698">the compiler is putting out.   You can see it has a red</span> <span data-start="17741.532" data-end="17748.243">squiggly, because the it doesn't have the call.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="17748.513" data-end="17751.65">Arrays.  You have an annotation. You put square brackets after it</span> <span data-start="17751.984" data-end="17756.333">to say that it's an array.  I  have this array of foods, and if</span> <span data-start="17756.491" data-end="17760.029">I initialize it to these  strings, it's happy.  If I push</span> <span data-start="17760.03" data-end="17765.093">in a new string, it's still  happy.  But if I were to try to</span> <span data-start="17765.094" data-end="17771.091">initialize it, or push in a  bollion, it would complain and I</span> <span data-start="17771.53" data-end="17774.846">would have to fix that.  So your functions, you will be inporting</span> <span data-start="17775.197" data-end="17778.817">them all over your application.  Those were contrived examples,</span> <span data-start="17778.818" data-end="17782.26">because you can look at your  variables three or four lines</span> <span data-start="17782.261" data-end="17784.911">above.  But a function, this is  where you're going to be able to</span> <span data-start="17785.054" data-end="17788.3">catch things across your  application as you import</span> <span data-start="17788.443" data-end="17791.348">things.  You can see here that I typed my parameter with that</span> <span data-start="17791.349" data-end="17794.072">same annotation.  There's  another annotation after the</span> <span data-start="17794.241" data-end="17797.48">arguments list, which is the  return type.  And then we just</span> <span data-start="17797.974" data-end="17803.709">write normal JavaScript on the  inside.  If I pass race car, it</span> <span data-start="17803.71" data-end="17810.866">will be happy, but bullion, it  will complain.  It is smart at</span> <span data-start="17811.187" data-end="17814.436">figuring out what return types  are, so you can omit the return</span> <span data-start="17814.629" data-end="17817.222">type if you don't want to do so  much typing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="17817.355" data-end="17819.355">All right.</span> <span data-start="17825.32" data-end="17828.218">Unions.  This is something that  I use all the time.  It's like</span> <span data-start="17828.219" data-end="17832.662">an or.  I want to say that a  vegetable can be a broccoli or a</span> <span data-start="17833.506" data-end="17837.289">carrot.  Fruit can be any of  these fruits.  And I use unions</span> <span data-start="17837.29" data-end="17841.461">with types.  I can say an  ingredient for this restaurant</span> <span data-start="17841.462" data-end="17844.76">is going to be a vegetable or a  truth,</span> <span data-start="17853.526" data-end="17856.156">fruit.   If I try to make this sludge</span> <span data-start="17856.557" data-end="17861.021">drink out of bread and bacon, it will not be happy because it's</span> <span data-start="17863.106" data-end="17866.716">neither a vegetable or a fruit.  Interfaces.  This is how you</span> <span data-start="17867.317" data-end="17871.34">type objects.  This looks a lot  like plain object notation.  You</span> <span data-start="17872.032" data-end="17874.918">have a colon, and instead of the value, you put your type name.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="17875.117" data-end="17877.799">You also can use all of these  other features inside of your</span> <span data-start="17878.551" data-end="17881.865">interfaces.  So here we have a  union between a bunch of</span> <span data-start="17882.075" data-end="17884.866">animals.  You can have your  favorite.  You can make it</span> <span data-start="17885.098" data-end="17888.313">optional by allowing nulls, and  TypeScript will help you check</span> <span data-start="17888.487" data-end="17891.349">null before you access the  values or anything like that.</span> <span data-start="17891.656" data-end="17895.761">All right.  So most of my  day I spend writing React, and</span> <span data-start="17895.898" data-end="17900.057">that is where TypeScript really  shines for me.  I like it when</span> <span data-start="17900.058" data-end="17904.25">I'm writing plain TypeScript,  but for React components, I</span> <span data-start="17904.251" data-end="17913.297">think it's the bees' knees.  If  you use the prop types package,</span> <span data-start="17913.298" data-end="17917.092">this probably looks familiar toe you.  In prop types, you have to</span> <span data-start="17917.905" data-end="17923.221">declare your types.  You get  more help from the compiler.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="17923.222" data-end="17926.484">You don't have to include the  prop types package.  All of this</span> <span data-start="17926.889" data-end="17931.714">gets stripped out at compile  time, and you ship a smaller</span> <span data-start="17931.909" data-end="17934.795">bundle, a little bit.  So just  to walk through this, we have</span> <span data-start="17935.2" data-end="17938.956">our props.  We're going to have  one prop called size that</span> <span data-start="17939.122" data-end="17943.729">accepts small, medium, or large. And then we just pass it into</span> <span data-start="17943.962" data-end="17946.668">our component as usual.  And you can see here that inside my</span> <span data-start="17946.992" data-end="17951.304">component, I have very little  TypeScript-specific syntax.  It</span> <span data-start="17951.305" data-end="17954.968">really looks pretty much like  normal JavaScript.  And this is</span> <span data-start="17954.969" data-end="17959.292">what it looks like to use that.  I import my icon component, and</span> <span data-start="17959.293" data-end="17963.229">if I don't give props,  TypeScript will complain because</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="17963.23" data-end="17967.275">I told it to expect props.  Here if I give it size, it can</span> <span data-start="17967.459" data-end="17970.796">suggest to me what the props  should be.  This is nice when</span> <span data-start="17970.797" data-end="17973.595">you're using a design system,  because you can know exactly</span> <span data-start="17973.596" data-end="17978.62">what the values are supposed to  be.  This is the VS code</span> <span data-start="17978.946" data-end="17982.403">interface, and when you run the  compiler, it gives this exact</span> <span data-start="17982.404" data-end="17985.978">suggestion where it will list  what it's expecting.  If I give</span> <span data-start="17985.979" data-end="17990.194">it something that it's  expecting, it will be happy and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="17990.425" data-end="17994.162">I can compile my code.  I hope  that has made TypeScript a</span> <span data-start="17994.395" data-end="17996.395">little less mysterious.

But you</span> <span data-start="18241.414" data-end="18245.172">wouldn't hire me to build a  website for you.  Unless you're</span> <span data-start="18245.321" data-end="18249.427">my mom.  If you did, you would  get sub par results.  What I</span> <span data-start="18249.832" data-end="18252.395">realized through all of my time  working with UI, is that the</span> <span data-start="18252.713" data-end="18256.061">best user experience is no UI at all.  So let me talk about that</span> <span data-start="18256.203" data-end="18259.412">for a second.  UI is a middle  man.  It's a conversation.  It's</span> <span data-start="18261.377" data-end="18264.86">pre-canned.  It has boundaries.  We try to code for the simplest</span> <span data-start="18265.264" data-end="18268.673">possible scenario to get a user  through the process, or all the</span> <span data-start="18269.54" data-end="18273.747">processes in the world! Right?  And so we could improve upon</span> <span data-start="18273.908" data-end="18282.125">this UX probably a little bit.   There's been great feats of UXG.</span> </p>

The reason we have UI and wonderful buttons</span> <span data-start="18291.329" data-end="18295.673">and sliders is historically, we  haven't been able to talk to</span> <span data-start="18295.85" data-end="18299.877">computers  —  until now.  Natural language processing is the field</span> <span data-start="18299.878" data-end="18303.357">of computing that deals with not just speech recognition but</span> <span data-start="18303.647" data-end="18308.578">extracting a user's intent from  what they just said.  We have</span> <span data-start="18308.723" data-end="18315.606">Alexa, Cortona, Google home,  okay Google or Google assistant</span> <span data-start="18315.827" data-end="18318.431">or whatever you call that thing. A lot of people have these.  I</span> <span data-start="18318.766" data-end="18323.619">will give you three examples of  how no UI is better than a UI.</span> </p>

So</span> <span data-start="18423.605" data-end="18431.222">the question now is, is UI as we know it dead? The answer is no.</span> </p>

But</span> <span data-start="18633.639" data-end="18639.998">one of the creators, John McKay, has given a talk last year</span> <span data-start="18640.584" data-end="18645.84">talking about the whole journey  of the Tessel team.

There you go.  Now we're</span> <span data-start="18734.777" data-end="18738.467">talking.  All righty.  Let's  talk about a bunch more</span> <span data-start="18738.608" data-end="18740.608">interesting stuff like</span> <span data-start="18749.417" data-end="18752.772">JavaScript.  Babel announced  they were running JavaScript on</span> <span data-start="18753.043" data-end="18756.812">their watches, and they didn't  stop until they could get</span> <span data-start="18760.848" data-end="18764.504">JavaScript running and  efficient.  230 lines of code</span> <span data-start="18764.645" data-end="18770.392">versus 39 lines of JavaScript  over the UI of a smart watch.</span> <span data-start="18770.957" data-end="18774.695">And when they went defunct last  year, they got bought out by fit</span> <span data-start="18775.547" data-end="18780.086">bit, and my watch is running  JavaScript on the UI.  You can</span> <span data-start="18780.585" data-end="18783.846">create apps for your watch on  JavaScript.  But we need to get</span> <span data-start="18784.067" data-end="18789.285">smaller.  These are pretty  capable chips.  How about</span> <span data-start="18789.491" data-end="18792.17">putting JavaScript on a  microcontroler like this? Have</span> <span data-start="18792.749" data-end="18796.175">you ever played with this  before? This is an 8 bit</span> <span data-start="18796.514" data-end="18800.291">processor.  It literally has  2,56 o</span> <span data-start="18804.095" data-end="18809.088">bytes of memory.  It holds 30K  of flash.  And you can do stuff</span> <span data-start="18809.089" data-end="18816.04">like put space invaders on it.   How? There are bunches of way.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="18816.041" data-end="18819.227">Usually you use some C</span> <span data-start="18823.104" data-end="18826.977">+ + to code it.  It's a good  thing, and you just mentioned</span> <span data-start="18827.109" data-end="18831.485">flow.  It uses flow to infer  your types and stuff.  I don't</span> <span data-start="18832.165" data-end="18836.213">have time to explain it.  But  come up to me and try it</span> <span data-start="18836.44" data-end="18839.154">yourself.  Because that's all  the games you will be make</span> <span data-start="18839.345" data-end="18842.703">willing be just JavaScript, you  can just put them on to the web</span> <span data-start="18842.936" data-end="18845.701">and play them.  And after you  played them, you can compile</span> <span data-start="18846.05" data-end="18848.05">them and put them on to devices</span> <span data-start="18852.096" data-end="18856.502">like this one.  This is a  JavaScript game running on a</span> <span data-start="18856.894" data-end="18865.418">microcontroler, with hardware  that has 8 bit 16 megaHertz</span> <span data-start="18865.541" data-end="18870.658">processor.  Or you can use this  one.  It's a tiny arcade box</span> <span data-start="18870.848" data-end="18876.488">that you can play with.  Why is  that interesting? Because this</span> <span data-start="18876.664" data-end="18878.982">is just JavaScript as you are  writing.  And you can check</span> <span data-start="18879.635" data-end="18883.179">that, because I have some links  up.  If you go to this with your</span> <span data-start="18883.18" data-end="18886.554">computer or laptop, actually,  you can play the exact same game</span> <span data-start="18887.525" data-end="18891.576">that gets compiled down to the  microcontroler.  And we have</span> <span data-start="18891.747" data-end="18894.829">space invaders if you're into  that kind of stuff.  And we have</span> <span data-start="18894.974" data-end="18898.825">a workshop.

Our next talk</span> <span data-start="18962.649" data-end="18964.649">is from Martin, and he's going</span> <span data-start="18969.048" data-end="18973.532">to be talking about accessible  customizable selects, and it's</span> <span data-start="18974.029" data-end="18975.894">probably harder than you  thought.</span> <span data-start="18975.895" data-end="18977.895"Audience member: Hi.  Okay.  This is</span> <span data-start="18980.037" data-end="18984.219">working? Great.  Welcome to my  presentation about accessible</span> <span data-start="18988.198" data-end="18991.26">customizable select.  My name is Martin, and I work as a</span> <span data-start="18996.717" data-end="19000.017">front-end developer for a  company.  Let me address the</span> <span data-start="19000.191" data-end="19005.656">elephant in the room.  Why  another JavaScript? Isn't it the</span> <span data-start="19005.791" data-end="19010.943">first rule that we should always use the native whenever</span> <span data-start="19011.466" data-end="19015.22">possible? True.  However, the  native thought is hard to style</span> <span data-start="19015.383" data-end="19019.894">using CSS.  This forces us to  create our own custom</span> <span data-start="19020.204" data-end="19023.522">implementations, and we need to  reimplement the accessibility</span> <span data-start="19023.679" data-end="19028.294">into it as well.  And I'm not  talking about high enough</span> <span data-start="19028.813" data-end="19030.813">contrast and large enough fonts. What I mean</span> <span data-start="19033.701" data-end="19037.049">is supporting assistive  technologies, such as the screen</span> <span data-start="19037.878" data-end="19042.992">readers used by the visually  impaired.  And there must be</span> <span data-start="19042.993" data-end="19046.105">plenty of existing solutions out there? Well, I have looked</span> <span data-start="19050.191" data-end="19054.28">into them.  I have reviewed  existing solutions provided by</span> <span data-start="19057.528" data-end="19061.883">various companies and various  techniques.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="19061.884" data-end="19064.333">Unfortunately, there were  issues.  For example, the</span> <span data-start="19065.412" data-end="19067.651">implementation provided by  Google as part of the polymer</span> <span data-start="19068.161" data-end="19076.074">project is not compatible with  JAWS and square key when using</span> <span data-start="19076.22" data-end="19079.504">voiceover screen readers.  How  can we use such a solution? We</span> <span data-start="19079.715" data-end="19086.283">cannot.  On the other hand,  there's implementation by Jquery</span> <span data-start="19087.003" data-end="19090.799">UI, which is buggy and remains  completely silent when used with</span> <span data-start="19091.492" data-end="19093.814">voiceover.  So how can we use  such a solution? We</span> <span data-start="19099.39" data-end="19102.417">cannot.  We were looking for a  solution that could be</span> <span data-start="19102.418" data-end="19106.171">integrated into any project  regardless of its front end</span> <span data-start="19106.312" data-end="19109.992">technology.  But of course,  accessibility was the top line</span> <span data-start="19110.219" data-end="19112.58">priority.  What do I mean? We  were looking for a solution that</span> <span data-start="19113.126" data-end="19115.19">works regardless of the  operating system the user may be</span> <span data-start="19117.734" data-end="19124.998">using.  With slight reservation  when it comes to Linux,</span> <span data-start="19125.821" data-end="19128.756">assistive technologies is not as great as it's going to be.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="19128.757" data-end="19132.805">Next, we must support all of the commonly used browsers,</span> <span data-start="19133.334" data-end="19139.386">including internet explorer 11.  If the technologies used by the</span> <span data-start="19139.572" data-end="19144.883">solution would be available for  up to I8.  Support for all major</span> <span data-start="19145.011" data-end="19149.335">screen readers used around the  world is a must.  And of course,</span> <span data-start="19149.336" data-end="19157.36">we cannot forget about the  myriad of keyboard shortcuts.</span> <span data-start="19157.361" data-end="19161.188">Don't worry.  We don't have to  consider all of these</span> <span data-start="19161.588" data-end="19165.384">combinations and all of these  technologies equally, since</span> <span data-start="19166.63" data-end="19168.84">there are combinations that are  recommended by the providers and</span> <span data-start="19169.365" data-end="19172.511">vendors of these assistive  technologies.  It doesn't mean</span> <span data-start="19172.512" data-end="19178.023">we can ignore the rest.  We just need to make sure that these</span> <span data-start="19178.024" data-end="19180.606">work really well.  On the other  hand, there are combinations</span> <span data-start="19181.025" data-end="19183.025">that are just not compatible at  all.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="19186.053" data-end="19191.661">For example, the JAWS screen  reader is incompatible with the</span> <span data-start="19191.662" data-end="19194.851">Edge browser.  I'm told this is  being fixed.</span> <span data-start="19194.852" data-end="19198.798">All of this has taken us on  several months of a journey in</span> <span data-start="19199.033" data-end="19202.202">which we were testing and  prototyping, and we made quite a</span> <span data-start="19202.203" data-end="19208.091">couple of findings.   Accessibility supporting</span> <span data-start="19208.092" data-end="19213.392">browsers could be improved.  And support for aria, which is used</span> <span data-start="19214.28" data-end="19218.797">to make our websites more  accessible is implemented by</span> <span data-start="19219.654" data-end="19223.816">assistive technologies, not  browsers, inconsistently.  This</span> <span data-start="19224.135" data-end="19226.922">makes situations where you are  prototyping and testing a</span> <span data-start="19227.163" data-end="19231.919">solution.  It seems to work fine with one assistive technology.</span> <span data-start="19231.92" data-end="19234.812">And things completely break  apart.  After a moment, you will</span> <span data-start="19236.22" data-end="19240.018">begin to feel like Alice in  wonderland.  Things just don't</span> <span data-start="19242.648" data-end="19247.12">make any sense.       This is me right here.</span> <span data-start="19247.121" data-end="19251.131">Anyway.  There are some positive sides about this.  For example,</span> <span data-start="19251.616" data-end="19257.225">once you put accessibility into  the mix, the Android and iOS</span> <span data-start="19257.226" data-end="19260.977">platform are pretty much the  same.  Throughout all of this, I</span> <span data-start="19261.232" data-end="19266.207">have been reminded of a quote by Steve Jobs.  Yes, he's more</span> <span data-start="19266.567" data-end="19270.721">handsome than me.  Great things  are never done by one person in</span> <span data-start="19270.722" data-end="19275.462">business.  They are done by a  team of people.  Similarly, to</span> <span data-start="19275.748" data-end="19278.887">achieve great accessibility, we  cannot rely on just a single</span> <span data-start="19279.396" data-end="19282.068">technique.  We will need to find a combination of techniques that</span> <span data-start="19282.387" data-end="19286.562">will work well together.  Well,  have we found such a solution?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="19290.204" data-end="19294.004">I'm happy to tell you that,  indeed, we have.  We were able</span> <span data-start="19294.005" data-end="19300.238">to design a solution that adapts and works very well with all the</span> <span data-start="19300.594" data-end="19304.351">compatible combinations of these major technologyes.

<p><span data-start="19938.215" data-end="19942.348">But not so much about why hack  your future is.  So hack your</span> <span data-start="19942.478" data-end="19945.783">future was founded by a couple  of people who thought, well,</span> <span data-start="19946.006" data-end="19951.145">there's a growing group of  refugees coming to our country.</span> <span data-start="19951.395" data-end="19955.349">And they actually have a lot of  trouble entering the job market</span> <span data-start="19955.824" data-end="19958.602">because they won't have the  right backgrounds.  They'll have</span> <span data-start="19958.902" data-end="19961.792">language barriers.  Maybe  there's discrimination issues</span> <span data-start="19962.033" data-end="19966.982">going on.  How can we prevent  these people from becoming</span> <span data-start="19967.152" data-end="19969.885">marginalized in our society.  So they funded hack your future,</span> <span data-start="19970.096" data-end="19972.999">because they decided what's the  best way to empower people and</span> <span data-start="19973.169" data-end="19979.233">the best way to get them jobs:  One of the best ways is to teach</span> <span data-start="19979.366" data-end="19983.03">them web development skills.   There's a lot of demand for web</span> <span data-start="19983.374" data-end="19986.048">development skills.  It allows  you to go into various different</span> <span data-start="19986.705" data-end="19989.966">paths, as you all know.  We  thought, well, how can we do</span> <span data-start="19990.119" data-end="19995.065">that? We came up with an idea of setting up a volunteer program</span> <span data-start="19995.066" data-end="19998.697">where volunteers teach refugees  every Sunday for about four</span> <span data-start="19999.249" data-end="20002.746">hours.  We have interactive  sessions with them.  And then</span> <span data-start="20002.884" data-end="20005.602">they spend about 20 hours  working on home work</span> <span data-start="20005.938" data-end="20009.731">assignments.  And they hand in  their homework on GitHub.  And</span> <span data-start="20009.901" data-end="20013.723">we interact with them throughout with week on Slack.  So they</span> <span data-start="20014.223" data-end="20017.356">have support for the whole week. We teach them basic skills.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="20017.478" data-end="20022.266">First we start off with HTMLHTML CSS, because they have virtually</span> <span data-start="20022.267" data-end="20027.599">no technical skills coming in,  and that's an easy way to enter</span> <span data-start="20027.6" data-end="20031.054">the field.  Then we spend nine  weeks on the basics of</span> <span data-start="20031.055" data-end="20033.53">programming through JavaScript,  which I had a lot of pleasure in</span> <span data-start="20034.359" data-end="20039.5">teaching them.   They're super-motivated, so it</span> <span data-start="20040.178" data-end="20043.13">goes faster than with my  students at the university.  And</span> <span data-start="20043.242" data-end="20047.271">after  —  at the end of those six months, they work on a project</span> <span data-start="20047.272" data-end="20050.319">and they actually develop  something themselves.  They</span> <span data-start="20050.659" data-end="20052.706">often choose to develop  something that will benefit</span> <span data-start="20053.774" data-end="20056.342">other refugees, which is really  awesome.  And alongside that</span> <span data-start="20056.811" data-end="20060.931">program, we also teach seminars  on how to conduct yourself in</span> <span data-start="20060.932" data-end="20066.713">job interviews.  How to make a  good LinkedIn profile, you know?</span> <span data-start="20067.251" data-end="20072.541">Basic skills that you might also want, and things that are quite</span> <span data-start="20072.96" data-end="20076.431">different in the Netherlands as  opposed to, for instance, Syria.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="20076.772" data-end="20083.745">So yeah, that's the way that we  set it up.  So what have we</span> <span data-start="20084.027" data-end="20087.304">achieved? We have about 55  students that have found jobs at</span> <span data-start="20087.765" data-end="20093.353">companies such as KPMG,  booking.com, and KLM.  I guess</span> <span data-start="20093.524" data-end="20097.38">that's the main thing that we've achieved.  But we also have an</span> <span data-start="20097.74" data-end="20104.217">active network of students, men  20Rs,   —  mentors and alumni.</span> <span data-start="20104.476" data-end="20107.432">They're all in the Slack group,  and they help each other out</span> <span data-start="20107.578" data-end="20113.131">with anything from finding good  companies to apply it, to how to</span> <span data-start="20113.387" data-end="20118.61">cycle through the snow in the  Netherlands when winter comes.</span> <span data-start="20119.046" data-end="20123.977">And we've also achieved 100% up  time for the past two years, and</span> <span data-start="20124.382" data-end="20127.798">who can really say that about  any program they're running.  We</span> <span data-start="20128.17" data-end="20135.273">also have new chapters in  Copenhagenen, London, and more.</span> <span data-start="20135.384" data-end="20142.603">People have started copying our  project.  Hopefully it leads to</span> <span data-start="20143.307" data-end="20145.323">a better future.       So I also have a quote.</span> <span data-start="20145.673" data-end="20150.676">It's not by Steve Jobs.  It's by one of our students, Jack.  He</span> <span data-start="20150.944" data-end="20155.909">says that his main take-aways  from the program were to  —  how</span> <span data-start="20156.086" data-end="20159.798">to think like a programmer, how  to work in a team, and most</span> <span data-start="20160.099" data-end="20163.854">importantly, that people can  still treat him for the person</span> <span data-start="20163.98" data-end="20169.956">that he is and not the way that  he might be seen.  Which I think</span> <span data-start="20170.244" data-end="20173.451">is a very important thing for  these students coming to us,</span> <span data-start="20173.651" data-end="20177.724">because as soon as they enter  our doors, they stop being a</span> <span data-start="20178.141" data-end="20180.433">refugee and they start being a  student.  We just treat them</span> <span data-start="20180.56" data-end="20184.559">like that, and we don't really  talk about their backgrounds at</span> <span data-start="20184.737" data-end="20188.339">all.  We treat them as students  and we say this is your</span> <span data-start="20188.943" data-end="20192.93">homework.  You have to deliver  on it.  We will be supportive</span> <span data-start="20193.11" data-end="20196.731">and try to help you with any  issue, but you have to deliver.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="20197.065" data-end="20200.389">So, actually, the point of  this talk is not to tell you how</span> <span data-start="20201.198" data-end="20205.042">awesome it is that I work at  this program, that I volunteer,</span> <span data-start="20205.043" data-end="20209.177">or how good this program is.  I  actually want all of you to</span> <span data-start="20209.731" data-end="20213.533">start copying this idea, and to  set up a hack your future of</span> <span data-start="20213.739" data-end="20218.427">your own.  I think it's one of  the best ways to empower people.</span> <span data-start="20218.72" data-end="20223.195">So how can you do that? You'll  need a couple of ingredients.</span> <span data-start="20223.306" data-end="20226.243">First off, a convenient  location.  It's important that</span> <span data-start="20226.606" data-end="20232.045">people can actually reach your  location.  And a lot of these</span> <span data-start="20232.493" data-end="20235.078">people will be in camps, and  they might not have a lot of</span> <span data-start="20235.225" data-end="20237.537">money or means of  transportation.  So that's</span> <span data-start="20237.77" data-end="20240.961">important that you find a good  location.  Secondly, you'll need</span> <span data-start="20241.122" data-end="20245.53">some laptops.  They don't need  to be start of the art.  It's</span> <span data-start="20245.701" data-end="20249.763">better if developers don't have  state of the art laptops so they</span> <span data-start="20249.896" data-end="20254.604">learn to develop for old people. You'll need a program director,</span> <span data-start="20254.895" data-end="20258.024">or better yet, a team of people  prepared to think about the hard</span> <span data-start="20258.025" data-end="20261.004">challenges that you might face  to get everybody together.  We</span> <span data-start="20261.184" data-end="20267.2">can help you a bit with that.   You'll need mentors, and it</span> <span data-start="20267.37" data-end="20271.563">seems like it might be difficult to find people to volunteer,</span> <span data-start="20271.735" data-end="20275.327">especially on a Sunday.  But  we've found that there's an</span> <span data-start="20275.478" data-end="20278.443">abundance of mentors.  People  are happy to help.  There are</span> <span data-start="20278.59" data-end="20281.661">people from universities.   There's people from companies.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="20282.132" data-end="20285.142">There's people from any place  you can think of.  A lot of</span> <span data-start="20285.482" data-end="20288.543">people with diverse backgrounds  like to help out as well.  So we</span> <span data-start="20288.919" data-end="20293.141">have a very diverse group of  mentors helping out.  And</span> <span data-start="20293.317" data-end="20298.471">students, of course.  This is  the most important part.  It</span> <span data-start="20298.748" data-end="20302.066">might not be as easy as finding  the mentors, because you need to</span> <span data-start="20302.183" data-end="20305.774">find people that have basic  English skills, first.  That's</span> <span data-start="20306.258" data-end="20309.463">our minimum requirement.  But we also want them to be very</span> <span data-start="20309.899" data-end="20312.726">motivated.  So we actually have  them do a little test before</span> <span data-start="20313.18" data-end="20315.372">they're allowed to join our  program.  And it's about</span> <span data-start="20315.86" data-end="20318.006">learning a skill on your own.   So they have to prove that they</span> <span data-start="20318.125" data-end="20320.833">can do that within a certain  amount of time.  And it's a task</span> <span data-start="20321.211" data-end="20326.041">that really anybody can  complete, as long as they're</span> <span data-start="20326.367" data-end="20328.308">motivated.       I guess a lot of people will</span> <span data-start="20328.309" data-end="20331.487">ask, how do you get financial  support? You don't need that</span> <span data-start="20331.648" data-end="20335.811">much money.  It's nice if some  companies help out and donate</span> <span data-start="20336.301" data-end="20340.298">old laptops.  It's nice in the  municipality helps out with the</span> <span data-start="20340.459" data-end="20345.218">rent a bit or gets you a  location.  But ultimately, this</span> <span data-start="20345.902" data-end="20348.645">is definitely something that you can overcome.  You would be</span> <span data-start="20348.773" data-end="20352.053">surprised at how many people  want to help if you have a good</span> <span data-start="20352.329" data-end="20354.477">idea.       Of course you also need a</span> <span data-start="20354.631" data-end="20357.192">curriculum.  This is something  that can be very difficult to</span> <span data-start="20357.193" data-end="20360.918">set up, but we've already done  it for you.  So I'll show you a</span> <span data-start="20361.078" data-end="20364.285">link on our curriculum.  It's  just something on GitHub.  It's</span> <span data-start="20364.526" data-end="20367.335">just a list of topics that we  think is good to talk about.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="20367.556" data-end="20374.468">But of course you can set up  your own way of doing it.  So,</span> <span data-start="20374.661" data-end="20376.661">how would you do this? Just</span> <span data-start="20378.895" data-end="20384.791">like JSConf, you can say I like  this idea and I want to do it in</span> <span data-start="20384.968" data-end="20387.888">my city.  So you fork the  project, and if you want to know</span> <span data-start="20387.889" data-end="20389.889">how to get started, you</span> <span data-start="20393.205" data-end="20396.351">go to start code school, and  there will be lots of tips and</span> <span data-start="20396.352" data-end="20399.113">documents and a set-up for a  code of conduct.</span> <span data-start="20399.114" data-end="20403.257">There will be an article about  how to deal with students who</span> <span data-start="20404.084" data-end="20407.578">have some trouble with staying  in the country.  There will be</span> <span data-start="20407.869" data-end="20413.183">some tips on how to conduct  yourself as a teacher.  So, we</span> <span data-start="20413.343" data-end="20415.343">strive to share all of the  knowledge that we already have</span> <span data-start="20415.54" data-end="20420.603">here.  And we also have links to all of the resources that we</span> <span data-start="20420.969" data-end="20422.692">use.       If you need some more help,</span> <span data-start="20422.693" data-end="20428.576">you can talk to me on Slack.  I  think there should be a space</span> <span data-start="20429.199" data-end="20437.155">between Laurens and Aarnoudse,  which is a very dutch name.  I</span> <span data-start="20437.356" data-end="20440.461">will be around for these two  days, and I like to work</span> <span data-start="20440.637" data-end="20443.886">together with you and to create  a better future.  Thank</span> <span data-start="20452" data-end="20456.075"Audience member: Thank you so much for that  talk.  I hope someone  —  I don't</span> <span data-start="20456.761" data-end="20459.905">know, maybe me can bring that to New York.  That would be</span> <span data-start="20460.093" data-end="20466.319">awesome.  Anyway, our next talk  is from Kristjan.  He's going to</span> <span data-start="20466.32" data-end="20469.819">be talking about something cool  that GitHub</span> <span data-start="20474.14" data-end="20478.379">could do.      >> Hello.  Oh my God, I can't</span> <span data-start="20478.606" data-end="20484.034">see my speaker notes.  That's  fine.  Hey.  I work at GitHub,</span> <span data-start="20485.434" data-end="20489.145">but this talk isn't about me as  an engineer at GitHub.  It's</span> <span data-start="20489.277" data-end="20491.277">more of a</span> <span data-start="20496.982" data-end="20500.624">user.  Before I started at  GitHub, I would have these ideas</span> <span data-start="20502.079" data-end="20507.034">like, I wish GitHub could do  this one thing.  And I would</span> <span data-start="20507.035" data-end="20510.424">write Chrome extensions to do  these things.  But there's some</span> <span data-start="20510.425" data-end="20513.433">things  —  there they are!  There's some stuff that I</span> <span data-start="20513.545" data-end="20515.545">couldn't do as Chrome</span> <span data-start="20517.66" data-end="20524.322">extensions.  For those things,  I've recently discovered this</span> <span data-start="20524.491" data-end="20529.521">library.  This is not the right  clicker.  There you go.  It's</span> <span data-start="20529.711" data-end="20533.121">called pro BOT, and it's a  library for GitHub to write</span> <span data-start="20533.496" data-end="20538.002">these GitHub applications.  And  pro BOT does this by leveraging</span> <span data-start="20538.495" data-end="20544.146">web hooks and the GitHub API to  give you the power to extend</span> <span data-start="20544.327" data-end="20546.327">guilt hub in a</span> <span data-start="20547.872" data-end="20554.667"> —  GitHub in a simple way.  If  something happens to GitHub,</span> <span data-start="20555.052" data-end="20558.062">proBOT gets a ping, and it will  analyze what to do in the</span> <span data-start="20558.768" data-end="20563.191">situation, and maybe fire off  events of its own.  I have a</span> <span data-start="20563.192" data-end="20567.329">little trivial example.  If we  want to respond to every issue</span> <span data-start="20567.33" data-end="20571.56">opened in our repository, and  let's just say hello.  A</span> <span data-start="20571.561" data-end="20575.514">welcoming message.   We're going to build it right</span> <span data-start="20575.647" data-end="20583.96">now.  We have this module, and  it takes in probot as an</span> <span data-start="20584.134" data-end="20587.626">argument or parameter.  We can  attach event listeners on the</span> <span data-start="20587.75" data-end="20593.718">robot.  There's a list on the  GitHub documentation page for</span> <span data-start="20593.963" data-end="20597.204">what you can listen to.  You're  listening to if there's any</span> <span data-start="20597.688" data-end="20600.341">events opened.  We get this  context with it.  With the</span> <span data-start="20600.572" data-end="20603.621">context, we can create a  comment.  This is kind of</span> <span data-start="20603.942" data-end="20606.494">confusing, and I didn't  understand this at first.  But</span> <span data-start="20606.685" data-end="20610.786">it just gives you an object back that operates in the context of</span> <span data-start="20611" data-end="20616.783">this issue.  And we just give it the body for the issue.  And</span> <span data-start="20626.73" data-end="20631.758">then just using GitHub API, it's easy.  Create this comment.  We</span> <span data-start="20632.034" data-end="20636.218">can run this.  And every time  someone opens up an issue where</span> <span data-start="20636.374" data-end="20640.867">this probot is installed, it  will respond, thanks for</span> <span data-start="20654.271" data-end="20656.836">the issue.  There's a bunch of  these BOTs out there.  Sometimes</span> <span data-start="20657.417" data-end="20661.035">they will close down the issues  when nobody has commented the</span> <span data-start="20661.036" data-end="20663.825">issue.   for some days, and I  have a problem that I really</span> <span data-start="20663.826" data-end="20672.303">want it to solve with probot.   And it is related to ES lent.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="20674.148" data-end="20677.539">I don't know if everybody here  uses it, but I almost always use</span> <span data-start="20678.114" data-end="20682.522">it.  It will run in a build.   And if someone broke an ES lent</span> <span data-start="20682.523" data-end="20689.701">rule, it will give you like a  red status.  There's just one</span> <span data-start="20689.702" data-end="20693.019">problem with this: People can  just disable the rules right</span> <span data-start="20693.02" data-end="20698.767">there in the code.  So this is a project that I have where</span> <span data-start="20699.89" data-end="20705.037">somebody disabled the rules and  did whatever they wanted.  I</span> <span data-start="20705.251" data-end="20707.834">understand that people need to  get stuff done.  They're like, I</span> <span data-start="20708.01" data-end="20715.194">don't know how to do this.  I  know how to use JQuery show.  I</span> <span data-start="20715.503" data-end="20718.673">don't know how to show and hide  things.  I maybe would want it</span> <span data-start="20719.053" data-end="20723.059">to focus that you shouldn't do  this.  Or, like, ping me and I</span> <span data-start="20723.246" data-end="20727.882">can explain how to do it  correctly.  So, like, this</span> <span data-start="20728.323" data-end="20731.461">previous one, it just goes  through and everything is green,</span> <span data-start="20731.582" data-end="20733.582">people</span> <span data-start="20735.076" data-end="20739.197">are great.  I, like I said, I  would like for these to be</span> <span data-start="20739.494" data-end="20746.253">flagged.  So I wrote this  probot.  I gave it a logo.  It's</span> <span data-start="20746.668" data-end="20753.272">an ESLint logo with the eyes  emojiemoji.  When a pull request</span> <span data-start="20754.294" data-end="20762.448">comes in, it checks the diff,  and if disable is in there, it</span> <span data-start="20762.946" data-end="20766.994">will comment on there.  There's  a great thing.  If you install</span> <span data-start="20768.473" data-end="20773.098">probots into your repositories,  you can give conflicts.  My</span> <span data-start="20773.818" data-end="20777.37">probot, you can change this  message.  If you wanted to give</span> <span data-start="20777.744" data-end="20785.577">him like a little image, you can do that.  You can @ the team</span> <span data-start="20785.748" data-end="20793.434">that should review this.   Like @the JS team.  And if</span> <span data-start="20793.549" data-end="20795.549">they're like legitimate</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="20798.837" data-end="20805.628">ESLint disables.  This talk went really fast.  You can find</span> <span data-start="20805.629" data-end="20809.481">probot on my GitHub, which is up there.</span> <span data-start="20809.482" data-end="20811.482">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="20822.917" data-end="20824.917">lightning talks for today.  So  I'm here to say that y'all can</span> <span data-start="20825.095" data-end="20829.156">leave early.  But I'm also here  to promote the party happening,</span> <span data-start="20829.264" data-end="20829.496">and I [ Applause ]</span> <span data-start="20829.497" data-end="20829.635"Audience member: That's actually all of our  lightning talks for today.  So</span> <span data-start="20829.636" data-end="20833.188">hope I can pronounce this right. At</span> <span data-start="20837.124" data-end="20840.964">Egisgarour.  I tried. It's in your leaflet.</span> <span data-start="20845.501" data-end="20850.118">And also, until around 6:30,  there's going to be a bus coming</span> <span data-start="20850.386" data-end="20854.21">in from here, and also the hotel to the party.</span> <span data-start="20854.211" data-end="20858.107">And dinner is also provided.  So don't, you know, have dinner</span> <span data-start="20858.406" data-end="20862.464">before the party, unless you  want to have a second dinner,</span> <span data-start="20862.591" data-end="20870.381">which I won't judge.  And Harpa  opens tomorrow at 9:00.  I hope</span> </p>
