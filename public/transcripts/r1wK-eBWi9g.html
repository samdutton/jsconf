data-end="636.589">just couldn't make it work so another</span> <span data-start="636.589" data-end="638.209">attempt I really said like me and I</span> <span data-start="638.209" data-end="641.089">really need a functional testing tool or</span> <span data-start="641.089" data-end="642.44">something with you know the emphasis on</span> <span data-start="642.44" data-end="643.699">actually seeing what the browsers are</span> <span data-start="643.699" data-end="647.69">doing and so Ward Cunningham created</span> <span data-start="647.69"

data-end="661.67">other things but so he created this</span> <span data-start="661.67" data-end="666.92">thing called fit and it was implemented</span> <span data-start="666.92" data-end="668.209">in

data-start="670.94" data-end="672.59">at the time so I kind of emailed him say</span> <span data-start="672.59" data-end="673.76">hey did anyone done this yet I said no</span> <span data-start="673.76" data-end="676.04">let go ahead so I tried to implement it</span> <span data-start="676.04" data-end="678.89">and he had a specific thing if you know</span> <span data-start="678.89" data-end="680.12">fit i'm not going to go into it but</span> <span data-start="680.12" data-end="681.23">they've got these things called fixtures</span> <span data-start="681.23" data-end="683.99">and it's good for data driven</span> <span data-start="683.99" data-end="685.1">development but one of the things they</span> <span data-start="685.1" data-end="687.74">had this thing called action fixture and</span> <span data-start="687.74" data-end="692.29">they've got four he has four API</span> <span data-start="692.29" data-end="694.37">commands i don't know if i can

data-start="700.55" data-end="702.77">says on his website if you deviate from</span> <span data-start="702.77" data-end="705.32">this api you forked the project and you</span> <span

data-end="711.71">other thing is kind of silly if i want</span> <span data-start="711.71" data-end="714.23">to check a checkbox that's not the</span> <span data-start="714.23" data-end="715.04">command you would want to use that</span> <span data-start="715.04" data-end="717.86">actually is a check is the command for</span> <span data-start="717.86"

a checkbox but then check the</span> <span data-start="723.14" data-end="725.6">value in too much naming classic so I</span> <span data-start="725.6" data-end="727.93">didn't like the API it was too limiting</span> <span data-start="727.93" data-end="731.18">so he kind of I guess said at the time</span> <span data-start="731.18" data-end="734.03">go for yourself you're very pleasant guy</span> <span data-start="734.03" data-end="735.26">he didn't actually say those words but</span> <span data-start="735.26" data-end="741.2">we had were forced to fork fit and so</span> <span
