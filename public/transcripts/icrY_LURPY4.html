for</span> <span data-start="333.589" data-end="336.169">video and so I thought what if we kind</span> <span data-start="336.169" data-end="340.339">of treat this thing this thing kind of</span> <span data-start="340.339" data-end="344.36">like like this thing instead of thinking</span> <span data-start="344.36" data-end="347.3">of of a website as actually a place what</span> <span data-start="347.3" data-end="349.58">if we think about it as a bouncing</span> <span data-start="349.58" data-end="352.819">signal that we can play around with and</span> <span data-start="352.819" data-end="354.949">so so I started experimenting with this</span> <span data-start="354.949" data-end="357.08">idea about two and a half years ago or</span> <span data-start="357.08" data-end="362.62">something and so what this is is</span> <span data-start="362.62" data-end="367.039">basically here I'm using WebRTC to send</span> <span data-start="367.039" data-end="370.37">a video signal between various browser</span> <span data-start="370.37" data-end="375.819">windows so here I'm sending this in this</span> <span data-start="375.819" data-end="379.879">video to this

here</span> <span data-start="384.05" data-end="386.719">and compositing them with each other</span> <span data-start="386.719" data-end="389.75">over here and these are all happened to</span> <span data-start="389.75" data-end="391.49">be on the same computer to kind of show</span> <span data-start="391.49" data-end="394.639">the idea but they could be you know when</span> <span data-start="394.639" data-end="396.77">one window could be in China and one</span> <span data-start="396.77" data-end="400.25">somewhere else one here but this is I</span> <span data-start="400.25" data-end="401.629">don't know why this was interesting to</span> <span data-start="401.629" data-end="402.35">me it was just</span> <span data-start="402.35" data-end="404.27">let me explore this idea
