in a browser good idea I'm gonna</span> <span data-start="293.99" data-end="296.54">take you to some ways that I have come</span> <span data-start="296.54" data-end="298.19">to actually be able to do this in a</span> <span data-start="298.19" data-end="300.89">browser the first thing that we need is</span> <span data-start="300.89" data-end="305.21">audio right we have a Web Audio API and</span> <span data-start="305.21" data-end="307.91">there's probably yes it's my favorite</span> <span data-start="307.91" data-end="310.45">one too</span> <span data-start="310.46" data-end="313.04">there's

got a</span> <span data-start="316.91" data-end="319.16">video or an audio element in your Dom</span> <span data-start="319.16" data-end="321.2">you could just grab the audio from that</span> <span data-start="321.2" data-end="323.12">and you can push it through the API and</span> <span data-start="323.12" data-end="325.28">you can stream it from your device if</span> <span data-start="325.28" data-end="327.23">you've got a camera microphone you can</span> <span data-start="327.23" data-end="328.73">grab the audio from that and you can</span> <span data-start="328.73" data-end="331.46">stream it through the API you can go and</span> <span data-start="331.46" data-end="332.78">get a file you can go and get a sound</span> <span data-start="332.78" data-end="335.03">file when you get a sound file you do</span> <span data-start="335.03" data-end="336.95">have to decode it into the API you sort</span> <span data-start="336.95" data-end="338.66">of got to buffer it in because sound</span> <span data-start="338.66" data-end="339.83">files by and large are sort of</span> <span data-start="339.83" data-end="341.45">compressed and you've got to make the</span> <span data-start="341.45" data-end="343.13">audio api understand the data of the</span> <span data-start="343.13" data-end="344.9">sound file so we decode it into what we</span> <span
