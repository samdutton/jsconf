<p><span data-start="23.119" data-end="29.039">Thank you Ben, thank you everyone for joining me here today, it's a real honour, thank you</span> <span data-start="29.039" data-end="36">JSConf for making this happening, as Ben said I'll talk about visualising the application,</span> <span data-start="36" data-end="43.32">the code just being a part of it, as we all know apps are so much more than code. So,</span> <span data-start="43.32" data-end="48.579">we'll see whether we can use some 3D visualisation techniques to get a better perspective of</span> <span data-start="48.579" data-end="50.27">our apps.</span> <span data-start="50.27" data-end="57.61">So we'll use this as the a case study, the awesome to do app, we have maybe created a</span> <span data-start="57.61" data-end="62.53">version of this app, some of us may have contributed to the project using different frameworks</span> <span data-start="62.53" data-end="68.659">to create a to do app, I think it will be a good example that most of us can relate</span> <span data-start="68.659" data-end="74.59">to, just for those that may not be familiar, so they understand what they are looking at,</span> <span data-start="74.59" data-end="80.81">it's a to do app, you put in to do items, check them off, sort them, so you get different</span> <span data-start="80.81" data-end="85.84">views and that's essentially the functionality, ok.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="85.84" data-end="92.09">So, we ask, what's an app? The first thing that comes to mind, it's code, looks something</span> <span data-start="92.09" data-end="98.369">like this, we're all intimately familiar with this sort of view. In order to sort of maybe</span> <span data-start="98.369" data-end="103.509">better understand the reasoning why we need to see things beyond just the code, not just</span> <span data-start="103.509" data-end="109.84">see them but share them, show them, we'll look at a more tangible example, like coffee.</span> <span data-start="109.84" data-end="116.549">What's coffee? it's ingredients something like this, very simple ingredients, water,</span> <span data-start="116.549" data-end="123.22">coffee beans, that's all. Now, go and tell that to those people outsides pre-so coffee,</span> <span data-start="123.22" data-end="134.489">the beautiful folks from the Barn, are they great, awesome \{Applause\}.</span> <span data-start="134.489" data-end="141.129">Good job to JSConf for setting that up. You see their set up, it's people, it's not just</span> <span data-start="141.129" data-end="147.739">ingredients, we have a person taking the order, a person making the coffee, tense of thousands</span> <span data-start="147.739" data-end="157.269">of dollars of equipment, that Espresso machine, $5,000, I know, I used to have a coffee shop,</span> <span data-start="157.269" data-end="158.319">the coffee we take for</span> <span data-start="158.319" data-end="163.519">granted, we got a much better perspective when we think about it in a 3D way, we have</span> <span data-start="163.519" data-end="169.629">a sense of geography, if the coffee shop is in Baltimore and we're here in Berlin that's</span> <span data-start="169.629" data-end="177.18">no good for us, all these things come into play when we want to think more broadly about</span> <span data-start="177.18" data-end="180.709">where our coffee comes from, what our coffee really is.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="180.709" data-end="186.43">The key message here, sort of a no brainer, coffee shop is a much bigger deal than the</span> <span data-start="186.43" data-end="196.93">coffee itself, we are using the to do list app as a case study, it's a much bigger deal</span> <span data-start="196.93" data-end="202.129">than a to do list or a feature, the to do app is a much bigger deal than the feature</span> <span data-start="202.129" data-end="206.31">set that is designed.</span> <span data-start="206.31" data-end="212.65">When we put the 3D view up of the coffee shop we are able to get perspective on the scale</span> <span data-start="212.65" data-end="219.049">of the coffee shop, location of it, able to see the people, processes, things, in that</span> <span data-start="219.049" data-end="225.499">traceability, the concrete artefacts, the coffee machine, the location of the bathrooms</span> <span data-start="225.499" data-end="233.739">in respect to the entrance, the concrete things give us a good appreciation for what's involved,</span> <span data-start="233.739" data-end="240.43">everybody understands that 3D diagram, whether you are a coffee farmer, coffee maker, a business</span> <span data-start="240.43" data-end="244.2">owner, customer, we all intuitively understand that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="244.2" data-end="251.129">So what's what we are hoping for in our 3D application view. So we have on the left hand</span> <span data-start="251.129" data-end="256.94">side the coffee shop, the inputs into that visualisation are things like the ingredients,</span> <span data-start="256.94" data-end="263.37">inventory, people and infrastructure and we have the output the analogous input for the</span> <span data-start="263.37" data-end="269.74">to do list, will be the code, support scripts, our people very important and our infrastructure,</span> <span data-start="269.74" data-end="273.81">somehow we are going to come up with the 3D diagram, that's hopefully what we will get</span> <span data-start="273.81" data-end="279.849">to together today, I'll do some of your audience participation, I can see this far in to the</span> <span data-start="279.849" data-end="285.009">conference, people are a little more tired.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="285.009" data-end="293.05">So we start with the code, so we start out with the app as code text, now we are getting</span> <span data-start="293.05" data-end="298.59">to something beyond the text, the files, the folders, the file system, so already, there</span> <span data-start="298.59" data-end="305.55">is a little bit more to our code than just the text file. Here we just have a subtle</span> <span data-start="305.55" data-end="312.24">benefit of the 3D view, just the beginnings of 3D visualisation in terms of getting a</span> <span data-start="312.24" data-end="313.8">better perspective.</span> <span data-start="313.8" data-end="319.259">Here, for example, we can see the entire folder structure, the sort of thing you would to</span> <span data-start="319.259" data-end="324.83">click through every single folder to see how deep they are, in one view if we do this sort</span> <span data-start="324.83" data-end="331.729">of leverage, the third dimension, we can see the top level folders, contains of a assets</span> <span data-start="331.729" data-end="338.81">folder, Java assets folder and so on, across the whole code base.</span> <span data-start="338.81" data-end="344.97">So maybe somebody there. So another way we can gain some value, looking at things in</span> <span data-start="344.97" data-end="354.009">3D, if we juxtaposition the files next to the diagram, we have a visual way, quickly,</span> <span data-start="354.009" data-end="360.639">shorthand, to see what files are important, visually you can see the file in front, this</span> <span data-start="360.639" data-end="366.129">file has less code than the one behind it, it gives you a little bit of overview, perspective,</span> <span data-start="366.129" data-end="371.801">shorthand perspective if you will. Obviously you need a lot more, just to look at the file</span> <span data-start="371.801" data-end="379.95">system in 3D may not be directly a huge amount of value for that. To explore further, let's</span> <span data-start="379.95" data-end="385.319">compare with a more complex app, so we introduce discourse, another great open sources app</span> <span data-start="385.319" data-end="392.05">that folks made available, some of the folks behind stack overflow, it's a forum software</span> <span data-start="392.05" data-end="394.189">so people interact, write blog</span> <span data-start="394.189" data-end="399.61">messages, post comments, there is some mail and bulletin board functionality, it's a very</span> <span data-start="399.61" data-end="405.43">complex app. So, while I have two open sources apps, someone mentioned open sources just</span> <span data-start="405.43" data-end="415.409">before I got up, give a quick round of applause to people who contribute to open sources \{Applause\}.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="415.409" data-end="416.409">Awesome.</span> <span data-start="416.409" data-end="423.821">So, what can we see in 3D, we can see a relative size of things and now, one thing we see is</span> <span data-start="423.821" data-end="431.53">that all discourse is much bigger, we put it next to a model there, let's say someone</span> <span data-start="431.53" data-end="436.62">in the room I sat next to from Korea, studying in Finland I just met today, manager of our</span> <span data-start="436.62" data-end="447.061">team, standing next to the code base modelled in certain dimensions, she gets to say look</span> <span data-start="447.061" data-end="453">at how big my code base is, so, at the same time she can also share that with err management,</span> <span data-start="453" data-end="457.569">by saying hey, look how big my code base is!</span> <span data-start="457.569" data-end="464.84">We saw a talk on Friday, Kai from Microsoft, talked about the changes in the new Microsoft</span> <span data-start="464.84" data-end="472.86">browsers compare to EI, talked about lines of code, we all need statistics like that</span> <span data-start="472.86" data-end="478.91">for different reasons here's another way to show the relative size of things while looking</span> <span data-start="478.91" data-end="485.82">at the actual file systems, and to give perspectives to folks at a glance view, hey that's a big</span> <span data-start="485.82" data-end="494.44">app, that's life size, well not life size, that is to scale, the Airbus A 380, is to</span> <span data-start="494.44" data-end="503.341">scale, that's just the JavaScript portion of the discourse apps. So again there is some</span> <span data-start="503.341" data-end="509.229">value in showing things that way, both for us as developers, technologists but also for</span> <span data-start="509.229" data-end="518.229">business partner, I think that should help our partners in understanding what we do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="518.229" data-end="523">So, what else can we see? Can we gain any insight about the structure of are code, beyond</span> <span data-start="523" data-end="528.09">ok it's a big code base, first to do that let's look at the folders of the code, let's</span> <span data-start="528.09" data-end="534.1">ignore the files for a second, that allows a more compact view, that's what we see here</span> <span data-start="534.1" data-end="536.88">at the first shot of things.</span> <span data-start="536.88" data-end="542.089">Now let's sort things, let's sort them with the advantage of a 3D perspective, so let's</span> <span data-start="542.089" data-end="552.4">use x , y , z planes, we can sort in one direction on one folder level, another sort in another</span> <span data-start="552.4" data-end="559.29">direction on the y plane for the next folder level, we are using the advantage of all our</span> <span data-start="559.29" data-end="564.61">planes a little bit, it gives a more compact code base, so now that code base that was</span> <span data-start="564.61" data-end="570.49">the length of the A 380 that had no hope whatsoever of fitting on the screen now we can see in</span> <span data-start="570.49" data-end="573.399">one compact view.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="573.399" data-end="577.49">So what's the advantage of that? First of all, I think that by itself is awesome, I</span> <span data-start="577.49" data-end="583.73">don't know how many of you have been clicking through, being able to see the whole directory</span> <span data-start="583.73" data-end="586.74">system at once is awesome.</span> <span data-start="586.74" data-end="594.77">Now I say you can go directly to any file at any level, another quick benefit of looking</span> <span data-start="594.77" data-end="602.67">at things in 3D, we can see patterns, it doesn't really take an expert eye to say, this one</span> <span data-start="602.67" data-end="608.62">on the left, it's named, "Admin", the top level folder is named admin, this one is,</span> <span data-start="608.62" data-end="615.29">"Discourse", they are fatter, longer, it looks like the folders have names, models, folders,</span> <span data-start="615.29" data-end="621.76">components, maybe they are the two men apps in the whole apps, these are some of the patterns</span> <span data-start="621.76" data-end="626.23">we want to see when we are exploring a code base, now we can see in 3D rather quickly</span> <span data-start="626.23" data-end="632.279">and also non-technical people might also be able to get it, maybe an appreciation of that</span> <span data-start="632.279" data-end="635.36">without understanding the code base so much.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="635.36" data-end="643.29">Of course, now we need to see the files, so if we want to explore any folder, we can click</span> <span data-start="643.29" data-end="648.72">any of them or all of them at one time, again sufficient of the limitation of the current</span> <span data-start="648.72" data-end="654.13">methods of viewing our folder structure, either using the command line or the operating system</span> <span data-start="654.13" data-end="660.209">GUI, had limitation of seeing one folder one directory at the time or it clunky when you</span> <span data-start="660.209" data-end="662.62">want to see more.</span> <span data-start="662.62" data-end="669.06">So that's all 3D code, but Ola you said, app is not just code you just spent the last 10</span> <span data-start="669.06" data-end="675.38">minutes talking about code ok, so we have a computer, we start off with the code but</span> <span data-start="675.38" data-end="679.399">now we're introduce our run time. We have to put the computer into the picture in this</span> <span data-start="679.399" data-end="684.02">case we can see in one view that we have a certain code pace it runs on windows operating</span> <span data-start="684.02" data-end="690.709">system, it actually needs a browser as a reason time, and so again shorthand view of what</span> <span data-start="690.709" data-end="696.24">our getting better perspective on what our app looks like in a shorthand.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="696.24" data-end="704.69">We also need a user, another thing that I missing in a lot of diagram either with oversimplifying</span> <span data-start="704.69" data-end="711.16">the stick figure user or non-existent at all let's have the user in the view, some app</span> <span data-start="711.16" data-end="715.839">or software don't need a user perhaps they interact with environment or sensors or other</span> <span data-start="715.839" data-end="721.829">apps but we're talking the webapp, there a user involved let's show them. Now we're talking</span> <span data-start="721.829" data-end="726.88">in this particular room about a special type of app software called webapp, so we need</span> <span data-start="726.88" data-end="737.5">a web server here, that we introduce new men that platform there the server the node express</span> <span data-start="737.5" data-end="746.88">has NDN dependency it serves HTTP in this case on the same computer. That looks like</span> <span data-start="746.88" data-end="754.61">our developers machine, clearly it's still not what an app looks like really in the wild,</span> <span data-start="754.61" data-end="759.58">but we're getting there slowly so now we introduce developer and developer want developer tools</span> <span data-start="759.58" data-end="767.99">that go with that, and now we can also show and share perhaps succinctly but certainly</span> <span data-start="767.99" data-end="773.69">in a way that developer does more than code. Clearly there's the build, there's test and</span> <span data-start="773.69" data-end="777.73">there are tools that go with that against some more dependencies, more installation</span> <span data-start="777.73" data-end="784.91">shown in orange, you just very familiar with Git, it was mentioned in the talk before mine,</span> <span data-start="784.91" data-end="789">others have talked about the transpiling tool, Peter Muller did a great talk on Friday I</span> <span data-start="789" data-end="794.389">recommend anyone who didn’t see that to check out video, talking about a different</span> <span data-start="794.389" data-end="799.899">language transpiling tools we have to deal with and perhaps a better way to do that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="799.899" data-end="805.08">Here we can visualise that among the other tools that we used.</span> <span data-start="805.08" data-end="810.26">So here's our view about our developer, some perspective are the kinds of things you see</span> <span data-start="810.26" data-end="815.39">at a glance when you look at a system, or an application, in particular development</span> <span data-start="815.39" data-end="821.779">environment this way. We can do a technology comparison. Here we say oh, another stack</span> <span data-start="821.779" data-end="828.149">we could use for our webapp is ember and ember as a facility called ember that include some</span> <span data-start="828.149" data-end="836.36">of the same installation, those separate installs we had to do for transpiling or testing the</span> <span data-start="836.36" data-end="840.759">build dependency management it's all in ember so we can do a visual comparison, it doesn't</span> <span data-start="840.759" data-end="845.069">tell you which one is better or worse just give you some perspective if you saw one developers</span> <span data-start="845.069" data-end="849.279">machine in this view of another developers machine in that view you can see the difference</span> <span data-start="849.279" data-end="853.72">rather quickly, and in the stacks they use and why how these stacks are different.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="853.72" data-end="859.1">Same things with rails, rails are totally different technology from our JavaScript frameworks,</span> <span data-start="859.1" data-end="865.759">server side framework we can still visualise the developer environment. So here just trying</span> <span data-start="865.759" data-end="871.25">to show the versatility of looking at things in $3 how it's not just for this specific</span> <span data-start="871.25" data-end="880.75">type of app I think almost any code pace any type of app can benefit from this kind visualisation.</span> <span data-start="880.75" data-end="888.86">What happened to our user is way over there or over there. No code for the user, poor</span> <span data-start="888.86" data-end="892.779">user. So what do we have to do, we have to do some deployment stabs which is more tools</span> <span data-start="892.779" data-end="900.11">and more roles for our development team in this case our single developer, by the way</span> <span data-start="900.11" data-end="906.529">I wish I should name my developer I will name her Sandra, someone I met here today from</span> <span data-start="906.529" data-end="921.459">Zimbabwe very great effort from JSConf \{applause\} so there's Sandra, now she has to deploy our</span> <span data-start="921.459" data-end="930.389">code, more tools we might have FTP file programme, to transport the tools, we might use Amazon</span> <span data-start="930.389" data-end="939.35">S3 for our storage. The simplest way you can deploy a single page app, so we do that, we</span> <span data-start="939.35" data-end="945.079">deploy Amazon S3 we have to configure some DNS so the domain names work out right, today</span> <span data-start="945.079" data-end="951.2">spoke a little bit about some of the issues that come up with DNS routing and so forth.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="951.2" data-end="958.61">Whatever we can figure in S 3 in Amazon the default routes, error messages, error screens</span> <span data-start="958.61" data-end="964.92">they are code they make up our system, they are part of thing that just totally get lost</span> <span data-start="964.92" data-end="971.19">whenever we either point to our code and say hey the code is the app, or when we try to</span> <span data-start="971.19" data-end="974.57">do a little bit better than that and we draw the diagram of the app here's our S3 cloud,</span> <span data-start="974.57" data-end="980.279">here’s a client and server, instead of the 2 dimensional ways we do. I think that shorthand</span> <span data-start="980.279" data-end="985.02">is great it's awesome for us as engineers but I think the value of getting a little</span> <span data-start="985.02" data-end="991.029">bit more sophisticated is very beneficial for I think for us as engineers, but also</span> <span data-start="991.029" data-end="999.779">for our partners, clients, bosses, we deploy everything we should, ask are we done. Things</span> <span data-start="999.779" data-end="1007.98">are working, app has been developed, user can download it, make their to do list, but</span> <span data-start="1007.98" data-end="1014.709">as it generally goes we need more features we need more developers so Sandra needs a</span> <span data-start="1014.709" data-end="1019.389">partner, co-worker. We introduced another developer with another development environment</span> <span data-start="1019.389" data-end="1024.089">we model their develop environment there's might not be Mac, but for the sake of this</span> <span data-start="1024.089" data-end="1031.12">talk, we have just said it the same sort of set up. So we bring in Bryan who spoke a little</span> <span data-start="1031.12" data-end="1038.339">earlier from San Francisco all the way here from San Francisco and what kind of development</span> <span data-start="1038.339" data-end="1043.4">team if we don't have someone from Silicon Valley on the team, so Bryan is here collaborating</span> <span data-start="1043.4" data-end="1049.679">on the app. Now they have Github as a shared repository, they use it shared repository,</span> <span data-start="1049.679" data-end="1057.67">they are both doing there separate build deploy test, how long is I before a different operating</span> <span data-start="1057.67" data-end="1062.56">system, a different configuration on one person's machine makes it past here or failed there,</span> <span data-start="1062.56" data-end="1066.74">so we need to have a shared build and test environment, that's what we have done we have</span> <span data-start="1066.74" data-end="1073.37">create up here in this case we have used Amazon c2 as a cloud structure, we have a Linux operating</span> <span data-start="1073.37" data-end="1079.47">system we can see visually that's different from our Mac. Again some of those sort of</span> <span data-start="1079.47" data-end="1083.21">things that make up our system very important things that make up our system that I think</span> <span data-start="1083.21" data-end="1089.84">often get lost way too easily when we talk about our systems.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1089.84" data-end="1098.88">So we got more tools more code configuration but when ask are we done, some of you are</span> <span data-start="1098.88" data-end="1104.52">already looking at that gap the gulf between the dev and the prod, something is missing</span> <span data-start="1104.52" data-end="1111.39">you might also be looking saying this dev part looks a whole lot different from prod.</span> <span data-start="1111.39" data-end="1116.12">My development environment is not made up of S3 I can't have that on my machine that's</span> <span data-start="1116.12" data-end="1117.12">why we have what we</span> <span data-start="1117.12" data-end="1121.789">have. Similarly S3 does not support build tool we have set up using our EC2 instance.</span> <span data-start="1121.789" data-end="1128.9">These things are so different. Maybe we need something else, introduce staging environment.</span> <span data-start="1128.9" data-end="1135.36">Try to make that identical to production, we have someone playing that role, of testing</span> <span data-start="1135.36" data-end="1141.11">our pre-production app in staging let's called that person today as we could see in his presentation</span> <span data-start="1141.11" data-end="1149.549">he is anal about quality and errors if anyone can catch any errors before going to production</span> <span data-start="1149.549" data-end="1155.9">it today. He has some tools to catch any ringers production it would be a good candidate for</span> <span data-start="1155.9" data-end="1161.95">us to GA before we get to production.</span> <span data-start="1161.95" data-end="1172.409">So are we done? Cloud storage we didn't talk about that we're all using local storage we</span> <span data-start="1172.409" data-end="1182.48">need some code for the database, we need sub database actual executable database app installation,</span> <span data-start="1182.48" data-end="1186.87">so we have shown that there in red, now we have got to upgrade our staging. We go from</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1186.87" data-end="1194.799">S3 to EC do again I think the value of the 3D visualisation is that you know just visually</span> <span data-start="1194.799" data-end="1199.94">you look at the S3 versus the EC2 you can see that it's different and you can see it's</span> <span data-start="1199.94" data-end="1206.08">significantly different and crucially our team mates can see that we as a team and our</span> <span data-start="1206.08" data-end="1211.24">partners, clients, customers, executives. So when we said yeah you know it's going to</span> <span data-start="1211.24" data-end="1215.6">take some more resources it going to take some more time for us to go from S3 to EC2</span> <span data-start="1215.6" data-end="1220.7">they have a way to visualise this, they don't have Java to think that oh whatever magic</span> <span data-start="1220.7" data-end="1228.669">you guys do just do it faster. I mean you drew S3 as a circle, so make it so, but now</span> <span data-start="1228.669" data-end="1235.97">we can give them a better perspective, for what's involved. So with that, again you can</span> <span data-start="1235.97" data-end="1241.94">ask the question, are we done? Valid question but I think you are seeing the pattern now</span> <span data-start="1241.94" data-end="1248.97">right? The pattern is really we're never done right? I mean that's sort of the reality of</span> <span data-start="1248.97" data-end="1252.77">our lives. They are all these things that have I have not touched honestly that part</span> <span data-start="1252.77" data-end="1258.59">of are daily lives different infrastructure, operational things we need to introduce we</span> <span data-start="1258.59" data-end="1263.58">talk about containerisation now instead of virtual machine infrastructure, we might use</span> <span data-start="1263.58" data-end="1268.179">in memory data stores like memcache, a whole bunch of stuff we can do on the infrastructure</span> <span data-start="1268.179" data-end="1273.049">side, same thing we have services we generally need to plug-in here, message queues, workflow</span> <span data-start="1273.049" data-end="1279.94">energy other kinds of storage, we may introduce different communication pathways using web</span> <span data-start="1279.94" data-end="1286.36">socket or peer to peer or streaming some great talks about that earlier. I recommend Thomas's</span> <span data-start="1286.36" data-end="1292.429">yesterday evening talking about streaming it peer to peer which you should check out</span> <span data-start="1292.429" data-end="1296.039">if you missed it yesterday or Friday.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1296.039" data-end="1305.09">So, I think the 3D view helps us visualise better all these aspects of our system. So,</span> <span data-start="1305.09" data-end="1311.98">hopefully at this point we have some analogous way of looking at our app as a system, including</span> <span data-start="1311.98" data-end="1317.85">people including processes, including assets and resources similarly to how we might think</span> <span data-start="1317.85" data-end="1327.65">of the physical thing like a coffee shop, physical system like a coffee shop I beg your</span> <span data-start="1327.65" data-end="1333.94">pardon. Me see the same in sight we can have the perspective of the location and scale</span> <span data-start="1333.94" data-end="1340.62">of our application, we can see the people, the processes, the things as well as have</span> <span data-start="1340.62" data-end="1345.35">traceability to concrete artefacts, this is intuitively understood.</span> <span data-start="1345.35" data-end="1351.33">So, talk a little bit about the tools I am sure many of you are wondering how do you</span> <span data-start="1351.33" data-end="1358.309">do, what's he showing me. In this case what you are seeing here today uses Ruby as a scripting</span> <span data-start="1358.309" data-end="1361.662">language, integrating with Github I will talk about the integrations I have done over so</span> <span data-start="1361.662" data-end="1370.58">far and a 3D modelling talk called Sketchup. I have done produced similar results using</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1370.58" data-end="1372.03">Javascript JS</span> <span data-start="1372.03" data-end="1376.289">library as well as JavaScript and another modelling software called tinker cat I can</span> <span data-start="1376.289" data-end="1382.36">talk you to off line all about why I am not using those now, I am still evaluating they</span> <span data-start="1382.36" data-end="1387.299">might be something I will end up doing more with.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1387.299" data-end="1392.58">Then we talk about API integrations, currently Github is the anyone, the source code you</span> <span data-start="1392.58" data-end="1401.87">saw there from discuss or to do, this is based on the code base of those apps from Github,</span> <span data-start="1401.87" data-end="1408.99">through using the Ruby scripts, using ruby and the Sketchup modelling tool I created</span> <span data-start="1408.99" data-end="1415.85">the visualisation of the app code pace. Very interesting future work for me and others</span> <span data-start="1415.85" data-end="1422.07">interested in this kind of field will be to integrate whatever modelling tools they come</span> <span data-start="1422.07" data-end="1428.39">up with and I want to do it with this, other source control systems, you see there other</span> <span data-start="1428.39" data-end="1433.51">cloud platforms would be great to directly integrate to cloud bottom. query Amazon and</span> <span data-start="1433.51" data-end="1440.23">Azure and for the status of our applications, the size of them, the configuration of them</span> <span data-start="1440.23" data-end="1445.96">the show those in our visualisation. Similarly it would be great to integrate with the various</span> <span data-start="1445.96" data-end="1458.51">CI and devtools that are out there some of you are familiar with. Still along the lines</span> <span data-start="1458.51" data-end="1465.04">of future exploration I am working on getting this stuff open sourced. It's not right now,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1465.04" data-end="1472.49">I can't give you a URL get the modelling tool I will be adding more components, you saw</span> <span data-start="1472.49" data-end="1481.23">JavaScript biased with infrastructure, the same things apply for any infrastructure or</span> <span data-start="1481.23" data-end="1488.72">development tools you use Java, or whatever have you, ruby. What will be really awesome</span> <span data-start="1488.72" data-end="1493.5">would be to integrate with the various 3D interaction technologies, Google cardboard,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1493.5" data-end="1503.5">Microsoft lens, Occulus I am not there yet. Would be great. Some of you my motivation</span> <span data-start="1503.5" data-end="1509.07">for that some of you guys know the code really hard to find it that attributed to that which</span> <span data-start="1509.07" data-end="1514.409">measures improved, to that I add which is visualised, improved even if we're not empirically</span> <span data-start="1514.409" data-end="1521.73">and quantitatively measuring something, just being able to visualise it being able to see</span> <span data-start="1521.73" data-end="1530.57">symmetry see patterns, see some degree of complexity is not the final word on how complex</span> <span data-start="1530.57" data-end="1538.72">all kinds of visualised, the fact that everybody can't thank you to you guys have been great</span> <span data-start="1538.72" data-end="1545.59">thank you very much. So why are these false. I could really use your feedback as I said,</span> <span data-start="1545.59" data-end="1552.69">either on some of the current stuff you see or some of the future interactions you can</span> <span data-start="1552.69" data-end="1561.24">help with or you are doing yourself, I would love to hear about it. so, thank you, thank</span> <span data-start="1561.24" data-end="1566.539">you to Berlin, the Berlin people, you have been super awesome, you guys have been great,</span> </p>
