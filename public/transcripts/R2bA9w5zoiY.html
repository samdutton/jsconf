data-end="22.35">node which makes RPC awesome so as I</span> <span data-start="22.35" data-end="24.75">said easy as cake with D node you can</span> <span data-start="24.75" data-end="26.99">just string together your processes like</span> <span data-start="26.99" data-end="29.429">like nothing you just hack up a server</span> <span data-start="29.429" data-end="33.54">here require D node and then just call</span> <span data-start="33.54" data-end="35.579">it it's it's a function you can define</span> <span data-start="35.579" data-end="36.75">methods on it you can define</span> <span data-start="36.75" data-end="39.42">constructors the cool thing is you can</span> <span data-start="39.42" data-end="42.6">define functions in your D node server</span> <span data-start="42.6" data-end="44.91">and then those functions can be called</span> <span data-start="44.91" data-end="48.96">by clients that connect so like here we</span> <span data-start="48.96" data-end="52.5">have just a simple sting function that</span> <span data-start="52.5" data-end="55.14">has two parameters N and a callback and</span> <span data-start="55.14" data-end="57.539">then you know when we get a request in</span> <span data-start="57.539" data-end="59.67">we just call that callback with n times</span> <span data-start="59.67" data-end="63.42">100 and listen on port 5000 and here's a</span> <span data-start="63.42" data-end="65.43">client that makes use of that server so</span> <span data-start="65.43" data-end="69.84">it just goes denote connect port 5000</span> <span data-start="69.84" data-end="71.939">and it gets this remote object and you</span> <span data-start="71.939" data-end="74.34">can call the the server function which</span> <span data-start="74.34" data-end="77.85">was Xing as we just saw and it gives it</span> <span data-start="77.85" data-end="79.14">some parameters and you just get the</span> <span data-start="79.14" data-end="82.35">callback and and these processes can be</span> <span data-start="82.35" data-end="85.95">living on different servers or the same</span> <span data-start="85.95" data-end="87.42">server it really doesn't matter because</span> <span data-start="87.42" data-end="89.85">do you know just figures all that out</span> <span data-start="89.85" data-end="93.869">makes it all work so yeah no schemas</span> <span data-start="93.869" data-end="97.02">none of that about XML no like</span> <span data-start="97.02" data-end="99.15">making your own silly JSON thing that's</span> <span data-start="99.15" data-end="101.4">gonna route your your a synchronous</span> <span data-start="101.4" data-end="103.47">callbacks to where you need in your</span> <span data-start="103.47" data-end="105.329">program you can just pass a function</span> <span data-start="105.329" data-end="109.579">directly and it makes it so much simpler</span> <span data-start="109.579" data-end="113.34">so here's here's these two client and</span> <span data-start="113.34" data-end="114.93">server side by side servers on the top</span> <span data-start="114.93" data-end="116.759">and I'm just gonna go through kind of</span> <span data-start="116.759" data-end="119.369">what happens when you make a remote</span> <span data-start="119.369" data-end="123.18">function called d node so oh goodness</span> <span data-start="123.18" data-end="126.84">that's supposed to be red I don't know</span> <span data-start="126.84" data-end="132.93">what's up with that anyways so here we</span> <span data-start="132.93" data-end="134.01">call this link function</span> <span data-start="134.01" data-end="138.51">we give it 66 as the end parameter okay</span> <span data-start="138.51" data-end="142.11">this one's good and then uh you know we</span> <span data-start="142.11" data-end="144.06">give it this callback here that has just</span> <span data-start="144.06" data-end="146.909">a console dot log now in denote the</span> <span data-start="146.909" data-end="149.069">functions execute on the sides that</span> <span data-start="149.069" data-end="152.22">they're defined on so this console dot</span> <span data-start="152.22" data-end="154.04">log is going to execute on the client</span> <span data-start="154.04" data-end="157.049">because that's you know where you've run</span> <span data-start="157.049" data-end="158.519">the program it's not like sending around</span> <span data-start="158.519" data-end="160.56">a serialized to string of a function or</span> <span data-start="160.56" data-end="162.09">something silly like that it actually</span> <span data-start="162.09" data-end="165.329">sends references so that callback gets</span> <span data-start="165.329" data-end="168.14">passed into the function body and then</span> <span data-start="168.14" data-end="171.51">the N also two computer results that we</span> <span data-start="171.51" data-end="173.22">get back at the client just as a</span> <span data-start="173.22" data-end="175.98">parameter directly exactly like is as if</span> <span data-start="175.98" data-end="179.12">all of this was running locally except</span> <span data-start="179.12" data-end="182.19">you don't get return values because</span> <span data-start="182.19" data-end="183.69">that's not very asynchronous you know</span> <span data-start="183.69" data-end="186.78">and then you can just print it like this</span> <span data-start="186.78" data-end="189.269">so you just launch your server you want</span> <span data-start="189.269" data-end="191.7">your client and you get your result back</span> <span data-start="191.7" data-end="196.049">it's very simple very very easy to get</span> <span data-start="196.049" data-end="197.79">started building this stuff and so you</span> <span data-start="197.79" data-end="199.29">can sort of incrementally build these</span> <span data-start="199.29" data-end="202.65">awesome programs like I have here but it</span> <span data-start="202.65" data-end="204.15">might be a little bit sketchy getting it</span> <span data-start="204.15" data-end="206.129">uh entirely working with this network so</span> <span data-start="206.129" data-end="211.65">yeah callbacks so you can actually</span> <span data-start="211.65" data-end="213.48">yeah callbacks so you can actually take this code this sort of server</span> <span data-start="213.48" data-end="216.209">client TCP streams like I just mentioned</span> <span data-start="216.209" data-end="218.31">that example and just throw it up on the</span> <span data-start="218.31" data-end="222.299">server with exactly the same code except</span> <span data-start="222.299" data-end="224.22">you know okay here in the first four</span> <span data-start="224.22" data-end="226.199">lines we've got a web server and then</span> <span data-start="226.199" data-end="228.48">instead of a server dot less than 5,000</span> <span data-start="228.48" data-end="231.209">we just server dot listen app</span> <span data-start="231.209" data-end="233.76">and it's a web app and it just knows how</span> <span data-start="233.76" data-end="238.859">to make that work with socket IO so yeah</span> <span data-start="238.859" data-end="240.69">and you can actually do both — so you</span> <span data-start="240.69" data-end="242.37">can like serve it out listen app and</span> <span data-start="242.37" data-end="244.5">server dot listen on five thousand and</span> <span data-start="244.5" data-end="246.569">that will like host a web server and</span> <span data-start="246.569" data-end="249.03">have your TCP service so you can have</span> <span data-start="249.03" data-end="251.519">like your your hacky back-end code that</span> <span data-start="251.519" data-end="253.229">like connects to the TCP thing and you</span> <span data-start="253.229" data-end="254.97">can have your nice fancy front-end that</span> <span data-start="254.97" data-end="260.06">connects to your web server and it's</span> <span data-start="260.06" data-end="265.44">it's the same methods for both so like</span> <span data-start="265.44" data-end="267.84">if if you remember the client we just</span> <span data-start="267.84" data-end="269.88">wrapped up this is basically the</span> <span data-start="269.88" data-end="272.31">equivalent in browser form so just some</span> <span data-start="272.31" data-end="274.74">basic HTML you just throw down a script</span> <span data-start="274.74" data-end="279">tag and D node makes this /d nodejs</span> <span data-start="279" data-end="281.669">available for you automatically so you</span> <span data-start="281.669" data-end="283.83">don't have to really worry about messing</span> <span data-start="283.83" data-end="288.66">with like deploying client source but</span> <span data-start="288.66" data-end="290.85">anyways you just pass in your 66</span> <span data-start="290.85" data-end="292.53">parameter and you pass in your callback</span> <span data-start="292.53" data-end="295.199">and you get back the end value and if</span> <span data-start="295.199" data-end="296.52">you go to the browser that's what you</span> <span data-start="296.52" data-end="300.45">see pretty much exactly like the client</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="300.45" data-end="302.76">I mean it's exactly the same sort of</span> <span data-start="302.76" data-end="304.65">code except for instead of console dot</span> <span data-start="304.65" data-end="306.99">log we have you know inner HTML thing</span> <span data-start="306.99" data-end="308.22">because I'm not using jQuery for</span> <span data-start="308.22" data-end="312.51">simplicity here also denote works</span> <span data-start="312.51" data-end="314.61">awesomely with browser if I actually</span> <span data-start="314.61" data-end="317.85">behind the scenes its wrapping the</span> <span data-start="317.85" data-end="320.76">client source that's like /d nodejs the</span> <span data-start="320.76" data-end="322.56">the browser side version of denote that</span> <span data-start="322.56" data-end="325.77">it needs to do this crazy trickery with</span> <span data-start="325.77" data-end="327.479">browserify already but you can also use</span> <span data-start="327.479" data-end="331.11">it explicitly browser fight is a is a</span> <span data-start="331.11" data-end="334.95">browser version of require so you can</span> <span data-start="334.95" data-end="337.169">like load up npm modules and craziness</span> <span data-start="337.169" data-end="339.75">like that and bundle everything but</span> <span data-start="339.75" data-end="341.24">here's just an example of that you can</span> <span data-start="341.24" data-end="343.919">just require d node in your little</span> <span data-start="343.919" data-end="346.8">browserify line there as a middleware</span> <span data-start="346.8" data-end="351.33">and then the code becomes even nicer</span> <span data-start="351.33" data-end="353.46">because it's even more like what you</span> <span data-start="353.46" data-end="355.08">would write on the server because now</span> </p>
