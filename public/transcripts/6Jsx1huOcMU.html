<p><span data-start="96" data-end="98.97">Raphael destroyed away the problem was</span> <span data-start="98.97" data-end="101.399">that as many developers when I was</span> <span data-start="101.399" data-end="103.909">creating Raphael I look at the msdn and</span> <span data-start="103.909" data-end="107.159">to look at the other other libraries</span> <span data-start="107.159"

data-end="116.13">same path that was a big mistake they</span> <span data-start="116.13" data-end="119.009">all wrong they all did it wrong so I did</span> <span data-start="119.009" data-end="124.56">it better now so that's like an example</span> <span data-start="124.56" data-end="126.36">of a difference in BML which I was</span> <span data-start="126.36" data-end="128.58">trying to solve it called sub-pixel</span> <span data-start="128.58" data-end="130.41">rendering that you see there two squares</span> <span data-start="130.41" data-end="134.13">and the square on the right the square</span> <span data-start="134.13" data-end="136.38">on the left is this quadrille and SVG</span> <span data-start="136.38" data-end="138.66">the square on the rights

<span data-start="144.36" data-end="148.38">let's zoom it up so that happens because</span> <span data-start="148.38" data-end="151.41">when you specify when you when you</span> <span data-start="151.41" data-end="154.56">specify the coordinates and as integers</span> <span data-start="154.56" data-end="159.63">and when you use a you know SVG and use</span> <span data-start="159.63" data-end="163.29">one pixel stroke it actually doesn't fit</span> <span data-start="163.29" data-end="165.78">in the pixel grid and happens to be on</span> <span data-start="165.78" data-end="167.94">the edge of two pixels and get blurred</span> <span data-start="167.94" data-end="171.81">across these two pixels and we could</span> <span data-start="171.81" data-end="173.489">have a long discussion is good or bad</span> <span data-start="173.489" data-end="176.459">thing but this is how it is and in envy</span> <span data-start="176.459" data-end="179.22">ml you CSS to position elements and you</span> <span data-start="179.22" data-end="181.47">obviously use integer numbers for that</span> <span data-start="181.47" data-end="183.269">and that's why it's always nice and</span> <span data-start="183.269" data-end="185.88">crisp but it's not the same it's not</span> <span data-start="185.88" data-end="188.7">consistent and sometimes this difference</span> <span data-start="188.7" data-end="191.4">is really really annoying so it fixed</span> <span data-start="191.4" data-end="196.38">now in Rafael 2.0 it's pixel to pixel</span> <span data-start="196.38" data-end="199.98">exactly the same in BML and SVG because</span> <span data-start="199.98" data-end="203.22">it was rewritten again the</span> <span data-start="203.22" data-end="205.26">transformations it's not the important</span> <span data-start="205.26" data-end="209.579">part of a pretty much any drawing</span> <span data-start="209.579" data-end="212.459">process so the transformations which</span> <span data-start="212.459" data-end="213.75">originally didn't pay much attention</span> <span data-start="213.75" data-end="216.23">when it when it created the Rafah</span> <span data-start="216.23" data-end="218.69">and then I paid more attention to it and</span> <span data-start="218.69" data-end="221.239">then I decide to completely change it</span> <span data-start="221.239" data-end="224.989">the whole API or the transformations the</span> <span data-start="224.989" data-end="227.09">reason why I did it is because it's</span> <span data-start="227.09" data-end="229.31">something which is you use most of the</span> <span data-start="229.31" data-end="233.13">time if you're really doing stuff and</span> <span data-start="233.14" data-end="236.299">something which is very important so</span> <span data-start="236.299" data-end="238.4">what the transformations basically it's</span> <span data-start="238.4" data-end="241.519">like I can rotate and draw a rectangle</span> <span data-start="241.519" data-end="243.14">then I could rotate it around some point</span> <span data-start="243.14" data-end="246.17">and then I should be able to rotate it</span> <span data-start="246.17" data-end="247.67">around other point that was impossible</span> <span data-start="247.67" data-end="249.98">in Rafael before if you want to rotate</span> <span data-start="249.98" data-end="252.59">around another point you will reset the</span> <span data-start="252.59" data-end="254.9">previous transformation so now you could</span> <span data-start="254.9" data-end="257.389">rotate another around another point the</span> <span data-start="257.389" data-end="260.209">problem is a transformation then when</span> <span data-start="260.209" data-end="261.829">you apply multiple transformation they</span> <span data-start="261.829" data-end="264.41">all relative to previous one so if now I</span> <span data-start="264.41" data-end="266.18">want to say okay now translate</span> <span data-start="266.18" data-end="268.789">horizontally 100 pixels you will see</span> <span data-start="268.789" data-end="271.039">this picture because the whole</span> <span data-start="271.039" data-end="272.419">coordinate system is transformed</span> <span data-start="272.419" data-end="275.93">transformed as well which is may be</span> <span data-start="275.93" data-end="279.08">correct but not really useful so in</span> <span data-start="279.08" data-end="281.599">decide to introduce relative and</span> <span data-start="281.599" data-end="283.88">absolute transformations in Rafael so</span> <span data-start="283.88" data-end="285.77">now you could say transform relatively</span> <span data-start="285.77" data-end="287.57">and then you will see this or you could</span> <span data-start="287.57" data-end="288.95">say transform absolutely and then you</span> <span data-start="288.95" data-end="294.95">could see that I think it's important in</span> <span data-start="294.95" data-end="296.57">transformation to specify the Holy</span> <span data-start="296.57" data-end="298.61">origin of transformation especially when</span> <span data-start="298.61"

data-end="304.729">specify the point around which your take</span> <span data-start="304.729" data-end="307.099">when you scale you don't specify the</span> <span data-start="307.099"

data-end="390.709">not good enough so i was thinking about</span> <span data-start="390.709" data-end="393.86">this and I will decided it sounds it's</span> <span data-start="393.86" data-end="395.3">the problem sounds familiar there is</span> <span data-start="395.3" data-end="400.999">already in SVG the API for linked</span> <span data-start="400.999" data-end="403.429">comments

have parameters</span> <span data-start="408.199" data-end="410.119">you move to this point draw a line to</span> <span data-start="410.119" data-end="412.069">this point it draw a cubic vizier

data-end="425.449">appears so you give a string in string</span> <span data-start="425.449" data-end="427.189">each letter represents a comment and</span> <span data-start="427.189" data-end="429.889">numbers represent the values you pass to</span> <span data-start="429.889" data-end="431.689">the comment so for example the first</span> <span data-start="431.689" data-end="434.529">line grid like rotate 30 degree around</span> <span data-start="434.529" data-end="438.169">100-120 then rotate minus 45 degree</span> <span data-start="438.169" data-end="443.329">around 6210 then you could when you ask</span> <span data-start="443.329" data-end="444.949">for transformation give you a string so</span> <span data-start="444.949" data-end="446.479">you could ask this element what is your</span> <span data-start="446.479" data-end="448.459">transformation grab this transformation</span> <span data-start="448.459"

data-start="624.879" data-end="626.62">any element yet just the object</span> <span data-start="626.62" data-end="629.8">animation so then i create a path and as</span> <span data-start="629.8" data-end="631.629">you see the past doesn't get any past</span> <span data-start="631.629" data-end="635.35">drinks its pass without puzzling and set</span> <span data-start="635.35" data-end="637.99">attributes mouse 0 which will call the</span> <span data-start="637.99" data-end="639.999">function and you draw me back when with</span> <span data-start="639.999" data-end="642.79">a shot at mouse i make it yellow remove</span> <span data-start="642.79" data-end="645.12">the stroke and unclick i say this</span> <span data-start="645.12" data-end="648.579">animate and I grab the animation I just</span> <span data-start="648.579" data-end="652.569">created until to repeat eight times and</span> <span data-start="652.569" data-end="656.019">then I say animate transformation 400 /</span> <span data-start="656.019" data-end="661.749">x + 0 / x so the element it's happened</span> <span data-start="661.749" data-end="663.959">to be in two animations at the same time</span> <span data-start="663.959" data-end="666.43">so it's opening and shutting his mouth</span> <span data-start="666.43" data-end="670.48">and it's moving horizontally and they</span> <span data-start="670.48" data-end="672.85">apply it to the same element and the</span> <span data-start="672.85" data-end="674.41">first animation actually repeated eight</span> <span data-start="674.41" data-end="676.66">times and this past animation just goes</span> <span data-start="676.66" data-end="686.129">right right i am little bit ago so the</span> <span data-start="686.129" data-end="689.649">this the animation usually represents</span> <span data-start="689.649" data-end="691.87">like you you click the click the button</span> <span data-start="691.87" data-end="693.97">you start the animation and while it's</span> <span data-start="693.97" data-end="696.069">going you have no idea what's going on</span> <span data-start="696.069" data-end="697.72">unless it's finished and you receive</span> <span data-start="697.72" data-end="698.889">your call back and then you see aha</span> <span data-start="698.889" data-end="702.04">animations finished but you if you want</span> <span data-start="702.04" data-end="703.72">really to know the status of animation</span> <span data-start="703.72" data-end="705.37">any point of the time you don't you</span> <span data-start="705.37" data-end="708.309">don't really have a tools to get it so</span> <span data-start="708.309" data-end="711.1">in Rafael too i introduced a new feature</span> <span data-start="711.1" data-end="712.809">so you could actually give their status</span> <span data-start="712.809" data-end="714.61">of animation and you could change the</span> <span data-start="714.61" data-end="716.8">status of animation that give you</span> <span data-start="716.8" data-end="719.17">ability to totally control any animation</span> <span data-start="719.17" data-end="723.639">as much as you want so you could change</span> <span data-start="723.639" data-end="725.379">you could stop you could continue from</span> <span data-start="725.379" data-end="727.42">the point where it stops and so on and</span> <span data-start="727.42" data-end="737.73">so far I think it's awesome</span> <span data-start="737.74" data-end="740.41">well doesn't doesn't look like this you</span> <span data-start="740.41" data-end="743.7">lost your phone so they all they all</span> <span data-start="743.7" data-end="746.5">were all apic rocks you still could</span> <span data-start="746.5" data-end="747.85">create animation like that so you</span> <span data-start="747.85" data-end="750.43">animate to the new attributes during</span> <span data-start="750.43" data-end="753.16">this time is in Quebec but behind the</span> <span data-start="753.16" data-end="755.77">scene to create the animation object but</span> <span data-start="755.77" data-end="756.79">you could do it yourself you could</span> <span data-start="756.79" data-end="759.22">create animation object and then you</span> <span data-start="759.22" data-end="761.41">could animate element just like that it</span> <span data-start="761.41" data-end="763.54">was the object the good thing about it</span> <span data-start="763.54" data-end="764.92">then later you could say what's your</span> <span data-start="764.92" data-end="768.07">status and the element which I ok I'm in</span> <span data-start="768.07" data-end="770.2">three animations right now the first</span> <span data-start="770.2" data-end="771.91">animation am in the beginning the second</span> <span data-start="771.91" data-end="773.26">animation I'm in the middle in the last</span> <span data-start="773.26" data-end="775.27">animations I'm about to finish and this</span> <span data-start="775.27" data-end="776.83">is animations now okay I'll grab the</span> <span data-start="776.83" data-end="778.63">second animation apply to this element</span> <span data-start="778.63" data-end="780.04">because I wanted him to move like that</span> <span data-start="780.04" data-end="784.18">and so on so the API is like that there</span> <span data-start="784.18" data-end="786.37">is a method status and by default</span> <span data-start="786.37" data-end="787.84">settings which only array of all these</span> <span data-start="787.84" data-end="790.63">animations and their statuses if you</span> <span data-start="790.63" data-end="792.19">pass the animation object it reaching</span> <span data-start="792.19" data-end="794.74">the number from 0 to 1 depending where</span> <span data-start="794.74" data-end="798.04">the animation is but if you it also set</span> <span data-start="798.04" data-end="801.36">us so if you pass the number and the</span> <span data-start="801.36" data-end="804.43">animation then it will change the status</span> <span data-start="804.43" data-end="806.77">of this current animation jumps to the</span> <span data-start="806.77" data-end="808.63">position you specify forward to backward</span> <span data-start="808.63" data-end="810.43">depending on the current status you</span> <span data-start="810.43" data-end="812.41">could pause and resume you could stop</span> <span data-start="812.41" data-end="814.84">said time is basically a shortcut for</span> <span data-start="814.84" data-end="817.39">status but you use milliseconds from the</span> <span data-start="817.39" data-end="819.67">beginning of the animation for example</span> <span data-start="819.67" data-end="821.77">if you want to sing Chris keep better</span> <span data-start="821.77" data-end="824.19">parade milliseconds and percentage and</span> <span data-start="824.19" data-end="826.78">the animation has method delay and</span> <span data-start="826.78" data-end="829.54">repeats delay means it started up right</span> <span data-start="829.54" data-end="831.49">now but after some given period of</span> <span data-start="831.49" data-end="833.53">milliseconds and repeat basically it</span> <span data-start="833.53" data-end="835.72">will go to the end then roll back to the</span> <span data-start="835.72" data-end="838.24">beginning and go again and let's as many</span> <span data-start="838.24" data-end="839.83">times in specify if you want infinite</span> <span data-start="839.83" data-end="848.53">loop you pass infinity ok events I'm</span> <span data-start="848.53" data-end="850.27">generally big fan of event driven</span> <span data-start="850.27" data-end="852.46">development and event-driven</span> <span data-start="852.46" data-end="854.62">architecture so I was thinking that</span> <span data-start="854.62" data-end="856.27">events is something the draw file is</span> <span data-start="856.27" data-end="859.93">missing so not so long ago i wrote the</span> <span data-start="859.93" data-end="862.63">library called EGS which is basically</span> <span data-start="862.63" data-end="865.15">event managing custom event managing</span> <span data-start="865.15" data-end="867.67">thing and somebody asked me yesterday</span> <span data-start="867.67" data-end="869.12">why I don't use some</span> <span data-start="869.12" data-end="872.24">some existing libraries for events well</span> <span data-start="872.24" data-end="873.8">basically because when I wrote it they</span> <span data-start="873.8" data-end="878.029">didn't exist yet so you could use</span> <span data-start="878.029" data-end="879.56">recovery for that so I'm not promoting</span> <span data-start="879.56" data-end="881.33">this library I mean you don't you don't</span> <span data-start="881.33" data-end="882.74">have to use it but Raphael have it</span> <span data-start="882.74" data-end="888.56">inside so how it works it work Raphael</span> <span data-start="888.56" data-end="890.839">always firing the events in the eve</span> <span data-start="890.839" data-end="892.76">space so you could always listen to</span> <span data-start="892.76" data-end="895.91">events and lots of internal features are</span> <span data-start="895.91" data-end="898.58">bounded on events but you can do it like</span> <span data-start="898.58" data-end="901.19">that so you could say okay Eve on an</span> <span data-start="901.19" data-end="903.71">animation do some function that means on</span> <span data-start="903.71" data-end="906.89">any animation event animation related</span> <span data-start="906.89" data-end="908.96">event in the Raphael it will call this</span> <span data-start="908.96" data-end="910.58">function so if you start animation stop</span> <span data-start="910.58" data-end="913.13">animation animation frame or you could</span> <span data-start="913.13" data-end="914.72">say on each animation start call me</span> <span data-start="914.72" data-end="917.06">function some animation started or each</span> <span data-start="917.06" data-end="919.91">animation start the idea of element for</span> <span data-start="919.91" data-end="921.38">this particular element called the</span> <span data-start="921.38" data-end="924.92">function all a niche animation related</span> <span data-start="924.92" data-end="926.66">event for this particular element of</span> <span data-start="926.66" data-end="929.36">this function all you get the point</span> <span data-start="929.36" data-end="937.13">again hope so this is a another thing I</span> <span data-start="937.13" data-end="941.75">had let's say you want to draw the the</span> <span data-start="941.75" data-end="943.97">polyline this is actually how your</span> <span data-start="943.97" data-end="945.65">approach to draw a line like that it's</span> <span data-start="945.65" data-end="948.47">very easy to do it in SVG or in Raphael</span> <span data-start="948.47" data-end="950.87">for that sake and the problem that it's</span> <span data-start="950.87" data-end="954.41">not always what you want sometimes it's</span> <span data-start="954.41" data-end="955.88">quite easy but it's sometimes you want</span> <span data-start="955.88" data-end="958.16">to cure and the only thing you know it's</span> <span data-start="958.16" data-end="960.41">points which curve is going through and</span> <span data-start="960.41" data-end="961.97">you don't really want to create its</span> <span data-start="961.97" data-end="963.95">pubic began thinking how they should go</span> <span data-start="963.95" data-end="967.04">so basically you need to draw the spline</span> <span data-start="967.04" data-end="969.29">so I had new Commons in Rafael so now</span> <span data-start="969.29" data-end="971.36">it's easier said you could create the</span> <span data-start="971.36" data-end="974.9">curve which without much trouble the</span> <span data-start="974.9" data-end="976.07">only difference that instead of</span> <span data-start="976.07" data-end="979.25">specifying the common l-proline you</span> <span data-start="979.25" data-end="982.19">specify common are and that will create</span> <span data-start="982.19" data-end="985.67">this shiny cove just specify the points</span> <span data-start="985.67" data-end="987.38">and to draw you the cough against around</span> <span data-start="987.38" data-end="989.839">this point just you can do it with the</span> <span
