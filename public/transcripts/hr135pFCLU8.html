<p><span data-start="122.009" data-end="126.1">Since reliable faster and engaging are pretty nebulous terms.</span> <span data-start="126.1" data-end="132.69">Google has developed a checklist to make these goals more concrete, including that the site</span> <span data-start="132.69" data-end="144.08">is served over HTTPS, pages are responsive, look good on desktop or mobile, any size,</span> <span data-start="144.08" data-end="151.72">that app URLs load while offline — highly relevant to this talk — that you can add your</span> <span data-start="151.72" data-end="156.47">app to the home screen, just like a native app.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="772.97" data-end="783.64">So, orbit use cases go beyond offline.</span> <span data-start="783.64" data-end="787.6">Orbit attempts to solve a number of problems.</span> <span data-start="787.6" data-end="795.11">Client-first development, where you're prototyping a feature without prototyping the back end</span> <span data-start="795.11" data-end="797.79">to fulfil it.</span> <span data-start="797.79" data-end="801.07">Pluggable sources.</span> <span data-start="801.07" data-end="807.48">Orbit's very interface-based, so sources that share interfaces can be substituted for each</span> <span data-start="807.48" data-end="808.48">other.</span> <span data-start="808.48" data-end="816.33">For instance, index DB could fall back to local storage.</span> <span data-start="816.33" data-end="822.5">Most modern web apps involve more than one source of data, often more than two.</span> <span data-start="822.5" data-end="831.81">If you're Wright an offline web app, at a minimum, you have browser storage, and remote</span> <span data-start="831.81" data-end="838.95">server, and you probably have an in-memory store, and you might even have data streaming</span> <span data-start="838.95" data-end="848.44">in from other sources like web sockets to service an event.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="848.44" data-end="858.73">And speaking of the main store, it's really nice to work with immutable data so be able</span> <span data-start="858.73" data-end="866.47">to fork stores, make edits, and throw away the edits or commit them back, merge them</span> <span data-start="866.47" data-end="876.2">back to the main store, but have total control over that process.</span> <span data-start="876.2" data-end="886.65">And orbit deterministically tracks changes to each source with the ability to undo or</span> <span data-start="886.65" data-end="894.34">redo those changes.</span> <span data-start="894.34" data-end="903.5">Because your apps work offline, they can work optimistically, even when other online.</span> <span data-start="903.5" data-end="911.28">They don't need to be hindered by a delay in the request-response cycle.</span> <span data-start="911.28" data-end="918.57">For some changes, you can optimistic about their application, and then only handle failures</span> <span data-start="918.57" data-end="919.92">as they come up.</span> <span data-start="919.92" data-end="930.41">But, show a success immediately to the user.</span> <span data-start="930.41" data-end="939.85">Stepping back philosophically, orbit considers all these sources of data that need to communicate</span> <span data-start="939.85" data-end="940.85">with each other.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="940.85" data-end="947.96">And they all have different data in different forms.</span> <span data-start="947.96" data-end="954.65">So we need to put common interfaces on them, and we need to normalise data that flows between</span> <span data-start="954.65" data-end="957.62">them.</span> <span data-start="957.62" data-end="962.48">They also need to communicate with each other.</span> <span data-start="962.48" data-end="964.31">That's done three event.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1262.64" data-end="1273.92">Queryable sources allow for query sources to be passed to a query method, and, again,</span> <span data-start="1273.92" data-end="1277.88">these can be labelled.</span> <span data-start="1277.88" data-end="1284.88">This is the raw form of a query expression, and this is the builder form.</span> <span data-start="1284.88" data-end="1292.88">We were requesting all the planets and sort them by name.</span> <span data-start="1292.88" data-end="1299.42">Something to focus on here is that all the sources that say implement the queryable interface</span> <span data-start="1299.42" data-end="1306.84">in your application are able to understand the same query expressions.</span> <span data-start="1306.84" data-end="1315.3">And so you can make a query against the memory store in the same way you can make a query</span> <span data-start="1315.3" data-end="1321.16">against your back-end remote store, or your in-memory store.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1401.37" data-end="1408.47">So, depending upon whether you want to be optimistic or pessimistic, you can customise</span> <span data-start="1408.47" data-end="1415.78">your strategies, and you can write your own completely custom strategies that have their</span> <span data-start="1415.78" data-end="1423.68">own JavaScript logic here, but there are just some that are provided for convenience.</span> <span data-start="1423.68" data-end="1430.78">Of course, things do go wrong, especially it would be irresponsible not to have some</span> <span data-start="1430.78" data-end="1439.79">failure handling in offline scenarios, or optimistic updating, and so, you might need</span> <span data-start="1439.79" data-end="1450.75">to write a strategy that responds to a failure event, and takes an action, like this here</span> <span data-start="1450.75" data-end="1460.71">is responding to a network error on the remote source, and it will retry the queue of actions</span> <span data-start="1460.71" data-end="1468.61">every five seconds.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1468.61" data-end="1476.24">In this scenario, we are communicating back to the user a failure based upon the label</span> <span data-start="1476.24" data-end="1485.29">that's put on in update, and then we are rolling back the transform to — we're rolling back</span> <span data-start="1485.29" data-end="1492.04">the store state just before that transform was applied.</span> <span data-start="1492.04" data-end="1497.2">Then we are skipping events on the remote source, so it's basically a reset.</span> <span data-start="1497.2" data-end="1498.59">We're throwing up our hands.</span> <span data-start="1498.59" data-end="1504.01">It could be — we could be a lot more sophisticated about this and do some reconciliation.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1605.88" data-end="1611.52">They don't need to be proxied in the service worker.</span> <span data-start="1611.52" data-end="1619.67">They might have sources like a store, a back-up source, which probably would be index DB,</span> <span data-start="1619.67" data-end="1627.47">and a remote, or a remote source, maybe a JSON API source, or you might want to add</span> <span data-start="1627.47" data-end="1637.71">a real time source like sockets, or service an event.</span> <span data-start="1637.71" data-end="1644.85">And then the process for booth an orbit PWA, the app shell fetched from the service worker</span> <span data-start="1644.85" data-end="1655.72">went offline, the stores populated with data from back-up, like the example I showed earlier,</span> <span data-start="1655.72" data-end="1661.52">and then the co-ordinators activated, and all the strategies are activated along with</span> <span data-start="1661.52" data-end="1666.4">it, so orbit can keep monitoring things.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1666.4" data-end="1672.24">Strategy might be something like this.</span> <span data-start="1672.24" data-end="1678.38">Everything that — every change to the store is synced to back-up; every change that happens,</span> <span data-start="1678.38" data-end="1685">that is observed on the remote source, syncs to the store; every time the store is queried,</span> <span data-start="1685" data-end="1693.47">a request is made to the remote source, and the same with updates.</span> <span data-start="1693.47" data-end="1702.169">So all of this allows us to finally check off that last item on our to-do list.</span> <span data-start="1702.169" data-end="1713.16">And it also allows us to add a whole bunch of more items, a whole bunch of more capabilities</span> <span data-start="1713.16" data-end="1724.46">for our app, whether it is offline, or online.</span> <span data-start="1724.46" data-end="1729.37">And I think the Downasaur is happy.</span> <span data-start="1729.37" data-end="1735.99">If you're interested in orbit, the guides are on the orbit.js.com.</span> <span data-start="1735.99" data-end="1740.11">I'm working to fully flesh out the site.</span> <span data-start="1740.11" data-end="1747.09">I hope it will get you started, and please feel free to follow orbit on Twitter if you're</span> <span data-start="1747.09" data-end="1751.25">interested.</span> <span data-start="1751.25" data-end="1752.25">Thanks very much.</span> </p>
