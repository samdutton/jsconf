we want to</span> <span data-start="1010.779" data-end="1012.88">change reality we have looked at reality</span> <span data-start="1012.88" data-end="1014.589">and we kind of don't like it so much so</span> <span data-start="1014.589" data-end="1016.029">we've invented our own and we're trying</span> <span data-start="1016.029" data-end="1017.709">to roll it out as well as we possibly</span> <span data-start="1017.709" data-end="1020.86">can one piece of reality that is</span> <span data-start="1020.86" data-end="1023.62">problematic are inline scripts inline</span> <span data-start="1023.62" data-end="1025.48">scripts are the biggest problem on the</span> <span data-start="1025.48" data-end="1027.459">web period but the biggest problem on</span> <span

data-start="1035.29" data-end="1037.689">right but if we allow self then that's</span> <span data-start="1037.689" data-end="1039.64">not only inline script on your origin</span> <span data-start="1039.64" data-end="1041.02">but also external script from your</span> <span data-start="1041.02" data-end="1043.059">origin so we've invented a new origin</span> <span

data-start="1051.309" data-end="1053.53">to you can whitelist it haha what we</span> <span data-start="1053.53" data-end="1054.64">would suggest however is that you</span> <span data-start="1054.64" data-end="1056.32">externalize the scripts to whatever</span> <span data-start="1056.32" data-end="1058.39">extent possible you pull it out into an</span> <span data-start="1058.39"

data-end="1077.32">we think is going to be a better</span> <span data-start="1077.32" data-end="1079.45">solution well actually what we've done</span> <span data-start="1079.45" data-end="1081.73">in

data-start="1102.66" data-end="1104.74">one thing that we're trying to do in</span> <span data-start="1104.74" data-end="1106.9">order to allow certain types of inline</span> <span data-start="1106.9" data-end="1109.78">script is using a nonce you send the</span> <span data-start="1109.78" data-end="1112.78">nonce as a valid origin in a script</span> <span data-start="1112.78" data-end="1115.48">source this nonce is then repeated as a</span> <span data-start="1115.48" data-end="1117.97">nonce attribute on scripts that come</span> <span data-start="1117.97" data-end="1120.22">into a page this allows the browser to</span> <span data-start="1120.22" data-end="1121.87">distinguish between scripts that the</span> <span data-start="1121.87"

data-end="1128.68">if an attacker hopefully doesn't know</span> <span data-start="1128.68" data-end="1130.36">the secret then it won't be able to</span> <span data-start="1130.36" data-end="1131.68">execute script because they won't be</span> <span data-start="1131.68" data-end="1134.11">able to get access to the nonce this is</span> <span data-start="1134.11"
