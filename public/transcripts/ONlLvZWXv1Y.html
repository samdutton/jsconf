<p><span data-start="227.77" data-end="231.51">And then if we have some time at the end, I would like to kind of share just a bit of</span> <span data-start="231.51" data-end="235.67">my story and experience with JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="235.67" data-end="240.22">With that, I would like to for two seconds give us some context for those who haven't</span> <span data-start="240.22" data-end="244.97">heard talk two seconds about the history of JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="244.97" data-end="249.75">So, and in the beginning the web platform was really immature.</span> <span data-start="249.75" data-end="250.75">Or just beginning.</span> <span data-start="250.75" data-end="256.68">And, you know, the future of the web at the time I think it was the '80s, I'm not even</span> <span data-start="256.68" data-end="260.799">sure, was foreseen as something that would be powered by Java, right?</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="289.33" data-end="296.76">And I don't even need we know what that's like, right?</span> <span data-start="296.76" data-end="303.54">I think while some would say that part of JavaScript is maybe what makes it weak or</span> <span data-start="303.54" data-end="308.29">unique, I would say that may have been one of the happiest accidents if it was an accident</span> <span data-start="308.29" data-end="310.15">in the history of our time.</span> <span data-start="310.15" data-end="311.88">And that's the reason I put the slide up there.</span> <span data-start="311.88" data-end="313.76">Now, let's get to the four things.</span> <span data-start="313.76" data-end="320.84">Number one.</span> <span data-start="320.84" data-end="325.07">I can already see some of the TypeScript people in the room judging me.</span> <span data-start="325.07" data-end="332.43">But let me tell you, I think dynamic typing with JavaScript is something that is weak</span> <span data-start="332.43" data-end="339.71">and that creates brittle applications, I have honestly not seen a more welcoming construct.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="339.71" data-end="345.4">Mainly because static typing as it stands is extra syntax.</span> <span data-start="345.4" data-end="346.77">And there's a lot to keep track of.</span> <span data-start="346.77" data-end="353.02">I mean, this is from feedback from friends of mine who were journalists, architects,</span> <span data-start="353.02" data-end="356.45">graphic designers with not a lot of web Dev or computer science experience.</span> <span data-start="356.45" data-end="360.87">All of them wanting a change from what they studied.</span> <span data-start="360.87" data-end="365.09">Guess what language they found a home?</span> <span data-start="365.09" data-end="368.18">Not TypeScript.</span> <span data-start="368.18" data-end="373.48">JavaScript by its nature of dynamic typing was the language of choice.</span> <span data-start="373.48" data-end="374.58">I believe this is the reason.</span> <span data-start="374.58" data-end="380.139">I believe through the dynamic nature of the language, what you get is the ability to go</span> <span data-start="380.139" data-end="386.48">from zero to, oh, my gosh, it's working, in a fraction of the time it would normally take.</span> <span data-start="386.48" data-end="391.27">I would also say that dynamic typing is educational.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="391.27" data-end="393.77">Absolutely educational.</span> <span data-start="393.77" data-end="398.32">And what I mean by that is it teaches you the need for static typing.</span> <span data-start="398.32" data-end="399.46">Right?</span> <span data-start="399.46" data-end="402.87">How many of you have been bitten by implicit coercion?</span> <span data-start="402.87" data-end="409.12">You try to do a computation and you get a nan, what can occur with the explicit JavaScript</span> <span data-start="409.12" data-end="414.52">conversion because of the dynamic type system.</span> <span data-start="414.52" data-end="418.8">What happens is really cool and something that I believe is unique to the JavaScript</span> <span data-start="418.8" data-end="420.36">community.</span> <span data-start="420.36" data-end="425.15">JavaScript as a syntax I would say is really, really, really friendly for the reasons we</span> <span data-start="425.15" data-end="426.15">discussed.</span> <span data-start="426.15" data-end="428.03">But I would say that's two sides of the same coin.</span> <span data-start="428.03" data-end="433.83">The other side being the helpful, supportive, inclusive community that I'm looking at right</span> <span data-start="433.83" data-end="435.37">now.</span> </p>
