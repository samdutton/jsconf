<p><span data-start="10.42" data-end="16.76">So, thank you very much for attending this talk pip hope you brought your hat for this</span> <span data-start="16.76" data-end="17.94">talk.</span> <span data-start="17.94" data-end="27.461">Did you ever wonder why organizations, companies or even the governments try to when you get</span> <span data-start="27.461" data-end="32.61">to the Internet and how they are able to do that even though you don't save the cookies</span> <span data-start="32.61" data-end="35.86">in your browser.</span> <span data-start="35.86" data-end="38.03">Your default.</span> <span data-start="38.03" data-end="43.579">We will cover a little bit about the whole history of the fingerprint in the web environment</span> <span data-start="43.579" data-end="44.649">and the browsers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="44.649" data-end="54.96">And towards the end we will talk a little bit more about more advanced fingerprint techniques.</span> <span data-start="54.96" data-end="58.14">And also, like how they try to mitigate them.</span> <span data-start="58.14" data-end="63.289">I say try because it's basically a cat/mouse game.</span> <span data-start="63.289" data-end="69.34">And they are in pursuit to circumvent our fingerprinting protections.</span> <span data-start="69.34" data-end="72.86">So, it's a game and the user always loses.</span> <span data-start="72.86" data-end="78.71">And the final thing I'm going to say in the talk is, I'm going to say the word "Attacker"</span> <span data-start="78.71" data-end="79.71">a lot.</span> <span data-start="79.71" data-end="86.86">When I say the word" Attacker," we can think about anyone who tries to demonize us.</span> <span data-start="86.86" data-end="89.729">Could be a company, advertiser, anything like that.</span> <span data-start="89.729" data-end="91.34">So, that's it.</span> <span data-start="91.34" data-end="95.87">So, like I said before, I work for the browser.</span> <span data-start="95.87" data-end="97.57">Mainly work on the mobile stuff.</span> <span data-start="97.57" data-end="100.02">I work with little bit with the fingerprinting.</span> <span data-start="100.02" data-end="108.03">If you have questions about the browser, complain, stop by and ask about it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="108.03" data-end="117.71">So, before I talk about track, we need to understand what is the motivation?</span> <span data-start="117.71" data-end="119.979">Like, it's a good word.</span> <span data-start="119.979" data-end="126.24">If we're talking about the different attacks, we need to think about the attacker's mentality.</span> <span data-start="126.24" data-end="133.4">So, we need to know why people want to attack the user once you demonize the user.</span> <span data-start="133.4" data-end="139.05">So, star developers, we have a design document.</span> <span data-start="139.05" data-end="145.44">And we think those are the mainly kind of goals of the attacker.</span> <span data-start="145.44" data-end="146.86">The first one is analytics.</span> <span data-start="146.86" data-end="151.97">So, people to want know organizations want to know what users do.</span> <span data-start="151.97" data-end="158.42">How many times a unique user accesses a site?</span> <span data-start="158.42" data-end="159.49">It's for analytics.</span> <span data-start="159.49" data-end="160.49">Target ads, personalization.</span> <span data-start="160.49" data-end="167.01">So, sometimes a company wants to have a hand wants to send the user a hand crafted experience.</span> <span data-start="167.01" data-end="173.1">So, it is by doing it, some things make sense.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="173.1" data-end="178.2">But we will have having a lot of sense.</span> <span data-start="178.2" data-end="180.15">For the detection as the organization.</span> <span data-start="180.15" data-end="190.61">And probably it's the most because they are made by trying to demonize it.</span> <span data-start="190.61" data-end="196.24">These are the main goals of attackers.</span> <span data-start="196.24" data-end="202.49">But before talking about fingerprint techniques we should understand why the fingerprint techniques</span> <span data-start="202.49" data-end="205.13">are more and more advanced at this stage.</span> <span data-start="205.13" data-end="208.18">And one of the motivations is because of the cookies.</span> <span data-start="208.18" data-end="209.58">So, I love this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="209.58" data-end="217.9">This quote from the L.A. Times from an article from 1996 where it says they are data that</span> <span data-start="217.9" data-end="220.75">can be stored to your PC.</span> <span data-start="220.75" data-end="223.77">And they access it every time you go back to the website.</span> <span data-start="223.77" data-end="232.79">And it says that sites because of the third party, it was not that clear at that time.</span> <span data-start="232.79" data-end="238.5">So, again, it was self contained to a single site.</span> <span data-start="238.5" data-end="241.53">And the cookies are really simple.</span> <span data-start="241.53" data-end="244.74">Probably everyone knows here how cookies work.</span> <span data-start="244.74" data-end="247.41">So, the first step, the user requests a web page.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="247.41" data-end="253.78">They send back the cage with the cookies using the cookie.</span> <span data-start="253.78" data-end="261.04">And finally, will the user access a page from the same website?</span> <span data-start="261.04" data-end="265.3">So, the server knows things on that page.</span> <span data-start="265.3" data-end="266.77">It's simple.</span> <span data-start="266.77" data-end="268.25">It's easy.</span> <span data-start="268.25" data-end="275.95">But what's happened after the cookie was created was people were able to attack users.</span> <span data-start="275.95" data-end="278.66">They were able to attack users.</span> <span data-start="278.66" data-end="281.25">Especially like advertisers and trackers.</span> <span data-start="281.25" data-end="290.29">And they did that because cookies are really easy to [audio cutting out to Skype] and it's</span> <span data-start="290.29" data-end="292.17">almost the same.</span> <span data-start="292.17" data-end="315.81">The only difference is the main change, you have an advertiser.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="315.81" data-end="317.28">Normally they're a friend.</span> <span data-start="317.28" data-end="322.56">So, they have the domain.</span> <span data-start="322.56" data-end="326.36">The user sends to the website.</span> <span data-start="326.36" data-end="331.92">The advertiser and their content websites.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="331.92" data-end="334.55">The server sends the content to the advertiser.</span> <span data-start="334.55" data-end="336.72">And the advertiser also sets it up.</span> <span data-start="336.72" data-end="345.68">But when you go to another website, the advertiser reads that cookie and they know what kind</span> <span data-start="345.68" data-end="347.02">of site did you visit.</span> <span data-start="347.02" data-end="354.37">So, this is a good example created by like and working with privacy.</span> <span data-start="354.37" data-end="361.23">Sometimes, for example, we test the news websites.</span> <span data-start="361.23" data-end="365.7">And later on, you can access health websites.</span> <span data-start="365.7" data-end="368.83">Search for a curser or something like that.</span> <span data-start="368.83" data-end="373.07">And now they advertise what you are doing.</span> <span data-start="373.07" data-end="379.139">So, the third party is attached to this.</span> <span data-start="379.139" data-end="384.45">But a few people felt lots about that.</span> <span data-start="384.45" data-end="390.96">For example, and this created a bunch of ad blockers.</span> <span data-start="390.96" data-end="400.5">You have privacy badge, and in from EFF, block, a bunch of ad blockers try to event third</span> <span data-start="400.5" data-end="402.23">party cookies.</span> <span data-start="402.23" data-end="409.03">However, what's happened to us, preventing cookies is not enough anymore.</span> <span data-start="409.03" data-end="415.95">You need you need to show how the browser behaves to have really privacy these days.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="415.95" data-end="423.84">Because JavaScript, CSS, how HTTP protocol behaves.</span> <span data-start="423.84" data-end="428.9">It like exposes the user locality.</span> <span data-start="428.9" data-end="432.3">Besides the user locality, it exposes the user's machine.</span> <span data-start="432.3" data-end="435">What kind of machine I am.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="435" data-end="440.35">It's exposed what language the user navigates on the Internet.</span> <span data-start="440.35" data-end="445.18">So, all the tools are amazing, but they are not enough right now.</span> <span data-start="445.18" data-end="449.99">If you want to really have privacy, they are not enough.</span> <span data-start="449.99" data-end="456.13">So, let's talk a little bit about the browser fingerprints.</span> <span data-start="456.13" data-end="464.56">The browser, like I said, we have a document, a design documentation where we talk about</span> <span data-start="464.56" data-end="473.12">what kind of fingerprint attacks trackers, advertisers, governments try on users.</span> <span data-start="473.12" data-end="479.98">And the four of them are request behavior, JavaScript attackers, CSS attackers and plugins.</span> <span data-start="479.98" data-end="485.76">We're to the going to talk about plugins because if you are using a plugin, you are screwing</span> <span data-start="485.76" data-end="486.76">up.</span> <span data-start="486.76" data-end="487.76">Sorry.</span> <span data-start="487.76" data-end="494.01">So, the first one, the most simple is the behavior attack.</span> <span data-start="494.01" data-end="501.33">And basically, it is when you are requesting content from a server and it's really about</span> <span data-start="501.33" data-end="503.21">the user agents.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="503.21" data-end="504.4">There are others.</span> <span data-start="504.4" data-end="512.089">But the others are more the HTTP level the HTTP connection level, people are able to</span> <span data-start="512.089" data-end="516.14">get the HTTP specification.</span> <span data-start="516.14" data-end="518.87">This is the simplest one.</span> <span data-start="518.87" data-end="520.55">A good example is accept language.</span> <span data-start="520.55" data-end="527.79">So, an attacker or advertiser knows you are an English speaker if you say language English,</span> <span data-start="527.79" data-end="530.98">U.S. Or accepting code.</span> <span data-start="530.98" data-end="535.85">And every browser has a different accept encoding.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="535.85" data-end="542.27">So, trackers or malware people, malware attackers, they know what browser you are on and can</span> <span data-start="542.27" data-end="547.36">provide you malware specific for you.</span> <span data-start="547.36" data-end="558.17">And the user agents, so, every time you access websites, they apply to the machine.</span> <span data-start="558.17" data-end="564.58">So, it's from the past and we never changed that.</span> <span data-start="564.58" data-end="569.67">The other one is, think more about JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="569.67" data-end="576.79">JavaScript is really interesting because it's a language that allows you to do anything</span> <span data-start="576.79" data-end="577.79">and everything.</span> <span data-start="577.79" data-end="581.779">And in this side, when you do anything and everything, it's terrible.</span> <span data-start="581.779" data-end="586.75">So, I don't know if you ever use it the top browser.</span> <span data-start="586.75" data-end="595.33">And you can use the secret slides, it can change how much safe you want.</span> <span data-start="595.33" data-end="602.31">For example, the default option on JavaScript, you are able to play video and be able to</span> <span data-start="602.31" data-end="603.58">play audio.</span> <span data-start="603.58" data-end="612.2">But when you move up a little bit to the safe to a more safer privacy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="612.2" data-end="615.25">We start to disable things from the browser.</span> <span data-start="615.25" data-end="618.56">Start to disable JavaScript, video.</span> <span data-start="618.56" data-end="619.75">Save audio.</span> <span data-start="619.75" data-end="625.93">So, the first thing is the navigate objects.</span> <span data-start="625.93" data-end="626.93">The dot navigate objects.</span> <span data-start="626.93" data-end="628.89">This object exposes so many things.</span> <span data-start="628.89" data-end="632.76">Like, for example, this is an example exposed by language.</span> <span data-start="632.76" data-end="634.45">Even expose what part am I?</span> <span data-start="634.45" data-end="638.54">And this shows up and I took it from my Macbook.</span> <span data-start="638.54" data-end="642.68">It says Mac can tell.</span> <span data-start="642.68" data-end="645.76">The attacker knows that I'm on a Macbook.</span> <span data-start="645.76" data-end="646.81">And it's scary.</span> <span data-start="646.81" data-end="648.13">Really scary.</span> <span data-start="648.13" data-end="654.73">Especially for, I'm in this, I'm so crazy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="654.73" data-end="655.73">It's really scary.</span> <span data-start="655.73" data-end="660.45">GS is posting this much information.</span> <span data-start="660.45" data-end="666.6">Other one is GS other GS information is on the screen.</span> <span data-start="666.6" data-end="675.36">So, the problem about the screen is because when you're mobile or when you are on a notebook,</span> <span data-start="675.36" data-end="677.2">when you are mobile, especially Android.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="677.2" data-end="684.94">Android has so many sometimes you are able to learn what this specific device does on</span> <span data-start="684.94" data-end="685.94">the screen.</span> <span data-start="685.94" data-end="692.72">So, in this example we show like the whole screen for the Macbook and also the pixel</span> <span data-start="692.72" data-end="694.05">is scary.</span> <span data-start="694.05" data-end="697.38">You should never expose that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="697.38" data-end="699.279">So, we tried to mitigate that.</span> <span data-start="699.279" data-end="701.68">Like make it in a new form.</span> <span data-start="701.68" data-end="705.43">There's two kind of mitigations.</span> <span data-start="705.43" data-end="706.87">Researchers explain in the papers.</span> <span data-start="706.87" data-end="709.55">The first one is make everything in a form.</span> <span data-start="709.55" data-end="712.779">All the users should have the same values.</span> <span data-start="712.779" data-end="715.13">It's the approach you use on top browser.</span> <span data-start="715.13" data-end="720.8">And the other one is make summarize each user is.</span> <span data-start="720.8" data-end="727.61">We don't do that because it's a little bit hard to do that.</span> <span data-start="727.61" data-end="731.839">To do that without adding issues to the browser.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="731.839" data-end="734.62">Because every time you access something, it's going to make a noise.</span> <span data-start="734.62" data-end="738.57">And we can make an issue.</span> <span data-start="738.57" data-end="742.84">So, we make like dates, vendors.</span> <span data-start="742.84" data-end="744.68">We try to make everything universal.</span> <span data-start="744.68" data-end="747.27">So, for example, dates.</span> <span data-start="747.27" data-end="751.88">If you are using your top browser and you instantiate objects.</span> <span data-start="751.88" data-end="757.11">And you see the user, and they are all in the zero.</span> <span data-start="757.11" data-end="759.55">All of them are each.</span> <span data-start="759.55" data-end="762.73">We try to normalize them.</span> <span data-start="762.73" data-end="764.86">All the vendors are the same.</span> <span data-start="764.86" data-end="770.68">We try to build up the language inside the browser to normalize everything.</span> <span data-start="770.68" data-end="775.52">All the fonts in the browser to make it the same across everywhere.</span> <span data-start="775.52" data-end="779.27">So, we try to make everything universal.</span> <span data-start="779.27" data-end="783.83">So, the second one is the web value.</span> <span data-start="783.83" data-end="785.86">The web value is amazing API.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="785.86" data-end="794.18">I remember when I went to release it and the gamer developers were like insanely excited</span> <span data-start="794.18" data-end="797.87">about that because they were able to do a bunch of stuff.</span> <span data-start="797.87" data-end="811.37">However, since 2016/2015, a few researchers say how do people play on websites?</span> <span data-start="811.37" data-end="819.18">The user is able to hear the audio, but it will be playing in the background.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="819.18" data-end="822.64">And it will be used to track users.</span> <span data-start="822.64" data-end="823.79">But why?</span> <span data-start="823.79" data-end="826.66">The first thing is the context.</span> <span data-start="826.66" data-end="831.801">So, every time you create a web browser object in this group, every time you go to use the</span> <span data-start="831.801" data-end="833.85">web browser, you must create the context.</span> <span data-start="833.85" data-end="840.33">The context exposes so much information about your machine and it is unique.</span> <span data-start="840.33" data-end="845.48">Even if you have two Macbooks from the same year and the same day, they are unique.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="845.48" data-end="850.12">For instance, this is totally different from the machine.</span> <span data-start="850.12" data-end="853.38">Document time is also didn't from machine to machine.</span> <span data-start="853.38" data-end="857.02">Nothing is unique.</span> <span data-start="857.02" data-end="861.05">Like in mention, sometimes they have the two numbers in the same and other things are the</span> <span data-start="861.05" data-end="862.11">same across machines.</span> <span data-start="862.11" data-end="867.95">But objects can expose some information about the user.</span> <span data-start="867.95" data-end="872.089">So, we try to normalize a little bit as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="872.089" data-end="875.48">And there's other this one's the most scary one.</span> <span data-start="875.48" data-end="880.79">So, this graph is when I play one single audio.</span> <span data-start="880.79" data-end="882.26">But these are not able to hear.</span> <span data-start="882.26" data-end="887.07">I just created audio context and play that.</span> <span data-start="887.07" data-end="893.339">So, the bluish line is the baseline created by the experience.</span> <span data-start="893.339" data-end="897.16">And the red line, red curve, it's my machine.</span> <span data-start="897.16" data-end="900.45">So, one machine is different from another machine.</span> <span data-start="900.45" data-end="906.01">Doesn't matter if you were bought on the same day in the same place.</span> <span data-start="906.01" data-end="908.49">It has the psalm configuration.</span> <span data-start="908.49" data-end="910.76">Each machine is didn't from another machine.</span> <span data-start="910.76" data-end="916.73">So, when you play this audio, you can see a difference between them.</span> <span data-start="916.73" data-end="921.25">So, this block here, this organization is created using these codes.</span> <span data-start="921.25" data-end="928.33">This code was in the previous line there is a paper and this block of code was taken from</span> <span data-start="928.33" data-end="929.33">the paper.</span> <span data-start="929.33" data-end="933.279">And this code is really simple.</span> <span data-start="933.279" data-end="938">Create an answer, create and play back.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="938" data-end="940.18">After that, you get the data, get the frequency.</span> <span data-start="940.18" data-end="943.39">And the frequency is different for each user.</span> <span data-start="943.39" data-end="949.54">And even worse, not just each browser, but each browser version is different.</span> <span data-start="949.54" data-end="954.329">So, if I play this code, if I don't know.</span> <span data-start="954.329" data-end="958.2">59, if I do 60, we are talking different values.</span> <span data-start="958.2" data-end="965.79">So, it is crazy, and fits everything from the web.</span> <span data-start="965.79" data-end="972.61">So, it's like it was almost impossible to make it uniform without breaking the whole</span> <span data-start="972.61" data-end="975.48">user experience.</span> <span data-start="975.48" data-end="982.19">And probably it's so simple to explore and so many people explore that.</span> <span data-start="982.19" data-end="985">It's the time based side channels.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="985" data-end="991.43">One thing about JavaScript is, like I said before, the CPU, you can get the same CPU,</span> <span data-start="991.43" data-end="995.76">the same built into the same date and they will have few differences.</span> <span data-start="995.76" data-end="997.71">So, JavaScript is really complex.</span> <span data-start="997.71" data-end="1001.85">JavaScript has an adjustment time, a minimum agent.</span> <span data-start="1001.85" data-end="1003.47">Each is different.</span> <span data-start="1003.47" data-end="1008.269">And JavaScript runs on top of the CPU because of the JavaScript just in time.</span> <span data-start="1008.269" data-end="1018.35">Based on that, we are able to know huge function takes to run and look into that.</span> <span data-start="1018.35" data-end="1026.059">So, a good example of that is all those functions here we were able to calculate the difference</span> <span data-start="1026.059" data-end="1030.929">between where a function runs and use the function to calculate that.</span> <span data-start="1030.929" data-end="1035.139">A good example is a block of code that's really simple.</span> <span data-start="1035.139" data-end="1042.029">It's basically so, it was written by Andrew Bartz in 2007.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1042.029" data-end="1046.669">The channels are known for like years and years and years.</span> <span data-start="1046.669" data-end="1055.379">And this is an example, basically, they want to know how long the works in the browser</span> <span data-start="1055.379" data-end="1059.789">results when the source is not an image.</span> <span data-start="1059.789" data-end="1064.57">For example, in the line nine, if you look at the line nine, the test of the source and</span> <span data-start="1064.57" data-end="1066.139">the damage.</span> <span data-start="1066.139" data-end="1074.659">With this code we know how long the browser the browser sends to the stack and they do</span> <span data-start="1074.659" data-end="1080.91">the computations and filters out, okay, this is not an image.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1080.91" data-end="1084.399">So, like, it's a really simple code.</span> <span data-start="1084.399" data-end="1089.96">And there is we can do kind of things, the kind of attack</span> <span data-start="1089.96" data-end="1095.57">And the thing we do, we try to remove granularity.</span> <span data-start="1095.57" data-end="1098.659">We claim 200 milliseconds.</span> <span data-start="1098.659" data-end="1109.419">If you get it now and it is attracted by other performance stuff, the variable will be 100</span> <span data-start="1109.419" data-end="1110.659">milliseconds.</span> <span data-start="1110.659" data-end="1118.799">It's the best we can do because everyone agrees side channels, basically the type of channels</span> <span data-start="1118.799" data-end="1120.529">are terrible.</span> <span data-start="1120.529" data-end="1123.76">And basically, we should remove it from JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1123.76" data-end="1126.389">However, it's not possible to break the whole web.</span> <span data-start="1126.389" data-end="1129.279">So, this is an alternative.</span> <span data-start="1129.279" data-end="1130.94">We try to cut the variable.</span> <span data-start="1130.94" data-end="1132.5">And it works reasonably.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1132.5" data-end="1135.359">But, again, it's not a silver bullet.</span> <span data-start="1135.359" data-end="1136.851">We know that someone can explore that.</span> <span data-start="1136.851" data-end="1141.049">That people are able to explore that.</span> <span data-start="1141.049" data-end="1144.259">Like even increase a little bit more of the timer.</span> <span data-start="1144.259" data-end="1149.25">But like for the majority of the attackers, it works.</span> <span data-start="1149.25" data-end="1150.879">The other things that cover today.</span> <span data-start="1150.879" data-end="1158.76">And we cover today, because each browser has a different library.</span> <span data-start="1158.76" data-end="1164.259">And each graphics library, even for different operating systems renders differently.</span> <span data-start="1164.259" data-end="1170.639">So, the key for the attack, where there's a bunch of things on the screen using few</span> <span data-start="1170.639" data-end="1173.809">text, few style, few reqs.</span> <span data-start="1173.809" data-end="1180.82">And use that to get the data and the image and sent to a server.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1180.82" data-end="1185.35">This image is basically a key and a map.</span> <span data-start="1185.35" data-end="1190.33">So, we tried a different approach to mitigate that.</span> <span data-start="1190.33" data-end="1193.11">But sadly, it was complex to the user.</span> <span data-start="1193.11" data-end="1201.429">We tried to access the HTML files and it shows a pop up on my screen saying, okay, this user</span> <span data-start="1201.429" data-end="1206.96">has tried to go to the image from the browser.</span> <span data-start="1206.96" data-end="1210.809">And you're like, you cannot allow, you can allow.</span> <span data-start="1210.809" data-end="1217.479">So, it's for the user, it was the best we could do we could do about that.</span> <span data-start="1217.479" data-end="1219.499">Like that attack.</span> <span data-start="1219.499" data-end="1222.549">I think Mozilla's explaining a little bit.</span> <span data-start="1222.549" data-end="1225.83">Mozilla is using the same thing a little bit.</span> <span data-start="1225.83" data-end="1229.94">But right now, they are kind of following the same idea as well.</span> <span data-start="1229.94" data-end="1234.239">Now talking a little bit about CSS.</span> <span data-start="1234.239" data-end="1241.519">With our same property that trackers are able to fingerprint the line heights.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1241.519" data-end="1249.58">So, line heights, they are simple, and they okay.</span> <span data-start="1249.58" data-end="1250.899">And the font size.</span> <span data-start="1250.899" data-end="1255.84">So, but for different machines, those are different.</span> <span data-start="1255.84" data-end="1256.84">Especially on Firefox.</span> <span data-start="1256.84" data-end="1263.379">So, in Firefox, if you get the line height from if you get the default line height so,</span> <span data-start="1263.379" data-end="1266.22">for Linux, it's lines and pixels.</span> <span data-start="1266.22" data-end="1269.009">It's 19 dot pixels.</span> <span data-start="1269.009" data-end="1276.489">And sometimes it's 19 but what's happening?</span> <span data-start="1276.489" data-end="1279.44">It's because fonts are broken.</span> <span data-start="1279.44" data-end="1280.44">Fonts are terrible.</span> <span data-start="1280.44" data-end="1281.44">And really hard to create a font.</span> <span data-start="1281.44" data-end="1283.37">It's really hard to create a font.</span> <span data-start="1283.37" data-end="1291.639">And each like each machine each browser, each assistant has a different default font.</span> <span data-start="1291.639" data-end="1293.859">And each font has an official.</span> <span data-start="1293.859" data-end="1302.729">So, it is like on Firefox where it uses the font from the system, the font from the system,</span> <span data-start="1302.729" data-end="1304.13">the line height's different.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1304.13" data-end="1308.58">So, we also try to uniform that.</span> <span data-start="1308.58" data-end="1316.619">So, we had the default be instead of the font size, we need to make sure it's what that</span> <span data-start="1316.619" data-end="1320.45">agency recommends so we're following the specification at least.</span> <span data-start="1320.45" data-end="1325.809">But, again, it's not amazing ID.</span> <span data-start="1325.809" data-end="1328.629">It should be fixed in the font size instead of in the fonts.</span> <span data-start="1328.629" data-end="1333.44">And from that side instead of browser side.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1333.44" data-end="1336.34">And talking a little bit more about this.</span> <span data-start="1336.34" data-end="1340.039">These are able to track you.</span> <span data-start="1340.039" data-end="1341.799">Like the properties.</span> <span data-start="1341.799" data-end="1348.36">We have like the best device heights, are able to strike the device.</span> <span data-start="1348.36" data-end="1351.419">The user's machine device size.</span> <span data-start="1351.419" data-end="1355.019">So, we also uniform those values.</span> <span data-start="1355.019" data-end="1358.85">So, the default puts the 1.0.</span> <span data-start="1358.85" data-end="1362.149">We create for the height.</span> <span data-start="1362.149" data-end="1363.739">We also make them uniform.</span> <span data-start="1363.739" data-end="1370.2">So, when someone tries to know what's the size of your device, like what's the size</span> <span data-start="1370.2" data-end="1371.49">of your device?</span> <span data-start="1371.49" data-end="1374.82">We lie to the requester.</span> <span data-start="1374.82" data-end="1383.48">And the last thing I didn't talk about is we do also something about cookies.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1383.48" data-end="1386.609">And Mozilla called that first by isolation, what we do.</span> <span data-start="1386.609" data-end="1388.47">We are a little bit more fancy.</span> <span data-start="1388.47" data-end="1392.399">We have a trademark.</span> <span data-start="1392.399" data-end="1397.64">And basically, it is it isolates all the identifier source.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1397.64" data-end="1401.049">By what are the source cookies?</span> <span data-start="1401.049" data-end="1402.169">Shared work?</span> <span data-start="1402.169" data-end="1403.299">Web storage?</span> <span data-start="1403.299" data-end="1410.58">For example, when you are accessing a website, and it has a frame.</span> <span data-start="1410.58" data-end="1423.629">In iFrame we isolate inside of iFrame, all the workers, storage, WebGL.</span> <span data-start="1423.629" data-end="1428.149">We try to translate everything for the URL.</span> <span data-start="1428.149" data-end="1432.549">The URL is a key to any identified source.</span> <span data-start="1432.549" data-end="1434.769">It looks simple.</span> <span data-start="1434.769" data-end="1439.399">However, it breaks the whole web when enable that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1439.399" data-end="1441.82">So, it is why Mozilla doesn't have it on by default.</span> <span data-start="1441.82" data-end="1447.769">We need it enabled for isolation.</span> <span data-start="1447.769" data-end="1454.22">Programmers, they want to be able to communicate across the whole domain.</span> <span data-start="1454.22" data-end="1458.649">And we don't allow that anymore with the isolation.</span> <span data-start="1458.649" data-end="1460.399">Thank you, guys.</span> </p>
