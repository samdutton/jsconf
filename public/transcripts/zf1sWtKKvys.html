data-start="121.679" data-end="123.119">just talk a little bit about what the</span> <span data-start="123.119" data-end="125.249">nes is a lot of you'll probably heard of</span> <span

you do the</span> <span data-start="140.04" data-end="141.66">stats there and the key part is we only</span> <span data-start="141.66" data-end="142.47">have</span> <span data-start="142.47" data-end="143.97">a little more than two thousand bytes of</span> <span data-start="143.97" data-end="149.7">RAM so not a lot to operate too good so</span> <span data-start="149.7" data-end="152.67">Ness ma'am is a way that we can access</span> <span data-start="152.67" data-end="155.37">the ram in the NES while it's running we</span> <span data-start="155.37" data-end="156.77">can read it and we can write to it</span> <span data-start="156.77" data-end="158.91">manipulate it and basically kind of act</span> <span data-start="158.91" data-end="162.21">as a

limit you can do</span> <span data-start="166.35" data-end="168.87">really insane cheat codes with it just</span> <span data-start="168.87" data-end="171.6">kind of types of experiments you know</span> <span data-start="171.6" data-end="173.22">like like weird things you just kind of</span> <span data-start="173.22" data-end="175.8">have fun with and it works both in</span> <span data-start="175.8" data-end="177.39">software and in hardware which we'll</span> <span data-start="177.39" data-end="180.14">talk a little bit more later in the talk</span> <span data-start="180.14" data-end="181.95">so yeah so that some of the things that</span> <span data-start="181.95" data-end="185.459">were inspired and that we were inspired</span> <span data-start="185.459" data-end="188.22">by angie was previous work with the dual</span> <span data-start="188.22" data-end="191.06">port ram was using python as a front-end</span> <span data-start="191.06" data-end="194.16">rendered graphics that way there's an</span> <span data-start="194.16" data-end="197.19">emulator called fce UX it's the most</span> <span data-start="197.19" data-end="198.99">featured emulator I guess you could say</span> <span data-start="198.99" data-end="202.44">for the NES it's a technically</span> <span data-start="202.44" data-end="204.54">cross-platform but in Windows it has</span> <span data-start="204.54" data-end="207">more features it has a scripting engine</span> <span data-start="207" data-end="209.61">in Lua which allows you to do similar</span> <span data-start="209.61" data-end="211.709">things to this where you can modify</span> <span data-start="211.709" data-end="213.42">graphics modify memory things like that</span> <span data-start="213.42" data-end="215.16">yes and we are really interesting</span> <span data-start="215.16" data-end="217.23">developer features is why we kind of</span> <span data-start="217.23" data-end="219.45">flock to it yeah out of a really cool</span> <span data-start="219.45" data-end="220.95">stuff you can do and that kind of you</span> <span data-start="220.95" data-end="222.78">know this definitely inspired forward</span> <span data-start="222.78" data-end="224.13">you have a hex editor you kind of look</span> <span data-start="224.13" data-end="225.45">at the ram while it's running but we</span> <span data-start="225.45" data-end="226.98">wanted to bring it to hardware right and</span> <span data-start="226.98" data-end="229.53">an accessory called the game genie was</span> <span data-start="229.53" data-end="231.42">was around back there in the NES that</span> <span data-start="231.42" data-end="234.9">allowed you to modify memory addresses</span> <span data-start="234.9" data-end="236.85">in the system but it was like you to do</span> <span data-start="236.85" data-end="238.17">it beforehand and it's kind of hard to</span> <span data-start="238.17" data-end="239.549">use it was a little weird and awkward</span> <span data-start="239.549" data-end="241.799">and you put a game cartridge into the</span> <span data-start="241.799" data-end="243.66">game training game shooting into the</span> <span data-start="243.66" data-end="246.42">system yeah you your one friend in grade</span> <span data-start="246.42" data-end="247.56">school that you might have actually</span> <span data-start="247.56" data-end="249.09">liked maybe had a game genie and you</span> <span data-start="249.09" data-end="250.11">would hang out with him just so you can</span> <span data-start="250.11" data-end="253.38">use it okay so just going to give you an</span> <span data-start="253.38" data-end="254.489">idea of what you can do with this we're</span> <span data-start="254.489" data-end="257.13">gonna do a quick demo okay so mm yeah</span> <span data-start="257.13" data-end="258.359">can we switch one of these screens to</span> <span data-start="258.359" data-end="267.3">the nes oh wow cool live demos yeah okay</span> <span data-start="267.3" data-end="271.41">so I thought that might happen so right</span> <span data-start="271.41" data-end="273.63">now we have the on the back of the</span> <span data-start="273.63" data-end="276">console there's an additional port here</span> <span data-start="276" data-end="277.53">and it's just a you are took a serial</span> <span data-start="277.53" data-end="280.56">port and we're reading it over and we'll</span> <span data-start="280.56" data-end="281.82">go over the background but right now</span> <span data-start="281.82" data-end="283.95">this is feeding live through USB to this</span> <span data-start="283.95" data-end="285.93">machine and Dustin will go over the</span> <span data-start="285.93" data-end="288.75">architecture but on things that annoyed</span> <span data-start="288.75" data-end="290.49">me most about this game is that you</span> <span data-start="290.49" data-end="292.16">can't see the score while you're playing</span> <span data-start="292.16" data-end="298.71">so this is a live representation of the</span> <span data-start="298.71" data-end="302.97">score and the so come yeah out of the</span> <span data-start="302.97" data-end="305.19">score and period they just scored yeah</span> <span data-start="305.19" data-end="307.41">great so actually you really can't see</span> <span data-start="307.41" data-end="309.18">it until you score so like sometimes its</span> <span data-start="309.18" data-end="310.83">neck and neck and you forget on a really</span> <span data-start="310.83" data-end="311.97">high scoring do you mean my cousin got</span> <span data-start="311.97" data-end="315.66">really competitive to put this so yeah</span> <span data-start="315.66" data-end="317.31">maybe let it run until you know the</span> <span data-start="317.31" data-end="319.349">timer updates live yeah and that's</span> <span data-start="319.349" data-end="321.15">reading from brand like real time just</span> <span data-start="321.15" data-end="323.49">funneling tons of bytes over the that</span> <span data-start="323.49" data-end="325.08">stream right yes not stimulated by like</span> <span data-start="325.08" data-end="326.039">counting down or something like that</span> <span data-start="326.039" data-end="327.87">it's coming yet it's raw it's actually</span> <span data-start="327.87" data-end="330.33">frame four separate decimal coded bites</span> <span data-start="330.33" data-end="335.25">so yeah and then TSA kind of manhandled</span> <span data-start="335.25" data-end="337.02">by bag and broke some my hardware but I</span> <span data-start="337.02" data-end="339.36">guess that's what I get it's okay i have</span> <span data-start="339.36" data-end="342.27">a video of it running but it was was</span> <span data-start="342.27" data-end="346.03">pretty much all for this</span> <span data-start="346.04" data-end="351.79">so we played this game a lot and the</span> <span data-start="351.79" data-end="356.06">yeah but completely lost his mind they</span> <span data-start="356.06" data-end="358.28">had seen it so we were just looking for</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="358.28" data-end="359.83">I was just looking for ways to</span> <span data-start="359.83" data-end="362.96">non-intrusive Lee extend a game that I</span> <span data-start="362.96" data-end="363.98">already liked without calling like a</span> <span data-start="363.98" data-end="366.23">hack or like disassembling it or reverse</span> <span data-start="366.23" data-end="367.49">engineering it I really want to just</span> <span data-start="367.49" data-end="369.23">take the information that's kind of</span> <span data-start="369.23" data-end="370.97">hidden to you and get like this third</span> <span data-start="370.97" data-end="372.95">eye into all the stuff that's going on</span> <span data-start="372.95" data-end="374.72">and then you could extend it however you</span> <span data-start="374.72" data-end="376.73">like there's like millions idea every</span> <span data-start="376.73" data-end="379.1">time I mean it's probably how this both</span> <span data-start="379.1" data-end="380.57">started with Dustin we talked about like</span> <span data-start="380.57" data-end="382.16">oh but what about this what about double</span> <span data-start="382.16" data-end="384.44">dragon what about you know we go you</span> <span data-start="384.44" data-end="386.09">know through all these ideas of stuff</span> <span data-start="386.09" data-end="388.19">you wish we could have done you know</span> <span data-start="388.19" data-end="390.5">game genie just wasn't enough I wasn't</span> <span data-start="390.5" data-end="393.5">enough so a quick overview of what</span> <span data-start="393.5" data-end="396.35">exactly we're working with here dismiss</span> <span data-start="396.35" data-end="399.68">cool so this is a diagram showing the</span> <span data-start="399.68" data-end="401.66">layout of the address space of the NES a</span> <span data-start="401.66" data-end="403.64">pet machine but it has a 16-bit address</span> <span data-start="403.64" data-end="405.89">which is why you see for hex bytes there</span> <span data-start="405.89" data-end="409.1">it's text on the left and the way the</span> <span data-start="409.1" data-end="410.93">memory works is the first eight pages</span> <span data-start="410.93" data-end="413.45">which is the two thousand bytes that's</span> <span data-start="413.45" data-end="414.47">the ram so that's the part that we're</span> <span data-start="414.47" data-end="417.11">targeting below that you have addresses</span> <span data-start="417.11" data-end="418.52">that when you read and write to control</span> <span data-start="418.52" data-end="421.28">the input devices the graphics the sound</span> <span data-start="421.28" data-end="423.26">below that certain cartridges have were</span> <span data-start="423.26" data-end="424.37">crammed we're not going to really touch</span> <span data-start="424.37" data-end="426.35">on that here but you don't just so you</span> <span data-start="426.35" data-end="427.88">know it's there and then below that is</span> <span data-start="427.88" data-end="429.89">where the game rom is so the stuff that</span> <span data-start="429.89" data-end="432.14">specific to each cartridge the the</span> <span data-start="432.14" data-end="436.1">graphics and sort of the the code the</span> <span data-start="436.1" data-end="438.65">levels the music sound effects all the</span> <span data-start="438.65" data-end="440.15">data for the game is in is in the rom</span> <span data-start="440.15" data-end="441.47">down there so again can't touch that</span> <span data-start="441.47" data-end="444.55">we're just living on the top there so</span> <span data-start="444.55" data-end="448.13">okay so Ness them the the system that we</span> <span data-start="448.13" data-end="450.44">have kind of looks like this on the left</span> <span data-start="450.44" data-end="452.36">you have a script you write for each</span> <span data-start="452.36" data-end="454.34">game and the idea is that they're very</span> <span data-start="454.34" data-end="456.83">convenient to make their simple you can</span> <span data-start="456.83" data-end="459.02">iterate really quickly with them in the</span> <span data-start="459.02" data-end="460.78">middle on top there you see the engine</span> <span data-start="460.78" data-end="464.75">all JavaScript stuff that kind of you</span> <span data-start="464.75" data-end="465.62">know middle where is it all together</span> <span data-start="465.62" data-end="467.72">does a bunch of magic if a web server</span> <span data-start="467.72" data-end="469.96">that handles the graphics on the bottom</span> <span data-start="469.96" data-end="472.19">client browser attaches and that's where</span> <span data-start="472.19" data-end="473.84">you get things like that scoreboard all</span> <span data-start="473.84" data-end="475.59">rendered in the client</span> <span data-start="475.59" data-end="477.06">browser running you know browse your</span> <span data-start="477.06" data-end="480">style JavaScript the right is the kind</span> <span data-start="480" data-end="481.62">of the flexible part where you could</span> <span data-start="481.62" data-end="483.99">have different backends one of them is</span> <span data-start="483.99" data-end="485.97">the serial port for talking to the dual</span> <span data-start="485.97" data-end="487.89">port Graham right here and that's what</span> <span data-start="487.89" data-end="489.66">we make it work on real hardware but you</span> <span data-start="489.66" data-end="491.85">can switch that out for the emulator</span> <span data-start="491.85" data-end="493.2">version so that you can run it on</span> <span data-start="493.2" data-end="494.85">software and your computer instead and</span> <span data-start="494.85" data-end="496.32">then there's things for like you know we</span> <span data-start="496.32" data-end="498.27">did testing Arduino it to make sure that</span> <span data-start="498.27" data-end="500.85">the protocol was good and then things</span> <span data-start="500.85" data-end="502.89">like mock backends for testing or if you</span> <span data-start="502.89" data-end="504.99">don't need a pack n for whatever reason</span> <span data-start="504.99" data-end="506.55">which actually does come into play yeah</span> <span data-start="506.55" data-end="509.64">oh yeah so here's an example script it's</span> <span data-start="509.64" data-end="512.49">a little hard to read but you can kind</span> <span data-start="512.49" data-end="516.21">of see the shape of it so this game</span> <span data-start="516.21" data-end="517.59">ninja gaiden you're like a ninja wearing</span> <span data-start="517.59"
