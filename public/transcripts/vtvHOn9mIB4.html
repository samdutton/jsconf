data-start="1235.6" data-end="1236.98">change much it tells you what the</span> <span data-start="1236.98" data-end="1240.19">satellite number is like the year it was</span> <span data-start="1240.19" data-end="1244.27">launched is that 1366 is that is the</span> <span data-start="1244.27" data-end="1246.67">number of the launch for that year see</span> <span data-start="1246.67"

data-end="1265.45">and then one 48.1 77 it's a fractional</span> <span data-start="1265.45" data-end="1267.97">number for what day of the year is it</span> <span data-start="1267.97"

of giants</span> <span data-start="1283.42" data-end="1286.81">so now at this point okay we plug them</span> <span data-start="1286.81" data-end="1289.66">into our functions so we need to get sgp</span> <span data-start="1289.66" data-end="1293.83">sgp for functions in JavaScript and we</span> <span data-start="1293.83" data-end="1295.78">have a couple options I found these two</span>
