data-start="1692.129" data-end="1694.289">now that's not going to happen</span> <span data-start="1694.289" data-end="1696.6">so if it works kind of like a react</span> <span data-start="1696.6" data-end="1698.22">scripts if you ever have used that</span> <span data-start="1698.22" data-end="1700.859">before if with create react app you can</span> <span data-start="1700.859" data-end="1704.46">run NPM been MVP CLI create with the</span> <span data-start="1704.46" data-end="1706.47">name of your library and it will create</span> <span data-start="1706.47" data-end="1710.119">the whole folder all the github</span> <span data-start="1710.119" data-end="1713.489">workflows all the templates package.json</span> <span data-start="1713.489" data-end="1716.249">with all the fields and then it installs</span> <span data-start="1716.249" data-end="1719.759">the package the CLI as a dependency so</span> <span data-start="1719.759" data-end="1721.529">that it could run all of the other</span> <span data-start="1721.529" data-end="1724.499">scripts as well so the test script and</span> <span data-start="1724.499" data-end="1726.389">the build script do basically what I</span> <span data-start="1726.389" data-end="1729.389">talked about before this dart script is</span> <span data-start="1729.389" data-end="1731.639">for development which basically runs</span> <span data-start="1731.639" data-end="1735.419">tests in watch mode so it just checks</span> <span data-start="1735.419" data-end="1738.239">whatever you've done and your get</span> <span data-start="1738.239" data-end="1740.34">changes and it will run the tests based</span> <span data-start="1740.34" data-end="1743.909">upon that changed code but the most</span> <span data-start="1743.909" data-end="1745.44">interesting thing which I really</span> <span data-start="1745.44" data-end="1746.85">really really wish I could spend more</span> <span data-start="1746.85" data-end="1750.56">time on as the integrate command and</span> <span data-start="1750.56" data-end="1754.71">basically what it does is it packages up</span> <span data-start="1754.71" data-end="1756.3">the library in a tarball</span> <span data-start="1756.3" data-end="1758.31">the same tarball that gets pushed up to</span> <span data-start="1758.31" data-end="1760.62">the registry but instead of pushing it</span> <span data-start="1760.62" data-end="1763.29">to the registry and you'll have a</span> <span data-start="1763.29" data-end="1765.87">separate app that it will install your</span> <span data-start="1765.87" data-end="1768.36">library into so you can install</span> <span data-start="1768.36" data-end="1770.64">something from a tar ball from the file</span> <span data-start="1770.64" data-end="1774.51">system and then I run tests and import</span> <span data-start="1774.51" data-end="1777.12">the library as if I was using it like a</span> <span data-start="1777.12" data-end="1779.55">application and I run tests that way to</span> <span data-start="1779.55" data-end="1782.04">make sure that like I exported all the</span> <span data-start="1782.04" data-end="1784.8">methods correctly my dev dependencies</span> <span data-start="1784.8" data-end="1786.75">and dependencies have been set up the</span> <span data-start="1786.75" data-end="1788.43">right way because sometimes I put them</span> <span data-start="1788.43" data-end="1790.65">in the wrong place so to make sure that</span> <span data-start="1790.65" data-end="1792.78">when developers using the library that</span> <span data-start="1792.78" data-end="1795.42">have everything that they need so if</span> <span data-start="1795.42" data-end="1796.83">you're interested in that you can check</span> <span data-start="1796.83" data-end="1802.43">check out the library and lastly the CLI</span> <span data-start="1802.43" data-end="1806.73">uses itself for development and testing</span> <span data-start="1806.73" data-end="1809.58">and building so it's kind of like the</span> <span data-start="1809.58" data-end="1812.85">original perfect library that's enabling</span> <span data-start="1812.85" data-end="1816.84">other perfect libraries to be created so</span> <span data-start="1816.84" data-end="1819.93">one last thing friend of mine Jonathan</span> <span data-start="1819.93" data-end="1822.18">creamer he is really passionate about</span> <span data-start="1822.18" data-end="1824.73">front-end tooling as am I so he's</span> <span data-start="1824.73" data-end="1826.44">wanting to create this community around</span> <span data-start="1826.44" data-end="1829.47">front-end tooling he's coined the term</span> <span data-start="1829.47" data-end="1832.98">div ops instead of DevOps for this type</span> <span data-start="1832.98" data-end="1835.65">of thing so he has a blog about it and</span> <span data-start="1835.65" data-end="1837.78">there's a slack group and there's a</span> <span data-start="1837.78" data-end="1840.95">subreddit that you can join for that</span> <span data-start="1840.95"
