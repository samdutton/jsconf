<p><span data-start="13.69" data-end="19.08">So hey everyone my name is Phoomparin Mano and I'm 16 years old developer from Thailand</span> <span data-start="19.119" data-end="24.359">And this is for the love of web assembly. Hope you enjoy it</span> <span data-start="26.89" data-end="28.449">First of all</span> <span data-start="28.449" data-end="32.429">Javascript is a big ecosystem, and this is what makes us great</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="33.399" data-end="41.189">As you can see there is react. There's Redux and graph QL and a bunch of other libraries and this makes our</span> <span data-start="41.739" data-end="45.628">Ecosystems be together and we can create any applications</span> <span data-start="45.629" data-end="49.769">We want just like the animals in the forest</span> <span data-start="54.129" data-end="55.18">Now</span> <span data-start="55.18" data-end="61.739">There are sometimes when JavaScript alone might not cut it for example when you have performance problems</span> <span data-start="62.32" data-end="66.059">You need more performance you need more computation power</span> <span data-start="66.52" data-end="72">maybe you need to figure out a face of someone and sometimes javascript might not be enough</span> <span data-start="72.61" data-end="76.799">Sometimes you just need to get really low level and just flip some bits</span> <span data-start="76.799" data-end="80.999">And this is what our friends come in with assembly</span> <span data-start="82.96" data-end="90.419">And this is like a tale of two worlds we have the JavaScript world which is the world of</span> <span data-start="91.119" data-end="97.019">simplicity, elegance and the world of web assembly which is a world of performance and</span> <span data-start="97.42" data-end="103.829">Once we combine these two worlds we can open a portal and make really great apps</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="106.72" data-end="107.77">Now</span> <span data-start="107.77" data-end="115.29">In webassembly it is a binary format, which you can use any language you want but for now I'll pick rust</span> <span data-start="115.869" data-end="120.119">The reason I pick rust is we call first is really modern you</span> <span data-start="120.85" data-end="123.839">Can use Map reduce, you can use</span> <span data-start="124.61" data-end="129.789">many a lot a libraries which can makes your life really easy and</span> <span data-start="130.52" data-end="136.329">Next Rust is like my mom my mom loves to school at me, but she's has good intentions</span> <span data-start="136.91" data-end="143.199">So when you write really bad code Rust will scream at you the compiler will not let you compile</span> <span data-start="143.45" data-end="145.509">Until you make your code good</span> <span data-start="146.6" data-end="148.6">At last it is really fast</span> <span data-start="149.27" data-end="154.659">Rust done a lot of shaking at compile time so it can</span> <span data-start="155.72" data-end="158.889">it can compile combine your code and</span> <span data-start="159.5" data-end="164.86">It makes everything really fast, and it can use a lot of LLVM optimizations</span> <span data-start="166.79" data-end="168.79">Now I</span> <span data-start="169.01" data-end="170.77">Know a lot of you might wonder</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="170.77" data-end="176.199">How hard it is to use it because it is from I know another world another language</span> <span data-start="176.6" data-end="178.929">But the good news is is really easy</span> <span data-start="179.9" data-end="182.62">First you have to import your module</span> <span data-start="182.62" data-end="188.62">Which you can import like another JavaScript module and the webpack loader will handle the rest for you</span> <span data-start="189.44" data-end="191.09">you can just</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="191.09" data-end="196.63">Await the module, and then you can call it like this from the JavaScript function as usual</span> <span data-start="198.29" data-end="205.479">Now how do you export your functions the good new is you can write your JavaScript directly in Rust</span> <span data-start="205.82" data-end="211.479">so you can do `console.log` from Rust you can do `module.exports` from Rust and</span> <span data-start="212.209" data-end="217.988">anything really you can modify the DOM, you can modify the canvas</span> <span data-start="218.69" data-end="222.579">and it will call out to JavaScript just for you and</span> <span data-start="224.51" data-end="228.399">This is a great part, so let's do some demo. Shall we?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="237.6" data-end="244.37">Okay, so here's my commit history and you all can do this project at Phoomparin /react-rust</span> <span data-start="245.55" data-end="246.84">and</span> <span data-start="246.84" data-end="251.03">This is a starter kit so any of you can go and download it right away</span> <span data-start="256.2" data-end="258.409">Okay, so here's some knock-knock jokes</span> <span data-start="259.38" data-end="266.959">When I hit reply it will go call out to rust and fast and fast time replies for me. Here we go.</span> <span data-start="267.63" data-end="269.63">Oh, that wasn't what I expected</span> <span data-start="270.99" data-end="272.16">Okay</span> <span data-start="272.16" data-end="273.39">so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="273.39" data-end="280.099">So the JavaScript code call out to Rust and it gives us some replies. Let's check the code and</span> <span data-start="281.04" data-end="285.77">As you can see you can just write react like you would as usual</span> <span data-start="286.74" data-end="288.74">But the good part is</span> <span data-start="291.36" data-end="298.61">You can simply import your web assembly functions and use it in your Redux reducer</span> <span data-start="300.51" data-end="303.589">So here I just make Redux, akka</span> <span data-start="304.29" data-end="307.189">listens for the actions, and then it will call out to</span> <span data-start="307.89" data-end="309.57">webassembly</span> <span data-start="309.57" data-end="310.65">Okay</span> <span data-start="310.65" data-end="313.58">So really this is our. I have to say</span> <span data-start="314.13" data-end="316.52">so thank you everyone for listening and</span> </p>
