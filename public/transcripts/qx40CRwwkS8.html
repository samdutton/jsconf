data-start="21.16" data-end="24.82">you can return who doesn't know what</span> <span data-start="24.82" data-end="32.079">trilogy is â€” okay like anyway like</span> <span data-start="32.079" data-end="33.6">everything introduction for those guys</span> <span data-start="33.6" data-end="36.16">but then I were gonna dazzle it into</span> <span data-start="36.16" data-end="38.14">technical stuff but hopefully people are</span> <span data-start="38.14" data-end="41.289">gonna be able to follow with all this</span> <span data-start="41.289" data-end="44.32">so 330s is a it's a library which aims</span> <span data-start="44.32" data-end="48.37">to make the process of 3d concentrated</span> <span data-start="48.37" data-end="52.8">fatigue concentrate on create a 3 a 2</span> <span data-start="52.8" data-end="58.78">for the web much easier the color is the</span> <span data-start="58.78" data-end="61.319">way it has been built the core is not</span> <span data-start="61.319" data-end="64.059">attached to the runner so we have the</span> <span data-start="64.059" data-end="66.85">same scene graph in one side some of the</span> <span data-start="66.85" data-end="68.92">abilities but you can plug any vendor</span> <span data-start="68.92" data-end="71.32">that you want you can render that data</span> <span data-start="71.32" data-end="74.409">in whichever one you want these are ours</span> <span data-start="74.409" data-end="76.45">they have like a WebGL room their</span> <span data-start="76.45" data-end="78.64">cameras render as we hear and the dumb</span> <span data-start="78.64" data-end="80.92">renderer whichever you is you when I add</span> <span data-start="80.92" data-end="83.2">another one issues after you is</span> <span data-start="83.2" data-end="86.05">obviously written in JavaScript we have</span> <span data-start="86.05" data-end="87.94">some tools written in Python which is</span> <span data-start="87.94" data-end="89.89">mainly for like building the library and</span> <span data-start="89.89" data-end="91.48">minifying and compressing and things</span> <span data-start="91.48" data-end="94.26">like that we also have like a nodejs</span> <span data-start="94.26" data-end="97.15">builder but we really haven't really</span> <span data-start="97.15" data-end="99.52">used it too much house house it's</span> <span data-start="99.52" data-end="100.78">awesome</span> <span data-start="100.78" data-end="102.82">github and it's released under the MIT</span> <span data-start="102.82" data-end="107.85">license so this is this was you can see</span> <span data-start="107.85" data-end="110.52">this was like a state of the art of</span> <span data-start="110.52" data-end="113.17">canvas render like through the Jade like</span> <span data-start="113.17" data-end="115.15">two years ago like we were able to have</span> <span data-start="115.15" data-end="117.49">like a cube with different colors on its</span> <span data-start="117.49" data-end="120.46">face and with a fake shadow which is a</span> <span data-start="120.46" data-end="125.26">plain even like even two years ago I</span> <span data-start="125.26" data-end="126.52">think Thomas</span> <span data-start="126.52" data-end="128.319">canvas it on its own but the canvas API</span> <span data-start="128.319" data-end="131.2">didn't really have anything like no one</span> <span data-start="131.2" data-end="132.73">had really done much stuff with it so</span> <span data-start="132.73" data-end="134.98">even if with this implicit like people</span> <span data-start="134.98" data-end="136.45">were like impressed with it for some</span> <span data-start="136.45" data-end="139.36">reason I like you know in the past or</span> <span data-start="139.36" data-end="143.41">something shortly after we had like I</span> <span data-start="143.41" data-end="148.269">had that thing that keeps hitting weak</span> <span data-start="148.269" data-end="150.04">we started doing this project they would</span> <span data-start="150.04" data-end="153.28">in a downtown that it served like a</span> <span data-start="153.28" data-end="155.68">excuse for like improving the the canvas</span> <span data-start="155.68" data-end="157.09">renderer a lot like we had to add a lot</span> <span data-start="157.09" data-end="157.84">of features to it</span> <span data-start="157.84" data-end="161.469">even even if the actual music video that</span> <span data-start="161.469" data-end="164.29">we did we didn't use it that much we</span> <span data-start="164.29" data-end="165.849">were only is it for like some birds on</span> <span data-start="165.849" data-end="168.159">the homepage and some trees on some</span> <span data-start="168.159" data-end="171.25">putts but it was really really useful</span> <span data-start="171.25" data-end="172.959">like he was really like a Kickstarter</span> <span data-start="172.959" data-end="175">for the camera we had we had like so</span> <span data-start="175" data-end="178.51">many features thanks to this in the same</span> <span data-start="178.51" data-end="181.389">way we did this I think was six months</span> <span data-start="181.389" data-end="184.419">after that we work on these another</span> <span data-start="184.419" data-end="187.359">music video that in the same way it</span> <span data-start="187.359" data-end="189.31">itself as a key it's good excuse for</span> <span data-start="189.31" data-end="191.139">like implementing lots of features to</span> <span data-start="191.139" data-end="196.989">the render and this is more or less how</span> <span data-start="196.989" data-end="201.28">it is where we are now this is some this</span> <span data-start="201.28" data-end="203.29">is some notes about this raffinate so</span> <span data-start="203.29" data-end="205">this is the graph of comets and github</span> <span data-start="205" data-end="207.909">and as you can see this was small as a</span> <span data-start="207.909" data-end="211.03">pea Oh mm mm um when I was may put it on</span> <span data-start="211.03" data-end="213.04">github you can see more or less my</span> <span data-start="213.04" data-end="215.53">enthusiasm how he was going down a</span> <span data-start="215.53" data-end="218.26">little bit but I think this is more or</span> <span data-start="218.26" data-end="220.84">less when we were working on the</span> <span data-start="220.84" data-end="223.209">wouldn't wouldn't something website and</span> <span data-start="223.209" data-end="225.609">then there's a gap which is you know you</span> <span data-start="225.609" data-end="227.379">finish a project and then you retire for</span> <span data-start="227.379" data-end="230.769">like maybe some weeks and then this is</span> <span data-start="230.769" data-end="233.56">when a also qualia joining and solitude</span> <span data-start="233.56" data-end="236.769">submitted some commits and it's created</span> <span data-start="236.769" data-end="240.22">like interesting phenomenon that we</span> <span data-start="240.22" data-end="242.919">somehow found ourselves like fighting to</span> <span data-start="242.919" data-end="246.009">see who was committing most under to the</span> <span data-start="246.009" data-end="250.09">library and it kind of from then on we</span> <span data-start="250.09" data-end="251.709">had the same pattern now it was more</span> <span data-start="251.709" data-end="253.78">less here like we were working on this</span> <span data-start="253.78" data-end="256.15">wrong website on than we did the first</span> <span data-start="256.15" data-end="258.4">like the base code and we put in more</span> <span data-start="258.4" data-end="260.109">and more features and then another gap</span> <span data-start="260.109" data-end="261.94">which is like another project and then</span> <span data-start="261.94" data-end="264.46">from then on it's like more random this</span> <span data-start="264.46" data-end="266.11">is from then on it was this like</span> <span data-start="266.11" data-end="268.479">community driven enough development I</span> <span data-start="268.479" data-end="270.25">use it doesn't really depend and a</span> <span data-start="270.25" data-end="272.259">slightly just more like people whatever</span> <span data-start="272.259" data-end="274.21">they come in and they use put some</span> <span data-start="274.21" data-end="275.47">comments and then we just try to see</span> <span data-start="275.47" data-end="277.87">where we're gonna go with this so up</span> <span data-start="277.87" data-end="280.27">until now they were like about</span> <span data-start="280.27" data-end="284.979">140 contributors about 4,000 commits</span> <span data-start="284.979" data-end="287.69">55,000 lines of code</span> <span data-start="287.69" data-end="290.33">the library minified is about 100 whites</span> <span data-start="290.33" data-end="294.11">and gzipped it's about 100 kilobytes</span> <span data-start="294.11" data-end="296.509">which is something I somehow care about</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="296.509" data-end="299.15">I always wanted know I'd say was like a</span> <span data-start="299.15" data-end="301.099">good limit to have as a g-sib library to</span> <span data-start="301.099" data-end="304.22">don't go higher than 100 Kuwait's would</span> <span data-start="304.22" data-end="305.81">we keep fighting and we are all</span> <span data-start="305.81" data-end="308.569">determining 95-99 and no it's somehow</span> <span data-start="308.569" data-end="312.219">interesting but we'll see how it goes</span> <span data-start="312.219" data-end="315.409">it features a really really really bad</span> <span data-start="315.409" data-end="318.65">accomodation this is the first complain</span> <span data-start="318.65" data-end="321.44">from everyone that comes in it also like</span> <span data-start="321.44" data-end="323.9">from time to time we get some classical</span> <span data-start="323.9" data-end="325.52">developers the turbulence a like I'll be</span> <span data-start="325.52" data-end="326.629">surprised that you guys don't have any</span> <span data-start="326.629" data-end="329.96">any taste at all and this is because we</span> <span data-start="329.96" data-end="332.06">have like about at this point we have</span> <span data-start="332.06" data-end="336.62">but 175 examples those examples really</span> <span data-start="336.62" data-end="340.669">serve as a kind of unit test like in</span> <span data-start="340.669" data-end="342.05">whenever we change the feature in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="342.05" data-end="346.49">Reverse feature a feature we check those</span> <span data-start="346.49" data-end="347.9">examples of the relevant that are using</span> <span data-start="347.9" data-end="349.43">that feature we see we've written</span> <span data-start="349.43" data-end="351.68">something and at the same time those</span> <span data-start="351.68" data-end="353.719">examples we keep them updated all the</span> <span data-start="353.719" data-end="356.62">time on like even in the dev channel</span> <span data-start="356.62" data-end="360.44">brandish they're all the time updated so</span> <span data-start="360.44" data-end="362.18">you want to learn how something is wrong</span> <span data-start="362.18" data-end="363.86">again you only had to go to the examples</span> <span data-start="363.86" data-end="367.49">and see see how this we also make sure</span> <span data-start="367.49" data-end="370.659">that the the repository doesn't have any</span> <span data-start="370.659" data-end="373.58">dependencies so you can just download</span> <span data-start="373.58" data-end="376.129">the whole repository I mean you can</span> <span data-start="376.129" data-end="377.509">start hacking around you can display</span> <span data-start="377.509" data-end="380">with all this and but you need to bear</span> <span data-start="380" data-end="381.65">in mind that if you are like and always</span> <span data-start="381.65" data-end="384.83">if you're using from you need to execute</span> <span data-start="384.83" data-end="386.69">wrong with the allow file access man</span> <span data-start="386.69" data-end="388.61">files you know that you'll be able to</span> <span data-start="388.61" data-end="391">see some of the demos because it loads</span> <span data-start="391" data-end="396.139">3d meshes with JSON or other formats if</span> <span data-start="396.139" data-end="399.139">you have any questions or you to play</span> <span data-start="399.139" data-end="401.27">with that this is also we recently move</span> <span data-start="401.27" data-end="402.68">all the questions from the github we</span> <span data-start="402.68" data-end="405.08">move them to a stack overflow and so far</span> <span data-start="405.08" data-end="408.649">seems like some people is helping rot in</span> <span data-start="408.649" data-end="410.449">there like some there's some people that</span> <span data-start="410.449" data-end="412.49">try to help the people whenever they</span> <span data-start="412.49" data-end="413.34">have some</span> <span data-start="413.34" data-end="415.11">some problems and so we have a three</span> <span data-start="415.11" data-end="418.7">three today's as a channel on freenode</span> <span data-start="418.7" data-end="423.57">so this is how the API is currently I'm</span> <span data-start="423.57" data-end="425.4">not gonna get dive or like detailed</span> <span data-start="425.4" data-end="428.07">whole theme but you know as a part of</span> <span data-start="428.07" data-end="430.17">the reason that we don't have like a</span> <span data-start="430.17" data-end="433.26">good documentation is because we having</span> <span data-start="433.26" data-end="434.7">like moving a little bit the API we have</span> <span data-start="434.7" data-end="436.35">username and some things and it's you</span> <span data-start="436.35" data-end="437.94">know it is it's also laziness but it</span> <span data-start="437.94" data-end="440.34">takes some time to change the API and</span> <span data-start="440.34" data-end="442.62">also update the documentation and we</span> <span data-start="442.62" data-end="445.86">don't want to put comments and let's</span> <span data-start="445.86" data-end="449.72">talk about that and okay so this is how</span> <span data-start="449.72" data-end="452.94">like how you create a camera nowadays we</span> <span data-start="452.94" data-end="454.2">have mainly two terminals like</span> <span data-start="454.2" data-end="456.57">perspective camera graphical cameras</span> <span data-start="456.57" data-end="459.78">different kind of transformations the</span> <span data-start="459.78" data-end="462.63">view then you create a like a sin which</span> <span data-start="462.63" data-end="465.45">is what you're gonna be like you can</span> <span data-start="465.45" data-end="468.03">just think about it in a film in a film</span> <span data-start="468.03" data-end="469.38">way just assume what you're gonna be</span> <span data-start="469.38" data-end="471.93">putting all the stuff on that we create</span> <span data-start="471.93" data-end="475.14">like a cue geometry we load the texture</span> <span data-start="475.14" data-end="477.42">we have some utilities so like this will</span> <span data-start="477.42" data-end="480.6">do all the edges are loading and</span> <span data-start="480.6" data-end="485.22">everything new image and it will then</span> <span data-start="485.22" data-end="487.05">which we use that texture which is</span> <span data-start="487.05" data-end="490.53">pretty much like a gift like you can</span> <span data-start="490.53" data-end="493.2">load in any website and we create a</span> <span data-start="493.2" data-end="496.29">material using that texture and we then</span> <span data-start="496.29" data-end="497.7">create like a mesh that was going to use</span> <span data-start="497.7" data-end="498.99">the geometry that weakly with the cube</span> <span data-start="498.99" data-end="501.18">with my children and we add that to the</span> <span data-start="501.18" data-end="505.68">scene because we're using this foam</span> <span data-start="505.68" data-end="508.26">material if we don't have any light in</span> <span data-start="508.26" data-end="510.03">the scene we're not gonna see it so we</span> <span data-start="510.03" data-end="511.32">need to put a light in the scene and in</span> <span data-start="511.32" data-end="513.24">this case we are copying the position</span> <span data-start="513.24" data-end="515.52">from the camera into the light so it's</span> <span data-start="515.52" data-end="517.62">gonna look like you're pointing the</span> <span data-start="517.62" data-end="520.02">light into what you're seeing and then</span> <span data-start="520.02" data-end="521.61">finally we create a renderer in this</span> <span data-start="521.61" data-end="523.5">case we're creating a WebGL renderer</span> <span data-start="523.5" data-end="526.59">which we are enabling entirely so it</span> <span data-start="526.59" data-end="529.89">looks that's nicer and the only way to</span> <span data-start="529.89" data-end="532.65">the only connection to the Dom in this</span> <span data-start="532.65" data-end="534.93">case is like every render has a dump</span> <span data-start="534.93" data-end="536.7">limit inside which is just like a canvas</span> <span data-start="536.7" data-end="539.13">and you can add that as a function of</span> <span data-start="539.13" data-end="541.68">any node or any part on the Dom you can</span> <span data-start="541.68" data-end="543.48">also pass a canvas that you've really</span> <span data-start="543.48" data-end="545.49">created to the constructor but this is</span> <span data-start="545.49" data-end="547.09">the usual way that we usually do it</span> <span data-start="547.09" data-end="549.73">and then for an amazing we recommend</span> <span data-start="549.73" data-end="552.16">using requestanimationframe and in this</span> <span data-start="552.16" data-end="556.42">case we're just like changing the</span> <span data-start="556.42" data-end="558.31">rotation on the X and the y-axis and</span> <span data-start="558.31" data-end="561.04">every frame we are after that we're just</span> <span data-start="561.04" data-end="563.53">rendering the dot scene from that camera</span> <span data-start="563.53" data-end="565.81">so we end up with this super amazing</span> <span data-start="565.81" data-end="570.58">cube super amazing straight and you see</span> <span data-start="570.58" data-end="573.64">do you kind of see what's the difference</span> <span data-start="573.64" data-end="575.05">with all these like I'm the first one</span> <span data-start="575.05" data-end="576.67">but I'd like really really like a big</span> <span data-start="576.67" data-end="579.22">fan of vanilla J's but you want to see</span> <span data-start="579.22" data-end="581.53">how what's the code for doing this cube</span> <span data-start="581.53" data-end="584.47">created with WebGL like this money like</span> <span data-start="584.47" data-end="587.47">this you know it's some trailer like you</span> <span data-start="587.47" data-end="588.94">get all this uniforms you create all</span> <span data-start="588.94" data-end="592.18">this ending the texture I think
