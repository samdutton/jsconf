<p><span data-start="36.269" data-end="39">City and so for the next 20 minutes I'm</span> <span data-start="39" data-end="40.59">going to be talking about this button</span> <span data-start="40.59" data-end="42.69">and the process that it took from going</span> <span data-start="42.69" data-end="44.91">from Photoshop comp to something that is</span> <span data-start="44.91" data-end="49.559">in production today so we were doing a</span> <span data-start="49.559" data-end="52.17">redesign for a client last year we were</span> <span data-start="52.17" data-end="54.27">kind of embraced progressive enhancement</span> <span data-start="54.27" data-end="57.6">css3 and we're like we're not going to</span> <span data-start="57.6" data-end="60.14">cut up sprites anymore we're going to do</span> <span data-start="60.14" data-end="62.64">we're going to do this with CSS and so</span> <span data-start="62.64" data-end="64.649">this is what our designers created in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="64.649" data-end="66.69">Photoshop we have a normal state and an</span> <span data-start="66.69" data-end="69.72">active state and it looks like a pretty</span> <span data-start="69.72" data-end="71.1">straightforward conversion you know</span> <span data-start="71.1" data-end="73.38">there's rounded corners gradient</span> <span data-start="73.38" data-end="75.99">overlays text shadows drop shadows it</span> <span data-start="75.99" data-end="77.61">should be something easy to convert the</span> <span data-start="77.61" data-end="80.34">CSS so the designers just kind of gave</span> <span data-start="80.34" data-end="81.93">the developers the photoshop file and</span> <span data-start="81.93" data-end="83.88">they're like all right go to town and so</span> <span data-start="83.88" data-end="86.67">this is what our developers came back</span> <span data-start="86.67" data-end="90.36">with and this is not exactly what we're</span> <span data-start="90.36" data-end="92.819">looking for so that obviously the colors</span> <span data-start="92.819" data-end="94.92">are all wrong the drop shadows are weird</span> <span data-start="94.92" data-end="96.63">and they're like I don't know we just</span> <span data-start="96.63" data-end="98.459">looked at the photoshop file and we just</span> <span data-start="98.459" data-end="100.259">put everything in and so we started</span> <span data-start="100.259" data-end="102.03">talking with the designers and the</span> <span data-start="102.03" data-end="104.67">developers about like what the problem</span> <span data-start="104.67" data-end="106.979">was and so we realized in some cases the</span> <span data-start="106.979" data-end="108.869">design what the designers use to</span> <span data-start="108.869" data-end="110.429">describe something is different than</span> <span data-start="110.429" data-end="112.77">what the developers need and in other</span> <span data-start="112.77" data-end="115.08">cases the designers have vocabulary that</span> <span data-start="115.08" data-end="119.94">developers just don't have it all so you</span> <span data-start="119.94" data-end="121.289">know we have a failure to communicate</span> <span data-start="121.289" data-end="123.989">here designers and developers aren't</span> <span data-start="123.989" data-end="126.36">speaking the same language what the</span> <span data-start="126.36" data-end="128.19">designers put in the Photoshop isn't</span> <span data-start="128.19" data-end="131.73">what developers need for CSS so how do</span> <span data-start="131.73" data-end="134.61">we solve this translation issue well the</span> <span data-start="134.61" data-end="137.04">traditional approach was to create you</span> <span data-start="137.04" data-end="139.02">know a style guide like this and this is</span> <span data-start="139.02" data-end="141.06">comically complex and large you're not</span> <span data-start="141.06" data-end="142.59">supposed to be able to read what it is</span> <span data-start="142.59" data-end="144.87">but this is actually what are our</span> <span data-start="144.87" data-end="147.03">designers had to produce for us because</span> <span data-start="147.03" data-end="149.55">they they stopped trusting us basically</span> <span data-start="149.55" data-end="152.61">to produce to take our Photoshop files</span> <span data-start="152.61" data-end="153.48">and make it</span> <span data-start="153.48" data-end="155.129">in the CSS without screwing it up so</span> <span data-start="155.129" data-end="157.019">this is like we have so many different</span> <span data-start="157.019" data-end="159.18">color buttons it's an e-commerce site</span> <span data-start="159.18" data-end="160.59">that we're working for so it was like</span> <span data-start="160.59" data-end="162.39">all these different buttons and we had</span> <span data-start="162.39" data-end="164.28">to define the top grading the bottom</span> <span data-start="164.28" data-end="167.099">gradient for all the states and also in</span> <span data-start="167.099" data-end="168.48">there's a second level of complexity</span> <span data-start="168.48" data-end="169.86">because some of the buttons need white</span> <span data-start="169.86" data-end="171.12">texts and some of the buttons needed</span> <span data-start="171.12" data-end="173.97">dark text for contrast reasons so we</span> <span data-start="173.97" data-end="176.28">have this really kind of complex style</span> <span data-start="176.28" data-end="178.17">guide and there's a lot of failure</span> <span data-start="178.17" data-end="180.209">points with this traditional translation</span> <span data-start="180.209" data-end="182.16">process I mean the designers have to</span> <span data-start="182.16" data-end="184.5">translate their own designs and then the</span> <span data-start="184.5" data-end="187.019">developers have to take that file and</span> <span data-start="187.019" data-end="189.54">then translate it back into CSS and so</span> <span data-start="189.54" data-end="191.73">wouldn't it be great if we could cut out</span> <span data-start="191.73" data-end="193.349">the middleman and we could automate this</span> <span data-start="193.349" data-end="195.87">translation well of course we can</span> <span data-start="195.87" data-end="197.569">otherwise my talk would be really sure</span> <span data-start="197.569" data-end="200.76">and so we can automate this translation</span> <span data-start="200.76" data-end="203.64">with preprocessors they can act as the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="203.64" data-end="205.5">Rosetta Stone between designers and</span> <span data-start="205.5" data-end="208.379">developers and we can use them to to</span> <span data-start="208.379" data-end="210.239">translate our designs from Photoshop to</span> <span data-start="210.239" data-end="214.56">CSS flawlessly and so let's go back and</span> <span data-start="214.56" data-end="217.019">try to rebuild this button using sass</span> <span data-start="217.019" data-end="219.329">and compass just to note about the</span> <span data-start="219.329" data-end="222.09">technologies all my examples are in SAS</span> <span data-start="222.09" data-end="225.709">but if you use less or stylists you can</span> <span data-start="225.709" data-end="228.54">you can definitely use the same ideas</span> <span data-start="228.54" data-end="229.98">and if you haven't use a preprocessor</span> <span data-start="229.98" data-end="231.84">yet your mind is about to explode</span> <span data-start="231.84" data-end="234.69">because they're amazing and so I'm also</span> <span data-start="234.69" data-end="236.19">using compass which is a framework</span> <span data-start="236.19" data-end="238.829">that's built on top of sass which adds a</span> <span data-start="238.829" data-end="240.959">bunch of mix-ins and functions to solve</span> <span data-start="240.959" data-end="243.959">a lot of common problems that we that we</span> <span data-start="243.959" data-end="246.389">have as developers and compass kind of</span> <span data-start="246.389" data-end="248.13">it feels like the jelly that goes with</span> <span data-start="248.13" data-end="251.76">sass peanut butter and so I don't use</span> <span data-start="251.76" data-end="253.109">them separately at all anymore it's</span> <span data-start="253.109" data-end="256.44">always a Santa compass so first before</span> <span data-start="256.44" data-end="258.239">we get into like our translation we have</span> <span data-start="258.239" data-end="260.37">to like build up our base and we have to</span> <span data-start="260.37" data-end="262.5">sort of build all the stuff that isn't</span> <span data-start="262.5" data-end="263.849">going to change about our button</span> <span data-start="263.849" data-end="265.95">regardless of the color in the context</span> <span data-start="265.95" data-end="267.72">and so we start off with like a</span> <span data-start="267.72" data-end="272.15">prototype placeholder button placeholder</span> <span data-start="272.15" data-end="274.11">selector and there's all the stuff</span> <span data-start="274.11" data-end="276.33">that's just going to undo what browsers</span> <span data-start="276.33" data-end="279.3">do by default two buttons and kind of</span> <span data-start="279.3" data-end="280.74">add all the stuff that isn't going to</span> <span data-start="280.74" data-end="282.39">change like our font and our border</span> <span data-start="282.39" data-end="285.21">radius stuff like that and so now when</span> <span data-start="285.21" data-end="287.34">we write our SAS we can</span> <span data-start="287.34" data-end="289.38">extend that button placeholder and so we</span> <span data-start="289.38" data-end="291.12">can work in sort of a object or any a</span> <span data-start="291.12" data-end="294.27">modular approach in our SAS and then</span> <span data-start="294.27" data-end="297.479">when it gets output to CSS it's done in</span> <span data-start="297.479" data-end="299.16">a performant way so you can see here</span> <span data-start="299.16" data-end="301.83">instead of copying those 16 or so</span> <span data-start="301.83" data-end="304.29">properties we actually just increase the</span> <span data-start="304.29" data-end="306.6">selector chain and so this is one of the</span> <span data-start="306.6" data-end="307.77">the more powerful things with</span> <span data-start="307.77" data-end="309.6">preprocessors because you can the way</span> <span data-start="309.6" data-end="311.91">that you write the source code isn't</span> <span data-start="311.91" data-end="314.13">necessarily how it gets compiled so you</span> <span data-start="314.13" data-end="316.169">can write in a way that is comfortable</span> <span data-start="316.169" data-end="317.82">for you and like make sense from</span> <span data-start="317.82" data-end="319.919">maintenance perspective but then when it</span> <span data-start="319.919" data-end="322.41">gets compiled it's it does what it needs</span> <span data-start="322.41" data-end="325.8">to do to have the smallest file size and</span> <span data-start="325.8" data-end="328.86">so now we have our base we and so what</span> <span data-start="328.86" data-end="331.65">we extend the button placeholder then we</span> <span data-start="331.65" data-end="333.03">just add the unique things about that</span> <span data-start="333.03" data-end="335.43">button so the only thing that's</span> <span data-start="335.43" data-end="336.87">different is is the background color</span> <span data-start="336.87" data-end="338.639">here and we actually we're already</span> <span data-start="338.639" data-end="341.729">running into a problem here because we</span> <span data-start="341.729" data-end="343.74">as I said before we want our dark</span> <span data-start="343.74" data-end="345.21">buttons they have light texts and our</span> <span data-start="345.21" data-end="347.34">latex the light buttons have dark text</span> <span data-start="347.34" data-end="349.229">so let's see how we can use sass to</span> <span data-start="349.229" data-end="351.33">automate that translation process so</span> <span data-start="351.33" data-end="355.02">that individual developers can't can't</span> <span data-start="355.02" data-end="357.9">screw it up basically so we can use a</span> <span data-start="357.9" data-end="359.94">built-in sass function to compare color</span> <span data-start="359.94" data-end="361.35">lightness there's a function called</span> <span data-start="361.35" data-end="363.63">lightness that returns a value between 0</span> <span data-start="363.63" data-end="366.539">and 100 just based on like the hsl value</span> <span data-start="366.539" data-end="368.55">of that color and so here we just do</span> <span data-start="368.55" data-end="370.77">some simple logic and we're saying if</span> <span data-start="370.77" data-end="372.93">the color is greater than 50 so if the</span> <span data-start="372.93" data-end="374.37">background color is a light color we</span> <span data-start="374.37" data-end="376.74">want to return dark text and you know</span> <span data-start="376.74" data-end="379.919">vice versa so now our text color gets</span> <span data-start="379.919" data-end="382.32">set programmatically instead of setting</span> <span data-start="382.32" data-end="384.24">that color explicitly we call a function</span> <span data-start="384.24" data-end="386.34">and give it the background color and</span> <span data-start="386.34" data-end="387.63">then so you see on the right here when</span> <span data-start="387.63" data-end="390.57">our CSS gets compiled that decision gets</span> <span data-start="390.57" data-end="392.7">made for us and we don't have to worry</span> <span data-start="392.7" data-end="395.4">about like if an individual developer is</span> <span data-start="395.4" data-end="396.9">going to read our style guide properly</span> <span data-start="396.9" data-end="399.96">or not so sass allows us to abstract</span> <span data-start="399.96" data-end="401.61">design logic and this is a really</span> <span data-start="401.61" data-end="405.03">powerful tool because we can we can</span> <span data-start="405.03" data-end="407.19">abstract this stuff so these changes</span> <span data-start="407.19" data-end="409.74">these decisions happen behind the scenes</span> <span data-start="409.74" data-end="412.38">and so also later on if like you know</span> <span data-start="412.38" data-end="414.36">our marketing department or comes in or</span> <span data-start="414.36" data-end="415.74">like you know it really should be like</span> <span data-start="415.74" data-end="419.159">444 not 333 that a be test better we can</span> <span data-start="419.159" data-end="420.599">change that in one place and then when</span> <span data-start="420.599" data-end="420.93">we</span> <span data-start="420.93" data-end="422.639">recompile all these changes get made</span> <span data-start="422.639" data-end="426.6">automatically so now that we have our</span> <span data-start="426.6" data-end="428.82">base and some simple design logic let's</span> <span data-start="428.82" data-end="431.49">talk about how to translate to commonly</span> <span data-start="431.49" data-end="434.759">used layer styles from Photoshop and how</span> <span data-start="434.759" data-end="436.65">to convert them the CSS we're going to</span> <span data-start="436.65" data-end="438.63">start with drop shadow and how to turn</span> <span data-start="438.63" data-end="442.11">that into into a CSS box shadow and so</span> <span data-start="442.11" data-end="444.509">this is a CSS conference so I assume</span> <span data-start="444.509" data-end="446.31">you've all written a box shadow before</span> <span data-start="446.31" data-end="447.69">but just to make sure we're on the same</span> <span data-start="447.69" data-end="451.02">page the CSS syntax we have x and y</span> <span data-start="451.02" data-end="453.479">offset the blur radius of spread radius</span> <span data-start="453.479" data-end="455.91">and then a color and so this is and this</span> <span data-start="455.91" data-end="457.47">is what photoshop gives us which is</span> <span data-start="457.47" data-end="459.389">pretty similar but there's some</span> <span data-start="459.389" data-end="461.21">important differences color and opacity</span> <span data-start="461.21"
