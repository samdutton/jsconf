<p><span data-start="151.17" data-end="154.92">JS we released it last year in March its</span> <span data-start="154.92" data-end="158.04">GPU accelerated so we use WebGL to make</span> <span data-start="158.04" data-end="159.48">everything fast so we actually do all</span> <span data-start="159.48" data-end="161.79">the the linear algebra in fragment</span> <span data-start="161.79" data-end="163.739">shaders and I'll talk a little bit about</span> <span data-start="163.739" data-end="166.079">that in a second but one of the things</span> <span data-start="166.079" data-end="167.43">that we do is we let you make</span> <span data-start="167.43" data-end="168.659">predictions through machine learning</span> <span data-start="168.659" data-end="170.549">models but

that as</span> <span data-start="174.18" data-end="177.209">well so when designing the library you</span> <span data-start="177.209" data-end="179.519">know we had a couple goals in mind one</span> <span data-start="179.519" data-end="181.469">is that we wanted to empower a diverse</span> <span data-start="181.469" data-end="183.06">group of Java developers like the folks</span> <span data-start="183.06" data-end="184.439">in this room you know there's a lot of</span> <span data-start="184.439" data-end="185.849">really awesome people in this community</span> <span data-start="185.849" data-end="188.04">and we want to sort of marry these two</span> <span data-start="188.04" data-end="190.53">worlds at the same time we wanted the</span> <span data-start="190.53" data-end="192.329">folks who are experienced in the machine</span> <span data-start="192.329" data-end="194.219">learning to be able to port their work</span> <span data-start="194.219" data-end="196.769">to the web now these goals are kind of</span> <span data-start="196.769" data-end="198.51">sometimes at conflict so we'll talk a</span> <span data-start="198.51" data-end="202.01">little bit about how we resolve those</span> <span data-start="202.01" data-end="203.97">okay so one of the principles that we</span> <span data-start="203.97" data-end="205.62">had was we wanted the library to be</span> <span data-start="205.62" data-end="208.199">super easy to use and we kind of leaned</span> <span data-start="208.199" data-end="210.15">towards that over performance at the</span> <span data-start="210.15" data-end="211.29">same time we didn't want to sacrifice</span> <span data-start="211.29" data-end="214.409">any functionality for simplicity so just</span> <span data-start="214.409" data-end="217.59">jumping into what that means we decided</span> <span data-start="217.59" data-end="219.72">to go with this eager only approach I'm</span> <span data-start="219.72" data-end="221.459">not going to go into what that means but</span> <span data-start="221.459" data-end="222.93">it's a much simpler way of programming</span> <span data-start="222.93" data-end="224.4">and actually most of the machine</span> <span data-start="224.4" data-end="225.78">learning world is moving towards this</span> <span data-start="225.78" data-end="228.239">eager approach versus a graph based</span> <span data-start="228.239" data-end="229.379">approach where you actually stitch</span> <span data-start="229.379" data-end="231.9">together a computation graph and execute</span> <span data-start="231.9" data-end="233.819">it later and we've really wanted to be</span> <span data-start="233.819" data-end="236.579">easy so we move towards eager we also</span> <span data-start="236.579" data-end="239.459">provide a high level layers API which is</span> <span data-start="239.459" data-end="241.379">a set of best practices in the machine</span> <span data-start="241.379" data-end="242.849">learning community so you don't have to</span> <span data-start="242.849" data-end="244.199">think about all the details of your</span> <span data-start="244.199" data-end="245.489">linear algebra when you're constructing</span> <span data-start="245.489" data-end="248.909">a model and we also provide a whole</span> <span data-start="248.909" data-end="250.859">repository of pre trained models that</span> <span data-start="250.859" data-end="252.54">require zero understanding of machine</span> <span data-start="252.54" data-end="254.25">learning to get started and I'm going to</span> <span data-start="254.25" data-end="256.169">show you a couple examples of those in a</span> <span data-start="256.169" data-end="259.229">second and I want to highlight this we</span> <span data-start="259.229" data-end="260.82">focus on performance when and where it</span> <span data-start="260.82" data-end="262.529">matters obviously we want matrix</span> <span data-start="262.529" data-end="264.99">multiplies to be fast what we did was we</span> <span data-start="264.99" data-end="267.18">took individual models and we figured</span> <span data-start="267.18" data-end="267.33">out</span> <span data-start="267.33" data-end="268.919">how to make those individual models</span> <span data-start="268.919" data-end="273">faster on a use case basis so as I said</span> <span data-start="273" data-end="274.56">we don't want to actually make the</span> <span data-start="274.56" data-end="277.05">library less functional so we support</span> <span data-start="277.05" data-end="279.15">gradients this is fancy talk for</span> <span data-start="279.15" data-end="282.12">sensitivity of each of the weights which</span> <span data-start="282.12" data-end="284.009">means we can train through any operation</span> <span data-start="284.009" data-end="285.87">that you use in the tensor flow chest</span> <span data-start="285.87" data-end="288">library support a lot of the tensor flow</span> <span data-start="288" data-end="290.25">ops 130 of them and for any of these</span> <span data-start="290.25" data-end="292.02">models that we're about to show you you</span> <span data-start="292.02" data-end="294.389">can actually dig down and get some of</span> <span data-start="294.389" data-end="295.86">the machine learning constructs out of</span> <span data-start="295.86" data-end="300.629">them if you want to okay so quickly</span> <span data-start="300.629" data-end="302.49">jumping into what the technical stack</span> <span data-start="302.49" data-end="304.74">looks like at the very top of the</span> <span data-start="304.74" data-end="306.539">abstraction api's we have our models</span> <span data-start="306.539" data-end="308.43">repo so this is set of pre trained</span> <span data-start="308.43" data-end="309.599">models I'll show you a couple of those</span> <span data-start="309.599" data-end="310.949">in a second require very little</span> <span data-start="310.949" data-end="313.08">understanding of machine learning below</span> <span data-start="313.08" data-end="315.599">that this is our layers API this is</span> <span data-start="315.599" data-end="317.4">where you can construct a model you can</span> <span data-start="317.4" data-end="319.409">train the model you can serialize the</span> <span data-start="319.409" data-end="321.479">model for later and we'll show you some</span> <span data-start="321.479" data-end="323.969">of that soon too and we also have below</span> <span data-start="323.969" data-end="325.65">that our core API which is or just</span> <span data-start="325.65" data-end="326.969">linear algebra kernels so these are</span> <span data-start="326.969" data-end="329.819">matrix multiplies convolutions and their</span> <span data-start="329.819" data-end="333.15">gradients which are derivatives so all</span> <span data-start="333.15" data-end="335.37">of these api is you can sort of poke in</span> <span data-start="335.37" data-end="338.099">at any of these abstraction layers all</span> <span data-start="338.099" data-end="339.69">of these sit on top of WebGL in the</span> <span data-start="339.69" data-end="342.27">browser we use fragment shaders to run</span> <span data-start="342.27" data-end="344.789">all of our math in parallel and in node</span> <span data-start="344.789" data-end="347.339">we actually bind with the N API to</span> <span data-start="347.339" data-end="349.979">tensorflow C++ and what that means is if</span> <span data-start="349.979" data-end="352.379">you use that same API for any of these</span> <span data-start="352.379" data-end="354.389">things you immediately get the hardware</span> <span data-start="354.389" data-end="356.25">acceleration that tensorflow has been</span> <span data-start="356.25" data-end="358.83">working hard on for the CPU and for GPUs</span> <span data-start="358.83" data-end="360.96">with CUDA and eventually we're gonna</span> <span data-start="360.96" data-end="364.229">have TPU support it was also very</span> <span data-start="364.229" data-end="366.539">important for us not to silo ourselves</span> <span data-start="366.539" data-end="368.37">in the JavaScript world there is a whole</span> <span data-start="368.37" data-end="370.289">wealth of models that are trained in the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="370.289" data-end="372.12">Python ecosystem that we want to take</span> <span data-start="372.12" data-end="373.77">advantage of so we have converter tools</span> <span data-start="373.77" data-end="375.81">that let you take a Karass model or a</span> <span data-start="375.81" data-end="377.789">tensorflow Saves model and bring them</span> <span data-start="377.789" data-end="380.93">back into the JavaScript world</span> <span data-start="380.93" data-end="383.669">ok so let's quickly take a look at what</span> <span data-start="383.669" data-end="386.819">the models repo looks like so if you</span> <span data-start="386.819" data-end="389.159">check out this link these are all our</span> <span data-start="389.159" data-end="391.889">pre trained models these are hosted on</span> <span data-start="391.889" data-end="394.289">github and on NPM so we host all the</span> <span data-start="394.289" data-end="395.759">weights and all the JavaScript for you</span> <span data-start="395.759" data-end="397.979">and we have a wealth of models from</span> <span data-start="397.979" data-end="400.06">object recognition to</span> <span data-start="400.06" data-end="402.52">human pose detection — localization -</span> <span data-start="402.52" data-end="405.16">segmentation — text classification and</span> <span data-start="405.16" data-end="407.11">the list goes on just go check this link</span> <span data-start="407.11" data-end="409.36">out but I want to show you one of the</span> <span data-start="409.36" data-end="411.33">demos because it's fun</span> <span data-start="411.33" data-end="421.11">so okay so this model is called pose net</span> <span data-start="421.11" data-end="423.669">it's running completely in the browser</span> <span data-start="423.669" data-end="425.38">nothing is being sent back to a server</span> <span data-start="425.38" data-end="428.02">and the idea here is we take RGB images</span> <span data-start="428.02" data-end="430.09">from webcam we pass it through this pose</span> <span data-start="430.09" data-end="432.22">detection model that generates key</span> <span data-start="432.22" data-end="434.35">points for each of you know sort of my</span> <span data-start="434.35" data-end="436.96">body parts and then it returns an object</span> <span data-start="436.96" data-end="438.04">that we can just render on the screen</span> <span data-start="438.04" data-end="439.6">and obviously it works with two people</span> <span data-start="439.6" data-end="441.31">so this is a lot of fun and we'll show</span> <span data-start="441.31" data-end="443.53">you how to use one of these models in a</span> <span data-start="443.53" data-end="447.1">minute the second model is very similar</span> <span data-start="447.1" data-end="449.08">to pose net it's doing person</span> <span data-start="449.08" data-end="451.36">segmentation so it's you know this</span> <span data-start="451.36" data-end="453.1">backgrounds a little funny but basically</span> <span data-start="453.1" data-end="456.49">what it does is it draws a mask of a one</span> <span data-start="456.49" data-end="458.11">where it thinks is a human pose and a</span> <span data-start="458.11" data-end="459.43">zero where it does where it thinks</span> <span data-start="459.43" data-end="461.38">there's not so this is what this one's a</span> <span data-start="461.38" data-end="462.639">lot of fun and I don't know if this is</span> <span data-start="462.639" data-end="464.44">gonna show well here but one of the</span> <span data-start="464.44" data-end="466.15">effects I really like is the portrait</span> <span data-start="466.15" data-end="468.729">mode

running directly in</span> <span data-start="472.479" data-end="475.63">the browser pretty fast okay so let's go</span> <span data-start="475.63" data-end="476.95">back to the slides and I'm going to show</span> <span data-start="476.95" data-end="478.539">you how that actually works and what the</span> <span data-start="478.539" data-end="480.76">code looks like so that model is called</span>
