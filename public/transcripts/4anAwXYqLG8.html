Sorry for my bad voice, I think I'm allergic for</span> <span data-start="36.59" data-end="46.42">bad API. I work for Facebook now, I'm not an evangelist, I just code stuff, I'm just</span> <span data-start="46.42" data-end="53.46">some dude. I also represent Facebook on TC 39 on standards committee on ECMAScript. Don't</span> <span data-start="53.46" data-end="58.629">worry, the bad parts are not mine, they're someone else's.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="58.629" data-end="65.75">I guess a lot of people here have a favorite library. There was your favorite library\h‑‑</span> <span data-start="65.75" data-end="72.7">nothing? React that's a good call. (Laughing) do you guys use libraries for everything,</span> <span data-start="72.7" data-end="79.45">like the same library, like utility library, like underscore in how many people use underscore?</span> <span data-start="79.45" data-end="92.51">Cool. JQuery? Something like Angular High Level YUY? Oooo .. sorry, guys (Laughing)</span> <span data-start="92.51" data-end="98.1">well, this is the great part about JavaScript, our community, if you look platforms like</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="98.1" data-end="107.06">EEO, Andriod or proprietary. Do whatever the platform owner tells you that's right to do.</span> <span data-start="107.06" data-end="112.78">There's a stock secret black box you can't touch, everyone tells you you can't do better</span> <span data-start="112.78" data-end="119.29">than they did, which is not true, let's be honest, it's not true in the Java committee.</span> <span data-start="119.29" data-end="125.939">We have a vibrant community of framework, we have discussion and fights about how many</span> <span data-start="125.939" data-end="133.269">package managers we need manage all of our libraries, I think a lot of them are called</span> <span data-start="133.269" data-end="142.69">MPM actually. But do we really need this many OA's, how many ways do we fled the accessDM</span> <span data-start="142.69" data-end="148.959">attributes. You know all the APIs in Ember data, do you know how many ways to filter</span> <span data-start="148.959" data-end="155.959">an array just in underscore? Is it same as well dash depending on which version you use</span> <span data-start="155.959" data-end="163.471">and what you opt in to. Do you even know tall APIs in the standard JavaScript library? What</span> <span data-start="163.471" data-end="172.79">about VS 6? Job recruiters and job descriptions are looking for experience with specific libraries,</span> <span data-start="172.79" data-end="177.77">and if you know the same concept under different name, you're actually not good enough, because</span> <span data-start="177.77" data-end="183.97">like you're not going to get ramped up quick enough before the company pivots, right. It's</span> <span data-start="183.97" data-end="189.71">starting to get a little bit annoying with all this proliferation, but, of course, you</span> <span data-start="189.71" data-end="193.77">have a solution for this, you created your own library and now there's only one thing</span> <span data-start="193.77" data-end="199.17">you is to learn. It's probably super easy, solves all the educations and all the names</span> <span data-start="199.17" data-end="207.03">are super easy for you to understand. How streamlined? JavaScript JS is really hard</span> <span data-start="207.03" data-end="213.79">to learn. Imagine this is like the first day and you get dropped into code based complicated</span> <span data-start="213.79" data-end="217.92">weapon App, in the middle of the web App, first day you have no idea how it works how</span> <span data-start="217.92" data-end="224.489">many calls in to JavaScript libraries do you see that you've never seen before. Imagine</span> <span data-start="224.489" data-end="230.58">this is the life of thousands of your colleagues. We had our own core libraries at Facebook</span> <span data-start="230.58" data-end="231.58">as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="231.58" data-end="236.98">One of the most common questions we had was so which Facebook specific module corresponds</span> <span data-start="236.98" data-end="244.22">to this underscore or JQue arey function? It's not that the library is too big, the</span> <span data-start="244.22" data-end="249.02">library is pretty cool. It doesn't matter if there's too many bytes, there's way to</span> <span data-start="249.02" data-end="255.7">optimize and filter those, it's actually total amount of APIs that you have to learn to be</span> <span data-start="255.7" data-end="260.75">productive in this industry. That's really difficult these days. And I don't think this</span> <span data-start="260.75" data-end="267.94">is inherent to a diverse ecosystem. I don't think it's inherent to programming in general.</span> <span data-start="267.94" data-end="273.72">I think I found a process that can help us minimize this problem. First of all, listen</span> <span data-start="273.72" data-end="283.78">to slow moving standard organizations. Then write some spaghetti code. Never abstract</span> <span data-start="283.78" data-end="291.14">until it actually causes bugs. Once it does cause a bug, subtract an abstraction and as</span> <span data-start="291.14" data-end="300.05">as much surface area as you destruct if it. This doesn't sound like best practices, and</span> <span data-start="300.05" data-end="307.05">no one wants to listen to slow moving standards story. Let me get back to that a little bit</span> <span data-start="307.05" data-end="315.56">later. First, some history. 2005. Late 2005. It was an interesting era for the web, it</span> <span data-start="315.56" data-end="322.98">was before internet explorer 7, JavaScript update for 6 years, ES 4 was being drafted,</span> <span data-start="322.98" data-end="329.34">it was going to go into failure. But minimal JavaScript, the line of library we had, the</span> <span data-start="329.34" data-end="335.12">community had enough, we started to take things into our own hands, and this was an era where</span> <span data-start="335.12" data-end="342.43">all the libraries started to see proliferation. A lot of them were like prototype, based JS,</span> <span data-start="342.43" data-end="347.5">those two heavily inspired Moo tools, which I kind of worked on a little bit. A lot of</span> <span data-start="347.5" data-end="354.07">those bad things were my fault. But, of course libraries couldn't agree on a standard way</span> <span data-start="354.07" data-end="359.81">of extending prototypes and having global name space so the best practice became like</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="359.81" data-end="363.71">J curry and underscore because they had their owne own separate name space.</span> <span data-start="363.71" data-end="370.56">Then ES 5 came along and it became popular to patch prototypes again, this time it's</span> <span data-start="370.56" data-end="377.3">called poly fills. A lot of those poly fills naturally replaced prototype and Moo tools</span> <span data-start="377.3" data-end="382.46">because they were sharing the same name space. But, the library in their own name space,</span> <span data-start="382.46" data-end="390.41">like underscore and J query lived on. They actually had better APIs at the time because</span> <span data-start="390.41" data-end="395.44">there were better documented and it was easier to learn because there was no standard that</span> <span data-start="395.44" data-end="400.71">you can rely on. And the rational that they still live on it's empowering to have an abstraction</span> <span data-start="400.71" data-end="408.21">on top of the native feature, you with tweak performance, fix thing Ms.\hThe speck without</span> <span data-start="408.21" data-end="414.94">relying on a standards body to fix it for you. Even TC 39 for JavaScript would even</span> <span data-start="414.94" data-end="419.57">argue if you're not quite happy with this, you should just use your own ten mow library</span> <span data-start="419.57" data-end="425.14">and build something on top of the standards. But which one do we use? There's at least</span> <span data-start="425.14" data-end="429.55">two ways to do it now, there's the standard way, and the library way, and there's multiple</span> <span data-start="429.55" data-end="434.2">libraries, we asked ourselves because we got this question a lot, should we adopt an API</span> <span data-start="434.2" data-end="440.18">like popular library or underscore or maybe a little dash, but which one of them, and</span> <span data-start="440.18" data-end="447.13">which version and is this going to be maintained. Do we even control the source? Is it community</span> <span data-start="447.13" data-end="453.17">driven, or is it controlled by one person? Do we require this library from all of our</span> <span data-start="453.17" data-end="461.491">source, or do we decouple it with some other dependency. So, let's take a minute to look</span> <span data-start="461.491" data-end="466.63">at why we actually use JavaScript to begin with. It's not best language in the world,</span> <span data-start="466.63" data-end="470.87">whatever your favorite style is, there's at least one Bert language out there that will</span> <span data-start="470.87" data-end="476.69">compile down to JavaScript. We can just use that instead, right? Well, we use JavaScript</span> <span data-start="476.69" data-end="481.53">because it's ubiquitous, it's something that people could agree on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="481.53" data-end="489.41">This is why general purpose programming languages keep winning out against DSLs and custom languages.</span> <span data-start="489.41" data-end="494.44">And by introducing divergence in the library community, we're actually undermining what</span> <span data-start="494.44" data-end="503.77">JavaScript is great. So back at Facebook we started building source trance filers for</span> <span data-start="503.77" data-end="510.31">ES 6 features, we invested a lot in E 6, we became very early adopters throughout our</span> <span data-start="510.31" data-end="519.01">entire code base, we joined TC 39 to start working on ES 7. There are some problems with</span> <span data-start="519.01" data-end="523.14">this technique though, there's some native functions that are shower than reimplementation</span> <span data-start="523.14" data-end="528.69">of this, load ash shows this over and over again. It's easy to solve just monkey batch</span> <span data-start="528.69" data-end="535.44">it, just overwry native version with one that's faster, this is a string of JavaScript that</span> <span data-start="535.44" data-end="541.71">you can actually do this. Sometimes, don't tell anyone, but you can actually use Shams</span> <span data-start="541.71" data-end="547.08">as well that are not quite compatible just to get the extra little performance boost,</span> <span data-start="547.08" data-end="552.13">just make sure you're continuously try knoll the standards as it mosting along and also</span> <span data-start="552.13" data-end="560.99">try to not expose dependencies on non‑standard behavior. There's a lot of compatibility problems</span> <span data-start="560.99" data-end="568.77">with just relying on poly fills. In the early day was Spec changes a lot you basically have</span> <span data-start="568.77" data-end="576">to live with it as a library rather than a final draft of a spec, you continuously upgrade,</span> <span data-start="576" data-end="580.65">you can really only have one version in one realm at a time, we have a lot of solutions</span> <span data-start="580.65" data-end="585.64">to solve this, another problem is that you mite have to load like a huge poly fill on</span> <span data-start="585.64" data-end="590.7">an initial page load instead of doing the modular loading.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="590.7" data-end="594.36">And all of this stuff is really difficult to get right, but we, and a lot of our people</span> <span data-start="594.36" data-end="598.99">are trying to build Open Source tooling, to support your environment, stacked actually</span> <span data-start="598.99" data-end="605.21">enable you do this. And this is all hard work, but it allowstous have a very simple story,</span> <span data-start="605.21" data-end="611.27">at Facebook, we use JavaScripts standard library. There's one way to do things, and it's the</span> <span data-start="611.27" data-end="620.42">standard way. And it's it avoids a very simple problem. It avoids bike shedding, bike shedding</span> <span data-start="620.42" data-end="628.18">is the biggest waist of all. We leave that to standard mailing list. It reminds me the</span> <span data-start="628.18" data-end="634.39">least intuitive lessons I learned from an organization. The top‑down authority is</span> <span data-start="634.39" data-end="640.87">best used on the very least important decisions, not the most important decisions. For example</span> <span data-start="640.87" data-end="646.88">I really recommend you force a strict and comprehensive style guide just because it</span> <span data-start="646.88" data-end="653.71">avoids this discussion on every of pole request or every DIsive which style you're going to</span> <span data-start="653.71" data-end="660.75">use and every person isn't going to have to fight to get their style (DIV) you might be</span> <span data-start="660.75" data-end="664.88">asking yourself, JavaScript standard library doesn't have all features of my library, so</span> <span data-start="664.88" data-end="672.29">what do I replace this with? Well, often the answer is just write some more boilerplate</span> <span data-start="672.29" data-end="679.5">code. It'll take you a few seconds longer, you don't take on dependency. The person coming</span> <span data-start="679.5" data-end="683.72">to fix your code does haven't to know about your obscure function and to pointing out</span> <span data-start="683.72" data-end="688.162">their version with the same or different names that someone else thought was better, and</span> <span data-start="688.162" data-end="693.43">better looking. This can be really annoying to have all this repetitive code that looks</span> <span data-start="693.43" data-end="698.43">ugly when we all want beautiful code, right.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="698.43" data-end="705.21">Except, this process fundamentally has no end, ever. We're simply never going to realize</span> <span data-start="705.21" data-end="710.68">state of software anywhere van that where everything is supremely satisfying. And that's</span> <span data-start="710.68" data-end="719.79">an emotional realization. This was an early quote from early Facebooker, but to put it</span> <span data-start="719.79" data-end="726.08">another way, you're not going to find a perfect library API, you have good looking code now</span> <span data-start="726.08" data-end="730.941">will look bad in a year, and you or someone else will have to go upgrade it. You might</span> <span data-start="730.941" data-end="741.01">not remember what abstraction you found was cool, today. However, it's not allGloomy.</span> <span data-start="741.01" data-end="748.471">You write your code a little differently, Ellen new patterns that allow you to structure</span> <span data-start="748.471" data-end="758.19">your code a different way that achieve your goal\h‑‑ now, learning these patterns</span> <span data-start="758.19" data-end="761.87">is quite difficult, and this is definitely a learning curve, but that makes you a better</span> <span data-start="761.87" data-end="768.72">programmer in general. Large frameworks they usually is an API for every kind of use case</span> <span data-start="768.72" data-end="773.49">you can just search for that API, like ask for it on stack overflow and you can find</span> <span data-start="773.49" data-end="779.85">a link to it. When you learn patterns you have to read a book or tutorial or find different</span> <span data-start="779.85" data-end="786.279">ways to express the same thing. It's a different way to search for things, but, essentially</span> <span data-start="786.279" data-end="792.16">it's the aim problem. It's just a slightly different solution. And, if you structure</span> <span data-start="792.16" data-end="798.16">a code in a way that uses patterns, instead of black box libraries, it's mouchoirs for</span> <span data-start="798.16" data-end="802.68">the next person to read your code, to actually understand what's going on. And this is the</span> <span data-start="802.68" data-end="806.84">most important lesson I've learned at Facebook.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="806.84" data-end="812.04">It's much easier to recover from no abstraction than the wrong abstraction.</span> <span data-start="812.04" data-end="818.05">So, this kind of says a spaghetti code can be Bert than a structure code this is very</span> <span data-start="818.05" data-end="825.17">counterintuitive to modern programmers, at least. It's that the structure abadd overhead</span> <span data-start="825.17" data-end="831.3">to what a new coder needs to learn just to get up to speed with your code base. But,</span> <span data-start="831.3" data-end="836.16">you know, like one little abstraction can't hurt, but abstractions tend to spread, because</span> <span data-start="836.16" data-end="841.52">toll is just a layer of abstractions, one on top of the other, and everything you have</span> <span data-start="841.52" data-end="848.42">on top of your abstraction will node the be unwound. You have to unwind every layer with</span> <span data-start="848.42" data-end="852.89">a total and complete understanding of the intraquasis of that system to get back to</span> <span data-start="852.89" data-end="858.73">the original layer and then rebuild it if there. And, that means that it can actually</span> <span data-start="858.73" data-end="867.66">be more\h‑‑ a lot easier to upgrade verbose, repetitive and explicit code than it is to</span> <span data-start="867.66" data-end="876.661">upgrade an abstraction. Now I'm not saying like bad code, spaghetti code is better. It's</span> <span data-start="876.661" data-end="880.75">really like Fettucci ine code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="880.75" data-end="889.64">Have you ever lived with like a large App that was built on the wrong framework? And</span> <span data-start="889.64" data-end="894.19">you tried to upgrade it but you never could, because you could never understand how the</span> <span data-start="894.19" data-end="900.16">underlying framework worked. Your had an existing App that was just written in haste, it was</span> <span data-start="900.16" data-end="904.83">all spaghetti code, maybe it was good spaghetti code, maybe it was Fettuccine code. A lot</span> <span data-start="904.83" data-end="913.3">of abstractions lots of repetition. Which one left you with more of a usable code? Abstraction</span> <span data-start="913.3" data-end="919.74">comes with a significant cost and significant risk, so it's better to abstract to begin</span> <span data-start="919.74" data-end="926.38">with and once you have a nice Feuccin e code base start finding repeated patterns, if the</span> <span data-start="926.38" data-end="932.75">pattern doesn't lead to bugs, don't fix it. It might look ugly but it's not hurting anyone.</span> <span data-start="932.75" data-end="940.56">Try to generalize it, and you only risk adding bugs in the generalization. It only adds surface</span> <span data-start="940.56" data-end="947.46">area to hurt everyone. But once it starts causing bugs then it becomes a problem because</span> <span data-start="947.46" data-end="953.24">it's repetition and some algorithms can be difficult to get right and then it starts</span> <span data-start="953.24" data-end="959.26">causing bugs then you generalize, you create an abstraction, but make sure the abstraction</span> <span data-start="959.26" data-end="967.31">can be used for wide variety of use cases because it has to make it worth it's weight.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="967.31" data-end="971.72">It might even be subject for standardtion if it's general enough. And this is where</span> <span data-start="971.72" data-end="976.98">slow moving standards can actually help you. If it convenience recall enough and useful</span> <span data-start="976.98" data-end="981.73">enough, it will be accepted as a standard, maybe it will be accepted as a draft and you</span> <span data-start="981.73" data-end="984.46">can sort of continue from that.</span> <span data-start="984.46" data-end="989.06">But if it's not, then maybe it's not actually worth the weight it's adding, maybe you need</span> <span data-start="989.06" data-end="998.839">to rethink or prove its value. Now let's talk about the DOM. There are apparently 25 methods</span> <span data-start="998.839" data-end="1005.841">to work with attributes alone, you can also access attributes throw properties. That's</span> <span data-start="1005.841" data-end="1012.79">still no reason to use a J query, the browser inconsistencies could be poly filled and the</span> <span data-start="1012.79" data-end="1018.43">rest is just basically adding some sugar. It's not solving the actual structural problem</span> <span data-start="1018.43" data-end="1022.53">and the come Plaintiff's Exhibitty of the actual DOM, the living DOM, and that thing</span> <span data-start="1022.53" data-end="1028.72">is the thank that leads to bugs. No and Already and Ember tries to address this by change</span> <span data-start="1028.72" data-end="1034.44">tracking and adding\h‑‑ bites on top of the DOM, you adopt have to access it directly</span> <span data-start="1034.44" data-end="1044.36">and solves the bugs. In theory web components and similar efforts can actually work on standardizing</span> <span data-start="1044.36" data-end="1050.3">these patterns then there's one thing you have to learn and this data mining, web components</span> <span data-start="1050.3" data-end="1057.211">world. Except, they don't actually remove as much as they add. The surface area of the</span> <span data-start="1057.211" data-end="1062.3">framework, these paradigms, it's huge, there's a lot of things you have to learn. Learning</span> <span data-start="1062.3" data-end="1069.24">how to use nit a fully structured way, and the intraquasis of that is still huge. And</span> <span data-start="1069.24" data-end="1075.37">that continues to be the case even when it's standardized. But, with this paradigm it's</span> <span data-start="1075.37" data-end="1079.34">all necessary. And that fende tends to happen when you keep building straight on top of</span> <span data-start="1079.34" data-end="1080.809">existing ideas.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1080.809" data-end="1088.59">So, sometimes joust have to rethink the whole stack. Come up with a smaller surface area.</span> <span data-start="1088.59" data-end="1092.16">So we thought, mutation is actualry the hard part of the DOM\h‑‑ mutation is actually</span> <span data-start="1092.16" data-end="1098.95">hard part of the D onlyM so what we through it away and do it like a patriot load. We</span> <span data-start="1098.95" data-end="1106.46">created react. We oar not trying to diverge from standard, we think functional approach</span> <span data-start="1106.46" data-end="1112.74">taken by react means we can drop so much more of the surface area. And all we're trying</span> <span data-start="1112.74" data-end="1118.52">to do is make it a lot easier to reason about code, without having you to think about a</span> <span data-start="1118.52" data-end="1124.8">lot of surface area. The remaining surface area is things that you can spend time thinking</span> <span data-start="1124.8" data-end="1133.03">about around your domain specific world. So this is the API of react . Suppose to function</span> <span data-start="1133.03" data-end="1139.5">that gets the initial state of component, render function that you can read from the</span> <span data-start="1139.5" data-end="1145.47">states. And a call back that sets state. You'll notice that the set state is actually the</span> <span data-start="1145.47" data-end="1151.21">only API in to react. This is really the only API you have to understande understand in</span> <span data-start="1151.21" data-end="1159.68">react. We also have this syntax sugar, basically because braces are difficult to read. It looks</span> <span data-start="1159.68" data-end="1167.8">like templates, but it's not really templates, there's no repeaters. In's no special directives,</span> <span data-start="1167.8" data-end="1172.45">there's no special conditionals, it's just plain old JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1172.45" data-end="1181.55">Now, reacts internals are pretty come collated. The differing algorithm can be fairly complicated.</span> <span data-start="1181.55" data-end="1185.34">But the surface area that you have to face as a developer to understand what's going</span> <span data-start="1185.34" data-end="1192.79">on in React is very simple, no new APIs just a simple concept. You can build an incredibly</span> <span data-start="1192.79" data-end="1202.621">con next App but this, we did and up until this point it sounds pretty good, right. But</span> <span data-start="1202.621" data-end="1213.84">nothing is free. So what are we giving up? Implicitness. React favors explicit APIs,</span> <span data-start="1213.84" data-end="1220.64">and for you to write out your code as explicitly as possible over built‑in Magic in many</span> <span data-start="1220.64" data-end="1225.04">cases we get request for implicit bubbling of events because it's teed use to pass a</span> <span data-start="1225.04" data-end="1231.73">call back around or extra properties around, well, turns out this is a terrible idea. It's</span> <span data-start="1231.73" data-end="1238.04">really difficult to follow code that depends on implicit bubbling of vents, it means that</span> <span data-start="1238.04" data-end="1244.91">if either side disappears, you don't know where it disappeared, let's say one call disappears</span> <span data-start="1244.91" data-end="1250.83">from your stack and later we realize that actually lead to a bug that we didn't anticipate,</span> <span data-start="1250.83" data-end="1255.42">how do you find what? Do you have to go through I have component and theirs of every component</span> <span data-start="1255.42" data-end="1263.1">and extraction along the way to find where that happened? This is just one example. If</span> <span data-start="1263.1" data-end="1269.48">but it speaks to the idea that saving a little bit of typing is actually not a good reason</span> <span data-start="1269.48" data-end="1272.92">enough for an abstraction.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1272.92" data-end="1279.58">It's much easier to recover from an explicit API by adding some sugar than to undo an explicit</span> <span data-start="1279.58" data-end="1285.21">API. And we take new abstractions in Direct very, very seriously, while you is to live</span> <span data-start="1285.21" data-end="1292.28">with a little bit of boilerplate (React) you will probably understand and refactor your</span> <span data-start="1292.28" data-end="1298.03">code in the future much easier. We make mistakes too, of course.</span> <span data-start="1298.03" data-end="1304.36">Um, if you're used to React you might have noticed that's not actually how you write</span> <span data-start="1304.36" data-end="1313.97">React right now we built our own class extraction. It was perhaps convenient. But in the next</span> <span data-start="1313.97" data-end="1319.741">version of React we're deprecate that and going all in on the ES 6 class, it's not an</span> <span data-start="1319.741" data-end="1328.16">extended verse of ES 6 classes just ES 6 classes, because it's not a one to one mapping it means</span> <span data-start="1328.16" data-end="1336.25">a little bit more boilerplate in some cases but it means that since we're removing proprietary</span> <span data-start="1336.25" data-end="1342.87">feature from the library, you can use whatever abstraction you want. Preferably we'll just</span> <span data-start="1342.87" data-end="1349.11">use standard JavaScripts so we don't add extra weight to our industry. But, if you railly</span> <span data-start="1349.11" data-end="1356.179">do want to use a third party library, since we provide the standard class system it means</span> <span data-start="1356.179" data-end="1361.98">that we can accept any kind of third party class system as well. Because the standard</span> <span data-start="1361.98" data-end="1367.11">represents an intermediate representation that can be shared across libraries, this</span> <span data-start="1367.11" data-end="1374.67">causes de‑couping as a side effect. Now think about that for a minute, React already</span> <span data-start="1374.67" data-end="1384.45">has a small surface area, removing proprietary features from the framework. Now, just because</span> <span data-start="1384.45" data-end="1391.67">you should mostly use standard language, it doesn't mean you have to use all of it. So,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1391.67" data-end="1396.03">JavaScript already has a huge service area if you want to keep adding more stuff to it,</span> <span data-start="1396.03" data-end="1400.19">then we have to remove something, because otherwise it will just keep growing and our</span> <span data-start="1400.19" data-end="1409.34">industry will run out of head space. Or whatever. But this is already being done through linters,</span> <span data-start="1409.34" data-end="1417.86">strict mode, VMs only optimize certain patterns. So, the next thing I want to work on is basically</span> <span data-start="1417.86" data-end="1424.38">just formalizing this step of the process. How do we remove features from existing language.</span> <span data-start="1424.38" data-end="1429.49">I mean they'll never be removed from the web, because you can't remove things from the web,</span> <span data-start="1429.49" data-end="1434.53">but it can be removed from our industry's mental service area.</span> <span data-start="1434.53" data-end="1443.02">So, let's put JS on a diet. Use poly fills instead of libraries, write explicit and repetitive</span> <span data-start="1443.02" data-end="1450.2">code, only abstract to actually solve buttings, not because it looks better. And rethink the</span> </p>
