<p><span data-start="37.61" data-end="38.61"><span class="speaker">Ashley</span>: All right.</span> <span data-start="38.61" data-end="39.61">Here everybody.</span> <span data-start="39.61" data-end="40.61">This is good.</span> <span data-start="40.61" data-end="41.61">As you filter in, I'm going to start my talk a little strange and read to you from the</span> <span data-start="41.61" data-end="43.909">namesake of this talk, which is Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time.</span> <span data-start="43.909" data-end="52.809">So this is from chapter one, a picture of the universe, a well known scientist, once</span> <span data-start="52.809" data-end="59.18">known  â€”  he described how the Earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits</span> <span data-start="59.18" data-end="64.53">around the center of a vast collection of star called a galaxy typical at the end of</span> <span data-start="64.53" data-end="70.75">the lecture a little old lady got up in the back of the room and said, what you have told</span> <span data-start="70.75" data-end="72.92">us is rubbish.</span> <span data-start="72.92" data-end="78.74">The world is a giant plate supported on the back of a tortoise.</span> <span data-start="78.74" data-end="87.509">And the scientist gave a reply saying: Well, what is the tortoise standing on, said the</span> <span data-start="87.509" data-end="89.729">scientist.</span> <span data-start="89.729" data-end="97.619">You're very clever, young man, very clever, old lady, but it's turtles all the way down.</span> <span data-start="97.619" data-end="104.06">Now you might be wondering that our universe is some sort of plate and there are turtles</span> <span data-start="104.06" data-end="105.06">floating in space.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="105.06" data-end="111.369">You might think that that's an odd idea but this talk is going to be the kind of talk</span> <span data-start="111.369" data-end="116.04">that's going to ask you to look at some of the concepts that you take for granted and</span> <span data-start="116.04" data-end="118.409">ask you you think they're true.</span> <span data-start="118.409" data-end="125.049">Now why on earth would something like that, with turtles in space have to do with JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="125.049" data-end="128.93">And, hopefully, by the end of this talk, you'll have figured it out.</span> <span data-start="128.93" data-end="129.93">All right.</span> <span data-start="129.93" data-end="133.79">So, hi, my name is Ashley Williams, as was introduced.</span> <span data-start="133.79" data-end="139.68">You may know me from Twitter as @agdubs, and if you do, I'm very sorry, don't follow.</span> <span data-start="139.68" data-end="140.84">I'm terrible.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="140.84" data-end="144.19">I work at this company that you would npm.</span> <span data-start="144.19" data-end="147.11">Anybody heard of npm?</span> <span data-start="147.11" data-end="151.67">And that's where I work as a services engineer.</span> <span data-start="151.67" data-end="155.25">Shout out to the fact that we've released npm 5.</span> <span data-start="155.25" data-end="156.27">Download it.</span> <span data-start="156.27" data-end="157.67">It's cool.</span> <span data-start="157.67" data-end="159.28">This talk is not about that.</span> <span data-start="159.28" data-end="162.92">But if you want to talk about that, find me.</span> <span data-start="162.92" data-end="166.86">If you're the type of person that watches slides, and sees a typo, and can't handle</span> <span data-start="166.86" data-end="170.29">themselves, please submit a PR.</span> <span data-start="170.29" data-end="173.17">I'm always very happy for them.</span> <span data-start="173.17" data-end="179.56">So I always like to start my talks saying I like to think about thinking, particularly</span> <span data-start="179.56" data-end="184.87">the kind of thinking that happens when people write code and the point of this talk today</span> <span data-start="184.87" data-end="191.83">is to maybe get you to also think, at least about the type of thinking that you do when</span> <span data-start="191.83" data-end="193.04">you write code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="193.04" data-end="196.33">So to get that thinking started, I'm going to pose you with this.</span> <span data-start="196.33" data-end="201.97">I'm not going to give you my answer quite yet but this is a PR that came into a repo</span> <span data-start="201.97" data-end="207.66">for a documentation project for a programming language, and they interested remove the jQuery</span> <span data-start="207.66" data-end="213.59">dependency by adding 400, and removing 200.</span> <span data-start="213.59" data-end="220.23">So this comes into play with dependency, and modularity.</span> <span data-start="220.23" data-end="225.26">How many people think that this is a really obvious thing to choose, accepted or not?</span> <span data-start="225.26" data-end="227.12">All right, good.</span> <span data-start="227.12" data-end="228.78">This talk's for you!</span> <span data-start="228.78" data-end="230.91">All right.</span> <span data-start="230.91" data-end="235.61">So I'm one of these people who has, for a very long time been a teacher as well as an</span> <span data-start="235.61" data-end="241.23">engineer and I'd like to say that teaching is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy</span> <span data-start="241.23" data-end="242.72">your thinking is.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="242.72" data-end="248.87">And over a long period of time of teaching people Node across the world, some people</span> <span data-start="248.87" data-end="254.67">in the audience are in these photos, we've run into some fascinating questions from beginners.</span> <span data-start="254.67" data-end="259.41">Now, here's one of the more fascinating ones and this is actually one of student of Steve</span> <span data-start="259.41" data-end="265.42">Kinney's asked him, how did you get permission to publish a module on npm.</span> <span data-start="265.42" data-end="266.84">True question.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="266.84" data-end="271.82">Many beginners think that you have to get permission, that there's an exceptionalism</span> <span data-start="271.82" data-end="274.21">of being able to publish a package.</span> <span data-start="274.21" data-end="280.12">But I hope you know that is not the case, literally anyone can publish a package on</span> <span data-start="280.12" data-end="281.12">npm.</span> <span data-start="281.12" data-end="287.94">Now once you get the idea of who can publish, the next one is how do you decide what goes</span> <span data-start="287.94" data-end="290.34">inside a module?</span> <span data-start="290.34" data-end="295.25">So like a proper scientist and wanting to get the correct answer, I went to Twitter</span> <span data-start="295.25" data-end="300.54">as I always do, because I was like, hey, what's your primary motivation for writing, or using</span> <span data-start="300.54" data-end="301.62">modular code?</span> <span data-start="301.62" data-end="304.57">Now, I got a huge number of responses.</span> <span data-start="304.57" data-end="306.87">This is a topic that a lot of people like.</span> <span data-start="306.87" data-end="310.08">But it was interesting because the responses were very diverse.</span> <span data-start="310.08" data-end="314.15">So one of the first sets of responses I got was that people believed that being able to</span> <span data-start="314.15" data-end="319.41">write modular code made them more disciplined, made debugging the code easier, made it easier</span> <span data-start="319.41" data-end="321.75">to test or document.</span> <span data-start="321.75" data-end="327.33">Alternatively, some people wrote that they made their code modular for reuse so that</span> <span data-start="327.33" data-end="330.45">they could do something in the future in case their code changed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="330.45" data-end="336.06">I put Bradley on his own slide in a talk about modularity, you gotta give Bradley a shout-out</span> <span data-start="336.06" data-end="343.13">for all the work that he's done for ES6 modules, so if you like ES6 modules, particularly in</span> <span data-start="343.13" data-end="344.87">Node, you should thank him.</span> <span data-start="344.87" data-end="349.11">So, of course, it was Twitter, so there were some shit posts, and they might have been</span> <span data-start="349.11" data-end="355.48">from some of the conference organizers that you know, we'll let those be.</span> <span data-start="355.48" data-end="360.96">But the biggest thing that we got was this idea of being able to reuse things, and in</span> <span data-start="360.96" data-end="363.36">particular, reuse things by separating concerns.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="363.36" data-end="367.53">Now, lots of people love this term separation of concerns, to the point that a lot of people</span> <span data-start="367.53" data-end="373.26">said it exactly in their responses but I thought it was awful vague that it was so specific</span> <span data-start="373.26" data-end="378.06">what people were saying, so I tried to push the question a bit further and I said, okay,</span> <span data-start="378.06" data-end="382.98">separation of concerns, how do you decide what the concerns are?</span> <span data-start="382.98" data-end="384.98">And this really stumped people.</span> <span data-start="384.98" data-end="390.919">People went from having ones of verbose answers to going.. uh, intuition mostly?</span> <span data-start="390.919" data-end="392.98">Said this person.</span> <span data-start="392.98" data-end="399.85">This person suggested throwing darts, which is about as scientific you can get, I guess.</span> <span data-start="399.85" data-end="406.53">Now even one of my JavaScript heroes, Ryan Haberbeek, who is here as an expert, who wrote</span> <span data-start="406.53" data-end="412.44">the book I learned JavaScript from, even he had an answer that, you know what, there are</span> <span data-start="412.44" data-end="418.22">a lot of practical, and ethical, and even aesthetic considerations to this question</span> <span data-start="418.22" data-end="424.81">of how you separate out your code and here's the punchline, the absolute best answer of</span> <span data-start="424.81" data-end="431.77">how do you split up your code is people got mad when I put it all in one file.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="431.77" data-end="436.919">So you remember this from the intro that I was not here for but saw on Twitter, I guess</span> <span data-start="436.919" data-end="439.72">a lot of people got mad.</span> <span data-start="439.72" data-end="445.16">But believe it or not, people do get mad in programming quite a bit and I could see how</span> <span data-start="445.16" data-end="449.08">if someone put their application all in one file, there would be a bunch of people grumping</span> <span data-start="449.08" data-end="451.95">about it.</span> <span data-start="451.95" data-end="456.38">But looking at the summary of these things it was it was really interesting because people</span> <span data-start="456.38" data-end="464.04">didn't have an idea or how or why it was a module.</span> <span data-start="464.04" data-end="469.09">However, overwhelmingly everyone thought that it was good.</span> <span data-start="469.09" data-end="472.46">No one respond with: Don't modularize your code.</span> <span data-start="472.46" data-end="476.87">So we're in this interesting positions where there's a lot of people who feel very interested</span> <span data-start="476.87" data-end="481.31">in something but don't have a solid grasp of why.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="481.31" data-end="487.26">So this made me think, okay, we have this huge batch of stuff, and maybe individually</span> <span data-start="487.26" data-end="493.22">they all make sense but we don't have a coherent picture of the world, a bit like this store,</span> <span data-start="493.22" data-end="497.54">which is a real store outside of Madison Square Garden in New York City.</span> <span data-start="497.54" data-end="503.16">I don't know if it capitalizes on all it promises but I would assume it does.</span> <span data-start="503.16" data-end="508.58">So this made me think, and I did this classic Ashley think that other people who might not</span> <span data-start="508.58" data-end="511.01">know me, might not think a normal person would do.</span> <span data-start="511.01" data-end="515.88">They would say, oh, the way that people think about modularity is the way people think about</span> <span data-start="515.88" data-end="517.699">time.</span> <span data-start="517.699" data-end="523.37">You know, people have this really intuitionistic idea that time passes but no one has any friggin'</span> <span data-start="523.37" data-end="526.189">idea of how time works.</span> <span data-start="526.189" data-end="530.43">If you do think you have an idea, you should find me at the party because I'm really interested.</span> <span data-start="530.43" data-end="536.74">But yeah, this made me think, I love this book, A Brief History of Time, and it goes</span> <span data-start="536.74" data-end="542.85">through and chronicles the history of how we've been thinking about the universe.</span> <span data-start="542.85" data-end="547.069">So my goal today is not necessarily to give you any answers but I do want to talk about</span> <span data-start="547.069" data-end="552.07">the ways that we think about modularity, and particularly give us some pointers to get</span> <span data-start="552.07" data-end="556.43">us in the right direction when we talk about splitting our code because, fundamentally,</span> <span data-start="556.43" data-end="561.41">splitting our code is so important and so critical to our daily lives that it's pretty</span> <span data-start="561.41" data-end="567.3">unsettling that we haven't really examined it as closely as I think we should.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="567.3" data-end="571.72">So I feel like I'm in a pretty good space to talk about this because the package ecosystem,</span> <span data-start="571.72" data-end="576.6">I personally think is JavaScript's picture of the universe, and working at npm, I'm pretty</span> <span data-start="576.6" data-end="578.72">close to that ecosystem.</span> <span data-start="578.72" data-end="582.19">So npm, I've checked this probably a week ago.</span> <span data-start="582.19" data-end="591.11">We have 472,000 packages, which puts us about  â€”  by an  â€”  three times as much as the next</span> <span data-start="591.11" data-end="592.579">package ecosystem.</span> <span data-start="592.579" data-end="599.209">So packages and modularity mean a lot to JavaScript because npm is the largest module repository</span> <span data-start="599.209" data-end="600.87">in the world.</span> <span data-start="600.87" data-end="602.99">Potentially, the universe.</span> <span data-start="602.99" data-end="605.13">I don't know if aliens have package managers.</span> <span data-start="605.13" data-end="608.029">But I feel like we'd be in the running, all right?</span> <span data-start="608.029" data-end="610.579">But what I want to do is ask: Okay.</span> <span data-start="610.579" data-end="612.499">Why is this the case, right?</span> <span data-start="612.499" data-end="615.759">Why are we, like, modularize all the things!</span> <span data-start="615.759" data-end="617.86">Cut my code into pieces.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="617.86" data-end="619.589">This is my JavaScript!</span> <span data-start="619.589" data-end="620.589">[ Laughter ]</span> <span data-start="620.589" data-end="621.879">Sorry, I had to do a pizza joke.</span> <span data-start="621.879" data-end="622.879">I had to.</span> <span data-start="622.879" data-end="623.879">It's late.</span> <span data-start="623.879" data-end="625.45">Gotta get you guys going!</span> <span data-start="625.45" data-end="626.45">Anyways.</span> <span data-start="626.45" data-end="627.6">Now lets get really serious.</span> <span data-start="627.6" data-end="630.2">This is a proper computer science talk.</span> <span data-start="630.2" data-end="637.399">So let's, Dijkstra, right, so Dijkstra is in a unique position that they have to think</span> <span data-start="637.399" data-end="648.06">in computational hierarchies, the automatic computer, lol, the automatic computer, haha,</span> <span data-start="648.06" data-end="653.119">the automatic computer confronts us with a radical new intellectual challenge that has</span> <span data-start="653.119" data-end="655.29">no precedent in our history.</span> <span data-start="655.29" data-end="661.2">So I'm not, like, the biggest fan of computer science exceptionalism but I definitely think</span> <span data-start="661.2" data-end="664.35">that he's definitely onto something here.</span> <span data-start="664.35" data-end="668.74">Modularity is the way, we as programmers, address this challenge that we need to be</span> <span data-start="668.74" data-end="672.24">thinking in very, very deep conceptual hierarchies.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="672.24" data-end="673.54">All right.</span> <span data-start="673.54" data-end="678.189">So we know kind of the problem that modularity is solving but what is modularity?</span> <span data-start="678.189" data-end="683.12">So, again, to the good sources, let's do a little Wikipedia.</span> <span data-start="683.12" data-end="688.339">Modular programming is a software-design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality</span> <span data-start="688.339" data-end="694.48">of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything</span> <span data-start="694.48" data-end="700.41">necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="700.41" data-end="704.809">So you may or may not be getting the idea but I'm a little worried about this one aspect</span> <span data-start="704.809" data-end="709.67">part of it and that seems to be the clincher of that definition, all right?</span> <span data-start="709.67" data-end="713.66">So in JavaScript we have this idea called the small-modules philosophy.</span> <span data-start="713.66" data-end="715.949">How many people here have heard of that?</span> <span data-start="715.949" data-end="717.3">How many people like it?</span> <span data-start="717.3" data-end="718.3">Interesting.</span> <span data-start="718.3" data-end="719.489">All right.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1577.84" data-end="1583.47">So I had asked recently a couple of  â€”  a few months after the first time, why do you choose</span> <span data-start="1583.47" data-end="1589.009">to split your code and so one of my coworkers, Chris Dickinson actually had a really awesome</span> <span data-start="1589.009" data-end="1590.009">answer.</span> <span data-start="1590.009" data-end="1596.14">He said I have two answers, the first one is kind of like what I would say, like, academically,</span> <span data-start="1596.14" data-end="1600.429">but the other one is actually how I think I really feel and what he says is: Programming</span> <span data-start="1600.429" data-end="1604.549">is like a maze that humans lack the language to describe completely.</span> <span data-start="1604.549" data-end="1607.679">With practice you start to internalize the maze.</span> <span data-start="1607.679" data-end="1612.429">And so that can seem pretty bad and what I want to say is internalizing and utilizing</span> <span data-start="1612.429" data-end="1614.09">intuition isn't super terrible.</span> <span data-start="1614.09" data-end="1616.929">It turns out dogs know calculus which is pretty neat.</span> <span data-start="1616.929" data-end="1620.95">You can read about this guy and his corgis to pick up a ball.</span> <span data-start="1620.95" data-end="1626.74">They're actually able to calculate the most efficient route, they're made of star stuff.</span> <span data-start="1626.74" data-end="1632.33">So we can always use intuition to figure out how to use modularity.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1632.33" data-end="1636.789">So we can all be a bunch of corgis.</span> <span data-start="1636.789" data-end="1642.399">So in summary, modularize your code to make your life easier for sure but the way that</span> <span data-start="1642.399" data-end="1648.09">you modularize, the way that you separate it out is by isolating things that are hard.</span> <span data-start="1648.09" data-end="1650.019">That's how you're going to make your life easier.</span> <span data-start="1650.019" data-end="1653.12">And in fact, modularizing is not free.</span> <span data-start="1653.12" data-end="1658.7">It's actually pretty expensive and the consequences could be for you for other developers and</span> <span data-start="1658.7" data-end="1660.41">also as you are end users.</span> <span data-start="1660.41" data-end="1668.15">So this helps you  â€”  too many people are are all like, I don't know what all that fancy</span> <span data-start="1668.15" data-end="1670.009">stuff is, I don't need that.</span> <span data-start="1670.009" data-end="1674.519">No, they're solving problems that you already have, so you should be looking into these</span> <span data-start="1674.519" data-end="1676.13">tools and using them.</span> <span data-start="1676.13" data-end="1680.549">And, finally, this is a fast-moving space right now, and there's not a lot of definitive</span> <span data-start="1680.549" data-end="1684.559">answers and I can't help but know that on Twitter recently, there's been a lot of really</span> <span data-start="1684.559" data-end="1691.919">nasty conversations about this, so I want to say, quit being jerks on Twitter, all right?</span> <span data-start="1691.919" data-end="1696.179">So I think this problem is far from being solved and I think getting more meet me into</span> <span data-start="1696.179" data-end="1701.57">this conversations and critically interrogating what we think about modularity is super important.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1701.57" data-end="1702.679">So I'll end with this.</span> <span data-start="1702.679" data-end="1709.049">This is from Julia Evans who everyone got mad at when she put it in one file.</span> <span data-start="1709.049" data-end="1715.919">She says: The more programming I do, the more things I run into, I don't know, Google doesn't</span> <span data-start="1715.919" data-end="1722.909">know, my colleagues don't know, but we gotta do it anyway and when this happens, she says,</span> <span data-start="1722.909" data-end="1728.009">right, this is why they pay a human with a brain who can investigate and learn, and these</span> <span data-start="1728.009" data-end="1730.94">should be the problems we're most excited to solve.</span> <span data-start="1730.94" data-end="1731.94">Thank you so much.</span> <span data-start="1731.94" data-end="1734.269">This is all of the sources from the talk.</span> <span data-start="1734.269" data-end="1735.269">Install npm 5!</span> <span data-start="1735.269" data-end="1736.269">[ Applause ]</span> <span data-start="1736.269" data-end="1737.269"Audience member: Thank you so much, Ashley.</span> </p>
