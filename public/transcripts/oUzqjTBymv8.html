data-end="956.87">an example we could actually I'm not</span> <span data-start="956.87" data-end="958.399">going to try to connect to the IRC here</span> <span data-start="958.399" data-end="960.11">but just to show you on the repple we</span> <span data-start="960.11" data-end="962.99">could capture any of these events so as</span> <span data-start="962.99" data-end="964.25">we've been firing these events the</span> <span data-start="964.25" data-end="965.63">repple has been running and it's just</span> <span data-start="965.63" data-end="967.01">keeping a log of everything that goes</span> <span data-start="967.01" data-end="968.93">through so it would be trivial for us to</span> <span data-start="968.93" data-end="970.579">just catch any event and

data-end="986.75">very disruptive this is providing a pub</span> <span data-start="986.75" data-end="989.18">sub that anyone can just deploy anywhere</span> <span data-start="989.18"

data-end="995.48">that's going to subscribe it now to this</span> <span data-start="995.48" data-end="997.1">channel and the only way to enumerate</span> <span data-start="997.1" data-end="998.54">the

right now it just released</span> <span data-start="1001.839" data-end="1004.089">it in addition to just having this pub</span> <span data-start="1004.089" data-end="1005.8">sub that anyone can subscribe to it also</span> <span data-start="1005.8" data-end="1007.959">launches up to other hooks one of which</span> <span data-start="1007.959" data-end="1011.56">is the web hook which is on port 9001</span> <span data-start="1011.56" data-end="1014.95">what this allows here we go is for you</span> <span data-start="1014.95" data-end="1017.23">to post arbitrary HTTP requests such as</span> <span data-start="1017.23" data-end="1021.04">a JSON RPC so you have this endpoint</span> <span data-start="1021.04" data-end="1022.959">that's not WebSocket based and not</span> <span data-start="1022.959" data-end="1024.55">socket i/o base so if you need someone</span> <span data-start="1024.55" data-end="1026.89">to broadcast the message into your hook</span> <span data-start="1026.89" data-end="1029.22">io cloud or into your hook j/s rather</span> <span data-start="1029.22" data-end="1032.23">they can just hit it with a HTTP request</span> <span

data-start="1044.439" data-end="1045.699">is that you could essentially just</span> <span data-start="1045.699" data-end="1048.73">deploy this little pub sub sano jitsu or</span> <span data-start="1048.73" data-end="1050.74">a similar hosting company and then you</span> <span data-start="1050.74" data-end="1052.36">could just start subscribing to messages</span> <span

data-end="1101.7">actually right now the Elm the idea is</span> <span data-start="1101.7" data-end="1104.129">to become an enterprise service bus so</span> <span data-start="1104.129"
