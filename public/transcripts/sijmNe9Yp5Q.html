data-end="131.41">this is kind of I started programming</span> <span data-start="131.41" data-end="134.86">very early know by the age of like eight</span> <span data-start="134.86" data-end="136.81">or nine I was very plainly things like</span> <span data-start="136.81" data-end="138.88">basic making like really simple bit back</span> <span data-start="138.88"

data-end="166.75">command-line apps in like python and</span> <span data-start="166.75" data-end="170.17">moving on to things like c and then in</span> <span data-start="170.17" data-end="171.37">very early high school i discovered</span> <span data-start="171.37" data-end="173.5">flash i just got to blue my vines i</span> <span data-start="173.5" data-end="174.7">could actually see what i was

data-end="184.18">programming inside this action script is</span> <span data-start="184.18" data-end="186.31">a pretty language there later in high</span> <span data-start="186.31" data-end="188.829">school we had a part of our schooling we</span> <span data-start="188.829" data-end="191.62">learn like Excel and Word and like the</span> <span data-start="191.62" data-end="193.299">built-in like vba language in that and</span> <span data-start="193.299" data-end="195.549">from that moves like some of us are</span> <span data-start="195.549" data-end="196.63">really curious that playing a visual</span> <span data-start="196.63" data-end="199.299">basic and then you know this web person</span> <span data-start="199.299" data-end="201.64">kept eating at me so I found out his PHP</span> <span data-start="201.64" data-end="203.26">and got involved in like sitepoint stuff</span> <span data-start="203.26" data-end="205.03">and our big on PHP at the time so I</span> <span data-start="205.03" data-end="207.34">learn how to play with the web then</span> <span data-start="207.34" data-end="208.87">unique comes around and like we all have</span> <span data-start="208.87" data-end="210.67">to do java the web car disappears for me</span> <span data-start="210.67" data-end="212.65">for a while but i can't i can't get away</span> <span data-start="212.65" data-end="214.42">i keep going back to it so I learned</span> <span data-start="214.42" data-end="215.52">jquery</span> <span data-start="215.52" data-end="218.64">not JavaScript jQuery I'll proudly say</span> <span data-start="218.64" data-end="223.44">that so then I got a job writing PHP and</span> <span data-start="223.44" data-end="225.33">jquery for a company after dropping out</span> <span data-start="225.33" data-end="228.26">of uni and I started messing with a</span> <span data-start="228.26" data-end="230.37">c-sharp was like an internal project we</span> <span data-start="230.37" data-end="232.38">had that people started using foolishly</span> <span data-start="232.38" data-end="234.99">and then we moved on to some Ruby stuff</span> <span data-start="234.99" data-end="238.26">and then like I couldn't get way from</span> <span data-start="238.26" data-end="240.81">this web thing later on I start working</span> <span data-start="240.81" data-end="243.18">like an agency moved mostly to front end</span> <span data-start="243.18" data-end="245.28">stuff i started doing ere you รง sister</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="245.28" data-end="247.56">HTML got really excited yeah something</span> <span data-start="247.56" data-end="249.96">some javascript stuff that eventually</span> <span data-start="249.96" data-end="251.61">leads to things like node and then like</span> <span data-start="251.61" data-end="253.02">I got really the performance and anyone</span> <span data-start="253.02" data-end="254.4">like worth their salt performance wants</span> <span data-start="254.4" data-end="255.54">to know everything about how everything</span> <span data-start="255.54" data-end="257.52">is working so you like engine X and a</span> <span data-start="257.52" data-end="258.87">passion you're tweaking things and like</span> <span data-start="258.87" data-end="262.17">how can I make this faster oh then it's</span> <span data-start="262.17" data-end="263.67">like our map start getting bigger and</span> <span data-start="263.67" data-end="265.26">bigger bigger companies like this</span> <span data-start="265.26" data-end="266.97">setting is crazy it's all over the place</span> <span data-start="266.97" data-end="269.1">how do we how do we manage this just</span> <span data-start="269.1" data-end="270.51">stop playing with sass and they removed</span> <span data-start="270.51" data-end="272.45">for to today and like I was using react</span> <span data-start="272.45" data-end="274.83">and like this all seems kind of crazy</span> <span data-start="274.83" data-end="277.26">like who does all this all these</span> <span data-start="277.26" data-end="279.36">languages and but actually have been</span> <span data-start="279.36" data-end="281.07">really simple because they all spring</span> <span data-start="281.07" data-end="283.89">from the stink like c-style languages so</span> <span data-start="283.89" data-end="286.08">we look at it something like a C++ for</span> <span data-start="286.08" data-end="288.09">example which is like one of those big</span> <span data-start="288.09" data-end="291.06">boy languages and we look at me see</span> <span data-start="291.06" data-end="293.34">things like all right we can figure out</span> <span data-start="293.34" data-end="294.96">we got like a variable assignment here</span> <span data-start="294.96" data-end="297.51">we've got like a function like that</span> <span data-start="297.51" data-end="299.52">we're taking a string you're adding the</span> <span data-start="299.52" data-end="301.11">input of the function to another string</span> <span data-start="301.11" data-end="302.58">or defined and returning that and just</span> <span data-start="302.58" data-end="304.2">calling that function it's pretty simple</span> <span data-start="304.2" data-end="305.91">code for like this like any language I</span> <span data-start="305.91" data-end="307.47">don't know kind of weird thing and this</span> <span data-start="307.47" data-end="309.18">is like we see like the string keyword</span> <span data-start="309.18" data-end="311.76">which is like we assume as a type like</span> <span data-start="311.76" data-end="313.95">we know our strings are that's all right</span> <span data-start="313.95" data-end="315.42">that's pretty bad it's nothing too</span> <span data-start="315.42" data-end="316.59">difficult but then you take things look</span> <span data-start="316.59" data-end="318.63">at javascript and like let's pretty much</span> <span data-start="318.63" data-end="320.13">the same thing right you got a variable</span> <span data-start="320.13" data-end="322.14">yet the VAR keyword a set of the string</span> <span data-start="322.14" data-end="324.06">like about the type anymore we're still</span> <span data-start="324.06" data-end="325.32">with the function the function name the</span> <span data-start="325.32" data-end="326.91">function parameter we're still plussing</span> <span data-start="326.91" data-end="328.11">two strings together returning I strand</span> <span data-start="328.11" data-end="329.82">calling a function that's like all right</span> <span data-start="329.82" data-end="331.08">well this is pretty straightforward</span> <span data-start="331.08" data-end="333.09">we've got a PHP and like this is almost</span> <span data-start="333.09" data-end="334.86">exactly the same thing we've dropped</span> <span data-start="334.86" data-end="336.75">afar and added like dollar signs and</span> <span data-start="336.75" data-end="341.07">otherwise its exact same code take this</span> <span data-start="341.07" data-end="343.77">to SAS exact same thing like we've taken</span> <span data-start="343.77" data-end="345.18">the function return web with that symbol</span> <span data-start="345.18" data-end="346.89">in front of them but yeah under the</span> <span data-start="346.89" data-end="348.12">covers are all kind of the same things</span> <span data-start="348.12" data-end="348.66">what this same</span> <span data-start="348.66" data-end="351.81">heritage lanikai you moved towards you</span> <span data-start="351.81" data-end="353.67">you are fast your language is anything</span> <span data-start="353.67" data-end="355.44">like Ruby where it's like all this</span> <span data-start="355.44" data-end="356.76">things made the code readable a now gone</span> <span data-start="356.76" data-end="361.35">and you kind of like if you've seen like</span> <span data-start="361.35" data-end="362.7">the previous examples you have rats</span> <span data-start="362.7" data-end="364.11">going on but jumping into like this like</span> <span data-start="364.11" data-end="368.04">all right they've taken it too far so</span> <span data-start="368.04" data-end="370.32">it's like it's not it's not hard this</span> <span data-start="370.32" data-end="371.28">programming things actually really easy</span> <span data-start="371.28" data-end="373.59">like that language is really language is</span> <span data-start="373.59" data-end="376.02">so easy but actually the whole thing of</span> <span data-start="376.02" data-end="377.67">like learning how to program is hard</span> <span data-start="377.67" data-end="379.29">like what is a ruby isn't whatsapp HP is</span> <span data-start="379.29" data-end="385.05">it was a javascript ism and so the last</span> <span data-start="385.05" data-end="387.27">four years I transitioned almost</span> <span data-start="387.27" data-end="389.07">primarily to entirely front-end</span> <span data-start="389.07" data-end="390.78">theyselves the hardest one market finds</span> <span data-start="390.78" data-end="393.6">most enjoyable problem and things like</span> <span data-start="393.6" data-end="395.04">an interesting start running meetups and</span> <span data-start="395.04" data-end="397.44">hang out entirely more fronting crowds</span> <span data-start="397.44" data-end="398.88">then we'd hire more developers in my</span> <span data-start="398.88" data-end="400.8">current job and they'd never seen me</span> <span data-start="400.8" data-end="402.72">right back anchored so you can send</span> <span data-start="402.72" data-end="404.34">questions is like you can do this weird</span> <span data-start="404.34" data-end="407.43">debates like is X even program you CSIS</span> <span data-start="407.43" data-end="409.65">exit programming like what I wanted to</span> <span data-start="409.65" data-end="410.49">do a real code why you're doing this</span> <span data-start="410.49" data-end="412.68">front-end thing like you seem so smart</span> <span data-start="412.68" data-end="417">what are you doing with your life this</span> <span data-start="417" data-end="418.98">is like this this is pretty pervasive</span> <span data-start="418.98" data-end="420.42">and I think about this in like what is</span> <span data-start="420.42" data-end="421.65">your programming it's like in the front</span> <span data-start="421.65" data-end="422.76">end with the lowest maintainability</span> <span data-start="422.76" data-end="424.23">scaling issues that we do on the back</span> <span data-start="424.23" data-end="427.14">end we're so he's doing a bunch of</span> <span data-start="427.14" data-end="428.82">operations here we care about we care</span> <span data-start="428.82" data-end="431.34">about performance yeah and it we have</span> <span data-start="431.34" data-end="432.3">two things like they have to worry about</span> <span data-start="432.3" data-end="433.169">we have to worry about compatibility</span> <span data-start="433.169" data-end="434.43">they have to wear BEC compatibility or</span> <span data-start="434.43" data-end="436.08">cross-platform like that code they write</span> <span data-start="436.08" data-end="437.49">it on PHP runs in that server it's</span> <span data-start="437.49" data-end="439.77">always going to work on that server very</span> <span data-start="439.77" data-end="441.12">little is going to break it and we had</span> <span data-start="441.12" data-end="442.74">this like a whole array of things such</span> <span data-start="442.74" data-end="444.21">different browser to browser versions</span> <span data-start="444.21" data-end="447.169">like a lot of a significantly harder and</span> <span data-start="447.169" data-end="449.25">so I pondered on this for one really</span> <span data-start="449.25" data-end="451.35">kind of bugged me and I bumped into this</span> <span data-start="451.35" data-end="453.9">mention of the dunning-kruger effect and</span> <span data-start="453.9" data-end="455.4">it's kind of a two-part thing and one is</span> <span data-start="455.4" data-end="458.46">like as people who only know a little</span> <span data-start="458.46" data-end="460.169">bit about a thing can extrapolate what</span> <span data-start="460.169"
