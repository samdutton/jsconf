<p><span data-start="24.81" data-end="27.75">I have been advised to be relatable and</span> <span data-start="27.75" data-end="29.49">so I'm going to tell you a little bit</span> <span data-start="29.49" data-end="34.58">about myself</span> <span data-start="34.59" data-end="36.75">so I actually don't come from a</span> <span data-start="36.75" data-end="38.25">traditional computer science background</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="38.25" data-end="41.09">I used to be a stage manager for theater</span> <span data-start="41.09" data-end="43.92">I'm pretty new to this game I've been</span> <span data-start="43.92" data-end="45.57">working for a little over a year and a</span> <span data-start="45.57" data-end="48.96">half in the industry to be very</span> <span data-start="48.96" data-end="50.67">reductive about what a stage manager is</span> <span data-start="50.67" data-end="52.26">just so that you understand the context</span> <span data-start="52.26" data-end="55.199">during the rehearsal process the actors</span> <span data-start="55.199" data-end="57.239">and the director are focusing on the</span> <span data-start="57.239" data-end="59.94">artistic development of a piece and the</span> <span data-start="59.94" data-end="61.829">stage manager is figuring out what needs</span> <span data-start="61.829" data-end="63.629">to be done to make all of those things</span> <span data-start="63.629" data-end="66.36">happen in real life and communicating</span> <span data-start="66.36" data-end="67.71">with the necessary departments and</span> <span data-start="67.71" data-end="70.68">people and so on so I was drawn to</span> <span data-start="70.68" data-end="72.6">coding because it has many parallels</span> <span data-start="72.6" data-end="75.299">with the organizational analytical and</span> <span data-start="75.299" data-end="77.4">problem-solving skills required in stage</span> <span data-start="77.4" data-end="79.83">management and also because both fields</span> <span data-start="79.83" data-end="83.549">are highly collaborative and I'm not a</span> <span data-start="83.549" data-end="85.619">loner so you know I enjoy working with</span> <span data-start="85.619" data-end="87.96">other people and coming together to make</span> <span data-start="87.96" data-end="92.25">cool stuff lastly I'm also a very long</span> <span data-start="92.25" data-end="94.409">game kind of person so I've always</span> <span data-start="94.409" data-end="96.39">enjoyed being in a position to watch the</span> <span data-start="96.39" data-end="99.63">evolution of a product over time it's</span> <span data-start="99.63" data-end="101.189">just as interesting to watch the process</span> <span data-start="101.189" data-end="105.29">for me as it is to have a final product</span> <span data-start="105.29" data-end="108.869">and so now perhaps you'll have some</span> <span data-start="108.869" data-end="111.36">understanding behind what my talk is</span> <span data-start="111.36" data-end="114">focusing on today so now that you can</span> <span data-start="114" data-end="116.7">relate to me I am going to go ahead and</span> <span data-start="116.7" data-end="121.189">get started with creative collaboration</span> <span data-start="121.189" data-end="125.79">building a unified design system so we</span> <span data-start="125.79" data-end="130.02">left off here conde nast new york as was</span> <span data-start="130.02" data-end="132.72">mentioned Conde Nast has a lot of</span> <span data-start="132.72" data-end="136.349">different brands many disparate types</span> <span data-start="136.349" data-end="141.569">and topics and the way that things used</span> <span data-start="141.569" data-end="144.989">to be back in the days of yore was that</span> <span data-start="144.989" data-end="148.44">every different brand had its own team</span> <span data-start="148.44" data-end="150.48">of Engineers and its own code base for</span> <span data-start="150.48" data-end="152.7">its website and of course this seemed</span> <span data-start="152.7" data-end="154.95">sensible because this is a company that</span> <span data-start="154.95" data-end="157.17">started in print publishing over a</span> <span data-start="157.17" data-end="159.09">hundred years ago and so the way that</span> <span data-start="159.09" data-end="160.98">the magazine's work is that they each</span> <span data-start="160.98" data-end="162.54">have their own separate team so as</span> <span data-start="162.54" data-end="164.4">digital started to be integrated into</span> <span data-start="164.4" data-end="166.8">the company you just add people to each</span> <span data-start="166.8" data-end="169.769">of those teams and you know carry on</span> <span data-start="169.769" data-end="173.76">but consider that despite the very</span> <span data-start="173.76" data-end="177.69">distinct tones designs and topics of</span> <span data-start="177.69" data-end="179.879">each of the brand's their digital needs</span> <span data-start="179.879" data-end="183.72">are actually overwhelmingly similar for</span> <span data-start="183.72" data-end="186.84">example some shared site needs include</span> <span data-start="186.84" data-end="189.019">the ability to show aggregated content</span> <span data-start="189.019" data-end="191.099">which is to say something like a home</span> <span data-start="191.099" data-end="195.39">page or a page showing content by author</span> <span data-start="195.39" data-end="201.269">by by subject you also need to be able</span> <span data-start="201.269" data-end="204.209">to show the actual content itself when</span> <span data-start="204.209" data-end="206.19">someone chooses an article to read or a</span> <span data-start="206.19" data-end="209.04">gallery to look at and that is pretty</span> <span data-start="209.04" data-end="211.59">much it that's what we do that's content</span> <span data-start="211.59" data-end="213.9">and you just need to be able to view it</span> <span data-start="213.9" data-end="216.69">that's a website for us for the most</span> <span data-start="216.69" data-end="222.29">part so with that being the case having</span> <span data-start="222.29" data-end="225.269">separate teams for all of the different</span> <span data-start="225.269" data-end="227.28">websites starting to make less and less</span> <span data-start="227.28" data-end="230.129">sense because with the sites being as</span> <span data-start="230.129" data-end="231.989">similar as they are in terms of what</span> <span data-start="231.989" data-end="234.33">they need it would make sense that any</span> <span data-start="234.33" data-end="236.04">feature that works well on one site</span> <span data-start="236.04" data-end="237.689">would work well on another and we would</span> <span data-start="237.689" data-end="240.599">want to pass it along so I don't need to</span> <span data-start="240.599" data-end="243.78">go too much into explaining how that's</span> <span data-start="243.78" data-end="246.989">not really efficient in order to get one</span> <span data-start="246.989" data-end="249.9">feature onto every different brand by</span> <span data-start="249.9" data-end="251.37">having it passed from brand to brand</span> <span data-start="251.37" data-end="255.09">with dev time in between and so on so</span> <span data-start="255.09" data-end="257.42">we've said that was enough of that</span> <span data-start="257.42" data-end="260.48">and we set forth a plan to create a</span> <span data-start="260.48" data-end="262.94">single application that would host all</span> <span data-start="262.94" data-end="266">of our sites we'd have a library of</span> <span data-start="266" data-end="268.73">shared components built in react and</span> <span data-start="268.73" data-end="271.1">these components would not just be the</span> <span data-start="271.1" data-end="274.97">visual aspects of the designs but they</span> <span data-start="274.97" data-end="276.89">would really be like truly plug-and-play</span> <span data-start="276.89" data-end="279.98">pieces of a website like you put in a</span> <span data-start="279.98" data-end="282.77">newsletter signup form you pop it in</span> <span data-start="282.77" data-end="284.96">there and you have a newsletter signup</span> <span data-start="284.96" data-end="286.13">form it's connected to the API</span> <span data-start="286.13" data-end="287.57">everything works people can use</span> <span data-start="287.57" data-end="290.23">immediately as once as soon as it's live</span> <span data-start="290.23" data-end="295.01">and so that's that's our lofty goal to</span> <span data-start="295.01" data-end="296.93">increase our efficiency to reduce or</span> <span data-start="296.93" data-end="298.7">done didn't see and it's really be able</span> <span data-start="298.7" data-end="300.77">to move a lot more quickly in terms of</span> <span data-start="300.77" data-end="302.87">developing products that will help us</span> <span data-start="302.87" data-end="306.05">stay innovative and ahead in the media</span> <span data-start="306.05" data-end="311.53">industry so this application which we</span> <span data-start="311.53" data-end="315.83">lovingly dubbed diverso was what we set</span> <span data-start="315.83" data-end="320.51">out to do a little bit before the end of</span> <span data-start="320.51" data-end="322.09">last year we started making the server</span> <span data-start="322.09" data-end="324.29">we moved to working on front-end stuff</span> <span data-start="324.29" data-end="327.04">near the beginning of this year and so</span> <span data-start="327.04" data-end="330.35">just for clarity's sake in case you were</span> <span data-start="330.35" data-end="334.16">wondering this is the deal if you want a</span> <span data-start="334.16" data-end="336.65">feature to be given to many different</span> <span data-start="336.65" data-end="339.41">brands all we want to be able to do is</span> <span data-start="339.41" data-end="341.57">develop it one time hence one clock</span> <span data-start="341.57" data-end="344.63">inverse oh and then it'll automatically</span> <span data-start="344.63" data-end="347.24">be available to any brand that is hosted</span> <span data-start="347.24" data-end="353">therein and we had a few requirements</span> <span data-start="353" data-end="355.63">around how we wanted to implement this</span> <span data-start="355.63" data-end="357.98">because you know without some</span> <span data-start="357.98" data-end="358.79">limitations</span> <span data-start="358.79" data-end="362.42">it could very easily be messy</span> <span data-start="362.42" data-end="364.94">so one thing was that we decided but we</span> <span data-start="364.94" data-end="366.94">would have no brand specific code</span> <span data-start="366.94" data-end="369.74">reusability was going to be the key in</span> <span data-start="369.74" data-end="374.06">terms of everything we did because if we</span> <span data-start="374.06" data-end="377.48">want to add features they need to be</span> <span data-start="377.48" data-end="380.3">able to be popped into any given brand</span> <span data-start="380.3" data-end="383.18">site and working immediately</span> <span data-start="383.18" data-end="389.27">so no brands specific code another is</span> <span data-start="389.27" data-end="391.22">that we needed to make it scalable be</span> <span data-start="391.22" data-end="394.7">cuz Conde Nast has over 20 brands right</span> <span data-start="394.7" data-end="397.67">now we need to support all of those but</span> <span data-start="397.67" data-end="400.1">also we need to support any number of</span> <span data-start="400.1" data-end="401.93">brands that they may choose to add in</span> <span data-start="401.93" data-end="404.51">the future and it should be just as easy</span> <span data-start="404.51" data-end="407.18">for our application to support 40 brands</span> <span data-start="407.18" data-end="410.5">as it is for it to support two and</span> <span data-start="410.5" data-end="412.58">lastly we really needed to get it done</span> <span data-start="412.58" data-end="416.27">as fast as possible that is because I</span> <span data-start="416.27" data-end="419.03">think that the you know the business</span> <span data-start="419.03" data-end="421.24">advantage here is clear in terms of</span> <span data-start="421.24" data-end="423.59">restructuring the team and you know how</span> <span data-start="423.59" data-end="425.96">the websites work and also because we</span> <span data-start="425.96" data-end="427.79">don't want to have to support both</span> <span data-start="427.79" data-end="430.03">legacy websites and this new app</span> <span data-start="430.03" data-end="431.96">concurrently for too long at the time</span> <span data-start="431.96" data-end="436.16">and perhaps most importantly because you</span> <span data-start="436.16" data-end="438.71">can't go to a brand and say hey we</span> <span data-start="438.71" data-end="440.21">figured out a way to make a really cool</span> <span data-start="440.21" data-end="442.52">application that's gonna be really great</span> <span data-start="442.52" data-end="445.1">for everyone in everything and we're</span> <span data-start="445.1" data-end="446.63">gonna stop working on what you've got</span> <span data-start="446.63" data-end="447.86">going on right now so we can work on</span> <span data-start="447.86" data-end="448.79">that and we'll be done in five years</span> <span data-start="448.79" data-end="452.41">okay bye so with that being the case</span> <span data-start="452.41" data-end="460.419">time was of the essence so really how</span> <span data-start="460.419" data-end="465.919">how indeed mr. walberg JSON JSON is</span> <span data-start="465.919" data-end="469.94">perhaps not the not what you would</span> <span data-start="469.94" data-end="472.7">expect for an answer to this question</span> <span data-start="472.7" data-end="475.19">and you probably also wouldn't expect it</span> <span data-start="475.19" data-end="476.63">to have exclamation points like that</span> <span data-start="476.63" data-end="478.82">because I feel like it's not typically</span> <span data-start="478.82" data-end="484.52">so exciting but here it is the the main</span> <span data-start="484.52" data-end="486.47">way that we were going to pull off this</span> <span data-start="486.47" data-end="490.04">system was by having every brand based</span> <span data-start="490.04" data-end="493.04">in a configuration in that way we would</span> <span data-start="493.04" data-end="495.59">be able to not have any unique logic</span> <span data-start="495.59" data-end="499.91">written within our components and still</span> <span data-start="499.91" data-end="502.49">have all of the brand's maintain their</span> <span data-start="502.49" data-end="506.02">you know unique visual appearance</span> <span data-start="506.02" data-end="508.13">because you know the differences need to</span> <span data-start="508.13" data-end="510.979">live somewhere otherwise you've made a</span> <span data-start="510.979" data-end="512.539">lot of people really angry and you've</span> <span data-start="512.539" data-end="515.9">just made one website so how does that</span> <span data-start="515.9" data-end="519.53">work in terms of the like what does this</span> <span data-start="519.53" data-end="523.61">configuration file look like so this is</span> <span data-start="523.61" data-end="524.79">an example</span> <span data-start="524.79" data-end="528.99">of how we started going about with here</span> <span data-start="528.99" data-end="531.63">colors one of the many many things that</span> <span data-start="531.63" data-end="533.73">need to be uniquely adjusted for every</span> <span data-start="533.73" data-end="538.68">brand so you'll see that we have these</span> <span data-start="538.68" data-end="540.54">different key value pairs and these are</span> <span data-start="540.54" data-end="544.38">referred to as design tokens the design</span> <span data-start="544.38" data-end="548.19">token just being the name of the unique</span> <span data-start="548.19" data-end="551.16">bit that is being used as the dynamic</span> <span data-start="551.16" data-end="554.85">element of a certain website that gets</span> <span data-start="554.85" data-end="558">changed on a brand by brand basis so</span> <span data-start="558" data-end="561.36">here our palette has different color</span> <span data-start="561.36" data-end="565.11">values and then we have different use</span> <span data-start="565.11" data-end="569.01">cases where we were creating tokens that</span> <span data-start="569.01" data-end="571.829">were semantically named but still</span> <span data-start="571.829" data-end="574.11">decoupled from their usage again for</span> <span data-start="574.11" data-end="575.88">reusability we didn't want to name</span> <span data-start="575.88" data-end="579.829">something you know footer link because</span> <span data-start="579.829" data-end="583.38">theoretically that everything should be</span> <span data-start="583.38" data-end="585.72">somewhat consistent and you might want</span> <span data-start="585.72" data-end="587.91">to use that link token again elsewhere</span> <span data-start="587.91" data-end="591.72">that's not a footer and you know you</span> <span data-start="591.72" data-end="599.579">don't confuse people so so how does that</span> <span data-start="599.579" data-end="604.73">actually become styles what we did was</span> <span data-start="604.73" data-end="608.61">set up our JSON to be loaded into our</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="608.61" data-end="611.279">Styles which we were writing in sass as</span> <span data-start="611.279" data-end="615.3">a map and then from there we can do</span> <span data-start="615.3" data-end="617.37">things like make this nifty function you</span> <span data-start="617.37" data-end="620.16">see at the bottom that just references</span> <span data-start="620.16" data-end="625.079">the map to get a color value and then</span> <span data-start="625.079" data-end="628.019">you can use that function like so in the</span> <span data-start="628.019"
