data-end="511.59">are now Ruby are going to be completely</span> <span data-start="511.59" data-end="513.87">in JavaScript witches which is pretty</span> <span data-start="513.87" data-end="516.14">cool but you know as we were doing this</span> <span data-start="516.14" data-end="519.27">we kind of had a problem because we</span> <span data-start="519.27" data-end="521.909">wrote all our code before Common j/s</span> <span data-start="521.909" data-end="523.979">existed and probably a lot of you did as</span> <span data-start="523.979" data-end="526.62">well and we thought well can we build a</span> <span data-start="526.62" data-end="530.07">tool that will help us do this with with</span> <span data-start="530.07" data-end="533.55">the with with with the code that we have</span> <span data-start="533.55" data-end="534.87">that's not written for common J's and</span> <span data-start="534.87" data-end="536.4">that helps us solve the problem of</span> <span data-start="536.4" data-end="538.14">sharing because come and jess is great</span> <span data-start="538.14" data-end="539">for module</span> <span data-start="539" data-end="541.61">but we still can't share our code right</span> <span data-start="541.61" data-end="544.01">so so there you know the most</span> <span data-start="544.01" data-end="546.29">communities like Ruby and Python have to</span> <span data-start="546.29" data-end="548.54">solve this with the gems and eggs and</span> <span data-start="548.54" data-end="550.07">stuff like I could manage right so</span> <span data-start="550.07" data-end="552.23">package managers so we looked at all the</span> <span data-start="552.23" data-end="553.76">package managers and found that they</span> <span data-start="553.76" data-end="555.65">didn't really help us in the way that we</span> <span data-start="555.65" data-end="557.9">had with mikes big problem I mean with</span> <span data-start="557.9" data-end="559.16">the big problem that Mike pointed out</span> <span data-start="559.16" data-end="561.65">yeah being able to take large amounts of</span> <span data-start="561.65" data-end="563.09">existing code and make it easy</span> <span data-start="563.09" data-end="565.61">convertible into common GS so we'd like</span> <span data-start="565.61" data-end="567.02">to offer the community we've been</span> <span data-start="567.02" data-end="568.94">working on this thing called CJ s why i</span> <span data-start="568.94" data-end="570.56">personally has you know as the community</span> <span data-start="570.56" data-end="573.65">has I've been working on CBS and this is</span> <span data-start="573.65" data-end="575.57">we're trying to solve that that problem</span> <span data-start="575.57" data-end="577.4">of making it very easy to take existing</span> <span data-start="577.4" data-end="579.29">code and put it in there and share it</span> <span data-start="579.29" data-end="582.68">with everybody right so um this is how</span> <span data-start="582.68" data-end="585.98">you would install a package of and to be</span> <span data-start="585.98" data-end="588.17">used in your software so it's one line</span> <span data-start="588.17" data-end="590.18">command easy this is actually using the</span> <span data-start="590.18" data-end="592.07">package so it's just you know you just</span> <span data-start="592.07" data-end="594.2">do some requires and then use the motion</span> <span data-start="594.2" data-end="595.97">sensor code looks pretty simple pretty</span> <span data-start="595.97" data-end="599.33">simple um it's built into extend so it</span> <span data-start="599.33" data-end="601.4">uses get under the covers so when you</span> <span data-start="601.4" data-end="603.35">fork that you fork a package and it</span> <span data-start="603.35" data-end="605.18">makes a local version so you can edit it</span> <span data-start="605.18" data-end="606.56">okay whether you're telling me I don't</span> <span data-start="606.56" data-end="608.33">have to go dig into some library</span> <span data-start="608.33" data-end="610.82">directory and copy oh okay it does it</span> <span data-start="610.82" data-end="613.1">specifically open house built in okay I</span> <span data-start="613.1" data-end="616.49">like that so I mean you guys may not</span> <span data-start="616.49" data-end="618.95">like it but i like it i mean so in</span> <span data-start="618.95" data-end="620.36">packing is when you want to save it onto</span> <span data-start="620.36" data-end="621.92">a web server this is for like</span> <span data-start="621.92" data-end="623.75">client-side stuff and it sort of minify</span> <span data-start="623.75" data-end="625.43">zit and makes the easy to use it's like</span> <span data-start="625.43" data-end="628.49">build tools built in are so if you want</span> <span data-start="628.49" data-end="630.14">to push a package that you've done it's</span> <span data-start="630.14" data-end="631.55">just a single command it goes up there</span> <span data-start="631.55" data-end="633.11">so all this stuff is pretty simple</span> <span data-start="633.11" data-end="635.089">pretty easy so I'm going to hopefully do</span> <span data-start="635.089" data-end="639.92">a short little demo of this um yeah we</span> <span data-start="639.92" data-end="641.24">go to the command line all right you</span> <span data-start="641.24" data-end="643.97">know what let's blow the font up let's</span> <span data-start="643.97" data-end="645.32">pull the phone up in here hang on let me</span> <span data-start="645.32" data-end="648.02">go to you and get you okay so tech oh</span> <span data-start="648.02" data-end="649.67">can you blow the spawn top yeah I can't</span> <span data-start="649.67" data-end="653.75">man plus there you go bigger more bigger</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="653.75" data-end="655.88">I want more you want it yes all right</span> <span data-start="655.88" data-end="657.889">more okay</span> <span data-start="657.889" data-end="662.329">I technology life partners remember ok</span> <span data-start="662.329" data-end="665.029">so I get more what it's not even going</span> <span data-start="665.029" data-end="669.589">shift shift command shift hey yeah yes</span> <span data-start="669.589" data-end="671.869">not now you're in the sorry yeah I'm</span> <span data-start="671.869" data-end="675.079">good okay so um very simple this is</span> <span data-start="675.079" data-end="676.97">actually beautify ASI don't know if</span> <span data-start="676.97" data-end="678.98">everybody seen this it's just a library</span> <span data-start="678.98" data-end="680.72">jayus library that i found on the i</span> <span data-start="680.72" data-end="683.209">cloned it brought it down i just made</span> <span data-start="683.209" data-end="685.279">this one directory where i put index.js</span> <span data-start="685.279" data-end="686.6">which is actually the same code as</span> <span data-start="686.6" data-end="689.119">beautified ijs this is doing some smart</span> <span data-start="689.119" data-end="690.619">defaults and the only other file i need</span> <span data-start="690.619" data-end="693.559">to add in here said I mean um down at</span> <span data-start="693.559" data-end="694.97">the bottom I just I need to add this one</span> <span data-start="694.97" data-end="697.639">line exports beautify j/s beautifly okay</span> <span data-start="697.639" data-end="699.679">one line of code one line of code to use</span> <span data-start="699.679" data-end="702.499">this okay and then in the package Jason</span> <span data-start="702.499" data-end="704.089">this is like telling it I need just</span> <span data-start="704.089" data-end="705.709">these two things the name of the package</span> <span data-start="705.709" data-end="707.509">and then the version that we said is</span> <span data-start="707.509" data-end="709.16">that semantic versioning it's a semantic</span> <span data-start="709.16" data-end="710.54">right I can't do anything but semantic</span> <span data-start="710.54" data-end="712.549">versioning yes semantic versioning so I</span> <span data-start="712.549" data-end="714.079">already did have five so we can see that</span> <span data-start="714.079" data-end="715.399">you can update like this is a case where</span> <span data-start="715.399" data-end="717.139">you cloned it make a new version</span> <span data-start="717.139" data-end="721.149">excellent save it um and now let's go</span> <span data-start="721.149" data-end="723.079">you guys can you guys read this when you</span> <span data-start="723.079" data-end="729.379">make this bigger okay how's that that's</span> <span data-start="729.379" data-end="730.699">good that a little bit better that looks</span> <span data-start="730.699" data-end="734.169">good alright and now we just do seed</span> <span data-start="734.169" data-end="736.32">push</span> <span data-start="736.32" data-end="739.23">and it's pushing it up and now it's up</span> <span data-start="739.23" data-end="741.48">on the CJ s server so that's all I had</span> <span data-start="741.48" data-end="743.07">to do to actually import this thing and</span> <span data-start="743.07" data-end="744.51">that server is all written in JavaScript</span> <span data-start="744.51" data-end="745.8">right it's all written in JavaScript</span> <span data-start="745.8" data-end="748.65">it's using nodejs on v8 right now but it</span> <span data-start="748.65" data-end="750.09">can be easily ported to any JavaScript</span> <span data-start="750.09" data-end="753.18">meant background platform right okay so</span> <span data-start="753.18" data-end="756.69">let's actually use um this so I also</span> <span data-start="756.69" data-end="758.1">leave you that I'd you know you're just</span> <span data-start="758.1" data-end="759.9">tricking me so my music pushed it up</span> <span data-start="759.9" data-end="763.37">there now let's install it seed install</span> <span data-start="763.37" data-end="770.61">jeaious so one line command installs it</span> <span data-start="770.61" data-end="772.11">now that's not version that I just put</span> <span data-start="772.11" data-end="776.55">up there let's go so to use it i just</span> <span data-start="776.55" data-end="778.65">added a bunch of stuff here so make that</span> <span data-start="778.65" data-end="780.57">bigger all right sure so we can read</span> <span data-start="780.57" data-end="782.43">that code because I there we go don't</span> <span data-start="782.43" data-end="785.91">trust you okay so I just require JSP you</span> <span data-start="785.91" data-end="787.56">to Phi which the package and there's</span> <span data-start="787.56" data-end="789.06">another native package called assist to</span> <span data-start="789.06" data-end="790.41">do some print out things because we're</span> <span data-start="790.41" data-end="791.46">going to do run it from the command line</span> <span data-start="791.46" data-end="792.62">because this is going to be server code</span> <span data-start="792.62" data-end="795.03">just passing some regular JavaScript</span> <span data-start="795.03" data-end="797.79">that's enough formatted and then we're</span> <span data-start="797.79" data-end="799.83">going to beautify it and spit it out so</span> <span data-start="799.83" data-end="801.36">this is all we should be able to should</span> <span data-start="801.36" data-end="810.57">have to do four finger swipe down I know</span> <span data-start="810.57" data-end="814.98">oh no stinky no sticky fingers hairy</span> <span data-start="814.98" data-end="819.12">palm hairy palms too much html5 Pope</span> <span data-start="819.12" data-end="824.14">croc all right so all right here we go</span> <span data-start="824.15" data-end="827.88">okay so wow so please purchase it pretty</span> <span data-start="827.88" data-end="829.68">printed it out server side you can do it</span> <span data-start="829.68" data-end="830.91">with client side code and it makes it</span> <span data-start="830.91" data-end="831.99">easier we've already poured it over a</span> <span data-start="831.99" data-end="833.55">bunch of libraries yep that are up there</span> <span data-start="833.55" data-end="837">so you can even look at that so okay so</span> <span data-start="837" data-end="839.91">now is the part where I get to tell you</span> <span data-start="839.91" data-end="842.67">that okay we're all in the JavaScript</span> <span data-start="842.67" data-end="845.4">community here and it would be really</span> <span data-start="845.4" data-end="847.74">really good if we had a package manager</span> <span data-start="847.74" data-end="850.5">guys okay we are all still on islands of</span> <span data-start="850.5" data-end="852.42">code I mean c'mon Janice is part of the</span> <span data-start="852.42" data-end="855.3">solution but we really do need to sort</span> <span data-start="855.3" data-end="857.13">of unite around a package manager it</span> <span data-start="857.13" data-end="858.87">doesn't have to be this one doesn't have</span> <span data-start="858.87" data-end="859.98">to be this one we're just offering this</span> <span data-start="859.98" data-end="862.32">up as as a potential solution but we do</span> <span data-start="862.32" data-end="864.66">need to unite around something so please</span> <span data-start="864.66" data-end="867.39">go and download it play with it and tell</span> <span data-start="867.39" data-end="869.13">us if this works for you because you</span> <span data-start="869.13" data-end="869.98">know it</span> <span data-start="869.98" data-end="872.14">actually make a huge difference for us</span> <span data-start="872.14" data-end="873.94">as a community of JavaScript errs if we</span> <span data-start="873.94" data-end="876.52">can just have a JavaScript package</span> <span data-start="876.52" data-end="877.78">management if you just look at the stats</span> <span data-start="877.78" data-end="880.96">one like egg and Jim came out like you</span> <span data-start="880.96" data-end="883.57">see the explosion of the community and</span> <span data-start="883.57" data-end="885.22">different packages that people use and</span> <span data-start="885.22" data-end="886.84">different projects to come out so you</span> <span data-start="886.84" data-end="889.75">know and imp and impassioned play ok so</span> <span data-start="889.75" data-end="893.5">that was CJ s so it's quick simple and</span> <span data-start="893.5" data-end="896.08">it uses really it's very easy to use</span> <span data-start="896.08" data-end="897.7">existing code for it looks really easy</span> <span data-start="897.7" data-end="899.47">and look pretty good never use elected</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="899.47" data-end="902.47">I'm gonna try it ok next thing we want</span> <span data-start="902.47" data-end="903.61">to talk to you about is interface</span> <span data-start="903.61" data-end="906.49">builder um as for sprout core we sort of</span> <span data-start="906.49" data-end="907.87">been a little bit late in the game here</span> <span data-start="907.87" data-end="911.44">um you know you've seen like eh tjs</span> <span data-start="911.44" data-end="913.84">there's a couple of ones out there and</span> <span data-start="913.84" data-end="916.27">you know we felt like we didn't want to</span> <span data-start="916.27" data-end="917.83">start doing it before we were pre 10</span> <span data-start="917.83" data-end="919.9">because the API was changing and now</span> <span data-start="919.9" data-end="922.39">with the API static and you know we can</span> <span data-start="922.39" data-end="924.31">support this API we don't want people</span> <span data-start="924.31" data-end="926.26">building stuff with the UI to the UI</span> <span data-start="926.26" data-end="928.24">machine and with the interface builder</span> <span data-start="928.24" data-end="931.02">and not having a change underneath them</span> <span data-start="931.02" data-end="935.07">so we also wanted to decide that oh</span> <span data-start="935.07" data-end="938.68">we're calling it greenhouse yes now it</span> <span data-start="938.68" data-end="940.18">is greenhouse and this is particularly</span> <span data-start="940.18" data-end="941.35">the thing that might decide what we've</span> <span data-start="941.35" data-end="942.58">been working on for the last two months</span> <span data-start="942.58" data-end="944.71">or so about two months we really like</span> <span data-start="944.71" data-end="947.73">the logo so let's just look at that logo</span> <span data-start="947.73" data-end="950.77">enough with the logo okay next slide so</span> <span data-start="950.77" data-end="953.28">we want to innovate in some small way</span> <span data-start="953.28" data-end="955.63">you know interface builders haven't</span> <span data-start="955.63" data-end="958.15">changed a lot in the last 20 years old</span> <span data-start="958.15" data-end="959.65">in some small way we wanted to try and</span> <span data-start="959.65" data-end="961.51">push it forward a little bit so the</span> <span data-start="961.51" data-end="963.43">first thing we wanted to do was sort of</span> <span data-start="963.43" data-end="964.57">clean up the UI a lot of these you'll</span> <span data-start="964.57" data-end="967.75">see and like they have all these panels</span> <span data-start="967.75" data-end="969.34">and it's like well there's your UI in</span> <span data-start="969.34" data-end="972.15">that little box okay the too small so we</span> <span data-start="972.15" data-end="976.06">we've blown it out so it's all this is</span> <span data-start="976.06" data-end="977.5">your whole UI and we've just cleaned it</span> <span data-start="977.5" data-end="979.87">up and it's just the top bar and the</span> <span data-start="979.87" data-end="980.86">bottom and that's all you've got and</span> <span data-start="980.86" data-end="984.88">then the rest of it's just your UI so</span> <span data-start="984.88" data-end="987.49">and we also have these Pickers that come</span> <span data-start="987.49" data-end="988.66">up when you need them and you tear them</span> <span data-start="988.66" data-end="990.46">off and if you want to hover them and</span> <span data-start="990.46" data-end="992.2">you can dock them to the side if you</span> <span data-start="992.2" data-end="993.55">want to as well and you can close them</span> <span data-start="993.55" data-end="995.62">get rid of them when you're done okay so</span> <span data-start="995.62" data-end="997.33">this is a big one so the other thing we</span> <span data-start="997.33" data-end="998.44">wanted to do is we want to solve the</span> <span data-start="998.44" data-end="1001.47">blue box problem so for four years this</span> <span data-start="1001.47" data-end="1003.36">is what real</span> <span data-start="1003.36" data-end="1004.89">face builders look like I don't know if</span> <span data-start="1004.89" data-end="1005.97">you guys have a reviews interface</span> <span data-start="1005.97" data-end="1008.93">builder but you have blue boxes because</span> <span data-start="1008.93" data-end="1011.73">these are all custom views and the guys</span> <span data-start="1011.73" data-end="1013.829">that wrote the interface builder didn't</span> <span data-start="1013.829" data-end="1016.29">know about these custom views so you</span> <span data-start="1016.29" data-end="1017.91">know they don't have pretty pictures for</span> <span data-start="1017.91" data-end="1019.44">them and you don't want to write extra</span> <span data-start="1019.44" data-end="1020.97">code for them because you've gotten out</span> <span data-start="1020.97" data-end="1024.42">of time so so you just got blue boxes</span> <span data-start="1024.42" data-end="1028.47">and we think that sucks and so well so</span> <span data-start="1028.47" data-end="1030.39">that's what it would look like and so</span> <span data-start="1030.39" data-end="1032.16">here's what looks like in greenhouse so</span> <span data-start="1032.16" data-end="1034.41">here's a similar you actually about the</span> <span data-start="1034.41" data-end="1036.449">same and so you can see we've got all</span> <span data-start="1036.449" data-end="1037.62">the custom views in and the way we're</span> <span data-start="1037.62" data-end="1039.99">able to do this is the magic of iframes</span> <span data-start="1039.99" data-end="1041.669">we actually load your entire application</span> <span data-start="1041.669" data-end="1044.669">in a suspended mode we like suppress</span> <span data-start="1044.669" data-end="1047.25">main and we keep it from running and the</span> <span data-start="1047.25" data-end="1048.96">whole thing lows and so we can access</span> <span data-start="1048.96" data-end="1050.58">your custom views and render them and</span> <span data-start="1050.58" data-end="1051.66">draw them and you don't have to write</span> <span data-start="1051.66" data-end="1054.63">any code it's really great all right so</span> <span data-start="1054.63" data-end="1058.2">it's going to transition next ok so</span> <span data-start="1058.2" data-end="1061.919">finally yeah well what we wanna site we</span> <span data-start="1061.919" data-end="1064.59">kind of feel like building you eyes with</span> <span data-start="1064.59" data-end="1066.15">an interface builder is an inalienable</span> <span data-start="1066.15" data-end="1068.07">right of doing a web application</span> <span data-start="1068.07" data-end="1070.59">framework so we are offering this to the</span> <span data-start="1070.59" data-end="1072.75">community for free right right now free</span> <span data-start="1072.75" data-end="1075.24">it's completely some people want to</span> <span data-start="1075.24" data-end="1077.16">charge you money for this but we think</span> <span data-start="1077.16" data-end="1080.4">that this should be free so this is free</span> <span data-start="1080.4" data-end="1083.76">it's on sprout PortMaster right now you</span> <span data-start="1083.76" data-end="1086.37">can play with it today so and now we're</span> <span data-start="1086.37" data-end="1088.98">going to i believe show you a demo so</span> <span data-start="1088.98" data-end="1093.299">i'm going to attempt to do this all</span> <span data-start="1093.299" data-end="1099.24">right so so on the third tab so let's</span> <span data-start="1099.24" data-end="1105.15">get rid of this and</span> <span data-start="1105.16" data-end="1111.27">oh we do want chrome but we also want</span> <span data-start="1111.28" data-end="1113.78">okay so this is what green house looks</span> <span data-start="1113.78" data-end="1115.75">like so I've got a simple little app</span> <span data-start="1115.75" data-end="1119.23">then fired up loads loads the app up</span> <span data-start="1119.23" data-end="1122.54">give it a second here to to load up and</span> <span data-start="1122.54" data-end="1124.97">so now here it is loading your app in</span> <span data-start="1124.97" data-end="1130.82">suspended mode okay so BAM now we're up</span> <span data-start="1130.82" data-end="1132.679">so now we can just open up our page</span> <span data-start="1132.679" data-end="1134.3">files and for all of you that have built</span> <span data-start="1134.3" data-end="1136.25">sprout perhaps this is backwards</span> <span data-start="1136.25" data-end="1138.83">compatible with all existing sprout</span> <span data-start="1138.83" data-end="1140.99">four-page files it's the exact same file</span> <span data-start="1140.99" data-end="1144.02">so it just works so we can bring up our</span> <span data-start="1144.02" data-end="1146.03">main page and so as you can see we've</span> <span data-start="1146.03" data-end="1149.929">blown out the design area it's really</span> <span data-start="1149.929" data-end="1152.6">clean and empty and this is what I've</span> <span data-start="1152.6" data-end="1154.49">just generated a really this is like if</span> <span data-start="1154.49" data-end="1156.86">you type SC git or svn it's Brock or app</span> <span data-start="1156.86" data-end="1158.63">this is what you get so this is like</span> <span data-start="1158.63" data-end="1161.179">what you would see maybe there still is</span> <span data-start="1161.179" data-end="1163.51">a blue box problem here I can't tell um</span> <span data-start="1163.51" data-end="1168.26">we'll see okay so um here's our so we</span> <span data-start="1168.26" data-end="1169.97">can move our label element around we've</span> <span data-start="1169.97" data-end="1173.84">got a little inspector that's like we</span> <span data-start="1173.84" data-end="1175.309">can pop up right there we can also get</span> <span data-start="1175.309" data-end="1177.14">to it from up here and sort of tear it</span> <span data-start="1177.14" data-end="1179.66">off and put it over there we can open up</span> <span data-start="1179.66" data-end="1184.61">our library pain let's add a button we</span> <span data-start="1184.61" data-end="1185.929">already have the propagator open so i'm</span> <span data-start="1185.929" data-end="1187.76">going to do that let's change the title</span> <span data-start="1187.76" data-end="1192.95">will say hello jayus comp I'm very</span> <span data-start="1192.95" data-end="1194.54">limited so I have to speak what I type</span> <span data-start="1194.54" data-end="1197.57">all right so let's talk about our layout</span> <span data-start="1197.57" data-end="1201.08">control so we can anchor obviously you</span> <span data-start="1201.08" data-end="1202.76">know this is a an application framework</span> <span data-start="1202.76" data-end="1204.71">so you use absolute positioning and you</span> <span data-start="1204.71" data-end="1206.72">can just anchor this to the top center</span> <span data-start="1206.72" data-end="1210.52">it so let's say we Center this one here</span> <span data-start="1210.52" data-end="1215.4">let's just make this 0</span> <span data-start="1215.41" data-end="1220.51">and 0 and this one let's anchor tap top</span> <span data-start="1220.51" data-end="1223.12">okay ideas okay perfect let's save that</span> <span data-start="1223.12" data-end="1226.99">and then we'll run it let's tear this up</span> <span data-start="1226.99" data-end="1229.54">whoops will tear this off so we can</span> <span data-start="1229.54" data-end="1232.06">resize it so you can see that whoops it</span> <span data-start="1232.06" data-end="1236.68">did in fact set the layout so the button</span> <span data-start="1236.68" data-end="1240.04">is centered and the label is anchored to</span> <span data-start="1240.04" data-end="1242.02">the top as you can see so yes in fact we</span> <span data-start="1242.02" data-end="1244.87">can affect the labels and so this is the</span> <span data-start="1244.87" data-end="1246.55">code that it outputs and there's this</span> <span data-start="1246.55" data-end="1248.2">big warning that says you can't really</span> <span data-start="1248.2" data-end="1250.21">edit this in you can if you think you</span> <span data-start="1250.21" data-end="1252.55">know what you're doing but do it at your</span> <span data-start="1252.55" data-end="1254.56">own risk so now we're going to do</span> <span data-start="1254.56" data-end="1255.57">something a little bit more interesting</span> <span data-start="1255.57" data-end="1258.34">have we solved the blue box problem</span> <span data-start="1258.34" data-end="1264.01">where is the terminal there okay so</span> <span data-start="1264.01" data-end="1265.6">we're going to i'm just going to write a</span> <span data-start="1265.6" data-end="1267.82">custom view real quick and then we're</span> <span data-start="1267.82" data-end="1270.31">going to load it into a greenhouse and</span> <span data-start="1270.31" data-end="1271.66">we're going to use it so let's just try</span> <span data-start="1271.66" data-end="1273.61">this we're going to generate this view</span> <span data-start="1273.61" data-end="1276.61">and now you get to see what it looks</span> <span data-start="1276.61" data-end="1278.02">like to write a custom Spronk overview</span> <span data-start="1278.02" data-end="1279.79">so the generator ran and now we're going</span> <span data-start="1279.79" data-end="1282.34">to find a property called color when it</span> <span data-start="1282.34" data-end="1285.19">started with READ&WRITE our render</span> <span data-start="1285.19" data-end="1293.08">method will read this function</span> <span data-start="1293.09" data-end="1298.07">and die install this I think it's got a</span> <span data-start="1298.07" data-end="1299.51">call he does not the coloring okay so</span> <span data-start="1299.51" data-end="1304.22">now we're gonna say context add style</span> <span data-start="1304.22" data-end="1310.07">something right ok background color and</span> <span data-start="1310.07" data-end="1316.49">we're going to say this get</span> <span data-start="1316.5" data-end="1321.69">color property right and lastly we want</span> <span data-start="1321.69" data-end="1323.1">this to redraw whenever that color</span> <span data-start="1323.1" data-end="1325.05">property changes so we're going to say</span> <span data-start="1325.05" data-end="1330.69">display a display properties array okay</span> <span data-start="1330.69" data-end="1332.67">so there we go simple custom views so</span> <span data-start="1332.67" data-end="1334.02">now because we load this thing in an</span> <span data-start="1334.02" data-end="1336.51">iframe we actually have to reload the</span> <span data-start="1336.51" data-end="1343.95">app so I'm going to tell reload so so</span> <span data-start="1343.95" data-end="1345.87">while we wait for this to reload wait</span> <span data-start="1345.87" data-end="1347.28">for it to reload okay so we have a small</span> <span data-start="1347.28" data-end="1354.81">bug here and I will fix there we go okay</span> <span data-start="1354.81" data-end="1356.82">so here's our page that we were on</span> <span data-start="1356.82" data-end="1362.79">before and let's add our custom view to</span> <span data-start="1362.79" data-end="1367.79">our library so it was called colors duck</span> <span data-start="1367.79" data-end="1370.92">color i'm going to set a layout we give</span> <span data-start="1370.92" data-end="1372.96">a dull fault lay out so that it's just</span> <span data-start="1372.96" data-end="1378.49">not really big and huge winged dragon on</span> <span data-start="1378.5" data-end="1383.73">nice okay so now some are just drag this</span> <span data-start="1383.73" data-end="1385.26">puppy and then so there's our custom</span> <span data-start="1385.26" data-end="1389.55">view rendering no extra code BAM okay so</span> <span data-start="1389.55" data-end="1391.56">let's do something a little a little bit</span> <span data-start="1391.56" data-end="1396.2">more interesting with this let's do some</span> <span data-start="1396.2" data-end="1400.86">findings shall we text field it's at a</span> <span data-start="1400.86" data-end="1404.67">controller down here we're going to call</span> <span data-start="1404.67" data-end="1409.06">it color controller</span> <span data-start="1409.07" data-end="1412.37">and as you would expect to just drag</span> <span data-start="1412.37" data-end="1414.769">these lines I'm option dragging so it</span> <span data-start="1414.769" data-end="1416.299">draws the line for the binding so we're</span> <span data-start="1416.299" data-end="1417.71">going to bind from that color property</span> <span data-start="1417.71" data-end="1419.57">and we're just going to add it to a</span> <span data-start="1419.57" data-end="1420.98">property called color on this controller</span> <span data-start="1420.98" data-end="1422.299">because this is JavaScript you don't</span> <span data-start="1422.299" data-end="1424.519">really have to predefine anything we</span> <span data-start="1424.519" data-end="1427.399">just say you know color and that's the</span> <span data-start="1427.399" data-end="1429.019">property that will bind that too and</span> <span data-start="1429.019" data-end="1431">then this text feel really the same</span> <span data-start="1431" data-end="1433.07">thing except for the text field is</span> <span data-start="1433.07" data-end="1436.99">called value to that same color property</span> <span data-start="1436.99" data-end="1441.259">okay BAM so let's save that and run it</span> <span data-start="1441.259" data-end="1445.94">with any luck you now have the blue box</span> <span data-start="1445.94" data-end="1448.029">problem again okay so there you go</span> <span data-start="1448.029" data-end="1455.539">that's greenhouse simple and free yes</span> <span data-start="1455.539" data-end="1463.009">it's free so that's greenhouse so this</span> <span data-start="1463.009" data-end="1464.149">like I said we've been working on this</span> <span data-start="1464.149" data-end="1466.129">so it's out today you can check it out</span> <span data-start="1466.129" data-end="1468.59">and play with it and it's sort of a</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1468.59" data-end="1470.539">Developer Preview they're still bugs</span> <span data-start="1470.539" data-end="1473">like you saw and but I'm we're actually</span> <span data-start="1473" data-end="1474.649">working on yes so been working on for</span> <span data-start="1474.649" data-end="1477.74">about two months and we've done our day</span> <span data-start="1477.74" data-end="1480.049">job that mean that like so after hours</span> <span data-start="1480.049" data-end="1481.909">trying to figure it out ah but will we</span> <span data-start="1481.909" data-end="1483.769">will actually be building apps on this</span> <span data-start="1483.769" data-end="1484.94">oh and there's one more thing I wanted</span> <span data-start="1484.94" data-end="1486.86">to show you just so you can see that it</span> <span data-start="1486.86" data-end="1490.82">works with with bigger apps so here's</span> <span data-start="1490.82" data-end="1492.32">there's a big there's an open source</span> <span data-start="1492.32" data-end="1494.929">project that sujit wrote first proper</span> <span data-start="1494.929" data-end="1496.929">called tasks and this is a big hairy</span> <span data-start="1496.929" data-end="1499.7">existing sprout corps app and you load</span> <span data-start="1499.7" data-end="1501.169">it up and it loads and these are all</span> <span data-start="1501.169" data-end="1503.509">custom views and yes in fact you can</span> <span data-start="1503.509" data-end="1505.82">manipulate all the custom views and do</span> <span data-start="1505.82" data-end="1507.95">whatever you want with them so there you</span> <span data-start="1507.95" data-end="1518.039">go that's greenhouse</span> <span data-start="1518.049" data-end="1521.51">ok so that was greenhouse and last thing</span> <span data-start="1521.51"

data-end="1531.35">warning so common knowledge is you know</span> <span data-start="1531.35" data-end="1533.24">that touch is actually very difficult to</span> <span data-start="1533.24" data-end="1534.529">do and very difficult to do in the web</span> <span data-start="1534.529" data-end="1537.47">um one of the you know we thought so too</span> <span data-start="1537.47" data-end="1539.39">and then we decided hey why don't we</span> <span data-start="1539.39" data-end="1541.039">just try this why don't we try to try to</span> <span data-start="1541.039"

data-end="1546.47">started working on it and we worked</span> <span data-start="1546.47" data-end="1547.789">really hard over the last I think these</span> <span data-start="1547.789" data-end="1550.279">last six months or so to get touch</span> <span data-start="1550.279" data-end="1552.409">support natively in time inside of</span> <span data-start="1552.409"

data-end="1573.409">little extra code so we're going to show</span> <span data-start="1573.409" data-end="1576.35">you right now is a really boring demo so</span> <span data-start="1576.35" data-end="1578.269">these are the sample demo controls in</span> <span data-start="1578.269" data-end="1580.429">the desktop just so you have for a frame</span> <span data-start="1580.429"
