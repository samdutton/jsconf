<p><span data-start="330.73" data-end="333.52">Modi stick on the face and post it right</span> <span data-start="333.52" data-end="338.2">back at you yeah Elon Musk so nothing on</span> <span data-start="338.2" data-end="343.75">me yeah yeah I am open for investment</span> <span data-start="343.75" data-end="346.36">I hear Singapore's a start-up hotspot</span> <span data-start="346.36" data-end="350.26">you can use it may different ways so you</span> <span data-start="350.26" data-end="352.27">can use it as a slack application so in</span> <span data-start="352.27" data-end="355.06">fact if you go to the moji fire calm and</span> <span data-start="355.06" data-end="356.71">you just click that add to slack button</span> <span data-start="356.71" data-end="358.03">it'll add it to your own slack</span> <span data-start="358.03" data-end="361.68">workspaces right now and this that works</span> <span data-start="361.68" data-end="364.6">so you basically find them image this is</span> <span data-start="364.6" data-end="369.76">my son slash mode if I put the pasty</span> <span data-start="369.76" data-end="373.9">image in yeah I see it can handle</span> <span data-start="373.9" data-end="377.5">multiple people so if you grab that one</span> <span data-start="377.5" data-end="382.45">in there we go that back there am i and</span> <span data-start="382.45" data-end="386.68">I it answers an age-old question that</span> <span data-start="386.68" data-end="389.98">has been plaguing people for hunt day go</span> <span data-start="389.98" data-end="393.28">that's the Mona Lisa smile there you go</span> <span data-start="393.28" data-end="395.75">so the moji fire does quite a lot is a</span> <span data-start="395.75" data-end="397.61">whole lot of things that it's doing but</span> <span data-start="397.61" data-end="399.02">i say the most impressive thing that</span> <span data-start="399.02" data-end="402.259">it's doing is its how the hell is it</span> <span data-start="402.259" data-end="405.68">calculating emotion emotion right it's</span> <span data-start="405.68" data-end="407.6">kind of kind of complex things a lot of</span> <span data-start="407.6" data-end="409.91">us can't really tell other people's</span> <span data-start="409.91" data-end="412.009">emotion but how is a computer figuring</span> <span data-start="412.009" data-end="415.07">that out right and I've got good news</span> <span data-start="415.07" data-end="418.1">for you it's really easy it's incredibly</span> <span data-start="418.1" data-end="422.24">easy so we got two steps just two steps</span> <span data-start="422.24" data-end="425.99">okay first step detecting the facial</span> <span data-start="425.99" data-end="427.22">features we know how to do this now</span> <span data-start="427.22" data-end="429.68">we've examined in our faces we know the</span> <span data-start="429.68" data-end="431.9">different points that every single face</span> <span data-start="431.9" data-end="434.63">has and so basically there's death</span> <span data-start="434.63" data-end="437.56">different algorithms that you can get</span> <span data-start="437.56" data-end="441.56">some of them are very arithmetic and</span> <span data-start="441.56" data-end="443.919">some of them are a little bit more</span> <span data-start="443.919" data-end="445.729">machine learning based essentially</span> <span data-start="445.729" data-end="447.47">there's lots of different algorithms you</span> <span data-start="447.47" data-end="450.949">can use which can if given an image will</span> <span data-start="450.949" data-end="453.38">extract for you those facial features in</span> <span data-start="453.38" data-end="455.389">every single face has one of those</span> <span data-start="455.389" data-end="457.33">features</span> <span data-start="457.33" data-end="461.449">if I step one and step two is really</span> <span data-start="461.449" data-end="464.12">really easy you just use and you're all</span> <span data-start="464.12" data-end="467.419">networks I said just two steps extract</span> <span data-start="467.419" data-end="469.669">the features and then just train and use</span> <span data-start="469.669" data-end="474.44">and you all network let's move on I want</span> <span data-start="474.44" data-end="477.8">to explain you know just just for this</span> <span data-start="477.8" data-end="478.22">guy</span> <span data-start="478.22" data-end="479.78">gentleman I'll explain in your network</span> <span data-start="479.78" data-end="480.889">just for just for him over there I</span> <span data-start="480.889" data-end="483.289">nobody else knows what they are now</span> <span data-start="483.289" data-end="486.46">but neural network is has a basis in</span> <span data-start="486.46" data-end="490.88">biology okay this is a neuron you should</span> <span data-start="490.88" data-end="494.479">have at least one of these maybe some of</span> <span data-start="494.479" data-end="497.9">you have a few less then you did</span> <span data-start="497.9" data-end="501.68">yesterday but it has some dendrites</span> <span data-start="501.68" data-end="509.63">going in a body a body and some axon</span> <span data-start="509.63" data-end="511.729">going out if enough electricity flows</span> <span data-start="511.729" data-end="514.729">into the dendrite the body fires some</span> <span data-start="514.729" data-end="516.529">electricity out through an axon that's</span> <span data-start="516.529" data-end="517.63">it</span> <span data-start="517.63" data-end="520.49">so it does if you stick enough of these</span> <span data-start="520.49" data-end="524.75">together you get a brain I can think</span> <span data-start="524.75" data-end="527.139">right that's it that's in your network</span> <span data-start="527.139" data-end="532.85">that's awful that's a brainer to say if</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="532.85" data-end="534.879">I asked you to code this up in</span> <span data-start="534.879" data-end="538.43">JavaScript you probably kind of try and</span> <span data-start="538.43" data-end="541.129">give it a go I mean a long time so I've</span> <span data-start="541.129" data-end="542.449">kind of studied there the computer</span> <span data-start="542.449" data-end="544.55">science basics right now but I still</span> <span data-start="544.55" data-end="545.529">remember some of it</span> </p>

data-start="775.86" data-end="781.33">what you do</span> <span data-start="781.34" data-end="783.86">and so then it tweaks it perhaps you</span> <span data-start="783.86" data-end="785.33">keep on

wrong</span> <span data-start="789.11" data-end="791.96">less wrong and so eventually what</span> <span data-start="791.96" data-end="795.05">happens is you give an eighth image and</span> <span
