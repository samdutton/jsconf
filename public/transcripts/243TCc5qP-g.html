just it's just</span> <span data-start="998.49" data-end="1001.28">a fresh sweet these are our mocha tests</span> <span data-start="1001.28" data-end="1004.46">and in this test on line 15 we are</span> <span data-start="1004.46" data-end="1005.93">asserting that the title of the</span> <span data-start="1005.93" data-end="1007.73">application equals to do and it has an</span> <span

thing we're</span> <span data-start="1087.98" data-end="1090.11">gonna do is build some component</span> <span data-start="1090.11" data-end="1092.179">interactors together so I think this is</span> <span data-start="1092.179" data-end="1095.12">a good spot to pause and and talk about</span> <span data-start="1095.12" data-end="1096.399">interactors and what they are</span> <span data-start="1096.399" data-end="1099.2">interactors allow you to think about how</span> <span data-start="1099.2" data-end="1101.389">to interact with your component and your</span> <span

data-start="1152.149" data-end="1153.499">abstract that away for you so you don't</span> <span data-start="1153.499" data-end="1154.85">have to worry about that timing or</span> <span

data-start="1196.549" data-end="1198.08">our application where we've rendered it</span> <span data-start="1198.08" data-end="1199.909">into the browser and now we're gonna</span> <span data-start="1199.909" data-end="1202.25">start driving the application around</span> <span data-start="1202.25" data-end="1206.3">with interactors so this begs a question</span> <span data-start="1206.3" data-end="1209.12">of how do we actually even interact with</span> <span data-start="1209.12" data-end="1212.09">our application and even for something</span> <span data-start="1212.09" data-end="1215.48">that's as simple as to do MVC there's a</span> <span data-start="1215.48" data-end="1216.86">lot that's going on here there's a lot</span> <span data-start="1216.86" data-end="1218.27">of different ways you can interact with</span> <span data-start="1218.27" data-end="1221.51">your application so let's stop and break</span> <span data-start="1221.51" data-end="1222.95">this down and just tackle adding it to</span> <span data-start="1222.95" data-end="1226.1">do first let's look back at the slim</span> <span data-start="1226.1" data-end="1227.99">diagram here just for adding it to do</span> <span data-start="1227.99" data-end="1231.62">you have input here where you type it in</span> <span data-start="1231.62" data-end="1233">the input and then you press ENTER to</span> <span data-start="1233" data-end="1236.63">submit you can also toggle a button on</span> <span data-start="1236.63" data-end="1240.98">the left to complete all to Do's so</span> <span data-start="1240.98" data-end="1243.59">we're at the top here we're already</span> <span data-start="1243.59" data-end="1246.11">asserting that we have our two dues or</span> <span data-start="1246.11" data-end="1248.24">two dues title there so that's done for</span> <span data-start="1248.24" data-end="1249.41">us now we just need to wire up our</span> <span data-start="1249.41" data-end="1252.34">interactor for actually submitting or</span> <span data-start="1252.34" data-end="1254.66">actually entering data into the input</span> <span data-start="1254.66" data-end="1258.17">and then submitting that that to do so</span> <span data-start="1258.17" data-end="1260.41">our actor is grown a little bit here I</span> <span data-start="1260.41" data-end="1263.6">want to call out line 12 we have a new</span> <span data-start="1263.6" data-end="1265.25">to do property which is equal to a</span> <span data-start="1265.25" data-end="1267.29">fillable method that we provide from</span> <span data-start="1267.29" data-end="1269.18">interactor and what fillable is going to</span> <span data-start="1269.18" data-end="1271.1">do is allow you to fill an input with</span> <span data-start="1271.1" data-end="1273.68">whatever data you want in your test and</span> <span data-start="1273.68" data-end="1276.17">then here on lines 15 to 17 we have a</span> <span data-start="1276.17" data-end="1278">submit to do property that we have equal</span> <span data-start="1278" data-end="1280.07">to a trigger Abul method that's provided</span> <span data-start="1280.07" data-end="1283.16">from interactor also which allows us to</span> <span data-start="1283.16" data-end="1284.81">trigger whatever

13</span> <span data-start="1289.55" data-end="1292.25">which is the enter key on the new to do</span> <span data-start="1292.25" data-end="1296.06">input field so that's that's great I</span> <span data-start="1296.06" data-end="1297.41">guess</span> <span data-start="1297.41" data-end="1300.14">so let's route this in reality and see</span> <span data-start="1300.14" data-end="1303.65">how we actually use this in a test so</span> <span data-start="1303.65" data-end="1305.78">same from earlier test suite that we</span> <span data-start="1305.78" data-end="1307.37">have right but we have a new describe</span> <span data-start="1307.37" data-end="1308.63">block and I want to kind of walk through</span> <span data-start="1308.63" data-end="1310.46">how interactors are playing a role here</span> <span data-start="1310.46" data-end="1312.83">first we're going to import the</span> <span data-start="1312.83" data-end="1315.26">interactor from the folder and at the</span> <span data-start="1315.26" data-end="1316.4">very top of the file we're going to</span> <span data-start="1316.4" data-end="1319.37">instantiate our enter actor and then</span> <span data-start="1319.37" data-end="1323.3">down here on lines 22 23 we're gonna</span> <span data-start="1323.3" data-end="1324.71">actually start interacting with our app</span> <span data-start="1324.71" data-end="1328.46">we named our to do to the or interact or</span> <span data-start="1328.46" data-end="1330.89">to do app so when we call that</span> <span data-start="1330.89" data-end="1332.57">interactor we're gonna do to do app dot</span> <span data-start="1332.57" data-end="1334.11">new to do and then</span> <span data-start="1334.11" data-end="1335.64">we passed two is actually going to be</span> <span data-start="1335.64" data-end="1336.87">the value of that's entered into the</span> <span data-start="1336.87" data-end="1338.97">input fields and then we just chain on a</span> <span data-start="1338.97" data-end="1342.03">submit to do interactor and bam we're</span> <span data-start="1342.03" data-end="1345.96">going to submit so we actually don't</span> <span data-start="1345.96" data-end="1347.34">have anything to assert against right</span> <span data-start="1347.34" data-end="1349.35">now all right if we look back at the</span> <span data-start="1349.35" data-end="1351.03">tests here you can see the assertion</span> <span data-start="1351.03" data-end="1352.92">down at the bottom is just a comment</span> <span data-start="1352.92" data-end="1356.64">that says oh so let's take a look back</span> <span data-start="1356.64" data-end="1362.13">at our diagram here and look at a to-do</span> <span data-start="1362.13" data-end="1364.95">item so we have our adding it to do</span> <span data-start="1364.95" data-end="1367.74">interactor kind of all fleshed out so in</span> <span data-start="1367.74" data-end="1370.85">order for us to assert we have an</span> <span data-start="1370.85" data-end="1373.44">infinite number of to-do items in this</span> <span data-start="1373.44" data-end="1376.52">list and when we built this application</span> <span data-start="1376.52" data-end="1379.02">we recognized that we could pull that</span> <span data-start="1379.02" data-end="1381.39">out onto a component right we could</span> <span data-start="1381.39" data-end="1383.64">build something and it's called to do I</span> <span data-start="1383.64" data-end="1387.27">don't so naturally with each component</span> <span data-start="1387.27" data-end="1389.4">there can be an interact or that maps</span> <span data-start="1389.4" data-end="1390.929">directly to and how you interact with</span> <span data-start="1390.929" data-end="1393.179">that component so we're going to try and</span> <span data-start="1393.179" data-end="1395.28">we're going to match that composability</span> <span data-start="1395.28" data-end="1397.049">that we get from the component with our</span> <span data-start="1397.049"
