<p><span data-start="5.359" data-end="8.76">hello so first of all I'm really happy</span> <span data-start="8.76" data-end="11.57">that so many people are interested in a</span> <span data-start="11.57" data-end="14.549">clean architecture or coding clean</span> <span data-start="14.549" data-end="17.4">components in the front-end code quality</span> <span data-start="17.4" data-end="19.619">or clean code is something that I really</span> <span data-start="19.619" data-end="22.13">am passionate about and I think that</span> <span data-start="22.13" data-end="25.109">learning some tricks can actually help</span> <span data-start="25.109" data-end="28.26">you to significantly improve your code</span> <span data-start="28.26" data-end="31.5">and make it a lot more testable and yeah</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="31.5" data-end="35.07">I kind of repurposed my initial idea of</span> <span data-start="35.07" data-end="38.7">using snake to convey some of these</span> <span data-start="38.7" data-end="41.76">ideas because I was inspired by a talk</span> <span data-start="41.76" data-end="43.739">yesterday about clean architecture</span> <span data-start="43.739" data-end="46.77">looking at it a bit from a higher level</span> <span data-start="46.77" data-end="50.579">and I just felt that that was exactly</span> <span data-start="50.579" data-end="55.8">what I wanted to share too so first of</span> <span data-start="55.8" data-end="58.71">all a bit about me my name is Peter and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="58.71" data-end="61.289">I'm a developer at small improvements in</span> <span data-start="61.289" data-end="65.909">Berlin I'm a big fan of many things but</span> <span data-start="65.909" data-end="67.77">among these things are functional</span> <span data-start="67.77" data-end="70.53">programming clean code keeping things</span> <span data-start="70.53" data-end="72.92">simple regardless of what it is and</span> <span data-start="72.92" data-end="75.78">perhaps a bit random air quality I'm</span> <span data-start="75.78" data-end="79.259">quite obsessed about measuring particles</span> <span data-start="79.259" data-end="88.64">and stuff odd things about me okay and</span> <span data-start="88.64" data-end="92.22">yeah so even if a snake is not like main</span> <span data-start="92.22" data-end="95.729">thing now but I still have a lot of</span> <span data-start="95.729" data-end="98.88">snake stuff and it might be helpful for</span> <span data-start="98.88" data-end="103.909">you to see an example of how it looks</span> <span data-start="103.909" data-end="107.39">just so that the code examples are a bit</span> <span data-start="107.39" data-end="112.09">clearer</span> <span data-start="112.1" data-end="116.61">so let me embarrass myself by losing a</span> <span data-start="116.61" data-end="121.439">snake quickly so this is the a game that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="121.439" data-end="127.71">I built and we will use that as an</span> <span data-start="127.71" data-end="130.849">example but I will also go beyond just</span> <span data-start="130.849" data-end="133.31">snake and show you some example</span> <span data-start="133.31" data-end="135.11">that are perhaps more in line with what</span> <span data-start="135.11" data-end="139.67">you might I died that are a bit more in</span> <span data-start="139.67" data-end="145.25">line with what you might be be coding on</span> <span data-start="145.25" data-end="148.819">a day-to-day basis but I think snake is</span> <span data-start="148.819" data-end="152.39">a great example because it's yeah you</span> <span data-start="152.39" data-end="153.98">couldn't see it has a component with</span> <span data-start="153.98" data-end="159.56">quite a lot of interaction so a quick</span> <span data-start="159.56" data-end="163.63">outline first we'll look a bit at</span> <span data-start="163.63" data-end="167.09">presentation versus model or present or</span> <span data-start="167.09" data-end="170.15">view versus logic whatever you call it</span> <span data-start="170.15" data-end="173.6">but I'm trying to distinguish between</span> <span data-start="173.6" data-end="176.45">these two different things and then dive</span> <span data-start="176.45" data-end="180.29">a bit deeper into what a model is how it</span> <span data-start="180.29" data-end="184.819">can look like and then proceed with</span> <span data-start="184.819" data-end="189.31">views because they are pretty useful and</span> <span data-start="189.31" data-end="193.1">some testing on top of that and finally</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="193.1" data-end="196.7">I will summarize learnings so what you</span> <span data-start="196.7" data-end="201.62">can take with you so let's start with</span> <span data-start="201.62" data-end="206.45">kind of a quiz or just yeah engaging you</span> <span data-start="206.45" data-end="210.829">as the audience so if you look at the</span> <span data-start="210.829" data-end="213.049">first one a checkout flow what would you</span> <span data-start="213.049" data-end="214.64">categorize that as is that a</span> <span data-start="214.64" data-end="217.04">presentation thing or is it like more</span> <span data-start="217.04" data-end="226.15">model logic any opinions ideas sorry</span> <span data-start="226.15" data-end="231.799">yeah it's good I will also share my</span> <span data-start="231.799" data-end="235.63">opinions after</span> <span data-start="235.64" data-end="239.18">and generating components what would you</span> <span data-start="239.18" data-end="249.44">treat at us very good and the setting</span> <span data-start="249.44" data-end="254.8">game over if you hit the wall very nice</span> <span data-start="254.8" data-end="259.609">and yeah the first one a bit tricky in</span> <span data-start="259.609" data-end="262.67">my opinion fingers both and you have to</span> <span data-start="262.67" data-end="265.03">remember here that we are looking at</span> <span data-start="265.03" data-end="267.95">focusing on the front end a bit so what</span> <span data-start="267.95" data-end="270.02">what our model is in the front end can</span> <span data-start="270.02" data-end="271.49">be a bit different from what you would</span> <span data-start="271.49" data-end="275.87">see it as in the back end for example I</span> <span data-start="275.87" data-end="279.65">think some frameworks call it also view</span> <span data-start="279.65" data-end="283.13">model for example which is kind of</span> <span data-start="283.13" data-end="285.59">speaking to that but yeah I would say</span> <span data-start="285.59" data-end="288.47">check out flow as it needs both both</span> <span data-start="288.47" data-end="291.59">sides generating components presentation</span> <span data-start="291.59" data-end="294.68">ideally of a model and setting game over</span> <span data-start="294.68" data-end="297.59">if you hit the wall and this is in snake</span> <span data-start="297.59" data-end="301.669">then I would treat as a model concern so</span> <span data-start="301.669" data-end="306.95">what can a model look like here's an</span> <span data-start="306.95" data-end="313.07">example of check out model I made up so</span> <span data-start="313.07" data-end="316.1">you have a step because this is a</span> <span data-start="316.1" data-end="320.06">stepwise stepwise process and the first</span> <span data-start="320.06" data-end="322.97">step could for example be entering your</span> <span data-start="322.97" data-end="325.61">contact details which consists of a</span> <span data-start="325.61" data-end="329.3">bunch of fields and then perhaps yeah</span> <span data-start="329.3" data-end="331.37">perhaps based on the country you select</span> <span data-start="331.37" data-end="334.4">you offer different payment methods or</span> <span data-start="334.4" data-end="337.64">something so you need this for multiple</span> <span data-start="337.64" data-end="339.979">purposes both to influence how you</span> <span data-start="339.979" data-end="343.49">render the view later on and to have</span> <span data-start="343.49" data-end="347.21">this logic in the system so in Iceland</span> <span data-start="347.21" data-end="349.49">you can pay with cookies but in Sweden</span> <span data-start="349.49" data-end="353.53">maybe pay with blueberries or something</span> <span data-start="353.53" data-end="358.76">another model would be snake my favorite</span> <span data-start="358.76" data-end="362.96">model so in snake it's yeah you saw me</span> <span data-start="362.96" data-end="366.08">playing it before and I was listing or</span> <span data-start="366.08" data-end="367.26">showing the status</span> <span data-start="367.26" data-end="369.66">if it's game over or the game is running</span> <span data-start="369.66" data-end="373.07">the score and then you have a bunch of</span> <span data-start="373.07" data-end="375.92">details that you need to keep track of</span> <span data-start="375.92" data-end="379.23">to be able to like ya decide what</span> <span data-start="379.23" data-end="380.49">happens next</span> <span data-start="380.49" data-end="384.33">can I press up what happens when the</span> <span data-start="384.33" data-end="386.64">time goes on will I move up if I eat an</span> <span data-start="386.64" data-end="388.68">apple what happens then and where are</span> <span data-start="388.68" data-end="393.39">actually the apples so let's do an</span> <span data-start="393.39" data-end="396.12">experiment because we didn't introduce</span> <span data-start="396.12" data-end="398.37">views yet</span> <span data-start="398.37" data-end="401.93">really so how would it look if you would</span> <span data-start="401.93" data-end="415.709">just play with a model</span> <span data-start="415.719" data-end="419.379">and we will go into this disc out a bit</span> <span data-start="419.379" data-end="421.959">later so don't have to care too much</span> <span data-start="421.959" data-end="426.489">about it so in a very easy way to play</span> <span data-start="426.489" data-end="427.959">with our model is to just use</span> <span data-start="427.959" data-end="440.07">console.log</span> <span data-start="440.08" data-end="444.22">and it's it becomes a bit trickier think</span> <span data-start="444.22" data-end="448.18">yeah already game over now that</span> <span data-start="448.18" data-end="449.71">challenge is kind of not eating the</span> <span data-start="449.71" data-end="455.53">apples but staying alive yeah so that's</span> <span data-start="455.53" data-end="457.449">how it look and it shows that the model</span> <span data-start="457.449" data-end="459.699">is kind of enough in a sense it's what</span> <span data-start="459.699" data-end="462.31">you need to be running whatever you do</span> <span data-start="462.31" data-end="464.5">and the check out example exam for</span> <span data-start="464.5" data-end="467.139">example you could also technically work</span> <span data-start="467.139" data-end="469.389">with the model you see the step and you</span> <span data-start="469.389" data-end="472.15">you're on your own say that I so now I</span> <span data-start="472.15" data-end="476.59">need to fill in the contact details but</span> <span data-start="476.59" data-end="479.169">it's really boring to play with this</span> <span data-start="479.169" data-end="484.84">model directly so we need views and what</span> <span data-start="484.84" data-end="487.12">is a view yeah you can see it is</span> <span data-start="487.12" data-end="488.71">something that you just connect to your</span> <span data-start="488.71" data-end="491.889">model kind of a mapping of your model</span> <span data-start="491.889" data-end="494.919">into something else so you take the</span> <span data-start="494.919" data-end="497.949">model transform it for example you</span> <span data-start="497.949" data-end="500.319">already seen how I did it into the</span> <span data-start="500.319" data-end="503.259">browser using under the hood react</span> <span data-start="503.259" data-end="507.159">components you also seen one of Darwin</span> <span data-start="507.159" data-end="510.219">here console.log that I used it's in a</span> <span data-start="510.219" data-end="513.339">sense of view and then I could also</span> <span data-start="513.339" data-end="516.849">implement a terminal view which I</span> <span data-start="516.849" data-end="520.87">actually did but what is a view at a bit</span> <span data-start="520.87" data-end="527.62">of a higher level so in essence if we</span> <span data-start="527.62" data-end="531.07">look at the snake example you present</span> <span data-start="531.07" data-end="534.459">the model and then yeah I'm kind of</span> <span data-start="534.459" data-end="537.88">combining also what you would if you</span> <span data-start="537.88" data-end="540.73">know MVC for example you typically treat</span> <span data-start="540.73" data-end="544.149">this as the controller bit but in react</span> <span data-start="544.149" data-end="547.66">world it's very common to group these</span> <span data-start="547.66" data-end="550.06">together in the component which I also</span> <span data-start="550.06" data-end="556.68">do but so a view in react world is about</span> <span data-start="556.68" data-end="560.949">present presenting what you have so we</span> <span data-start="560.949" data-end="563.14">need to draw the status in some way so</span> <span data-start="563.14" data-end="565.99">this is the conceptual idea and we draw</span> <span data-start="565.99" data-end="567.88">the apples we draw the snake we draw the</span> <span data-start="567.88" data-end="570.819">walls and we repeat and we need to move</span> <span data-start="570.819" data-end="572.64">the game forward by</span> <span data-start="572.64" data-end="574.26">the stick which moves it moves it</span> <span data-start="574.26" data-end="576.45">forward in time and then we have a bunch</span> <span data-start="576.45" data-end="579.089">of things that allow us to manipulate</span> <span data-start="579.089" data-end="582.87">this view and as I said the snake is</span> <span data-start="582.87" data-end="585.329">just an example because it's fun to work</span> <span data-start="585.329" data-end="587.82">with but actually this is how I think</span> <span data-start="587.82" data-end="590.7">you should be coding in your normal</span> <span data-start="590.7" data-end="594.329">day-to-day coding for example with the</span> <span data-start="594.329" data-end="596.49">checkout flow you could have something</span> <span data-start="596.49" data-end="598.37">like this</span> <span data-start="598.37" data-end="601.8">so we render the contact details which</span> <span data-start="601.8" data-end="604.5">is some kind of form and this form has</span> <span data-start="604.5" data-end="606.69">some handlers that allow you to</span> <span data-start="606.69" data-end="609.81">manipulate the model so this set name</span> <span data-start="609.81" data-end="613.14">will give in a model and a new name</span> <span data-start="613.14" data-end="615.36">give you back your new model which has</span> <span data-start="615.36" data-end="617.7">this name set and then you rerender it</span> <span data-start="617.7" data-end="621.329">so it's yeah it's not limited to snake</span> <span data-start="621.329" data-end="623.82">but you can apply it for anything</span> <span data-start="623.82" data-end="627.18">basically in the front end and let's</span> <span data-start="627.18" data-end="630.24">have a quick look at how this actually</span> <span data-start="630.24" data-end="649.58">looks in real code that's also</span> <span data-start="649.59" data-end="654.09">so can can everyone see the coat is it</span> <span data-start="654.09" data-end="656.94">large enough cool</span> <span data-start="656.94" data-end="659.49">so this conceptual yeah there is some</span> <span data-start="659.49" data-end="661.95">boilerplate here because this model is</span> <span data-start="661.95" data-end="664.98">running in the terminal but you can see</span> <span data-start="664.98" data-end="668.279">these drawn methods here draw snake draw</span> <span data-start="668.279" data-end="671.25">apples and then yeah a bit</span> <span data-start="671.25" data-end="673.52">boilerplate getting the initialize</span> <span data-start="673.52" data-end="677.04">initialization but here is the loop that</span> <span data-start="677.04" data-end="679.589">you saw in this conceptual idea where we</span> <span data-start="679.589" data-end="683.76">draw the different parts and manipulate</span> <span data-start="683.76" data-end="687.35">in the model and one observation is that</span> <span data-start="687.35" data-end="691.2">it's pretty simple in there are not many</span> <span data-start="691.2" data-end="694.16">like if statement conditionals and stuff</span> <span data-start="694.16" data-end="708.06">and let's also have a look at react one</span> <span data-start="708.07" data-end="711.39">cool yeah and by the way I'm using some</span> <span data-start="711.39" data-end="716.2">typescript but to such an extent so it</span> <span data-start="716.2" data-end="718.24">you don't really need to know it or care</span> <span data-start="718.24" data-end="723.01">about it so it looks a bit different</span> <span data-start="723.01" data-end="725.32">because I'm using react here and have to</span> <span data-start="725.32" data-end="728.53">adapt to react but the principle is</span> <span data-start="728.53" data-end="732.15">still the same so up here I have these</span> <span data-start="732.15" data-end="735.4">mappings that allow me to control the</span> <span data-start="735.4" data-end="738.76">model and yeah need to do it a bit</span> <span data-start="738.76" data-end="740.32">differently because I don't want to</span> <span data-start="740.32" data-end="742.45">rerender all the time</span> <span data-start="742.45" data-end="747.25">and here is the game loop and because in</span> <span data-start="747.25" data-end="751.06">react you given the state update you</span> <span data-start="751.06" data-end="754.45">render the state so so I don't do draw</span> <span data-start="754.45" data-end="757.06">walls and stuff here but I rather do</span> <span data-start="757.06" data-end="760.78">that here that you might recognize and</span> <span data-start="760.78" data-end="764.23">again something to observe is that this</span> <span data-start="764.23" data-end="768.19">is pretty simple code there's not much</span> <span data-start="768.19" data-end="771.76">that tells you about the game for</span> <span data-start="771.76" data-end="775.27">example you can't really say even what</span> <span data-start="775.27" data-end="778.89">happens if I eat an apple all of this is</span> <span data-start="778.89" data-end="781.93">not not existing here but everything is</span> <span data-start="781.93" data-end="786.04">just about putting the pixels on the in</span> <span data-start="786.04" data-end="790.75">the browser basically so let's jump back</span> <span data-start="790.75" data-end="799.65">to presentation yeah</span> <span data-start="799.65" data-end="813.48">testing so actually I wonder if I</span> <span data-start="813.49" data-end="815.38">yeah I've been running for it pretty</span> <span data-start="815.38" data-end="816.91">quick but testing is there an</span> <span data-start="816.91" data-end="819.16">interesting topic so let's try to spend</span> <span data-start="819.16" data-end="825.82">some time

<p><span data-start="825.82" data-end="835.3">I often see and if you look at what</span> <span data-start="835.3" data-end="836.98">actually we will see it when we look at</span> <span data-start="836.98" data-end="839.56">the test so a problem with tests that I</span> <span data-start="839.56" data-end="841.089">often sees that they are very very</span> <span data-start="841.089" data-end="843.459">detailed it's like for example in a</span> <span data-start="843.459" data-end="846.07">snake game a test could be a set</span> <span data-start="846.07" data-end="848.32">movement

but you will</span> <span data-start="853.63" data-end="856.57">see often a huge amount of tests that</span> <span data-start="856.57" data-end="860.589">are at a very detailed level and I want</span> <span data-start="860.589" data-end="862.48">to show you how I think tests should</span> <span data-start="862.48" data-end="865.81">look like and how these principles when</span> <span data-start="865.81" data-end="867.43">you put them all together makes it</span> <span data-start="867.43" data-end="881.93">really easy to accomplish that</span> <span data-start="881.94" data-end="884.19">so these are my tests for the snake</span> <span data-start="884.19" data-end="889.38">model yeah first start with a bunch of</span> <span data-start="889.38" data-end="894.6">simple tests that that you would</span> <span data-start="894.6" data-end="898.68">probably normally see also but then I</span> <span data-start="898.68" data-end="900.99">test confirmed that very

data-start="906.96" data-end="909.66">another point that allowed me to do</span> <span data-start="909.66" data-end="913.8">testing well that yeah I don't rely my</span> <span data-start="913.8" data-end="916.17">model is pure as well maybe that's</span> <span data-start="916.17" data-end="921.06">something worth mentioning that the</span> <span data-start="921.06" data-end="923.7">model execution of the model will always</span> <span data-start="923.7" data-end="926.43">give the same result and one key aspect</span> <span data-start="926.43" data-end="931.71">of that is that it's pure so I'm using a</span> <span data-start="931.71" data-end="933.87">seat that initializes our random</span> <span data-start="933.87" data-end="936.56">generator that allows me to still get</span>

data-end="954.66">pretty much playing the game so going</span> <span data-start="954.66" data-end="957.65">into the top wall leads to game over and</span> <span data-start="957.65" data-end="961.8">check the order walls as well eating an</span> <span data-start="961.8" data-end="964.83">apple increases the score by 1 and what</span> <span data-start="964.83" data-end="965.34">do I do</span> <span data-start="965.34" data-end="969.08">well I just create a game instance and</span> <span data-start="969.08" data-end="972.84">play until I eat an apple and thanks to</span> <span data-start="972.84" data-end="976.41">using this seat for the random</span> <span data-start="976.41" data-end="979.83">generation I know that the apple will</span> <span data-start="979.83"

when you play the game I just use</span> <span data-start="986.82" data-end="989.34">a random seed every time that makes sure</span> <span data-start="989.34" data-end="992.16">that you can't memorize where the apples</span> <span data-start="992.16" data-end="996.75">are and stuff like that yeah but I</span> <span data-start="996.75" data-end="998.55">managed to test like pretty much the</span> <span data-start="998.55" data-end="1003.71">whole game here snake is growing snake</span> <span data-start="1003.71" data-end="1006.05">crushing into itself leads to game over</span> <span

data-start="1013.52" data-end="1017.11">code</span> <span data-start="1017.12" data-end="1020.91">and yeah what enables this simple</span> <span data-start="1020.91" data-end="1025.32">testing yeah a pure model the random</span> <span data-start="1025.32" data-end="1027.69">generation something very importance is</span> <span data-start="1027.69" data-end="1034.709">simple construction of the

typically</span> <span data-start="1041.49" data-end="1043.83">don't fully can control because</span> <span data-start="1043.83" data-end="1045.42">sometimes you just need a lot of data</span> <span data-start="1045.42" data-end="1050.94">but based on my experience yeah</span> <span data-start="1050.94" data-end="1052.74">from whenever I started being</span> <span data-start="1052.74" data-end="1055.56">professional software developer one of</span> <span data-start="1055.56" data-end="1060.09">the biggest obstacles are that it's hard</span> <span data-start="1060.09" data-end="1063.63">to test and it makes people skip it so</span> <span data-start="1063.63" data-end="1068.25">is a construction rich model with very</span> <span data-start="1068.25" data-end="1071.03">meaningful modifiers so I'm a big fan of</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1071.03" data-end="1074.7">DDD domain-driven design and this is</span> <span data-start="1074.7" data-end="1078.42">something I brought with me from that so</span> <span data-start="1078.42" data-end="1081.15">rather than having a set movement vector</span> <span data-start="1081.15" data-end="1084.45">method on my model that I looked at a</span> <span data-start="1084.45" data-end="1086.73">lot of snake implementations and most of</span> <span data-start="1086.73" data-end="1090.45">them were dealing with updating the dxdy</span> <span

data-start="1097.05" data-end="1102.09">that's what I use in my tests so I try</span> <span data-start="1102.09" data-end="1105.51">to make the model very deep in a sense</span> <span data-start="1105.51" data-end="1108.33">so there is of course a lot involved in</span> <span data-start="1108.33" data-end="1110.1">moving up I have to check if it's</span> <span data-start="1110.1" data-end="1114.3">possible and stuff like that but the</span> <span data-start="1114.3" data-end="1124.63">model on the exposes simple move up</span> <span data-start="1124.64" data-end="1127.91">yeah or we have to move down example</span> <span data-start="1127.91" data-end="1133.58">here and complete separation of model</span> <span data-start="1133.58" data-end="1135.74">and view I think that's the most</span> <span data-start="1135.74" data-end="1138.37">essential things and it boils down to</span> <span data-start="1138.37" data-end="1141.26">separation of concerns what we discussed</span> <span data-start="1141.26" data-end="1144.53">in the beginning with what is what is</span> <span data-start="1144.53" data-end="1147.14">presentation what is model this is</span> <span data-start="1147.14" data-end="1150.44">really the key to to code cleaner</span> <span data-start="1150.44" data-end="1153.74">components because as you've seen</span> <span data-start="1153.74" data-end="1156.47">examples the view layers just be are</span> <span data-start="1156.47" data-end="1158.96">trivial basically and all the logic</span> <span data-start="1158.96" data-end="1162.26">lives in the model and the model itself</span> <span data-start="1162.26" data-end="1164.9">is also trivial or at least you can make</span> <span data-start="1164.9" data-end="1167.54">it it's a bit of a different small scale</span> <span data-start="1167.54" data-end="1170.75">challenge how you code it but as long as</span> <span data-start="1170.75" data-end="1174.14">the interface from it is nice then you</span> <span data-start="1174.14" data-end="1176">have something really nice to work with</span> <span data-start="1176" data-end="1178.22">that will kind of translate into a</span> <span data-start="1178.22" data-end="1182.929">simple view simple react components yeah</span> <span data-start="1182.929" data-end="1185.21">nothing it's important that in your</span> <span data-start="1185.21" data-end="1187.28">day-to-day work you need to remove</span> <span data-start="1187.28" data-end="1188.87">obstacles you need to make it really</span> <span data-start="1188.87" data-end="1192.77">simple to make people test more because</span> <span data-start="1192.77" data-end="1196.01">this is I often heard these arguments</span> <span data-start="1196.01" data-end="1197.929">like is testing really worth it it's</span> <span data-start="1197.929" data-end="1201.89">such a big maintenance burdens it just</span> <span data-start="1201.89" data-end="1207.049">takes a lot of time but I think if you</span> <span data-start="1207.049" data-end="1210.23">showed tests where an application where</span> <span data-start="1210.23" data-end="1212.299">all tests looks kind of like this then</span> <span data-start="1212.299" data-end="1216.679">this would partly disappear and this is</span> <span data-start="1216.679" data-end="1220.46">what happened at my work for example we</span> <span data-start="1220.46" data-end="1224.03">we started to write way simpler tests</span> <span data-start="1224.03" data-end="1228.02">and it makes a lot of people write more</span> <span data-start="1228.02" data-end="1231.14">tests that I you can just see that that</span> <span data-start="1231.14" data-end="1233">when you extract out the logic from the</span> <span data-start="1233" data-end="1235.76">components then it's so easy so there is</span> <span data-start="1235.76" data-end="1238.19">no excuse and the tests are really</span> <span data-start="1238.19" data-end="1240.83">meaningful as well so you you kind of</span> <span data-start="1240.83" data-end="1242.809">can motivate for yourself why they are</span> <span data-start="1242.809" data-end="1249.2">valuable so what are the biggest</span> <span data-start="1249.2" data-end="1253.37">learnings well I would say that I have a</span> <span data-start="1253.37" data-end="1256.76">lot

you</span> <span data-start="1261.84" data-end="1263.82">would start to do this I think you would</span> <span data-start="1263.82" data-end="1267.66">produce better code that's my belief</span> <span data-start="1267.66" data-end="1270.18">that if you kick up kick out the model</span> <span data-start="1270.18" data-end="1272.67">from your component to really be strict</span> <span
