data-end="1463.5">then use that throughout my code and</span> <span data-start="1463.5" data-end="1465.48">when I want to change it over to be an</span> <span data-start="1465.48" data-end="1468.27">article interface I can just replace</span> <span data-start="1468.27" data-end="1469.62">that and import the interface from</span> <span data-start="1469.62" data-end="1471.63">anywhere and use that and all of my code</span> <span data-start="1471.63" data-end="1473.64">will line up and I'm not just littering</span> <span data-start="1473.64" data-end="1474.26">it with any</span> <span data-start="1474.26" data-end="1477.86">statements anywhere everywhere so</span> <span data-start="1477.86" data-end="1479.95">typescript really encourages you to</span> <span data-start="1479.95" data-end="1482.48">develop by exposing these interfaces</span> <span data-start="1482.48" data-end="1484.91">really by creating these contracts that</span> <span data-start="1484.91" data-end="1487.85">you adhere to and its really simple to</span> <span data-start="1487.85" data-end="1489.77">introduce this type checking into your</span> <span data-start="1489.77" data-end="1491.93">project as we've seen without really</span> <span data-start="1491.93" data-end="1494.66">having to go fully into typescript and</span> <span data-start="1494.66" data-end="1496.22">converting everything all at once you</span> <span data-start="1496.22" data-end="1497.6">can do as much or as little as you like</span> <span data-start="1497.6" data-end="1500.12">the more that you do the more advantages</span> <span data-start="1500.12" data-end="1501.28">that you'll get from it though</span> <span data-start="1501.28" data-end="1504.02">so it provides this better ergonomics</span> <span data-start="1504.02" data-end="1505.91">story for developers on your project</span> <span data-start="1505.91" data-end="1507.8">it's easier for everyone to understand</span> <span data-start="1507.8" data-end="1510.29">what the API sar it's easier for new</span> <span data-start="1510.29" data-end="1511.49">developers who come on to the project</span> <span data-start="1511.49" data-end="1513.59">they get the smart tooling to help them</span> <span data-start="1513.59" data-end="1516.1">navigate the codebase and learn it and</span> <span data-start="1516.1" data-end="1518.72">it makes it easier to maintain that over</span> <span data-start="1518.72" data-end="1521.14">time especially as you need to refactor</span> <span data-start="1521.14" data-end="1523.82">so I work on an open source project</span> <span data-start="1523.82" data-end="1526.13">called dojo which received a complete</span> <span data-start="1526.13" data-end="1527.99">rewrite earlier this year completely</span> <span data-start="1527.99" data-end="1530">over to typescript and specifically to</span> <span data-start="1530" data-end="1532.4">strict typescript because one main focus</span> <span data-start="1532.4" data-end="1535.61">is on developer experience and we think</span> <span data-start="1535.61" data-end="1536.96">that typescript really helps us to</span> <span data-start="1536.96" data-end="1539.75">deliver on that so it's a really cool</span> <span data-start="1539.75" data-end="1541.28">project and I encourage you to check it</span> <span data-start="1541.28" data-end="1543.71">out and so I'll leave you with should</span> <span data-start="1543.71" data-end="1547.61">you use typescript probably yes but you</span> <span data-start="1547.61" data-end="1549.38">can decide at which level you want to</span> <span data-start="1549.38" data-end="1551.45">adopt it and then slowly increment that</span> <span data-start="1551.45" data-end="1554.72">over time this quote from Ken wheeler</span> <span data-start="1554.72" data-end="1557.12">these days if you aren't typing your JS</span> <span data-start="1557.12" data-end="1558.86">you're driving without a seat belt on I</span> <span data-start="1558.86" data-end="1561.38">think that that's totally totally</span> <span data-start="1561.38" data-end="1564.98">realistic and I believe that and so I'll</span> <span data-start="1564.98" data-end="1566.9">leave you with always bet on JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1566.9" data-end="1571.01">or a strict superset so thank you again</span> </p>
