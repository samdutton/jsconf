data-start="18.75" data-end="21.539">a software engineer I attended school</span> <span data-start="21.539" data-end="23.939">for music specifically music composition</span> <span data-start="23.939" data-end="26.82">and I was always drawn to the analytical</span> <span data-start="26.82" data-end="29.16">thinking aspect of music theory and</span> <span data-start="29.16" data-end="31.109">years later when I started to learn</span> <span data-start="31.109" data-end="32.88">functional programming I found that that</span> <span data-start="32.88" data-end="34.62">kind of the same itch was scratched</span> <span data-start="34.62" data-end="37.89">so when I started a musical project with</span> <span data-start="37.89" data-end="40.35">web development I decided to use</span> <span data-start="40.35" data-end="42.059">functional programming so here's my</span> <span data-start="42.059" data-end="43.71">introduction to functional programming</span> <span data-start="43.71" data-end="48">from a musical perspective so first we</span> <span data-start="48" data-end="50.039">have to ask the question what is</span> <span data-start="50.039" data-end="53.77">functional programming</span> <span data-start="53.78" data-end="56.27">well it's programming with functions I</span> <span data-start="56.27" data-end="59.55">just like object-oriented is based</span> <span data-start="59.55" data-end="61.17">around objects functions are the</span> <span data-start="61.17" data-end="63.42">building blocks so that leads the next</span> <span data-start="63.42" data-end="67.29">question what is a function well a non</span> <span data-start="67.29" data-end="68.909">functional definition might be something</span> <span data-start="68.909" data-end="71.85">like a sequence of commands attracted</span> <span data-start="71.85" data-end="74.25">into a reusable unit but a functional</span> <span data-start="74.25" data-end="75.72">definition is more something like a</span> <span data-start="75.72" data-end="77.88">relationship between a set of inputs and</span> <span data-start="77.88" data-end="80.09">outputs this is the mathematical</span> <span data-start="80.09" data-end="84.33">definition of of a function and is</span> <span data-start="84.33" data-end="86.1">sometimes referred to in programming as</span> <span data-start="86.1" data-end="90.119">a pure function so what makes a function</span> <span data-start="90.119" data-end="93.75">pure first means given the same</span> <span data-start="93.75" data-end="95.97">arguments in it will return the same</span> <span data-start="95.97" data-end="99.78">value this this means that it shouldn't</span> <span data-start="99.78" data-end="101.52">rely on anything from the outside such</span> <span data-start="101.52" data-end="103.56">as a random number generator the current</span> <span data-start="103.56" data-end="107.159">time or a read from the database it also</span> <span data-start="107.159" data-end="108.45">means no side-effects</span> <span data-start="108.45" data-end="110.189">this means it shouldn't affect anything</span> <span data-start="110.189" data-end="112.649">outside of itself it shouldn't many play</span> <span data-start="112.649" data-end="114.72">the Dom or write to the database or play</span> <span data-start="114.72" data-end="117.42">music and sometimes this is referred to</span> <span data-start="117.42" data-end="120">as being referentially transparent and</span> <span data-start="120" data-end="121.979">referentially transparent means that the</span> <span data-start="121.979" data-end="124.14">function and its arguments can be</span> <span data-start="124.14" data-end="128.28">replaced by its return value so for an</span> <span data-start="128.28" data-end="130.86">example we are here defining a note it</span> <span data-start="130.86"

accepts a</span> <span data-start="138.15" data-end="141.09">note and returns a new note with octave</span> <span data-start="141.09" data-end="144.18">incremented by one pi see here is the</span> <span data-start="144.18" data-end="147.81">result of that pure function play here</span> <span data-start="147.81" data-end="149.79">is an impure function because it has a</span> <span data-start="149.79" data-end="150.81">side-effect</span> <span data-start="150.81" data-end="153.269">it plays music and here you can note</span> <span data-start="153.269" data-end="156.12">that you can pass in either high C or</span> <span data-start="156.12" data-end="158.22">increment octave middle C and have the</span> <span data-start="158.22" data-end="159.45">same effect this is where the</span> <span data-start="159.45" data-end="164.069">referential transparency comes in so you</span> <span data-start="164.069" data-end="165.95">learn functional programming and you</span> <span data-start="165.95" data-end="169.319">move all side effects and now your</span> <span data-start="169.319" data-end="172.739">program is useless it's important to</span> <span data-start="172.739" data-end="174.9">note that side effects are not bad they</span> <span data-start="174.9" data-end="177.09">include making an HTTP request</span> <span data-start="177.09"

data-end="183.18">bad but they are unpredictable and they</span> <span data-start="183.18" data-end="184.859">are harder to test so you should use</span> <span data-start="184.859" data-end="186.989">your impure functions carefully and</span> <span data-start="186.989" data-end="192.239">predictably alright now that we have a</span> <span data-start="192.239"

data-start="654.179" data-end="656.61">find to really be the bread and butter a</span> <span data-start="656.61" data-end="659.16">functional programming and composition</span> <span data-start="659.16" data-end="660.749">is a technique to combine multiple</span> <span data-start="660.749" data-end="663.989">functions into a new function so here</span> <span data-start="663.989" data-end="665.249">we're going to take a note name and</span> <span data-start="665.249" data-end="666.629">we'll return a slightly detuned</span> <span data-start="666.629" data-end="669.48">frequency first we have a function</span> <span data-start="669.48" data-end="670.799">converting a note name to a frequency</span> <span data-start="670.799" data-end="675.6">for example an input of a4 would which</span> <span data-start="675.6" data-end="677.279">is a note name of a and an octave a4</span> <span data-start="677.279" data-end="680.399">will return 440 that's the the Hertz of</span> <span data-start="680.399" data-end="683.519">that note and here we're defining</span> <span data-start="683.519" data-end="685.439">function to multiply by small percentage</span> <span data-start="685.439" data-end="686.939">so once we have that frequency we can</span> <span data-start="686.939" data-end="691.259">detune it so in input a 440 would return</span> <span data-start="691.259" data-end="695.699">444 0.4 so compose takes two new</span> <span data-start="695.699" data-end="697.199">functions and calls them from right to</span> <span data-start="697.199" data-end="701.179">left the right to left is because</span> <span data-start="701.179" data-end="704.329">compose is a mathematical concept and</span> <span data-start="704.329"

data-end="716.85">later so here get deep get d2 dn't</span> <span data-start="716.85" data-end="719.249">frequency is a new composition that</span> <span data-start="719.249" data-end="721.799">takes an input and it passes it first to</span> <span data-start="721.799" data-end="725.999">frequency and then to detune up so an</span> <span data-start="725.999" data-end="730.29">input of a four will

data-start="758.16" data-end="760.319">functions well here we're gonna be</span> <span data-start="760.319" data-end="762.059">writing a function that converts a</span> <span data-start="762.059" data-end="764.999">human-readable shorthand into a computer</span> <span data-start="764.999" data-end="768.209">readable array alright so can everybody</span> <span data-start="768.209" data-end="772.11">read this alright so don't don't worry I</span> <span data-start="772.11" data-end="774.649">will zoom in on the important parts</span> <span data-start="774.649" data-end="776.879">first we're gonna be importing some</span> <span data-start="776.879" data-end="779.43">dependencies from Ram de and tan Jaya</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="779.43" data-end="783.18">Ram de is a utility library similar to</span> <span data-start="783.18" data-end="786.06">lodash or underscores but with a more</span> <span data-start="786.06" data-end="789.96">functional approach and you might note</span> <span data-start="789.96" data-end="791.55">that there are a lot of functions I'm</span> <span data-start="791.55" data-end="793.29">importing one of the cool things about</span> <span data-start="793.29" data-end="794.67">functional programming is that you take</span> <span data-start="794.67" data-end="796.59">lots of small functions and combine them</span> <span data-start="796.59" data-end="800.58">together with composition so for example</span> <span data-start="800.58" data-end="803.07">parse name here is a function it takes a</span> <span data-start="803.07" data-end="805.53">shorthand note and it returns the name</span> <span data-start="805.53" data-end="810.36">so c4 at a 10 would be a string where</span> <span data-start="810.36" data-end="812.22">the C is the note name the fours are</span> <span data-start="812.22" data-end="816.06">octave in the 8 n is the duration so</span> <span data-start="816.06" data-end="818.64">pipes through first to this regex</span> <span data-start="818.64" data-end="820.32">and that will return an array of</span> <span data-start="820.32" data-end="824.1">matching strings so any valid note name</span> <span data-start="824.1" data-end="827.04">and then it takes a head to return just</span> <span data-start="827.04" data-end="829.74">the full string so when passing in c4 at</span> <span data-start="829.74" data-end="832.17">a 10 the match function will return an</span> <span data-start="832.17" data-end="835.05">array of C and then head function will</span> <span data-start="835.05" data-end="838.83">take that and return just C so C for a</span> <span data-start="838.83" data-end="841.68">day 10 becomes array of the string c2</span> <span data-start="841.68" data-end="844.53">just the string seed parse octave is</span> <span data-start="844.53" data-end="848.4">similar imagines it to digits and then</span> <span data-start="848.4" data-end="850.98">we convert it to a number and parse</span> <span data-start="850.98" data-end="853.53">duration similarly will split at the at</span> <span data-start="853.53" data-end="856.47">symbol and it will take the last so c4</span> <span data-start="856.47" data-end="859.26">at a 10 will bring an array of c4 comma</span> <span data-start="859.26" data-end="863.04">a 10 and then just a 10 first time here</span> <span data-start="863.04" data-end="865.08">is a little bit more complicated it</span> <span data-start="865.08" data-end="868.83">takes a note and its context and it</span> <span data-start="868.83" data-end="872.37">returns a scheduled time so here we have</span> <span data-start="872.37" data-end="875.19">the array of notes we're slicing it to</span> <span data-start="875.19" data-end="879.27">only those preceding in and then we map</span> <span data-start="879.27" data-end="882.57">each of those to their length and we</span> <span data-start="882.57" data-end="885">reduce those to a single value and</span> <span data-start="885" data-end="887.91">overall this lets the Web Audio API know</span> <span data-start="887.91" data-end="890.1">when to play each note you're taking the</span> <span data-start="890.1" data-end="892.65">duration of all the notes before an</span> <span data-start="892.65" data-end="895.86">individual note and you're taking the</span> <span data-start="895.86" data-end="897.27">direction of them all and adding them</span> <span data-start="897.27" data-end="898.8">together and that lets you know when to</span> <span data-start="898.8" data-end="899.72">play the new note</span> <span data-start="899.72" data-end="903.12">so here parse shorthand is a composition</span> <span data-start="903.12" data-end="906.15">of compositions where it accepts a</span> <span data-start="906.15" data-end="907.77">string and it will return an array of</span> <span data-start="907.77" data-end="911.13">note objects so first it splits at all</span> <span data-start="911.13" data-end="912.899">whitespace converting a string</span> <span data-start="912.899" data-end="915.779">to an array of strings and an array map</span> <span data-start="915.779" data-end="918.449">here works like the array da map but as</span> <span data-start="918.449" data-end="920.009">a function so that allows us to pipe</span> <span data-start="920.009" data-end="922.949">into it and apply spec here takes an</span> <span data-start="922.949" data-end="925.589">object shape with functions each string</span> <span data-start="925.589" data-end="928.23">in the in the array that we just split</span> <span data-start="928.23" data-end="930.059">will be passed into each of these</span> <span data-start="930.059" data-end="932.879">functions and it will be mapped to an</span> <span data-start="932.879" data-end="935.369">object of the same shape so the string</span> <span data-start="935.369" data-end="937.499">will be passed a parse name and that'll</span> <span data-start="937.499" data-end="939.6">be the value for the key name the string</span> <span data-start="939.6" data-end="941.519">we passed a part octave they'll be the</span> <span data-start="941.519" data-end="946.17">value for the key octave and so on so</span> <span data-start="946.17" data-end="948.089">overall with our purse shorthand</span> <span data-start="948.089" data-end="950.66">function which takes an array of strings</span> <span data-start="950.66" data-end="955.949">this input string will be split at</span> <span data-start="955.949" data-end="958.05">whitespace become this array of strings</span> <span data-start="958.05"
