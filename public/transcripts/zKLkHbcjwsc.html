So, just before</span> <span data-start="31.14" data-end="37.09">we gene I'm quite a connoisseur of the animated gif and just in an attempt to be inclusive</span> <span data-start="37.09" data-end="44.98">- you see that on the slide it means the next slide contains a gif, if you suffer from vestibular</span> <span data-start="44.98" data-end="51.41">disorder or something that would make a uncomfortable, look away, listen to my voice, it's lovely,</span> <span data-start="51.41" data-end="54.22">interesting and ethnic \{Laughter\}.</span> <span data-start="54.22" data-end="61.53">I hope that makes you feel better and doesn't spoil your enjoyment, the next slide is animated,</span> <span data-start="61.53" data-end="66.229">this is how I feel after four days! \{Laughter\} .</span> <span data-start="66.229" data-end="73.36">So I like to relax before doing a conference talk, so I like to make you move, after four</span> <span data-start="73.36" data-end="79.1">days of sitting down, yeah, probably going to help. So, hello I'm Lewis Cowper, both</span> <span data-start="79.1" data-end="84.68">in life and pretty much everywhere on the internet and I just want to chill out for</span> <span data-start="84.68" data-end="86.35">a bit. .</span> <span data-start="86.35" data-end="90.1">So, you have heard a lot of fantastic talks and I hope you have had a chance to meet fantastic</span> <span data-start="90.1" data-end="94.5">people and chat to the sponsors and speakers after the talks, but I would really love you</span> <span data-start="94.5" data-end="105.7">to stand up for me. Feel free, have a little dance, little shake off. Everybody take a</span> <span data-start="105.7" data-end="113.469">deep breath and just hold, it nice and slow. Now on 3, I want you to blow there \{toward</span> <span data-start="113.469" data-end="120.17">the screen\}. 1, 2, 3, go!! \{Laughter\}.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="120.17" data-end="129.619">Wasn't that nice, just relax, it's ok, don't worry. So, yeah, forklifts and all that. Feel</span> <span data-start="129.619" data-end="130.52">free to sit down.</span> <span data-start="130.52" data-end="136.06">Have a glass of water and just enjoy at the moment.</span> <span data-start="136.06" data-end="145.62">So, forklift driver to developer in nine months. I'm@Lewis Cowper, pink sparkly heart JSConf,</span> <span data-start="145.62" data-end="150.87">please feel free to comment after.</span> <span data-start="150.87" data-end="155.6">Picture the scene, you wake up, it's still dark, you fall into clothes, you open the</span> <span data-start="155.6" data-end="163.63">door to leave and would you look at that, it snowed. Your job doesn't allow remote working,</span> <span data-start="163.63" data-end="169.17">your job doesn't require a WiFi connection and you are not sitting in front of a</span> <span data-start="169.17" data-end="174.92">computer, you make the best of it, put a fleece on, gulp down some tea, we're in Britain and</span> <span data-start="174.92" data-end="182.25">that's how you warm. This is your work, recovered steel pipe most probably from the oil rig</span> <span data-start="182.25" data-end="194.51">or field, the ones on the left 5 inch, the big ones 9 and 5 eighths, in Britain we deal</span> <span data-start="194.51" data-end="202.1">with Americans, all the sizes make me feel uncomfortable, your biggest asset is probably</span> <span data-start="202.1" data-end="208.09">one of these, that bundle right there will weigh around 3 to 4 tonnes, if you try and</span> <span data-start="208.09" data-end="210.74">pick them up it doesn't work! \{Laughter\} .</span> <span data-start="210.74" data-end="217.71">So, oh and if you drop that, I've discovered as well, steel pipe beats ground, so add that</span> <span data-start="217.71" data-end="228.54">into the rock, paper, scissors thing, steel win!! And you can break things really easily.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="228.54" data-end="233.94">So your job is to move these to your working area, where you are going to cut the pipe</span> <span data-start="233.94" data-end="239.93">with something like this. This is, I desperately tried to find a picture of my actual machine,</span> <span data-start="239.93" data-end="247.25">but my machine was in a small hut and was not nearly that clean and yeah, just generally</span> <span data-start="247.25" data-end="256.229">a bit grimy, we basically built a iron shed around that with two massive holes in the</span> <span data-start="256.229" data-end="264.65">side for the roller beds, so it your job is manual and really repetitive, it's varied,</span> <span data-start="264.65" data-end="268.13">sometimes something breaks and then you have to fix it.</span> <span data-start="268.13" data-end="275.729">\{Laughter\}. Some correlation. It gives your brain a lot of free time when you can just</span> <span data-start="275.729" data-end="281.46">switch off mentally at your job, I spent a lot of time analysing my work. So if one cut</span> <span data-start="281.46" data-end="287.84">takes x amount of time, how long would 1384 cuts take, no one bias an even amount, they</span> <span data-start="287.84" data-end="299.33">by buying distance, it's 1.88m, if I can get out 7 out of a 12, it's better to drag out</span> <span data-start="299.33" data-end="307.34">the longer pipe, soon enough my note bats looked like this, my colleagues, who were</span> <span data-start="307.34" data-end="314.54">less maths minded than me, thought I was Russell Crow in a beautiful mind! \{Laughter\} .</span> <span data-start="314.54" data-end="324.66">I love computers, I played with them for number of years, I like to think it was my analytical</span> <span data-start="324.66" data-end="333.28">mind that led me to programming or kept it fresh. I did the basics at school and tried</span> <span data-start="333.28" data-end="342.51">to go to university for computer science I was from a very small time, so I spent a lot</span> <span data-start="342.51" data-end="349.79">of time doing what we have been doing for the last few days, staying out late and partying,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="349.79" data-end="355.33">I signed up for an OU degree, computer science and design, soon as I got into second year</span> <span data-start="355.33" data-end="362.43">and introduced to Java, I didn't find it particularly engaging, I felt like I was learning in a</span> <span data-start="362.43" data-end="367.18">bubble and without an atmosphere of a classroom, I didn't seem to be able to focus and understand</span> <span data-start="367.18" data-end="374.56">why I had to type public stack void main every time and I still don't. I just wanted to make</span> <span data-start="374.56" data-end="378.97">a lot of things happen with my computer, not learn a lot of key words to get around. My</span> <span data-start="378.97" data-end="384.49">luck started to change, in the next city over, ten miles away, they were programming meet</span> <span data-start="384.49" data-end="390.99">ups, people got together in their spare time, unpaid, talked about programmering and taught</span> <span data-start="390.99" data-end="396.75">people stuff and asked questions, so combine people with enthusiasm for teaching and people</span> <span data-start="396.75" data-end="402.61">who want to learn, the fen diagram is basically the same, everybody wanted to teach and everybody</span> <span data-start="402.61" data-end="405.43">wanted to learn, it was fantastic.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="405.43" data-end="412.86">It was going to be a crowd and you have to say the right thing at these meet ups, you</span> <span data-start="412.86" data-end="418.23">have to know the lingo, so I said public stack main void before I ordered a drink and everybody</span> <span data-start="418.23" data-end="427.86">laughed, it kind of worked. I persevered and learnt the lingo, people there were happy</span> <span data-start="427.86" data-end="434.43">to chat about the things being discussed or anything related to DEV environment, when</span> <span data-start="434.43" data-end="439.4">you feel you have to say the right thing to fit in and at any time someone will find</span> <span data-start="439.4" data-end="446.139">out you don't know all the things, you start sticking to the one thing that gets you through</span> <span data-start="446.139" data-end="455.51">these meet ups and I liked games, playing games, I liked the idea of making games. One</span> <span data-start="455.51" data-end="460.52">of the groups was putting on a Gamejam in a month or so and I thought oh wow, I can</span> <span data-start="460.52" data-end="468.83">do some actually programming here, I looked at code on slides before at meet ups it was</span> <span data-start="468.83" data-end="473.57">easy, definitely wrong, what they don't show in the code slides is the other 100 that make</span> <span data-start="473.57" data-end="482.87">those work, I went to Google game tutorials to learning programming and discovered Python,</span> <span data-start="482.87" data-end="495.08">one caught my eye, rogue like library, the 5 hour tutorial took 17, I had functioning</span> <span data-start="495.08" data-end="501.18">game, it was really cool, it was the first time I made something from scratch.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="501.18" data-end="507.99">When I went to the Gamejam, somebody asked if anybody wanted to do Python, I was like,</span> <span data-start="507.99" data-end="516.86">yes, this is fantastic, I don't need to go a rogue like on my own, I latched on to the</span> <span data-start="516.86" data-end="520.899">people doing Python and didn't let go.</span> <span data-start="520.899" data-end="525.779">Then there was a team, a team of people who knew that I had literally never done anything</span> <span data-start="525.779" data-end="530.18">until the weekend before and were able to skeleton out the game and let me play with</span> <span data-start="530.18" data-end="536.029">random variables and see, you know, how to implement proper looking gravity and stuff</span> <span data-start="536.029" data-end="540.74">like that. Like I even, I was quite proud, I implemented a Para. lacks scrolling library</span> <span data-start="540.74" data-end="545.759">for a platformer when my team mates set we don't have time for that, 20 minutes later</span> <span data-start="545.759" data-end="548.79">it was done, I was King of the world.</span> <span data-start="548.79" data-end="557.22">It was there that I met somebody who did Java as work, I said hey I'm learning Java, I should</span> <span data-start="557.22" data-end="564.029">ask them what it's like to be a junior developer, he came in at that same kind of place and</span> <span data-start="564.029" data-end="571.72">gone through they're process, on job adverts, looking for a junior developer, three years</span> <span data-start="571.72" data-end="579.97">experience programming in eight different languages is like, what!! Like, seriously!?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="579.97" data-end="586.85">Catch 22, junior developer, three years' experience, either they not junior or they are not training</span> <span data-start="586.85" data-end="592.699">the people in three years the right thing and you should just not be doing that. So</span> <span data-start="592.699" data-end="597.98">the company you work for hired developer via QA, you would spend a couple of years in the</span> <span data-start="597.98" data-end="605.74">QA department, moving from manually to automated testing, then in DEV team testing, essentially</span> <span data-start="605.74" data-end="611.61">when you get familiar enough with integration tests, you write unit tests and then code</span> <span data-start="611.61" data-end="617.779">to go with them, it seemed like a better job than forklift driving, air conditioned office,</span> <span data-start="617.779" data-end="625.809">free water, what could go wrong! \{Laughter\} So I sent a CV away, heard nothing. Got in</span> <span data-start="625.809" data-end="630.819">touch with my friend who said they couldn't find my CV, I thought ok I'll try again, tried</span> <span data-start="630.819" data-end="637.41">again, I took a note that an error assisted, at the same time as there was an error processing</span> <span data-start="637.41" data-end="646.589">your application, congratulations CV submitted successfully, I thought that might be weird.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="646.589" data-end="650.55">My friend got in touch after a few weeks and said they still didn’t have any record of</span> <span data-start="650.55" data-end="656.879">it, I sent an email with screen shots to reproduce the bug that I'd found, as it turns out that</span> <span data-start="656.879" data-end="667.49">was a pretty good higher for QA, it did that for a while but soon got very, very bored</span> <span data-start="667.49" data-end="674.66">to make sure the flow works on a different build, but I lived in the town where all the</span> <span data-start="674.66" data-end="680.009">meet ups were, so I was able to leave work and go to the meet up without rushing, Python,</span> <span data-start="680.009" data-end="688.379">bit of Ruby, video games, but I really, really liked one of them, the JavaScript group, I</span> <span data-start="688.379" data-end="690.569">loved how the language looked \{Applause\}.</span> <span data-start="690.569" data-end="702.35">Great. There is an excuse. I loved how the language looked and I saw Ashley's talk describing</span> <span data-start="702.35" data-end="706.41">iteration through an array. If you look at Ruby when you already know what iteration</span> <span data-start="706.41" data-end="710.91">is, it looks really nice, when you look at JavaScript it actually explains what it's</span> <span data-start="710.91" data-end="716.019">doing, it's great. There's still like semicolon and I would reference a function it wouldn't</span> <span data-start="716.019" data-end="720.179">call I wouldn't know why because it was there was no brackets on the end. So yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="720.179" data-end="730.579">At the time I got into JavaScript round February last year having been programming for 2 or</span> <span data-start="730.579" data-end="736.97">3 months at various meet ups every month or so I would do anew thing. So this was well</span> <span data-start="736.97" data-end="742.079">into node being a thing, IE 11 had been out for a few months I’m like a clean slate</span> <span data-start="742.079" data-end="746.819">for somebody presenting JavaScript as if for the first time. They have played JavaScript</span> <span data-start="746.819" data-end="750.79">image in the past they tell you what do you like in programming you say JavaScript they</span> <span data-start="750.79" data-end="759.3">go oh I am sorry. Come on you're programming you can open the DevTools and do this. JavaScript</span> <span data-start="759.3" data-end="763.92">was power, power over something that I just loved which was the web, you could take any</span> <span data-start="763.92" data-end="769.1">website and ruin it in the DevTools, break everything because you completely didn't understand</span> <span data-start="769.1" data-end="773.889">what was happening but you knew 4 functions if you applied them in the right way you could</span> <span data-start="773.889" data-end="776.22">break everything, it was fantastic.</span> <span data-start="776.22" data-end="779.999">It felt like you could just type vaguely what you wanted to happen and it worked. I mean</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="779.999" data-end="784.739">I was doing simple stuff but it was amazing how quickly you can go from hey there's this</span> <span data-start="784.739" data-end="791.1">thing from JavaScript to enough power, enough knowledge to be dangerous. I really liked</span> <span data-start="791.1" data-end="796.259">the Jennifer quote from the intro on Friday which is JavaScript is pseudocode with semi-colones</span> <span data-start="796.259" data-end="805.399">on the end. I get that. It was just under 9 months or about 8 months that after I started</span> <span data-start="805.399" data-end="810.059">doing manual testing that we had. I had gone to ScotlandJS seen some fantastic, started</span> <span data-start="810.059" data-end="816.41">giving talks at user groups about things I didn't know anything about, but an opening</span> <span data-start="816.41" data-end="822.819">in the UX team who were working on their first AngularJS application having being doing Java</span> <span data-start="822.819" data-end="829.35">rendered pages for end tyre company's laugh, I think I said JavaScript often enough in</span> <span data-start="829.35" data-end="834.42">the interview they were like yeah we'll take you on. I got the job.</span> <span data-start="834.42" data-end="840.61">So there's a team of hackers we're all doing JavaScript it's all so fun. I get the title</span> <span data-start="840.61" data-end="844.769">of the talk I may have mislead you I didn't want to come here just to tell you my story,</span> <span data-start="844.769" data-end="849.249">because now I am a developer that's where the story ends but I want to tell you about</span> <span data-start="849.249" data-end="853.799">some of things that helped me along some, I learned myself some that others taught and</span> <span data-start="853.799" data-end="859.189">definitely some that I wish somebody had said sooner. This talk is for you if you no anybody</span> <span data-start="859.189" data-end="863.999">starting on the path to becoming a developer whether that's you useful, yourself, a colleague,</span> <span data-start="863.999" data-end="870.009">somebody who's interested they don't know how to deal with that. Or even if you are</span> <span data-start="870.009" data-end="873.36">watching this thing that's me I want to move into development I came here to learn and</span> <span data-start="873.36" data-end="875.879">be interested.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="875.879" data-end="882.009">Firstly, I would just say that this is not the right way to teach people modern web development.</span> <span data-start="882.009" data-end="887.399">I realise you can't see, oh no it's actually contrast quite well you cannot read it, it’s</span> <span data-start="887.399" data-end="893.29">entirely deliberately it's the stack from ThoughtWorks training course the JavaScript</span> <span data-start="893.29" data-end="898.389">toolkit which is great for experienced developers who want to know what tools they have available</span> <span data-start="898.389" data-end="905.11">across everything, but when you're new, you feel like all the things? I have to</span> <span data-start="905.11" data-end="910.97">learn all of that before I can write a website? This is useless. I think it's important we</span> <span data-start="910.97" data-end="915.61">should make learning materials at whatever level as accessible as you possibly can so</span> <span data-start="915.61" data-end="920.299">we can take people from this to this and be excited about learning the things they need</span> <span data-start="920.299" data-end="925.749">to learn. Let's go through some of things you could and should know about what I value</span> <span data-start="925.749" data-end="928.119">as a new developer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="928.119" data-end="934.1">First one, honesty. It always nice. Because when you start out you break something you</span> <span data-start="934.1" data-end="939.439">hit an error, you feel like you're the only one that's having this problem and having</span> <span data-start="939.439" data-end="944.079">it because you're stupid and you don't know anything. You can't figure out the right key</span> <span data-start="944.079" data-end="947.799">word to search for, you can't ask somebody because that would be terrible they will fire</span> <span data-start="947.799" data-end="953.399">you because oh my God you have caused an error it's broken something on your computer. That's</span> <span data-start="953.399" data-end="957.209">terrible. You feel like failures, what they don't realise it's that everybody programming</span> <span data-start="957.209" data-end="962.549">all the time breaks everything we just get better at fixing it. Right?</span> <span data-start="962.549" data-end="966.549">So when you have got a junior developer that's having a tough time with some new syntax or</span> <span data-start="966.549" data-end="972.149">trying to go into ES6 or something, support them but try and let them come across the</span> <span data-start="972.149" data-end="979.619">answer themselves. If you write the code for them, you're just writing abracadabra, we</span> <span data-start="979.619" data-end="989.389">have an app. It doesn't work no-one learns anything, people just as lost as me with things</span> <span data-start="989.389" data-end="997.559">that I had come across helped a lot. It felt less like I was coding in a bubble, the thing</span> <span data-start="997.559" data-end="1001.949">I did know started becoming relevant.</span> <span data-start="1001.949" data-end="1010.249">So if open source this next GIF perfectly encapsulate what I felt I will just look at</span> <span data-start="1010.249" data-end="1016.299">that repository that looks like an interesting project. It turns out that there's a lot of</span> <span data-start="1016.299" data-end="1020.799">open source software at there, not all of them are great learning experience but there's</span> <span data-start="1020.799" data-end="1025.48">a lot to learn from the community surrounding some of them are amazing I want to take a</span> <span data-start="1025.48" data-end="1030.88">moment to highlight Hoodie that was my introduction last February my first commit an open source</span> <span data-start="1030.88" data-end="1037.98">project if you do know anybody who's does want to get involved in the community tar</span> <span data-start="1037.98" data-end="1042.01">some other awesome initiatives out there to help newcomers the Rails Girls project, very</span> <span data-start="1042.01" data-end="1049.139">recently they finished their Summer of Code where they crowdfunded a large basically trying</span> <span data-start="1049.139" data-end="1055.899">to pay people who wanted to get into development and take them under the wing of an open source</span> <span data-start="1055.899" data-end="1059.6">project, who was happy to mentor them and answer any questions. It's fantastic. Their</span> <span data-start="1059.6" data-end="1064.549">statistics are incredible, I urge anybody who wants to help to look to them as a real</span> <span data-start="1064.549" data-end="1068.87">shining example of how to run an initiative like that but back to my thoughts on things</span> <span data-start="1068.87" data-end="1070.38">and stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1070.38" data-end="1075.61">Source control, I am not going to go too deep on what source control is if you're not using</span> <span data-start="1075.61" data-end="1082.2">it my now you should be you know that's fine, we're here all good, but as far as a new developer,</span> <span data-start="1082.2" data-end="1086.669">they may have never used it. I remember my friend telling me during a team project at</span> <span data-start="1086.669" data-end="1094">his masters university, that will remain nameless he asked his professor, what happens if 2</span> <span data-start="1094" data-end="1099.87">people edit the same file, how do we fix that, is there a nice way of doing it, and he was</span> <span data-start="1099.87" data-end="1108.5">told that the project manager should make sure that doesn't happen. \{laughter\} which</span> <span data-start="1108.5" data-end="1115.09">works, bit cheap though because you have the opportunity to take someone through source</span> <span data-start="1115.09" data-end="1122.549">control for the first time, we have been using it for decades now, as long is I have been</span> <span data-start="1122.549" data-end="1123.559">alive. New people</span> <span data-start="1123.559" data-end="1128.389">don't necessarily have the mental models of what happens when you do a Git ad they get</span> <span data-start="1128.389" data-end="1137.59">push, they may any some help with what might seem like simple or chore Git tasks. I discovered</span> <span data-start="1137.59" data-end="1141.83">when you are doing an open source project you branch you do the Github thing you do</span> <span data-start="1141.83" data-end="1146.84">branch commit, then open a pull request but because you can do a tremendous amount through</span> <span data-start="1146.84" data-end="1153.019">the Github UI you never get exposed to the commands going on. I have been quite taken</span> <span data-start="1153.019" data-end="1158.909">for using a graphical client for when multiple people are working on it, if you know someone</span> <span data-start="1158.909" data-end="1162.82">who's struggling with Git, explaining the principles rather than saying these are the</span> <span data-start="1162.82" data-end="1168.63">commands you need to run is probably well worth your time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1168.63" data-end="1173.039">This is one of the things that people are all levels tell everyone, whether it's a firm</span> <span data-start="1173.039" data-end="1178.649">or object orientated programmer trying to get some programming or front end it always</span> <span data-start="1178.649" data-end="1185.95">helps to see alternative ways of doing this. Innumerable talks suggesting you write a list</span> <span data-start="1185.95" data-end="1193.11">to get under the skin of a functional programming works. The limit on what you can learn by</span> <span data-start="1193.11" data-end="1199.11">trying new things out doesn't exist, but I think it's important to remember when you</span> <span data-start="1199.11" data-end="1203.13">are new don't dive too deep. You will wind up with a load of breadth of knowledge in</span> <span data-start="1203.13" data-end="1208.139">every which way of doing a single thing but because you have never taken the step forward</span> <span data-start="1208.139" data-end="1215.48">and tried to do more you end up having a coloured few on what some languages can and can't do.</span> <span data-start="1215.48" data-end="1221.75">Keep in mind the next 2 points. They say even in my very young career I have heard a lot</span> <span data-start="1221.75" data-end="1226.82">premature optimisation is the root of all evil. I suggest that goes triply so for you</span> <span data-start="1226.82" data-end="1231.049">software development education. Don't worry about how quickly you are learning slow down</span> <span data-start="1231.049" data-end="1235.85">the relax about, it I know coming to conferences trying to keep up with all the new technologies</span> <span data-start="1235.85" data-end="1241.289">and webapps out there means you feel like you have got to go fast, but honestly learn</span> <span data-start="1241.289" data-end="1245.95">apt your own pace it's super easy to get burned out on learning and not really enjoy what</span> <span data-start="1245.95" data-end="1251.11">you are doing because you are continuously thinking about all the things you don't know.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1251.11" data-end="1255.32">I say find your niche, because frankly the stack doesn't matter here we're at JSConf</span> <span data-start="1255.32" data-end="1260.22">we properly have JavaScript in our stack at some point that not necessarily the best fit</span> <span data-start="1260.22" data-end="1266.809">for everybody. So what you want to find out it's at what level you want to work. With</span> <span data-start="1266.809" data-end="1270.509">you trying everything you might stumble across something that really clicks for you.

I have also heard that</span> <span data-start="1285.48" data-end="1291.789">in systems programming everything has to be web scale. Is that a thing? I don't know,</span> <span data-start="1291.789" data-end="1296.19">but yeah. Find your niche and explore more the worse thing that will happen is that you</span> <span data-start="1296.19" data-end="1302.009">learn more about something and learn that you don't really care for it that much and</span> <span data-start="1302.009" data-end="1302.399">that's fine.</span> <span data-start="1302.399" data-end="1308.429">That's minimum viable product idea that goes round take the minimum shippable thing because</span> <span data-start="1308.429" data-end="1314.1">shipping culture it has his own problems but that's for another talk. We should really</span> <span data-start="1314.1" data-end="1318.85">get into habit of teaching new developers they should get it working force, then focus</span> <span data-start="1318.85" data-end="1322.82">on making it better because if they apply the same principles and it doesn't work, they</span> <span data-start="1322.82" data-end="1327.1">have no idea why. Just for those of you in the back that is a pile of sand being held</span> <span data-start="1327.1" data-end="1332.85">down by a 3 inch or 4 inch wide strap which looks like it might work, probably</span> <span data-start="1332.85" data-end="1337.69">won't. I have lost count of how many times I have made a start trying to solve something,</span> <span data-start="1337.69" data-end="1342.96">then second guess myself because some inconsequential implementation detail was not perfect them</span> <span data-start="1342.96" data-end="1349.37">then I was completely sidetracked from my train of thought. If I could get offer this</span> <span data-start="1349.37" data-end="1355.21">my Github profile would get a lot busier, but the number one thing that led me here</span> <span data-start="1355.21" data-end="1360.21">to talk you all whether that's people in your local dev community, helpful people who answer</span> <span data-start="1360.21" data-end="1365.99">questions on Twitter, people in open source communities people in slack RIRC, everyone</span> <span data-start="1365.99" data-end="1371.399">and people were the number one thing that inspired me to join this web community. We</span> <span data-start="1371.399" data-end="1375.909">need to start considering interpersonal skills as a major part of levelling up as a junior</span> <span data-start="1375.909" data-end="1378">dev.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1378" data-end="1381.779">We need to remain accountable for our action's programming is not the preserve of the super</span> <span data-start="1381.779" data-end="1386.429">educated anymore you have access to computers that fill entire rooms and can take a punch</span> <span data-start="1386.429" data-end="1393.7">card and spit out some binary, but we have moved past that. Anybody with a computer of</span> <span data-start="1393.7" data-end="1398.649">any kind, anybody who picks up a Firefox OS phone or 30 bucks or whatever can try out</span> <span data-start="1398.649" data-end="1403.59">web programming they can make an app in I think the current record upstairs was something</span> <span data-start="1403.59" data-end="1408.659">like of seconds.

If you go down stack overflow and say hey I am having</span> <span data-start="1421.149" data-end="1425.88">a bit of trouble adding these 2 number again what should I do the first answer is, use</span> <span data-start="1425.88" data-end="1432.25">a jQuery plug-in, no please don't do that. You need to be encouraging, giving them things</span> <span data-start="1432.25" data-end="1438.409">to do that are would help them understand because otherwise, certain websites look like</span> <span data-start="1438.409" data-end="1443">this. You ask a question, and immediately everybody leaps down your throat oh my God</span> <span data-start="1443" data-end="1449.83">you are using angular 1.2 you terrible human being. I always like to think it's GIFs because</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1449.83" data-end="1456.08">I like animation, but do you know who deserves to learn from you and who you can learn from?</span> <span data-start="1456.08" data-end="1459.36">Literally everyone. Thanks Gary.</span> <span data-start="1459.36" data-end="1467.269">So, in short, one year and 26 days ago today, I began my new life as a software developer,</span> <span data-start="1467.269" data-end="1473.179">about 7 weeks ago I moved to Berlin and changed job and I am now a junior front-end dev, I</span> <span data-start="1473.179" data-end="1478.99">am very happy. Because I am standing up here hopefully I can help at least one more person</span> <span data-start="1478.99" data-end="1488.86">gain the confidence to get involved too. So thank you very much I have been Louis Cowper.</span> <span data-start="1488.86" data-end="1489.97">\{applause\}</span> <span data-start="1489.97" data-end="1501.059">Actually, is that timer right?

Just</span> <span data-start="1501.059" data-end="1506.44">a quick thing I have got a few minutes, I want to just take a moment to talk about something</span> <span data-start="1506.44" data-end="1515.58">that I have been working really hard on, oh that's not mirroring. That will work. Yeah</span> <span data-start="1515.58" data-end="1523.2">so let's look at Hoodie, and Hoodie CSSI have been working on a tool that takes a Markdown</span> <span data-start="1523.2" data-end="1527.99">trial and pretty prints it with chalk it's not really fully done and code blocks don't</span> <span data-start="1527.99" data-end="1535.75">look too good. What I have in package JSON is MPM run help I would thoroughly urge anybody</span> <span data-start="1535.75" data-end="1544.6">using MPM as a build tool to try that when you run PMP run as normal you just get a list</span> <span data-start="1544.6" data-end="1548.159">of the script that can be really be helpful if you already know what all the dependencies</span> <span data-start="1548.159" data-end="1551.059">do but I just want to promote, oh I am off the bottom, sorry.</span> </p>

No!</span> <span data-start="1573.389" data-end="1580.639">Don't ask me! ! Basically we have the marked down file we can keep in sync, it looks great</span> <span data-start="1580.639" data-end="1589.059">in Github, take the input of run and add comments, tell people why you are doing what you are</span> <span data-start="1589.059" data-end="1595">doing, it hopefully will take off and everybody will really like it, it will help you go from</span> </p>
