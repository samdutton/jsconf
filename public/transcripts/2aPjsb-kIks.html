<p><span data-start="5.58" data-end="7.58">Good morning, everyone.</span> <span data-start="7.58" data-end="12.33">I want to start today with a question: how many of you — raise your hand — would consider</span> <span data-start="12.33" data-end="16.02">software development a dangerous activity?</span> <span data-start="16.02" data-end="19.279">Okay, not that many of you.</span> <span data-start="19.279" data-end="25.8">How many would consider an activity that involves hostile or bad relationships, mental or physical</span> <span data-start="25.8" data-end="31.39">stress, and something called a "death march", how much of you would describe that as dangerous?</span> <span data-start="31.39" data-end="33.05">Okay.</span> <span data-start="33.05" data-end="34.05">A good number more.</span> <span data-start="34.05" data-end="37.84">Now, what if I told you that software development had all those risks and even more?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="37.84" data-end="41.51">Probably wouldn't take me that long to convince you because many of you can probably relate</span> <span data-start="41.51" data-end="43.44">in some way or another.</span> <span data-start="43.44" data-end="47.9">In talking with developers all over the world, I found there are a lot of small risks in</span> <span data-start="47.9" data-end="54.829">what we do, whether it's poor working conditions, or horrendously managed projects, or even</span> <span data-start="54.829" data-end="57.05">just abusive managers and bad team-mates.</span> <span data-start="57.05" data-end="60.87">There are a lot of tiny risks in what we do as our job.</span> <span data-start="60.87" data-end="65.759">And so, because of that, I say software engineering is dangerous.</span> <span data-start="65.759" data-end="68.6">Just not dangerous in the way that you might expect it to be.</span> <span data-start="68.6" data-end="74.24">Even when we have good salaries, nice offices, comfy jobs, basically, there are still — there's</span> <span data-start="74.24" data-end="76.31">still a lot of risk in what we do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="76.31" data-end="79.52">There is in every field across the world.</span> <span data-start="79.52" data-end="82.479">But our feel is focused on creativity, right?</span> <span data-start="82.479" data-end="87.649">And problem-solving, and really approaching unique and new challenges.</span> <span data-start="87.649" data-end="91.67">Unfortunately, it's not so focused on how we interact with one another, how we take</span> <span data-start="91.67" data-end="96.709">care of ourselves, and how we build our teams.</span> <span data-start="96.709" data-end="101.27">So this is a combination that easily and unfortunately leads us to a lot of stress, right?</span> <span data-start="101.27" data-end="105.869">It can lead to physical mental illness, and burn-out.</span> <span data-start="105.869" data-end="109.499">We see people leave our industry all the time because of issues like these.</span> <span data-start="109.499" data-end="112.619">Is to so we can't do it alone.</span> <span data-start="112.619" data-end="114.2">We need a team, right?</span> <span data-start="114.2" data-end="119.219">Not just any team, but a team that will support us, to take that dangerous environment we</span> <span data-start="119.219" data-end="123.689">work in and turn it into a safe one.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="123.689" data-end="125.92">What does that team look like?</span> <span data-start="125.92" data-end="131.04">What kind of traits should we be looking for in a team and ourselves?</span> <span data-start="131.04" data-end="133.55">How do we build effective successful teams?</span> <span data-start="133.55" data-end="136.46">That's why I want to talk — that's what I want to talk about this morning.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="136.46" data-end="140.17">I think it is a great way to kick off this conference as we talk about a lot of the cutting-edge</span> <span data-start="140.17" data-end="144.96">things that are happening in the CSS community.</span> <span data-start="144.96" data-end="148.83">My name is Trent Willis, currently a senior UI engineer at Netflix.</span> <span data-start="148.83" data-end="149.96">I love my job.</span> <span data-start="149.96" data-end="150.96">I think it's wonderful.</span> <span data-start="150.96" data-end="156.71">I get a ton of freedom, work on things that interest me, and, most importantly, they give</span> <span data-start="156.71" data-end="157.71">me free food!</span> <span data-start="157.71" data-end="161.07">So what is not to like about that, right?</span> <span data-start="161.07" data-end="166.11">What are the primary reasons that I really, really enjoy the team that I work on it's</span> <span data-start="166.11" data-end="169.34">because what I would consider a safe team.</span> <span data-start="169.34" data-end="174.61">It's this relatively ambiguous idea of a safe team that I want to talk about today because</span> <span data-start="174.61" data-end="178.32">I would argue that many of us don't actually work on a teem like this.</span> <span data-start="178.32" data-end="183.07">You might say, "Trent, what are you talking about?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="183.07" data-end="186.86">It's not like I fear going to the office of course my team is safe."</span> <span data-start="186.86" data-end="189.63">That's not the takeaway safety I'm actually referring to.</span> <span data-start="189.63" data-end="195.09">I'm talking about safety in a more interpersonal sense, a sense that you can fully and completely</span> <span data-start="195.09" data-end="198.2">engage with your team and with your work.</span> <span data-start="198.2" data-end="203.18">A sense that you can challenge the status quo if you need to, you can suggest new potentially</span> <span data-start="203.18" data-end="204.94">controversial ideas.</span> <span data-start="204.94" data-end="210.34">At the very least, you should be able to let your team know when something about your job,</span> <span data-start="210.34" data-end="216.21">or your work, sucks, and you're not having fun and you're not enjoying it.</span> <span data-start="216.21" data-end="221.06">As I mentioned earlier, many of us don't find ourselves in situations like that often.</span> <span data-start="221.06" data-end="226.95">Late last year, there was a well-known management company in the United States called Gallup,</span> <span data-start="226.95" data-end="233.4">and they did some research that showed that only three out of ten workers actually believed</span> <span data-start="233.4" data-end="237.95">or could strongly agree that their opinion mattered at work.</span> <span data-start="237.95" data-end="239.01">Three out of ten.</span> <span data-start="239.01" data-end="241.65">That's an insanely low number, in my opinion.</span> <span data-start="241.65" data-end="248.25">At best, that means we have 70 per cent quieter offices, but at worst, means we are missing</span> <span data-start="248.25" data-end="254.54">out of 70 per cent of ideas that could be changing our team, and community, and potentially</span> <span data-start="254.54" data-end="258.43">the world for the better through the use of what we develop.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="258.43" data-end="260.34">You might be lucky.</span> <span data-start="260.34" data-end="264.69">Make you consider yourself one of those three in ten workers who actually feels their opinion</span> <span data-start="264.69" data-end="268.5">really matters, and, if so, that's wonderful, and I'm happy for you.</span> <span data-start="268.5" data-end="272.61">But it's in your best interest, actually, to be striving to build that type of environment</span> <span data-start="272.61" data-end="273.97">for everyone else on your team as well.</span> <span data-start="273.97" data-end="281.09">Gall aluminium found that — Gallup found that if you could increase it to six out of ten,</span> <span data-start="281.09" data-end="286.72">you saw a bunch of benefits such as fewer team members leaving, fewer incidents occurring,</span> <span data-start="286.72" data-end="288.06">and an increase in productivity.</span> <span data-start="288.06" data-end="293.87">I don't know about you been but that sounds like a win across the board for everyone for</span> <span data-start="293.87" data-end="294.87">me.</span> <span data-start="294.87" data-end="295.87">Sign me up for that.</span> <span data-start="295.87" data-end="301.1">But with all this in mind, the question still remains: how do we actually do that?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="301.1" data-end="302.84">How do we build a team like this?</span> <span data-start="302.84" data-end="307.79">Today, I have three short stories that I want to share that will hopefully provide a framework</span> <span data-start="307.79" data-end="314.19">for us to start thinking about what a team like this might look like.</span> <span data-start="314.19" data-end="317.9">So my first software development job, we practised code reviews.</span> <span data-start="317.9" data-end="324.56">Being a super junior developer at the time, my contributions were often heavily scrutinised.</span> <span data-start="324.56" data-end="325.75">Which was totally fair.</span> <span data-start="325.75" data-end="330.08">I was very bad at the time and I learned a lot from this process.</span> <span data-start="330.08" data-end="334.12">But, unfortunately, each code review could take days.</span> <span data-start="334.12" data-end="340.77">It meant that, even for tiny changes, it would take multiple days to land it into our codebase.</span> <span data-start="340.77" data-end="343.84">After this happened for a long time, I started to get really frustrated, right?</span> <span data-start="343.84" data-end="347.87">I didn't feel my contributions were a value for the team so they didn't seem like a priority</span> <span data-start="347.87" data-end="351.95">for anyone else.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="351.95" data-end="357">I started to work more slowly, slacked off more, and the result was that no-one really</span> <span data-start="357" data-end="360.06">noticed.</span> <span data-start="360.06" data-end="364.41">And so the lesson I took from this was that this team wasn't safe for me from feeling</span> <span data-start="364.41" data-end="369.26">worthless, for feeling that my work didn't have meaning, that I was kind of there as</span> <span data-start="369.26" data-end="372.59">another body.</span> <span data-start="372.59" data-end="376.58">The result was poor productivity and lack of engagement with the office.</span> <span data-start="376.58" data-end="377.82">And the work that I was doing.</span> <span data-start="377.82" data-end="382.93">Now, in this story, it would be really easy to say that the root issue here, the root</span> <span data-start="382.93" data-end="387.32">cause, the thing that we should be focusing on fixing was the code-review process, and</span> <span data-start="387.32" data-end="389.33">that it was flawed.</span> <span data-start="389.33" data-end="393.22">That may not necessarily be the wrong, but I don't think it was the root problem.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="393.22" data-end="397.36">Oftentimes, when things go wrong, we want to point to something that's really easy to</span> <span data-start="397.36" data-end="398.36">fix.</span> <span data-start="398.36" data-end="403.49">So, what happens, is we often fix a bunch of symptoms, and we wind up with a whole lot</span> <span data-start="403.49" data-end="409.93">of processes, rules, and guidelines, but root frustrations for our developers and for our</span> <span data-start="409.93" data-end="412.99">team are often still there.</span> <span data-start="412.99" data-end="416.389">When it comes to building a great team, we need to make sure we're fixing those deep</span> <span data-start="416.389" data-end="419.949">problems, those root frustrations.</span> <span data-start="419.949" data-end="424.27">We could have fixed the speed probably of the code reviews by mandating that every code</span> <span data-start="424.27" data-end="428.27">review be done in a certain amount of time, and we could have written code and bots to</span> <span data-start="428.27" data-end="430.139">help enforce the time limits.</span> <span data-start="430.139" data-end="433.02">What would have happened?</span> <span data-start="433.02" data-end="436.59">Myself and other junior developers on the team probably would have felt we were being</span> <span data-start="436.59" data-end="439.99">a burden to the senior engineers on the team.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="439.99" data-end="442.9">Because we're now dictating what they are spending their time on, and that's not a healthy</span> <span data-start="442.9" data-end="444.979">environment to be in.</span> <span data-start="444.979" data-end="450.74">That root frustration of being unsure of my contribution actually mattering was boiling</span> <span data-start="450.74" data-end="451.82">under the surface.</span> <span data-start="451.82" data-end="458.15">In this story, the real root problem here was my team wasn't good at sharing encouragement</span> <span data-start="458.15" data-end="460.02">and positive feedback.</span> <span data-start="460.02" data-end="465.32">Now, ironically, to point that out to someone, you have to give them some negative feedback</span> <span data-start="465.32" data-end="467.79">but no-one was willing to go that far.</span> <span data-start="467.79" data-end="472.78">So, what happened, is I had no signal that the work I was doing was good, but I had a</span> <span data-start="472.78" data-end="478.77">pretty strong signal that my contributions weren't that valued.</span> <span data-start="478.77" data-end="480.449">The answer here is not more process.</span> <span data-start="480.449" data-end="482.18">It rarely is ever is.</span> <span data-start="482.18" data-end="490.4">Oftentimes, we can solve technical problems through better process, or improved work flows,</span> <span data-start="490.4" data-end="494.21">but rarely does that actually help us with interpersonal problems.</span> <span data-start="494.21" data-end="498.949">Instead, we need to focus on fixing these sort of issues, primarily by communicating</span> <span data-start="498.949" data-end="502.05">better, communicating carefully.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="502.05" data-end="506.93">Apply some purpose, some empathy to how you communicate with your team.</span> <span data-start="506.93" data-end="510.85">Maybe you see a junior developer, and they're struggling with the code-review process.</span> <span data-start="510.85" data-end="514.44">So, be sure to add some positive comments.</span> <span data-start="514.44" data-end="518.74">Let them know they're doing a good job, even if they are having lots of issues with the</span> <span data-start="518.74" data-end="521.19">code they're submitting.</span> <span data-start="521.19" data-end="524.87">Or you interact with the team lead and you see they're really stressed out.</span> <span data-start="524.87" data-end="529.12">Maybe let them know your request wasn't that urgent, or, if you can, offer to take some</span> <span data-start="529.12" data-end="530.37">of their workload off.</span> <span data-start="530.37" data-end="536.48">The idea is that our communication, both in our team as well as the larger software engineering</span> <span data-start="536.48" data-end="541.93">community we're in, should always have this constant purpose of trying to build a better</span> <span data-start="541.93" data-end="543.81">environment.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="543.81" data-end="547.55">One where relationships are solid and people actually feel meaningfully connected to the</span> <span data-start="547.55" data-end="549.89">work they're doing.</span> <span data-start="549.89" data-end="553.64">Imagine the impact these sorts of things would have on the open-source community, right?</span> <span data-start="553.64" data-end="558.51">Maybe new contributors would feel more welcomed and actually want to get involved more.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="558.51" data-end="564.04">Maintainers might not feel so overwhelmed and burn out as frequently.</span> <span data-start="564.04" data-end="568.61">This idea of communicating carefully is really just a subset of a larger idea that I want</span> <span data-start="568.61" data-end="573.77">to talk about, and that is mindfulness, which is this practice of paying attention in a</span> <span data-start="573.77" data-end="576.39">particular way.</span> <span data-start="576.39" data-end="580.99">On purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally.</span> <span data-start="580.99" data-end="585.41">Purpose ful non-judgmental attention to what is going on around you is var to what I was</span> <span data-start="585.41" data-end="588.45">talking, right?</span> <span data-start="588.45" data-end="593.31">It's a relatively broad subject.</span> <span data-start="593.31" data-end="596.93">But at its core, mindfulness is simply about training yourself to really engage with what</span> <span data-start="596.93" data-end="603.76">is going on around you, which is why it's often defined by practices like yoga or meditation,</span> <span data-start="603.76" data-end="610.86">structured purposeful activities, but maybe you're like me, I don't know, yoga and meditation</span> <span data-start="610.86" data-end="614.43">seem a little new agey and unscientific.</span> <span data-start="614.43" data-end="621.62">But there's been an amount of scientific evidence and research coming out, and tons of anecdotal</span> <span data-start="621.62" data-end="627.32">evidence that these things tremendously improve your personal life which translates into benefits</span> <span data-start="627.32" data-end="629.19">and improvements in your professional life.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="629.19" data-end="635.31">As a brief example, the health care company Aetna started conducting mindfulness training</span> <span data-start="635.31" data-end="637.44">with its employees.</span> <span data-start="637.44" data-end="642.47">After 13,000 employees took out at least one somethings, they found compelling results:</span> <span data-start="642.47" data-end="648.37">a 28 per cent reduction in stress levels and a 20 per cent improvement in their quality</span> <span data-start="648.37" data-end="650.2">of sleep.</span> <span data-start="650.2" data-end="653.87">I don't know about the rest of you, but there are definitely times when I could use better</span> <span data-start="653.87" data-end="656.12">sleep and less stress in my life.</span> <span data-start="656.12" data-end="660.85">If doing so is going to benefit the rest of my team, then it's really a pretty compelling</span> <span data-start="660.85" data-end="664.79">reason for me at least to give this a shot.</span> <span data-start="664.79" data-end="671.2">I would recommend you start with an app called Headspace.</span> <span data-start="671.2" data-end="677.61">It lets you try out mindfulness meditation in your own time.</span> <span data-start="677.61" data-end="682.03">You can build it into your life on your own time and in your own terms, and, if you don't</span> <span data-start="682.03" data-end="687.99">like it, it at least provides a really nice way to start a nap.</span> <span data-start="687.99" data-end="696.22">Research has shown that mega mindfulness enables us to be more mindful around other people.</span> <span data-start="696.22" data-end="700.55">When you start to be more mindful, it benefits your team, because you engage in more meaningful</span> <span data-start="700.55" data-end="701.55">ways.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="701.55" data-end="705.15">We think about what we could be doing all the time instead of focusing on what we are</span> <span data-start="705.15" data-end="706.52">doing with our team.</span> <span data-start="706.52" data-end="711.85">We put away our phones more, to listen to people when they're actually talking to us.</span> <span data-start="711.85" data-end="716.68">We close our laptops during meetings to give presenters our full attention.</span> <span data-start="716.68" data-end="717.79">We show more interest.</span> <span data-start="717.79" data-end="722.46">We have likely all had interactions where the other person was distracted.</span> </p>
