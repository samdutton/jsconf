be a</span> <span data-start="50.09" data-end="51.86">long ways you have to go like climb up a</span> <span data-start="51.86" data-end="54.739">tree fly down if because the crickets</span> <span data-start="54.739" data-end="56.42">heavy and have to go up another tree</span> <span data-start="56.42" data-end="60.95">it's a mission but when she gets back to</span> <span data-start="60.95" data-end="67.25">the hole she has a little ritual she</span> <span data-start="67.25" data-end="71.39">takes the cricket drags it to the edge</span> <span data-start="71.39" data-end="74.15">of the hole right on the edge goes down</span> <span data-start="74.15" data-end="77.18">check things out comes back up and grabs</span> <span data-start="77.18" data-end="82.85">the cricket then dragged him down to the</span> <span data-start="82.85" data-end="87.02">depths where she lays her eggs stores</span> <span data-start="87.02" data-end="90.409">the cricket comes back up seals up the</span> <span data-start="90.409" data-end="95.54">hole he's still following me and then so</span> <span data-start="95.54" data-end="98.75">when like the poppy wasps or whatever</span> <span data-start="98.75" data-end="102.14">they're called a emerge they have some</span> <span data-start="102.14" data-end="104.709">food</span> <span data-start="104.719" data-end="111.299">it's a pretty good system but a long</span> <span data-start="111.299" data-end="119.919">time ago someone found a bug in it hey</span> <span data-start="119.929" data-end="125.67">what's on bugs though I guess crickets</span> <span data-start="125.67" data-end="131.67">are the ritual goes like this drag the</span> <span data-start="131.67" data-end="134.73">cricket to the edge of the hole you go</span> <span data-start="134.73" data-end="137.97">down check things out come back up and</span> <span data-start="137.97" data-end="142.25">drag the cricket in and go lay some eggs</span> <span data-start="142.25" data-end="146.599">but for some reason some weird person</span> <span data-start="146.599" data-end="150.81">sound a floor or a hack if you messed</span> <span data-start="150.81" data-end="153.39">with one of the steps you could get the</span> <span data-start="153.39" data-end="156.78">wasp into an infinite loop after</span> <span data-start="156.78"

data-end="166.19">reason I don't know why move the food</span> <span data-start="166.19" data-end="168.54">just a little bit just a little bit it</span> <span data-start="168.54" data-end="171.81">was like a couple of inches and when the</span> <span data-start="171.81" data-end="175.079">worst came back up she was like that's</span> <span data-start="175.079" data-end="179.01">not right so she dragged the food to the</span> <span data-start="179.01" data-end="182.13">edge of the hole then went down to check</span> <span data-start="182.13" data-end="187.579">things out and they do move the foods</span> <span data-start="187.579" data-end="193.079">and I was like what so she dragged the</span> <span data-start="193.079" data-end="197.579">cricket to edge of the hole for infinity</span> <span data-start="197.579" data-end="199.829">which I mean it was like in nineteen</span> <span data-start="199.829" data-end="201.9">eighteen hundred so infinity was only</span> <span data-start="201.9" data-end="206.16">about 40 but then like they did gave up</span> <span data-start="206.16" data-end="207.63">they got bored that's how you defined</span> <span data-start="207.63" data-end="209.67">infinity is just like now I'm not doing</span> <span data-start="209.67" data-end="214.26">this anymore I read that on a Snapple</span> <span data-start="214.26" data-end="219.66">lid</span> <span data-start="219.67" data-end="223.46">today I want to talk about rendering</span> <span data-start="223.46" data-end="228.38">things and with the intention of</span>
