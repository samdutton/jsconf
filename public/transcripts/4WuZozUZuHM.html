<p><span data-start="919.389" data-end="920.389">Lastly, convention.</span> <span data-start="920.389" data-end="925.6">We all have different ideas about convention, but as someone who has taught Ruby on Rails,</span> <span data-start="925.6" data-end="935.42">and em-R Ember, I think for beginners, it's important to give learners a set of guidelines</span> <span data-start="935.42" data-end="940.14">to use and work in.</span> <span data-start="940.14" data-end="943.829">Just I'm going to show a couple of little things.</span> <span data-start="943.829" data-end="946.709">So this is pretty much lazy-loading in Ember.js.</span> <span data-start="946.709" data-end="950.16">This is how straightforward it was.</span> <span data-start="950.16" data-end="955.5">I only need to explain what Lazy Loading is and show them is.</span> <span data-start="955.5" data-end="960.949">No disrespect to Angular, if I want to do this in Angular, it's not so straightforward.</span> <span data-start="960.949" data-end="965.819">This is one of the issues we face.</span> <span data-start="965.819" data-end="970.439">You need to make sure you can go into a lot of core concepts.</span> <span data-start="970.439" data-end="974.959">Going into a lot of core concepts for people you're trying to get into the industry might</span> <span data-start="974.959" data-end="977.1">just be a way to chase them away.</span> <span data-start="977.1" data-end="983.19">So using simpler methods, using this kind of method, and using convention over configuration,</span> <span data-start="983.19" data-end="985.189">we can do this and show it to to them better.</span> <span data-start="985.189" data-end="992.259">I hope a lot of frameworks will make it easier for people getting into the industry.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="992.259" data-end="996.579">This is a simple routing function in Ember.js.</span> <span data-start="996.579" data-end="997.74">This is a simple explanation.</span> <span data-start="997.74" data-end="1002.009">This is all I need to tell the student that how the routing itself would work, and this</span> <span data-start="1002.009" data-end="1008.16">would make logical sense because it follows systematically the way it will flow.</span> <span data-start="1008.16" data-end="1012.369">Lastly, this is a code written by someone who learned JavaScript for four days.</span> <span data-start="1012.369" data-end="1018.11">He literally just learned objects, variables, and functions, and then he came up with this.</span> <span data-start="1018.11" data-end="1023.519">I promised him I was going to put this up there because four days in, I couldn't write</span> <span data-start="1023.519" data-end="1024.519">this.</span> </p>
