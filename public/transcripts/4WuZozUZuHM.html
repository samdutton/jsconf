<p><span data-start="992.259" data-end="996.579">This is a simple routing function in Ember.js.</span> <span data-start="996.579" data-end="997.74">This is a simple explanation.</span> <span data-start="997.74" data-end="1002.009">This is all I need to tell the student that how the routing itself would work, and this</span> <span data-start="1002.009" data-end="1008.16">would make logical sense because it follows systematically the way it will flow.</span> <span data-start="1008.16" data-end="1012.369">Lastly, this is a code written by someone who learned JavaScript for four days.</span> <span data-start="1012.369" data-end="1018.11">He literally just learned objects, variables, and functions, and then he came up with this.</span> <span data-start="1018.11" data-end="1023.519">I promised him I was going to put this up there because four days in, I couldn't write</span> <span data-start="1023.519" data-end="1024.519">this.</span> </p>
