<p><span data-start="9.5" data-end="11.349">Hello.</span> <span data-start="11.349" data-end="16.33">My name is Jordan Santell from Google daydream WebXR team.</span> <span data-start="16.33" data-end="21.4">I'm here to share about our augmented reality on the world.</span> <span data-start="21.4" data-end="31.41">We're exploring how AR and VR will act on the web.</span> <span data-start="31.41" data-end="33.07">What is augmented reality?</span> <span data-start="33.07" data-end="38.85">Pokemon Go, filters, you know augmented reality.</span> <span data-start="38.85" data-end="44.649">But it's the come positing of the digital world on the real world.</span> <span data-start="44.649" data-end="47.26">It's similar to VA.</span> <span data-start="47.26" data-end="57.059">If you take AR and everything is in the virtual world, all opaque, then that becomes VR.</span> <span data-start="57.059" data-end="62.629">So, immersive computing is technology that operates on human immersion.</span> <span data-start="62.629" data-end="66.21">When that's on the web, we call it the immersive web.</span> <span data-start="66.21" data-end="72.5">So, we have been dreaming a lot about the future of the immersive web five to ten years</span> <span data-start="72.5" data-end="73.659">from now.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="73.659" data-end="80.829">And I'm excited to share with you the story of our foundational block of work for this.</span> <span data-start="80.829" data-end="82.909">Bringing augmented reality to the web.</span> <span data-start="82.909" data-end="87.57">And I'll also talk a little bit about what can be coming up in the future.</span> <span data-start="87.57" data-end="92.52">What can be going on in ten years from now and the challenges it brings and why this</span> <span data-start="92.52" data-end="97.229">is an exciting time to jump on in new medium.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="97.229" data-end="106.96">Last summer Apple released AR kit and Google, AR core, these are for iOS and Android devices.</span> <span data-start="106.96" data-end="113.619">Enabling mobile developers to create augmented reality applications and provides real world</span> <span data-start="113.619" data-end="118.61">understanding so developing can create content in order to interact with the real world.</span> <span data-start="118.61" data-end="124.12">So, developers having easy access is only one half of the equation.</span> <span data-start="124.12" data-end="129.25">The other half is do users actually have access to AR capable devices?</span> <span data-start="129.25" data-end="135.56">Previously this was limited to dedicated headsets, expensive dedicated headsets and less stable</span> <span data-start="135.56" data-end="136.56">platforms.</span> <span data-start="136.56" data-end="143.99">But these new forms, AR Core and AR Kit only require censors like gyro scope, accelerometer,</span> <span data-start="143.99" data-end="148.66">RGB camera, things you can find on most more than smartphones.</span> <span data-start="148.66" data-end="150.82">No special hardware is needed.</span> <span data-start="150.82" data-end="156.54">There are around 600 million AR Core and Kit devices.</span> <span data-start="156.54" data-end="164.59">It's the perfect time to start bringing augment the reality to the web.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="164.59" data-end="170.28">And there's like 200 megabytes of animated GIFs here, so, it might be a little slow.</span> <span data-start="170.28" data-end="175.77">We built some prototype browsers, web AR on AR Kit and Core.</span> <span data-start="175.77" data-end="176.77">Great names.</span> <span data-start="176.77" data-end="183.44">And these are hackie web views we use to expose features from AR kit, AR Core to web development.</span> <span data-start="183.44" data-end="192.75">First, we needed to identify which features we needed to create these experiences.</span> <span data-start="192.75" data-end="198.56">We identified three high level requirements we would need to bring to the web.</span> <span data-start="198.56" data-end="201.86">First off, we need to know where the device is in 3D space.</span> <span data-start="201.86" data-end="207.32">Its position and orientation in order to sync our virtual world on top of the real world.</span> <span data-start="207.32" data-end="209.31">VR has similar needs.</span> <span data-start="209.31" data-end="211.49">You have to track it there.</span> <span data-start="211.49" data-end="216.209">We were able to leverage a lot of the web VR API here.</span> <span data-start="216.209" data-end="221.65">Sometimes this is referred to as six stuff, or six degrees of freedom.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="221.65" data-end="229.21">And that's referring to tracking three axis of position and three axis of orientation.</span> <span data-start="229.21" data-end="232.7">We need to expose the camera stream and intrinsics.</span> <span data-start="232.7" data-end="237.29">Intrinsics in this case are things like the field of view and perspective of a camera.</span> <span data-start="237.29" data-end="242.18">Again, in order to sync our virtual world with the real world.</span> <span data-start="242.18" data-end="246.59">Mobile platforms only allow one process to access the camera at a time.</span> <span data-start="246.59" data-end="252.35">Since our AR platform is using the camera, we can't use get user media, for example.</span> <span data-start="252.35" data-end="257.16">We have to have another way to expose this information.</span> <span data-start="257.16" data-end="262.97">And finally, we need to be able to understand the world around us in order to interact with</span> <span data-start="262.97" data-end="264.45">the real world.</span> <span data-start="264.45" data-end="272.15">So, there is this broad description, the catch all term for the ability to interpret the</span> <span data-start="272.15" data-end="273.15">real world.</span> <span data-start="273.15" data-end="279.19">So, for example, finding surfaces to place an object on it or estimating light in an</span> <span data-start="279.19" data-end="280.19">environment.</span> <span data-start="280.19" data-end="285.5">So, you can see the brave line up, get scared when the lights go out.</span> <span data-start="285.5" data-end="288.87">So, these three components are MVP feature set.</span> <span data-start="288.87" data-end="293.28">And we also, of course, had some goals for this experiment.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="293.28" data-end="296.52">First off, general occupy exploration.</span> <span data-start="296.52" data-end="301.48">We were going to look into the ergonomics or feasibility of different features that</span> <span data-start="301.48" data-end="302.81">we do expose.</span> <span data-start="302.81" data-end="311.23">So, for example, earlier prototypes used Tango smartphones with infrared depth cameras on</span> <span data-start="311.23" data-end="312.23">them.</span> <span data-start="312.23" data-end="313.33">Similar to a Kinect.</span> <span data-start="313.33" data-end="322.14">So, this gave us around 30,0003D points per frame to position in the real world and</span> <span data-start="322.14" data-end="324.07">use that in our experiments.</span> <span data-start="324.07" data-end="331.67">So, needless to say, pushing 30,0003D points from the platform to web content and sometimes</span> <span data-start="331.67" data-end="335.24">in this case to the GPU was not ideal.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="335.24" data-end="341.63">So, we moved our initial API from point clouds was difficult to use in a performant way.</span> <span data-start="341.63" data-end="344.23">Wees want to discover what's possible.</span> <span data-start="344.23" data-end="346.29">What kinds of things we can make.</span> <span data-start="346.29" data-end="351.83">With post tracking in the camera feed, we can do things like build portals.</span> <span data-start="351.83" data-end="357.66">And since this is the web, we can use physics libraries and service detection to make an</span> <span data-start="357.66" data-end="359.11">AR mic drop.</span> <span data-start="359.11" data-end="366.6">We have had to build tools as we're developing these experiences to debug what we're doing.</span> <span data-start="366.6" data-end="372.32">It was very difficult before we had these tools to do things like visualize the surfaces.</span> <span data-start="372.32" data-end="375.29">So, we know are we finding a plane?</span> <span data-start="375.29" data-end="376.54">Are we miss something did I break something?</span> <span data-start="376.54" data-end="380.46">What's going on here?</span> <span data-start="380.46" data-end="383.07">And we also want to get developers excited about these features.</span> <span data-start="383.07" data-end="387.53">We wanted developers to bug visor vendors and say, we want this.</span> <span data-start="387.53" data-end="388.85">Please implement this.</span> <span data-start="388.85" data-end="391.4">And convince organizations to check it out.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="391.4" data-end="392.73">Maybe this is something we can use.</span> <span data-start="392.73" data-end="396.48">And see what core ideas people came up with.</span> <span data-start="396.48" data-end="402.11">So, concurrently, while working on these prototypes, folks from a handful of browsers that you</span> <span data-start="402.11" data-end="405.26">see up there, we were working on web VR2.0.</span> <span data-start="405.26" data-end="414.94">And it was renamed to WebXR to support virtual reality and augmented reality experiences.</span> <span data-start="414.94" data-end="421.419">There's now an implementation of WebXR inside of Chrome canary, I think the latest one,</span> <span data-start="421.419" data-end="423.06">behind a flag.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="423.06" data-end="430.04">And all currently support VR, all these ones, have pledged to support the WebXR Spec as</span> <span data-start="430.04" data-end="433.77">well.</span> <span data-start="433.77" data-end="439.05">After about nine months of prototyping and working with standards, we now have a working</span> <span data-start="439.05" data-end="441.06">version in a real browser.</span> <span data-start="441.06" data-end="442.68">So, kind of, asterisk.</span> <span data-start="442.68" data-end="448.7">So, when I wrote this proposal for JSConf EU months ago, I was kind of I had no idea</span> <span data-start="448.7" data-end="452.52">what state this would be in by now.</span> <span data-start="452.52" data-end="453.669">But I got pretty close.</span> <span data-start="453.669" data-end="455.25">It's about like two weeks away.</span> <span data-start="455.25" data-end="458.48">We're going through the reveal process right now.</span> <span data-start="458.48" data-end="463.69">And who knew that shipping code to a billion plus users was difficult?</span> <span data-start="463.69" data-end="467.96">So, it would be behind multiple flags.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="467.96" data-end="471.699">And the API will change for sure between several versions.</span> <span data-start="471.699" data-end="474.18">It's very in flux.</span> <span data-start="474.18" data-end="480.86">So, now that we have these features enabled in a real browser, we were able to show this</span> <span data-start="480.86" data-end="483.87">off at Google IO a few weeks back.</span> <span data-start="483.87" data-end="488.05">We have this educational site showcasing the statue from Mexico.</span> <span data-start="488.05" data-end="495.58">It's kind of like this kind of a Wikipedia type article with a model on there.</span> <span data-start="495.58" data-end="498.76">And we wanted to show off the progressive enhancement concept.</span> <span data-start="498.76" data-end="500.21">Something very webby.</span> <span data-start="500.21" data-end="505.23">So, if you're viewing this on desktop or mobile browser, you can move the statue around with</span> <span data-start="505.23" data-end="506.79">mouse and keyword.</span> <span data-start="506.79" data-end="510.59">And see the WebGL content and viewers.</span> <span data-start="510.59" data-end="516.59">But on a browser that supports AR features with WebXR, you can place it in the world</span> <span data-start="516.59" data-end="517.94">around you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="517.94" data-end="521.65">I swear the performance is better than this GIF looks.</span> <span data-start="521.65" data-end="528.7">You can place this life size statue and these annotations you can interact with.</span> <span data-start="528.7" data-end="529.96">Click on them.</span> <span data-start="529.96" data-end="536.17">And since it's just the web, render with HTML and CSS.</span> <span data-start="536.17" data-end="540.89">All the same web tools you're used to.</span> <span data-start="540.89" data-end="545.73">When we were showing this off in the web booth, there's a web booth and an Android booth at</span> <span data-start="545.73" data-end="548.11">Google IO.</span> <span data-start="548.11" data-end="552.78">I was at the Android booth, so we had a lot of Android developers check it out.</span> <span data-start="552.78" data-end="556.38">And their reaction was they didn't quite believe this was the web.</span> <span data-start="556.38" data-end="563.35">So, it was a lot of great feedback and confirmation that, yes, the web can performantly run WebGL</span> <span data-start="563.35" data-end="566.58">experiences with AR.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="566.58" data-end="571.55">So, I mentioned earlier, understanding.</span> <span data-start="571.55" data-end="576.83">So, the initial installation of augmented reality in Chrome only implements one set</span> <span data-start="576.83" data-end="578.27">of see understanding.</span> <span data-start="578.27" data-end="579.7">A hit test.</span> <span data-start="579.7" data-end="586.46">You can array out from the device and interact with the real world, some surface, a collision.</span> <span data-start="586.46" data-end="590.04">And this returns a 3D point if found.</span> <span data-start="590.04" data-end="598.37">So, commonly in applications, you have something that traces real world surfaces and displace</span> <span data-start="598.37" data-end="606.65">an indicator to the user indicating there's a space found here or no surface.</span> <span data-start="606.65" data-end="608.66">And where that collision occurred.</span> <span data-start="608.66" data-end="613.61">So, how we implement this radical behavior is on every frame we cast out array from the</span> <span data-start="613.61" data-end="617.89">device and see if we get a hit.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="617.89" data-end="622.04">If it hits the surface, we change the radical to provide feedback.</span> <span data-start="622.04" data-end="625.46">In this use case, we say, hey, we found a surface.</span> <span data-start="625.46" data-end="627.77">Tap again to place a model.</span> <span data-start="627.77" data-end="634.35">So, I'm going to show off some example code of implementing this radical.</span> <span data-start="634.35" data-end="637.71">And I don't want to get too deep into this at all for several reasons.</span> <span data-start="637.71" data-end="639.451">One, it's not in Canary yet.</span> <span data-start="639.451" data-end="644.67">And there will be better resources to come than me talking about it.</span> <span data-start="644.67" data-end="649">Like a Code Lab and other documentation.</span> <span data-start="649" data-end="654.02">This code is the same as if you're doing a VR experience with WebXR.</span> <span data-start="654.02" data-end="657.08">We can request a device from navigator XR.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="657.08" data-end="662.45">And we need to create an XR presentation context from a Canvas element.</span> <span data-start="662.45" data-end="666.17">This is similar to getting a WebGL context from Canvas.</span> <span data-start="666.17" data-end="671.17">And this is visible to the user and injected into the DOM.</span> <span data-start="671.17" data-end="676.25">And as a big caveat, there's absolutely no error handling here that should be done.</span> <span data-start="676.25" data-end="680.92">So, then you also request a session on that XR device.</span> <span data-start="680.92" data-end="683.01">Passing in our XL presentation context.</span> <span data-start="683.01" data-end="687.83">So, this request session is the part that's not fully spec壇 out for augmented reality</span> <span data-start="687.83" data-end="688.83">yet.</span> <span data-start="688.83" data-end="694.589">Ideally in the future this is where you would request specific augmented reality features.</span> <span data-start="694.589" data-end="699.59">So, you can kind of react to different environments, different platforms can support different</span> <span data-start="699.59" data-end="701.3">features.</span> <span data-start="701.3" data-end="706.47">And right now, once this lands, if you enable the augmented reality flag, everything's always</span> <span data-start="706.47" data-end="707.47">AR.</span> <span data-start="707.47" data-end="709.65">The camera feed will always be wondering.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="709.65" data-end="712.73">And the underlying AR platform is always running.</span> <span data-start="712.73" data-end="718.25">There's battery implications and privacy implications for using these features.</span> <span data-start="718.25" data-end="722.68">So, that will change very soon.</span> <span data-start="722.68" data-end="725.339">So, this is a lot of code right here, I know.</span> <span data-start="725.339" data-end="726.8">So, it's a lot of boilerplate.</span> <span data-start="726.8" data-end="730.42">This will all be abstracted away behind libraries.</span> <span data-start="730.42" data-end="735.23">But really quickly, we need to set up another Canvas that we write the WebGL commands to.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="735.23" data-end="741.12">So, this gets moved over to the XL presentation context we injected into the DOM.</span> <span data-start="741.12" data-end="743.25">This is the weirdest part of WebXR.</span> <span data-start="743.25" data-end="745.44">You have two canvass.</span> <span data-start="745.44" data-end="751.42">One that you write to that is not in the DOM, and one that displays that content that's</span> <span data-start="751.42" data-end="752.42">in the DOM.</span> <span data-start="752.42" data-end="755.37">So, it's very didn't than other kind of 3D stuff.</span> <span data-start="755.37" data-end="759.649">So, things of note here, we create a frame of reference.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="759.649" data-end="760.649">And for our session.</span> <span data-start="760.649" data-end="765.36">And then we start a request animation frame loop using our session's request animation</span> <span data-start="765.36" data-end="766.36">frame.</span> <span data-start="766.36" data-end="770.93">You have to hook into the native device in order to sync everything properly.</span> <span data-start="770.93" data-end="774.97">So, similar to this is, again, we're working with 3D.</span> <span data-start="774.97" data-end="781.68">So, this is similar to other kind of WebGL 3, JS development where we have a render loop.</span> <span data-start="781.68" data-end="788.83">So, a render loop we get our devices and that contains like a matrix representing our device's</span> <span data-start="788.83" data-end="790.72">position and orientation.</span> <span data-start="790.72" data-end="792.44">And then we render every frame.</span> <span data-start="792.44" data-end="797.09">Our virtual content that matches perfectly with our real world.</span> <span data-start="797.09" data-end="800.73">And then we call this radical update function.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="800.73" data-end="807.25">So, this radical is a custom GS class and is like a disk on the ground that can trace</span> <span data-start="807.25" data-end="808.25">surfaces.</span> <span data-start="808.25" data-end="812.08">And in every frame, update function.</span> <span data-start="812.08" data-end="816.07">I'm glossing over the details here.</span> <span data-start="816.07" data-end="821.16">And we have an origin point and a direction vector representing this line coming out of</span> <span data-start="821.16" data-end="822.269">our device.</span> <span data-start="822.269" data-end="827.31">And we have a variable hit.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="865.85" data-end="870.8">And there will definitely be libraries that will abstract this away.</span> <span data-start="870.8" data-end="873.8">So, what's next in the near future?</span> <span data-start="873.8" data-end="881.54">Like I said, sometime in the next few weeks AR will land in Canary behind a flag.</span> <span data-start="881.54" data-end="886.98">And with this flag, like I said, augmented reality will always be on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="886.98" data-end="888.85">And we want this to be more fine tuned.</span> <span data-start="888.85" data-end="893.33">So, with the request session API will have to be fleshed out.</span> <span data-start="893.33" data-end="897.19">And right now, we're only supporting hit tests.</span> <span data-start="897.19" data-end="901.76">That abstraction over the underlying service or mesh data that the AR platform provides.</span> <span data-start="901.76" data-end="909.56">But in the future, we would like to have point clouds, services, mesh, light estimation as</span> <span data-start="909.56" data-end="916.48">well as things like anchors which are abstract 3D points that you can place around the world.</span> <span data-start="916.48" data-end="924.73">Over time, as the system understands the scene better, that will update and become more accurate.</span> <span data-start="924.73" data-end="926.68">And right now, we're hand coding all this XL stuff.</span> <span data-start="926.68" data-end="928.51">There's a lot of rough edges.</span> <span data-start="928.51" data-end="930.23">The spec is still under development.</span> <span data-start="930.23" data-end="933.46">And we're making tools internally as needed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="933.46" data-end="939.12">So, libraries like 3JS currently support some XR use cases.</span> <span data-start="939.12" data-end="942.399">And in the future, we imagine this would also support AR.</span> <span data-start="942.399" data-end="948.56">And if you're familiar with Mozilla's A frame web library, after our prototype browsers,</span> <span data-start="948.56" data-end="952.56">someone a week later made an AR component that worked great.</span> <span data-start="952.56" data-end="956.05">So, that community is very proactive.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="956.05" data-end="961.31">We imagine all these libraries will support creating AR for a better experience rather</span> <span data-start="961.31" data-end="965.899">than writing using the API directly.</span> <span data-start="965.899" data-end="971.519">So, what I'm talking about right now is mostly mobile AR.</span> <span data-start="971.519" data-end="977.13">And this provides a lot of immediate solutions for things like shopping, education and entertainment.</span> <span data-start="977.13" data-end="982.47">And this is only the beginning as the future gets much more interesting and weird.</span> <span data-start="982.47" data-end="987.44">So, that's, you know, the future in the next few months or a year.</span> <span data-start="987.44" data-end="990.269">What about the next five years?</span> <span data-start="990.269" data-end="995.029">A little further out we can imagine computer vision and machine learning being used with</span> <span data-start="995.029" data-end="996.26">augmented reality.</span> <span data-start="996.26" data-end="1000.899">Mozilla has been working on their own prototype browsers using AR.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1000.899" data-end="1007.1">And they have been doing some research with computer vision within WebXR.</span> <span data-start="1007.1" data-end="1012.089">And something that's been talked about a lot in the AR industry is this concept of the</span> <span data-start="1012.089" data-end="1013.99">AR cloud, or cloud anchors.</span> <span data-start="1013.99" data-end="1018.209">Which lets multiple users share their virtual world.</span> <span data-start="1018.209" data-end="1024.319">This feature is currently a course and works for iOS and Android.</span> <span data-start="1024.319" data-end="1027.949">But this will be critical to have also on the web.</span> <span data-start="1027.949" data-end="1033.199">Unclear if it will be different services or part of the native API.</span> <span data-start="1033.199" data-end="1034.199">No idea.</span> <span data-start="1034.199" data-end="1040.409">But this is necessary and critical for our user immersive content.</span> <span data-start="1040.409" data-end="1042.939">And hardware is making a lot of progress.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1042.939" data-end="1050.489">So, with the latest generation of VR headsets, these R and 1 headsets, tracking for VR is</span> <span data-start="1050.489" data-end="1053.289">much more accessible now.</span> <span data-start="1053.289" data-end="1057.379">Rather than needing a whole room set up where you're installing I'm not sure what they</span> <span data-start="1057.379" data-end="1065.08">call it like lasers to track your movement and also like an expensive gaming computer,</span> <span data-start="1065.08" data-end="1066.08">essentially.</span> <span data-start="1066.08" data-end="1072.09">So, we're getting closer to these, like, smaller accessible rather affordable, comparatively,</span> <span data-start="1072.09" data-end="1075.73">headsets that people can use.</span> <span data-start="1075.73" data-end="1090.87">AR headsets like HoloLens and others, they're out and quite expensive and specialized hardware.</span> <span data-start="1090.87" data-end="1096.909">And in this head mounted display AR world, those will be supporting browsers.</span> <span data-start="1096.909" data-end="1099.7">So, the specification has to work for mobile.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1099.7" data-end="1102.94">But it's got to have the head mounted displays.</span> <span data-start="1102.94" data-end="1107.669">And the head mounted displays will have paradigms.</span> <span data-start="1107.669" data-end="1115.669">The HoloLens has pretty good support for hand gestures to interact with content as well</span> <span data-start="1115.669" data-end="1117.58">as voice commands.</span> <span data-start="1117.58" data-end="1120.72">So, we seem to be trending towards that.</span> <span data-start="1120.72" data-end="1125.72">Like a limited physical interface and using more computer vision machine learning to interact</span> <span data-start="1125.72" data-end="1127.84">with this virtual environment.</span> <span data-start="1127.84" data-end="1135.169">So, further out in the future again, this is looking at trends, making informed guesses.</span> <span data-start="1135.169" data-end="1137.779">But at the end of the day, they're still guesses.</span> </p>
