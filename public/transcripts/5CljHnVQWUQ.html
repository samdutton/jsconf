data-end="760.39">doing the hacking because it was very</span> <span data-start="760.39" data-end="763.3">professionally done we approached him</span> <span data-start="763.3" data-end="765.67">and after a few hours of negotiations he</span> <span data-start="765.67" data-end="767.59">surrendered and told us all about how he</span> <span data-start="767.59" data-end="770.05">did it and he even sent us all the code</span> <span data-start="770.05" data-end="773.74">and a lot of comments on our code which</span> <span data-start="773.74" data-end="778.75">was very hard to read so he was able to</span> <span data-start="778.75" data-end="780.85">like draw arbitrary buffers with paint</span> <span data-start="780.85" data-end="783.46">and this is from his coat various like</span> <span data-start="783.46" data-end="787.26">neatly organized his name in a proper</span> <span data-start="787.26" data-end="791.769">two-dimensional array</span> <span data-start="791.779" data-end="794.269">he wrote the whole rendering service</span> <span data-start="794.269" data-end="796.91">that was running on his computer that's</span> <span data-start="796.91" data-end="799.73">pumped our server with paint blob events</span> <span data-start="799.73" data-end="803.209">and enabled him to do this so he was</span> <span data-start="803.209" data-end="806.66">like rendering on a rendering server on</span> <span data-start="806.66" data-end="809.18">a rendering server because we all like</span> <span data-start="809.18" data-end="814.37">rendering servers right but we made it</span> <span data-start="814.37" data-end="817.939">harder for him we just increased the</span> <span data-start="817.939" data-end="821.93">race rate limiting a bit and added some</span> <span data-start="821.93" data-end="825.98">extra throttling and without degrading</span> <span data-start="825.98" data-end="828.529">the experience of the normal non</span> <span data-start="828.529" data-end="833.839">spamming user and this fight was ongoing</span> <span data-start="833.839" data-end="839.139">throughout the duration of the display</span> <span data-start="839.139" data-end="842.959">he also was able to avoid because the</span> <span data-start="842.959" data-end="848.059">paint leaks and if you draw something it</span> <span data-start="848.059" data-end="851.23">won't stay there forever because it gets</span> <span data-start="851.23" data-end="854.389">the paint leaks and somebody else paints</span> <span data-start="854.389" data-end="857.3">over it but he added the skewing factor</span> <span data-start="857.3" data-end="862.939">he could tune to his taste too yet to be</span> <span data-start="862.939" data-end="866.149">able to create like very straight images</span> <span data-start="866.149" data-end="874.93">and then we added random noise to it to</span> <span data-start="874.93" data-end="879.019">decrease the resolution of what this</span> <span data-start="879.019" data-end="883.519">hacker was able to draw and this is</span> <span data-start="883.519" data-end="885.62">still in the code you see it if you if</span> <span data-start="885.62" data-end="890">you press the half power if you if you</span> <span data-start="890" data-end="893.23">splat paint you can see that it</span> <span data-start="893.23" data-end="896.48">dominates enter like yeah it doesn't</span> <span data-start="896.48" data-end="898.67">come exactly in the center of where you</span> <span data-start="898.67" data-end="904.67">clicked and also it's totally on concept</span> <span data-start="904.67" data-end="906.259">because it's plotting paint like with</span> <span data-start="906.259" data-end="912.21">with some paint plot that's very</span> <span data-start="912.22" data-end="918.369">unprecedent</span> <span data-start="918.379" data-end="920.54">if you spend some time in Iceland you</span> <span data-start="920.54" data-end="921.889">quickly learn that the weather here is</span> <span data-start="921.889" data-end="924.47">quite unpredictable</span> <span data-start="924.47" data-end="926.209">and when we did this the first time</span> <span data-start="926.209" data-end="929.39">which was in 2016 there was basically a</span> <span data-start="929.39" data-end="931.43">crazy storm throughout the whole time it</span> <span data-start="931.43" data-end="935.12">was up and that was a great way to show</span> <span data-start="935.12" data-end="936.77">off the feature that you know we were</span> <span data-start="936.77" data-end="939.05">using the wind force and wind direction</span> <span data-start="939.05" data-end="943.91">to to render so we just looked on the</span> <span data-start="943.91" data-end="945.44">bright side there weren't a lot of</span> <span data-start="945.44" data-end="948.32">people like outside trying a lot more</span> <span data-start="948.32" data-end="949.22">people on the Internet</span> <span data-start="949.22" data-end="952.399">but the year after we set it up again</span> <span data-start="952.399" data-end="955.1">and the weather was way better</span> <span data-start="955.1" data-end="958.13">just nice weather and almost no wind at</span> <span data-start="958.13" data-end="961.69">all which proved problematic because</span> <span data-start="961.69" data-end="963.83">every time there was absolutely no wind</span> <span data-start="963.83" data-end="967.07">our renters are requests because we were</span> <span data-start="967.07"

data-end="979.94">this happened like five minutes before</span> <span data-start="979.94" data-end="983.45">that happened and as you can see in this</span> <span data-start="983.45" data-end="986.839">picture here's the mayor in 2016 lots of</span> <span data-start="986.839" data-end="988.49">wind you can see his hair it's it's</span> <span data-start="988.49" data-end="992.57">crazy and 2017 this is like a frozen</span> <span data-start="992.57" data-end="995.36">under server absolutely no end and me</span> <span data-start="995.36" data-end="996.709">and alt or somewhere in the back having</span> <span data-start="996.709" data-end="1000.13">a panic attack but we somehow got</span> <span data-start="1000.13" data-end="1002.23">through the interview with like</span> <span data-start="1002.23" data-end="1004.12">demonstrating how this worked without it</span> <span data-start="1004.12" data-end="1006.88">actually working at all and nobody</span> <span data-start="1006.88" data-end="1009.73">seemed to notice which is a pretty good</span> <span data-start="1009.73" data-end="1014.68">thing yes we learnt a few lessons</span> <span data-start="1014.68" data-end="1018.82">through this whole process first being</span> <span data-start="1018.82" data-end="1022.17">that we should avoid at any means any</span> <span
