<p><span data-start="10.179" data-end="12.879">so I'm here to talk to you about</span> <span data-start="12.879" data-end="18.23">creating custom modules using Yui on how</span> <span data-start="18.23" data-end="21.47">to once we have it how to submit it to</span> <span data-start="21.47" data-end="26.81">the Yui gallery so yui so this is a Yui</span> <span data-start="26.81" data-end="33.44">3 this is the our new Yui instance and</span> <span data-start="33.44" data-end="35.6">it's pretty much everything that we need</span> <span data-start="35.6" data-end="39.199">in order to get going with Yui 3 it's a</span> <span data-start="39.199" data-end="41.03">self-contained function that it will</span> <span data-start="41.03" data-end="42.73">return soon instance of the why up dude</span> <span data-start="42.73" data-end="45.14">and it will provide like ass unboxing</span> <span data-start="45.14" data-end="49.039">for us to where we can start building</span> <span data-start="49.039" data-end="52.489">our modules it's a sign this way so you</span> <span data-start="52.489" data-end="54.71">can have multiple why you are instances</span> <span data-start="54.71" data-end="57.769">in the same page and your guarantee that</span> <span data-start="57.769" data-end="59.629">they won't be colliding with each other</span> <span data-start="59.629" data-end="64.01">so that way you can put as many things</span> <span data-start="64.01" data-end="66.47">you want without ever having to worried</span> <span data-start="66.47" data-end="69.53">that things might break up all you need</span> <span data-start="69.53" data-end="71.78">is to include the script on your page</span> <span data-start="71.78" data-end="76.19">and you're good to go so with that we'll</span> <span data-start="76.19" data-end="81.47">talk about why you I add so why do I</span> <span data-start="81.47" data-end="84.65">that ad then you can include your the</span> <span data-start="84.65" data-end="85.79">name of the model you're going to be</span> <span data-start="85.79" data-end="88.27">writing full and then like I say you're</span> <span data-start="88.27" data-end="90.47">you get a call one for a callback</span> <span data-start="90.47" data-end="93.37">function with the why instance and then</span> <span data-start="93.37" data-end="96.35">you can start typing or everything you</span> <span data-start="96.35" data-end="98.27">need all your properties you just attach</span> <span data-start="98.27" data-end="100.52">to the wine instance your new module and</span> <span data-start="100.52" data-end="103.1">boom you're done so this is really all</span> <span data-start="103.1" data-end="108.74">it takes to create a Wi-Fi module you</span> <span data-start="108.74" data-end="111.02">can also name is place your module if</span> <span data-start="111.02" data-end="113.6">you need to by using the keyboard</span> <span data-start="113.6" data-end="117.02">namespace this case which is you know</span> <span data-start="117.02" data-end="120.65">creating space full bar and then we just</span> <span data-start="120.65" data-end="124.64">touch that to the Y instance we start</span> <span data-start="124.64" data-end="130.23">running all our code inside that</span> <span data-start="130.24" data-end="138.79">you could also do versioning so in this</span> <span data-start="138.79" data-end="142.87">case once we're done declaring</span> <span data-start="142.87" data-end="144.28">everything that we need to for our</span> <span data-start="144.28" data-end="146.17">module at the bow at the very bottom we</span> <span data-start="146.17" data-end="149.46">can pass an argument which is a</span> <span data-start="149.46" data-end="152.89">configuration I mean version this</span> <span data-start="152.89" data-end="154.72">version this number can be anything you</span> <span data-start="154.72" data-end="157.72">want has nothing to do the version of</span> <span data-start="157.72" data-end="160.66">the why object this is related to your</span> <span data-start="160.66" data-end="164.01">module and you can also specify</span> <span data-start="164.01" data-end="166.27">requirements that you module my needs so</span> <span data-start="166.27" data-end="167.68">you know in this case i'm specifying</span> <span data-start="167.68" data-end="170.2">that full it's gonna need the node</span> <span data-start="170.2" data-end="173.35">module and this was what's going to do</span> <span data-start="173.35" data-end="175.39">is once once we include foo in the page</span> <span data-start="175.39" data-end="177.75">it's going to also include note for us</span> <span data-start="177.75" data-end="180.46">automatically behind the scenes three</span> <span data-start="180.46" data-end="185.4">powerful stuff but also we can we can</span> <span data-start="185.4" data-end="187.36">make our model a little bit more</span> <span data-start="187.36" data-end="190.12">interesting by augmenting yui base so</span> <span data-start="190.12" data-end="192.34">why do I base provides a standard</span> <span data-start="192.34" data-end="194.41">template for us to create a set of</span> <span data-start="194.41" data-end="197.07">modules that are gramma consistence are</span> <span data-start="197.07" data-end="201.37">along the way but it's going to do that</span> <span data-start="201.37" data-end="203.92">by giving us like a name property it's</span> <span data-start="203.92" data-end="206.53">also going to provide us an attribute</span> <span data-start="206.53" data-end="210.46">properly it's going to extend event so</span> <span data-start="210.46" data-end="211.87">we're going to have all the goodies of</span> <span data-start="211.87" data-end="215.14">hobby custom event on our module it's</span> <span data-start="215.14" data-end="216.58">going to provide unique methods on the</span> <span data-start="216.58" data-end="221.08">stray methods are so that are very</span> <span data-start="221.08" data-end="223.08">important stuff if we want to make our</span> <span data-start="223.08" data-end="225.64">application to be a little more</span> <span data-start="225.64" data-end="227.92">sophisticated and also easy to easier to</span> <span data-start="227.92" data-end="232.63">scale so attributes are like I say it's</span> <span data-start="232.63" data-end="234.1">just going to give us a consistent API</span> <span data-start="234.1" data-end="235.72">and on the communications and sort of</span> <span data-start="235.72" data-end="237.94">like a blueprints of how your arteries</span> <span data-start="237.94" data-end="239.71">are going to be hey Ilan along the way</span> <span data-start="239.71" data-end="242.89">through your or your application it's</span> <span data-start="242.89" data-end="244.21">going to have built-in setters and</span> <span data-start="244.21" data-end="246.85">getters for us so that way and we can</span> <span data-start="246.85" data-end="249.34">modify them as we need them to do</span> <span data-start="249.34" data-end="251.98">whatever we need them to do it's going</span> <span data-start="251.98" data-end="255.07">to provide a name spacing and I'll see</span> <span data-start="255.07" data-end="256.81">ya so everything going to be talking</span> <span data-start="256.81" data-end="259">about you can also refer to the</span> <span data-start="259" data-end="260.799">documentation developer de yahoo that</span> <span data-start="260.799" data-end="263.47">comment / Yui but let me show you an</span> <span data-start="263.47" data-end="263.98">example</span> <span data-start="263.98" data-end="267.73">um so going back to our full a module</span> <span data-start="267.73" data-end="273.25">here we're going to create our class</span> <span data-start="273.25" data-end="275.32">right now we're our base class object</span> <span data-start="275.32" data-end="279.85">and then we're going to augment it with</span> <span data-start="279.85" data-end="282.25">the name propria and now my class is</span> <span data-start="282.25" data-end="284.17">going to have my name right whatever you</span> <span data-start="284.17" data-end="287.2">want it to be we can also like I say use</span> <span data-start="287.2" data-end="289.96">the attributes propri to declare all the</span> <span data-start="289.96" data-end="291.85">attributes our class is going to have by</span> <span data-start="291.85" data-end="295.06">default and then once once we're done</span> <span data-start="295.06" data-end="297.58">then all we need to do is just we're</span> <span data-start="297.58" data-end="301.18">going to extend our class with why that</span> <span data-start="301.18" data-end="303.49">base and then automatically as we do</span> <span data-start="303.49" data-end="308.14">that everything is going to be all the</span> <span data-start="308.14" data-end="309.91">preparation of bays are going to be put</span> <span data-start="309.91" data-end="313.6">into my class attributes event I'm so</span> <span data-start="313.6" data-end="316.51">that way we really have a module with a</span> <span data-start="316.51" data-end="319">feeling lines of code a model is ready</span> <span data-start="319" data-end="321.73">to go that can do all these cool things</span> <span data-start="321.73" data-end="326.92">like events right so by doing that we</span> <span data-start="326.92" data-end="329.08">get for free custom events we get bubble</span> <span data-start="329.08" data-end="334.48">event even I then broadcast them so in</span> <span data-start="334.48" data-end="336.4">this case right if we were to create a</span> <span data-start="336.4" data-end="338.56">cloud we had a class called goonie and</span> <span data-start="338.56" data-end="342.55">then we are going to associate a method</span> <span data-start="342.55" data-end="345.25">that says never say that okay and then</span> <span data-start="345.25" data-end="348.43">what we want to do is I want this event</span> <span data-start="348.43" data-end="350.29">never see that happens we're going to</span> <span data-start="350.29" data-end="353.14">fight when I broadcast say hey you know</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="353.14" data-end="356.41">I've been called let everyone everyone</span> <span data-start="356.41" data-end="359.91">that's subscribing to me listen you know</span> <span data-start="359.91" data-end="364.99">so here when we get our object my goonie</span> <span data-start="364.99" data-end="369.19">we can subscribe to to the event never</span> <span data-start="369.19" data-end="371.89">say die and once this guy's fire we're</span> <span data-start="371.89" data-end="375.99">going to be alert and hey you guys so</span> <span data-start="375.99" data-end="379.33">cool thing or one thing you you you want</span> <span data-start="379.33" data-end="380.83">to notice is that we actually isn't</span> <span data-start="380.83" data-end="383.53">listening for goonie column never say</span> <span data-start="383.53" data-end="386.35">die because why you are based give you</span> <span data-start="386.35" data-end="388.57">the name is spacing that we talked about</span> <span data-start="388.57" data-end="391.9">with the name attribute so this way it's</span> <span data-start="391.9" data-end="394.84">easy to have multiple broadcasting</span> <span data-start="394.84" data-end="396.64">events on the same on the page on your</span> <span data-start="396.64" data-end="397.72">module</span> <span data-start="397.72" data-end="402.6">by just declaring the name attribute</span> <span data-start="402.6" data-end="404.53">trickles out yeah you can you can</span> <span data-start="404.53" data-end="408.4">probably learn more about events and Yui</span> <span data-start="408.4" data-end="409.87">based on the documentation just want to</span> <span data-start="409.87" data-end="412.87">go over through the main stuff but I</span> <span data-start="412.87" data-end="416.02">don't want to extend tonight so once</span> <span data-start="416.02" data-end="417.85">we're done with our modules right what</span> <span data-start="417.85" data-end="419.68">do how do we include them in the page</span> <span data-start="419.68" data-end="422.5">right we you know we really worked on it</span> <span data-start="422.5" data-end="424.45">and it's ready to go how do we load it</span> <span data-start="424.45" data-end="426.85">well this is several ways you can load</span> <span data-start="426.85" data-end="430.15">our modern Yui 3 first one is by</span> <span data-start="430.15" data-end="433.06">inclusion so let's say we have the</span> <span data-start="433.06" data-end="434.95">simple really simple module today right</span> <span data-start="434.95" data-end="437.68">that all it does it just told us what</span> <span data-start="437.68" data-end="440.92">days today so if we were to use that</span> <span data-start="440.92" data-end="443.52">module then we're going to be using the</span> <span data-start="443.52" data-end="447.22">keyword use we're going to include our</span> <span data-start="447.22" data-end="451.48">two-day module and then what's going to</span> <span data-start="451.48" data-end="453.4">happen is why instance is going to have</span> <span data-start="453.4" data-end="459.16">all of this ready for us to you so in</span> <span data-start="459.16" data-end="462.58">this case I'm also requiring note so at</span> <span data-start="462.58" data-end="464.83">this point today I know our being</span> <span data-start="464.83" data-end="466.3">loading the page so i can use all the</span> <span data-start="466.3" data-end="470.26">notes all the cool knows stuff so why</span> <span data-start="470.26" data-end="472.93">don't one when it's going to get a</span> <span data-start="472.93" data-end="476.169">reference to an element with the ID one</span> <span data-start="476.169" data-end="478.15">and then we're going to set the content</span> <span data-start="478.15" data-end="482.169">to today's date really simple way to use</span> <span data-start="482.169" data-end="484.57">to load your models on the page if you</span> <span data-start="484.57" data-end="487.54">have you can compare concatenated</span> <span data-start="487.54" data-end="489.79">everything together or or you can put in</span> <span data-start="489.79" data-end="492.63">the script tag on top wherever you want</span> <span data-start="492.63" data-end="495.19">you could also pass a configuration</span> <span data-start="495.19" data-end="496.75">object when you're loading your modules</span> <span data-start="496.75" data-end="501.1">are so to the Yui function you can you</span> <span data-start="501.1" data-end="503.61">can pass a module configuration object</span> <span data-start="503.61" data-end="506.83">with the name of your module the path to</span> <span data-start="506.83" data-end="509.83">where the new model is hosted and all</span> <span data-start="509.83" data-end="514.45">and all the requirements are so this is</span> <span data-start="514.45" data-end="516.219">this Way's all of a more advanced but if</span> <span data-start="516.219" data-end="518.08">you need to you can you can use it they</span> <span data-start="518.08" data-end="520.63">prefer way it just is why do I use it</span> <span data-start="520.63" data-end="522.839">just takes care of everything for you</span> <span data-start="522.839" data-end="526.24">but then again at this point y will be</span> <span data-start="526.24" data-end="529.58">ready with everything you specify here</span> <span data-start="529.58" data-end="532.91">pretty simple gets you up up and running</span> <span data-start="532.91" data-end="536.48">through it pretty fast this day said</span> <span data-start="536.48"
