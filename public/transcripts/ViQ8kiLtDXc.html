data-end="411.009">up with all of these functions right all</span> <span data-start="411.009" data-end="412.57">right so now let's talk about this thing</span> <span data-start="412.57" data-end="416.229">right here what is that well it's seen</span> <span data-start="416.229" data-end="418.3">all the execution stack after it and it</span> <span data-start="418.3" data-end="420.46">could potentially resume evaluation when</span> <span data-start="420.46" data-end="425.44">invoked what do we call that anyone what</span> <span data-start="425.44" data-end="427.87">do we call that it's called a</span> <span data-start="427.87" data-end="430.21">continuation exactly so basically a</span> <span data-start="430.21" data-end="431.919">continuation is basically you're running</span> <span data-start="431.919" data-end="434.409">some code and you stop right and you you</span> <span data-start="434.409" data-end="435.789">have some sort of object

data-end="461.499">concept for everyone but they're we've</span> <span data-start="461.499" data-end="463.419">seen them before does anyone know what</span> <span data-start="463.419"

data-end="497.319">very similar and they should because in</span> <span data-start="497.319" data-end="498.459">the first in it you're passing it</span> <span data-start="498.459" data-end="499.869">basically in a right ah it's an</span> <span data-start="499.869" data-end="501.279">arguments object I know but it's</span> <span data-start="501.279" data-end="502.779">basically

<span data-start="508.569" data-end="510.219">things well arrays are fast streams are</span> <span data-start="510.219" data-end="512.86">small you know when you usually have</span> <span

data-end="520.75">so what ends up happening is you have to</span> <span data-start="520.75" data-end="522.219">handle these huge bodies that's bad for</span> <span data-start="522.219" data-end="523.75">memory so arrays are fast cuz you've</span> <span data-start="523.75" data-end="524.889">accessed everything's already in memory</span> <span data-start="524.889" data-end="526.72">but streams are small small is important</span> <span data-start="526.72" data-end="527.74">because small means a small memory</span> <span data-start="527.74" data-end="529.899">footprint so arrays are eager everything</span> <span data-start="529.899" data-end="531.699">has to be there once dreams are lazy you</span> <span data-start="531.699" data-end="533.589">can kind of get it over time whether run</span> <span data-start="533.589" data-end="535.24">is called immediately synchronously</span> <span data-start="535.24" data-end="536.829">after a rather clean up is called</span> <span data-start="536.829" data-end="538.6">immediately asynchrony after run or like</span> <span data-start="538.6" data-end="540.16">five minutes later does not matter as</span> <span data-start="540.16" data-end="542.41">long as that state is preserved it's a</span> <span data-start="542.41" data-end="544.149">raise or sink they're all their streams</span> <span data-start="544.149" data-end="546.279">are but does they do not have to be but</span> <span data-start="546.279" data-end="548.439">they can be a sink so that's kind of an</span> <span data-start="548.439" data-end="549.639">important thing and that's it that's</span> <span data-start="549.639" data-end="551.889">back okay so what's the upshot from this</span> <span data-start="551.889" data-end="555.49">well I've developed a framework called</span> <span data-start="555.49" data-end="557.139">fab which basically takes care of that</span> <span data-start="557.139" data-end="558.97">that kind of exploits this kind of</span> <span data-start="558.97" data-end="562.209">streaming and so basically it love</span> <span data-start="562.209" data-end="564.04">functions it's a functional framework</span> <span data-start="564.04" data-end="566.35">and so it's basically originally modeled</span> <span data-start="566.35" data-end="568.2">on jquery</span> <span data-start="568.2" data-end="569.73">this is not true anymore but basically</span> <span data-start="569.73" data-end="571.71">what I looked at you know you know</span> <span data-start="571.71" data-end="573.9">jQuery is traversing over the Dom we</span> <span data-start="573.9" data-end="580.35">have routing / URLs yes oh really sorry</span> <span data-start="580.35" data-end="582.36">all right anyway any questions thank you</span> <span data-start="582.36" data-end="586.84">for that every to that any questions I</span> <span data-start="586.85" data-end="590.19">feel like I've been scolded by my German</span> <span data-start="590.19" data-end="595.89">school teacher so my mom told me to slow</span> <span data-start="595.89" data-end="599.13">down dude tragedy where he was where he</span> <span data-start="599.13" data-end="601.56">would traverse over Dom you route / URLs</span> <span data-start="601.56" data-end="604.8">where you would manipulate a Dom you</span> <span data-start="604.8" data-end="606.99">respond to calls to your web server</span> <span data-start="606.99" data-end="608.37">where you would have UI events you have</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="608.37" data-end="610.11">HTTP verbs so I'm like that's kind of</span> <span data-start="610.11" data-end="611.87">cool map so let's take this you ah this</span> <span data-start="611.87" data-end="614.78">dsl you guys already know probably</span> <span data-start="614.78" data-end="616.95">unless you're Rebecca and then you would</span> <span data-start="616.95" data-end="620.07">replace it just kidding scoop you would</span> <span data-start="620.07" data-end="621.27">replace it with this it's like these are</span> <span data-start="621.27" data-end="622.71">come on the same thing right and so I</span> <span data-start="622.71" data-end="624.63">was like that's kind of cool cool thing</span> <span data-start="624.63" data-end="625.83">so that's how fab started there is</span> <span data-start="625.83" data-end="628.77">actually fab is find and bind because I</span> <span data-start="628.77" data-end="630.87">basically co-opted those two jquery</span> <span data-start="630.87" data-end="634.77">methods all right so but jquery wasn't</span> <span data-start="634.77" data-end="635.76">really cutting it for me didn't really</span> <span data-start="635.76" data-end="637.97">match right jquery have this huge DOM</span> <span data-start="637.97" data-end="641.37">everything is synchronous you know in</span> <span data-start="641.37" data-end="643.77">terms of manipulating the chain I like</span> <span data-start="643.77" data-end="644.64">the chain but I didn't like the</span> <span data-start="644.64" data-end="647.25">synchrony so I got inspiration somewhere</span> <span data-start="647.25" data-end="652.59">else and that was UNIX so unix chaining</span> <span data-start="652.59" data-end="655.56">basically looks like this right so I'm</span> <span data-start="655.56" data-end="657.03">not a UNIX guy I'm just kind of faking</span> <span data-start="657.03" data-end="659.46">it here but the idea is that you know</span> <span data-start="659.46" data-end="661.47">every every little program you have as</span> <span data-start="661.47" data-end="663.57">an input as an output right and so</span> <span data-start="663.57" data-end="665.34">that's really cool for frameworks if you</span> <span data-start="665.34" data-end="666.39">look for the frameworks that are really</span> <span data-start="666.39" data-end="667.74">cool like for example look where rails</span> <span data-start="667.74" data-end="669.36">went look we're so not sure when they</span> <span data-start="669.36" data-end="671.85">all went to rack right because rack is</span> <span data-start="671.85" data-end="673.5">good for middle where everyone's going</span> <span data-start="673.5" data-end="675.12">to middle where it makes sense the thing</span> <span data-start="675.12" data-end="677.43">about fab the entire thing is middle</span> <span data-start="677.43" data-end="679.44">where you saw those streaming functions</span> <span data-start="679.44" data-end="682.2">fab uses that and those basically every</span> <span data-start="682.2" data-end="685.23">function every app is middleware that</span> <span data-start="685.23" data-end="686.94">operates on a stream even the app</span> <span data-start="686.94" data-end="689.01">definition itself there's no difference</span> <span data-start="689.01" data-end="693.24">between a app and a response a app is</span> <span data-start="693.24" data-end="694.5">just a response that hasn't been</span> <span data-start="694.5" data-end="696.27">evaluated completely yet right so you</span> <span data-start="696.27" data-end="697.62">stream things some of those things are</span> <span data-start="697.62" data-end="698.62">functions that you would then</span> <span data-start="698.62" data-end="701.05">later so there were a bunch of things</span> <span data-start="701.05" data-end="705.06">how am i doing that time i doing okay</span> <span data-start="705.06" data-end="709.02">1230 i started 20 15 I can do okay I</span> <span data-start="709.02" data-end="711.55">want boilerplate I want to keep it as</span> <span data-start="711.55" data-end="713.68">small as possible I want it to be</span> <span data-start="713.68" data-end="715.66">natural nope no compilation step I</span> <span data-start="715.66" data-end="717.55">wanted to be JavaScript I don't want to</span> <span data-start="717.55" data-end="718.99">write some other language some franken</span> <span data-start="718.99" data-end="720.97">language I want it to be consistent I</span> <span data-start="720.97" data-end="722.89">don't want you know like kind of</span> <span data-start="722.89" data-end="723.91">different classes of things I want</span> <span data-start="723.91" data-end="725.56">everything to be a function I want it to</span> <span data-start="725.56" data-end="728.14">be clean no global pollution an</span> <span data-start="728.14" data-end="729.94">ambiguous no mandatory magic the first</span> <span data-start="729.94" data-end="732.28">thing frameworks do to solve an abstract</span> <span data-start="732.28" data-end="733.72">away problem is give you all these likes</span> <span data-start="733.72" data-end="736.36">play methods everywhere that make it</span> <span data-start="736.36" data-end="737.92">really easy to pick up but really hard</span> <span data-start="737.92" data-end="739.51">to scale I want to avoid that so if</span> <span data-start="739.51" data-end="741.58">you're this magic it's yours no shared</span> <span data-start="741.58" data-end="742.69">state that's obviously a functional</span> <span data-start="742.69" data-end="744.13">programming thing can't be synchronous</span> <span data-start="744.13" data-end="746.59">of course very low side effect ver gala</span> <span data-start="746.59" data-end="748.45">therrien I don't like the system of well</span> <span data-start="748.45" data-end="749.95">there's apps and then there's your</span> <span data-start="749.95" data-end="751.87">plugins I want those all to be on the</span> <span data-start="751.87" data-end="753.37">same level and I want it to be</span> <span data-start="753.37" data-end="755.17">composable so you should be able to</span> <span data-start="755.17" data-end="756.46">create apps and those apps should go</span> <span data-start="756.46" data-end="759.16">into other apps so fab is two things</span> <span data-start="759.16" data-end="761.83">okay the first thing is fab as a pattern</span> <span data-start="761.83" data-end="765.19">every single fab app every single one</span> <span data-start="765.19" data-end="769.63">looks like this okay take a while for</span> <span data-start="769.63" data-end="771.07">this decision it's really not that hard</span> <span data-start="771.07" data-end="772.96">basically the idea is you have a</span> <span data-start="772.96" data-end="774.46">function every function the first thing</span> <span data-start="774.46" data-end="776.44">it does it takes a call back that's the</span> <span data-start="776.44" data-end="777.25">function it's going to write it to</span> <span data-start="777.25" data-end="779.47">answer to okay then it returns another</span> <span data-start="779.47" data-end="781.6">function that is going to listen to</span> <span data-start="781.6" data-end="783.7">everything they come subsequently right</span> <span data-start="783.7" data-end="786.19">until it hears nothing right and then</span> <span data-start="786.19" data-end="788.08">it's like okay I'm done so usually what</span> <span data-start="788.08" data-end="789.91">happens at this end step you here at</span> <span data-start="789.91" data-end="791.2">they see right there it'll actually</span> <span data-start="791.2" data-end="793.96">return the original right function</span> <span data-start="793.96" data-end="796.39">passed in 1st right when it sees the end</span> <span data-start="796.39" data-end="799.33">it gives control back to whatever was</span> <span data-start="799.33" data-end="801.34">before it does that make sense the idea</span> <span data-start="801.34" data-end="803.2">here is you're using callbacks to pass</span> <span data-start="803.2" data-end="806.41">data asynchronously and you're using</span> <span data-start="806.41" data-end="809.62">return to pass control synchronously</span> <span data-start="809.62" data-end="811.33">right so you're passing control</span> <span data-start="811.33" data-end="813.79">synchronously and so fab is also a</span> <span data-start="813.79" data-end="816.16">library right so it's basically a</span> <span data-start="816.16" data-end="817.6">library of just all of its a flat</span> <span data-start="817.6" data-end="818.83">library if you go actually the git</span> <span data-start="818.83" data-end="820.27">repository it's literally just a flat</span> <span data-start="820.27" data-end="821.62">list of all of these functions there's</span> <span data-start="821.62" data-end="823.63">no hierarchy at all each one could be</span> <span data-start="823.63" data-end="825.46">put anywhere so what are these video</span> <span data-start="825.46" data-end="826.75">notes these libraries so like I really</span> <span data-start="826.75" data-end="828.31">like this units philosophy of keeping it</span> <span data-start="828.31" data-end="830.49">small so literally f</span> <span data-start="830.49" data-end="832.2">zipping which you know only is to show</span> <span data-start="832.2" data-end="834.57">not so much how small it is but I think</span> <span data-start="834.57" data-end="835.62">it's the most canonical way of</span> <span data-start="835.62" data-end="837.06">representing of sorry comparing two</span> <span data-start="837.06" data-end="838.98">libraries this is the size of each of</span> <span data-start="838.98" data-end="840.33">these functions each of these apps I</span> <span data-start="840.33" data-end="842.58">mean this is one of the few frameworks</span> <span data-start="842.58" data-end="844.529">that you actually might even you know</span> <span data-start="844.529" data-end="846.839">enter json' cake probably not you would</span> <span data-start="846.839" data-end="848.01">probably takes a bunch stuff out of it</span> <span data-start="848.01" data-end="851.22">but everything is very small and so I</span> <span data-start="851.22" data-end="853.23">guess the only thing left to do given</span> <span data-start="853.23" data-end="856.35">that I didn't complete my slides</span> <span data-start="856.35" data-end="859.02">entirely is to show you how it works and</span> <span data-start="859.02" data-end="860.04">so there's going to be some live coding</span> <span data-start="860.04" data-end="861.24">addition we're going to build a nap</span> <span data-start="861.24" data-end="862.709">right here so I'm going to roll up my</span> <span data-start="862.709" data-end="865.32">sleeves and we're going to switch over</span> <span data-start="865.32" data-end="867.99">to text Wrangler because that's how I</span> <span data-start="867.99" data-end="872.55">roll any questions well I'm really gonna</span> <span data-start="872.55" data-end="874.579">sleep</span> <span data-start="874.579" data-end="876.329">alright cool let's get out of this</span> <span data-start="876.329" data-end="881.76">keynote hell okay cool here is a text</span> <span data-start="881.76" data-end="884.1">editor okay cool so what does it look</span> <span data-start="884.1" data-end="886.5">like well it looks like this everything</span> <span data-start="886.5" data-end="887.82">is nap every app is on the same level</span> <span data-start="887.82" data-end="889.11">including your rep you know like a lot</span> <span data-start="889.11" data-end="890.399">of times you would have a library and</span> <span data-start="890.399" data-end="891.81">you would have an app and the app</span> <span data-start="891.81" data-end="893.7">requires the library and it does it's</span> <span data-start="893.7" data-end="895.35">tough the thing is your apps are also</span> <span data-start="895.35" data-end="897.089">libraries right everything's gonna wear</span> <span data-start="897.089" data-end="898.829">so basically everything is looks the</span> <span data-start="898.829" data-end="903.75">same so we're going to use this yeah I'm</span> <span data-start="903.75" data-end="905.39">sorry I should really fix up man</span> <span data-start="905.39" data-end="907.649">everything here on my screen it's like</span> <span data-start="907.649" data-end="911.79">weirdly fat like I'm looking at Sun woo</span> <span data-start="911.79" data-end="917.7">music video hold on it's that it's that</span> <span data-start="917.7" data-end="919.35">ok that's probably a little small but</span> <span data-start="919.35" data-end="923.97">we'll see what it work it's a so far ok</span> <span data-start="923.97" data-end="927.029">um alright so you've seen this pattern</span> <span data-start="927.029" data-end="928.35">before I'm not a huge fan of this to be</span> <span data-start="928.35" data-end="933.199">honest function</span> <span data-start="933.209" data-end="937.8">um alright cool so exports because we're</span> <span data-start="937.8" data-end="939.99">going to basically co-opt exports should</span> <span data-start="939.99" data-end="941.579">be asynchronous it should be a function</span> <span data-start="941.579" data-end="943.11">it shouldn't be assigning something</span> <span data-start="943.11" data-end="945.689">honestly not a fan but whatever I will</span> <span data-start="945.689" data-end="947.369">yield for that system and implement it</span> <span data-start="947.369" data-end="950.61">myself so basically we're going to do</span> <span data-start="950.61" data-end="953.429">this we're going to return exports and</span> <span data-start="953.429" data-end="955.019">we're gonna call it with our app what</span> <span data-start="955.019" data-end="956.309">are we going to do well it's just going</span> <span data-start="956.309" data-end="958.889">to say hello ok cool that's a wrap all</span> <span data-start="958.889" data-end="961.05">right you can really start small it's</span> <span data-start="961.05" data-end="963.059">not a huge thing right so all this app</span> <span data-start="963.059" data-end="964.35">gets is this exports thing and it just</span> <span data-start="964.35" data-end="965.67">so basically gets a pipe and you're</span> <span data-start="965.67" data-end="967.759">right to it ok cool so if we ran this</span> <span data-start="967.759" data-end="979.35">hello that I want to see that ok we just</span> <span data-start="979.35" data-end="980.999">ran a nap all right you see what happen</span> <span data-start="980.999" data-end="983.639">yay that's cool right so fab is not</span> <span data-start="983.639" data-end="985.67">necessarily a web framework if thank you</span> <span data-start="985.67" data-end="988.17">fab is not necessarily a web framework</span> <span data-start="988.17" data-end="989.999">right at web is just a part of it so</span> <span data-start="989.999" data-end="993.119">let's actually do some web and to do</span> <span data-start="993.119" data-end="996.059">that we gotta we gotta imports and stuff</span> <span data-start="996.059" data-end="998.369">and again same thing I don't think</span> <span data-start="998.369" data-end="999.72">require should be synchronous and it</span> <span data-start="999.72" data-end="1001.369">requires a synchronous but you know a</span> <span data-start="1001.369" data-end="1002.48">lot of people who are much smarter than</span> <span data-start="1002.48" data-end="1005.24">me disagree so that's ok but I'm gonna</span> <span data-start="1005.24" data-end="1008.42">do it myself so basically you get two</span> <span data-start="1008.42" data-end="1010.309">things here actually i lied one is</span> <span data-start="1010.309"

data-end="1014.36">think I don't want a synchronous</span> <span data-start="1014.36" data-end="1015.74">necessarily because I need it to be</span> <span data-start="1015.74" data-end="1017.839">somewhere else in Bangladesh when I get</span> <span data-start="1017.839" data-end="1019.459">the file I just want to use one API for</span> <span data-start="1019.459" data-end="1021.519">everything that's why I believe in</span> <span data-start="1021.519" data-end="1024.529">asynchronous this thing is really feel</span> <span data-start="1024.529" data-end="1031.169">like a Backstreet Boy alright cool so</span> <span data-start="1031.179" data-end="1035.529">almost you almost had me so let's import</span> <span data-start="1035.529" data-end="1040.1">stuff we're gonna use function not</span> <span data-start="1040.1" data-end="1042.589">function this time alright cool so let's</span> <span data-start="1042.589" data-end="1047.24">put this in your yay ok so that's that's</span> <span data-start="1047.24" data-end="1048.77">actually does the same exact thing which</span> <span data-start="1048.77" data-end="1050.09">is imported nothing in this case right</span> <span data-start="1050.09" data-end="1052.399">so now we're going to import let's see</span> <span data-start="1052.399" data-end="1055.179">well what do we need to run a web server</span> <span data-start="1055.179" data-end="1057.289">we need like a listener well first of</span> <span data-start="1057.289" data-end="1058.52">all we need to actually run this</span> <span data-start="1058.52" data-end="1059.51">function this actually is not running</span> <span data-start="1059.51" data-end="1060.77">it's just literally sending something</span> <span data-start="1060.77" data-end="1061.88">right so we're in need something called</span> <span data-start="1061.88" data-end="1064.46">run we're also going to need a no</span> <span data-start="1064.46" data-end="1067.01">no listen right because basically we</span> <span data-start="1067.01" data-end="1068.09">want note to be able to listen to stuff</span> <span data-start="1068.09" data-end="1069.44">this is a huge hack by the way I love</span> <span data-start="1069.44" data-end="1070.85">this do you guys know what's going on</span> <span data-start="1070.85" data-end="1073.1">here I'm basically taking your call and</span> <span data-start="1073.1" data-end="1074.9">this is optional so don't get too upset</span> <span data-start="1074.9" data-end="1076.97">about it I'm basically taking your call</span> <span data-start="1076.97" data-end="1078.8">back and to stringing it and sucking out</span> <span data-start="1078.8" data-end="1080.84">your arguments and looking at those</span> <span data-start="1080.84" data-end="1083.09">strings then going required myself but</span> <span data-start="1083.09" data-end="1084.83">that's totally optional after right here</span> <span data-start="1084.83" data-end="1086.63">you could put arguments and do it</span> <span data-start="1086.63" data-end="1089.48">explicitly but i think it's myself ok</span> <span data-start="1089.48" data-end="1090.92">cool so now what we're going to do is</span> <span data-start="1090.92" data-end="1093.04">they're actually going to return run and</span> <span data-start="1093.04" data-end="1095.27">then so run basically just evaluate the</span> <span data-start="1095.27" data-end="1097.16">stream and so the first thing we do here</span> <span data-start="1097.16" data-end="1100.39">in the stream is we do node oops sorry</span> <span data-start="1100.39" data-end="1103.94">jquery sorry node listen we're going to</span> <span data-start="1103.94" data-end="1109.17">listen on a port my favorite port</span> <span data-start="1109.18"

data-end="1123.07">the standard out so we're actually leave</span> <span data-start="1123.07" data-end="1124.84">that blank and then so we have this</span> <span data-start="1124.84" data-end="1125.74">thing here and this is kind of cool</span> <span data-start="1125.74" data-end="1127.09">because it looks like Marco but it's not</span> <span data-start="1127.09" data-end="1129.76">it's pure JavaScript and so we're gonna</span> <span data-start="1129.76" data-end="1142.69">run this hello yay web server oh alright</span> <span data-start="1142.69" data-end="1143.89">cool and this is actually going to get a</span> <span data-start="1143.89" data-end="1146.41">little bit messy so I think what I'm</span> <span data-start="1146.41"

data-end="1159.04">library of these tiny functions so</span> <span data-start="1159.04" data-end="1160.81">what's the first thing you want to do in</span> <span data-start="1160.81" data-end="1163.78">a web framework we have okay with web</span> <span data-start="1163.78" data-end="1165.16">servers just returning hello what else</span> <span data-start="1165.16"

data-end="1179.41">like I don't want to create a lot again</span> <span data-start="1179.41" data-end="1180.64">what am I claims about these web</span> <span data-start="1180.64" data-end="1181.78">frameworks is they all create like their</span> <span data-start="1181.78" data-end="1183.37">own special syntax you have a syntax for</span> <span data-start="1183.37" data-end="1185.14">matching strings it's called red X ok</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1185.14" data-end="1188.53">Reeve that and so here's I'm going to do</span> <span data-start="1188.53" data-end="1190.3">I'm going to wrote and I'm going to do</span> <span

data-start="1199.38" data-end="1204.47">all right cool all right</span> <span data-start="1204.48" data-end="1207.09">right that's a block okay and then if it</span> <span data-start="1207.09" data-end="1211.29">doesn't match we will return not found</span> <span data-start="1211.29" data-end="1219.15">and that will status for oki all right</span> <span data-start="1219.15" data-end="1220.35">does everyone understand what's going on</span> <span data-start="1220.35" data-end="1224.549">here all right should be pretty easy it</span> <span data-start="1224.549" data-end="1227.37">looks to us I've invented this it looks</span> <span data-start="1227.37" data-end="1229.169">like it's indented it's it's not Python</span> <span data-start="1229.169" data-end="1231.39">indentation is meaningless each app is</span> <span data-start="1231.39" data-end="1233.22">responsible for knowing what happens</span> <span data-start="1233.22" data-end="1234.75">here's what Rupe does when root is</span> <span data-start="1234.75" data-end="1236.34">called it's like give me a stream give</span> <span data-start="1236.34" data-end="1237.66">me a stream give me a stream right</span> <span data-start="1237.66" data-end="1239.76">actually I did this wrong I Paul does</span> <span data-start="1239.76" data-end="1241.83">it's like give me a stream until it sees</span> <span data-start="1241.83" data-end="1246.24">stop this should be out here right until</span> <span data-start="1246.24" data-end="1248.46">it sees stop and then it says okay</span> <span data-start="1248.46" data-end="1249.9">everything that I just got in that</span> <span data-start="1249.9" data-end="1251.64">stream if it matches I'm going to I'm</span> <span data-start="1251.64" data-end="1253.29">going to reify that stream if it doesn't</span> <span data-start="1253.29" data-end="1254.4">match i'm going to refi the next dream</span> <span data-start="1254.4" data-end="1256.44">so if this worked properly what should</span> <span data-start="1256.44" data-end="1259.26">happen now when we read this oops

data-start="1263.97" data-end="1266.64">it not found okay is that cool they're</span> <span data-start="1266.64" data-end="1270.059">gonna get that really really all right</span> <span data-start="1270.059" data-end="1271.32">you want to see the source it's really</span> <span data-start="1271.32" data-end="1273.57">that bad it's earlier than others not so</span> <span data-start="1273.57" data-end="1280.59">bad so what does we do all right well</span> <span data-start="1280.59" data-end="1283.65">basically this is it we have something</span> <span data-start="1283.65" data-end="1284.94">called stream stream just basically</span> <span data-start="1284.94" data-end="1286.919">takes a stream and saves it you can</span> <span data-start="1286.919" data-end="1289.47">replay it later so get a stream we're</span> <span data-start="1289.47" data-end="1290.94">going to call that yes get another</span> <span data-start="1290.94" data-end="1292.02">stream we're going to call that no</span> <span data-start="1292.02" data-end="1294.48">return a nap right which is just a</span> <span data-start="1294.48" data-end="1297.12">function that gets evaluated that looks</span> <span data-start="1297.12" data-end="1299.25">for that URL if you have a pattern in</span> <span data-start="1299.25" data-end="1301.53">there it'll it'll capture that and store</span> <span data-start="1301.53" data-end="1303.75">that in the head and sorry like hit URL</span> <span data-start="1303.75" data-end="1306">that whatever and if not it'll actually</span> <span data-start="1306" data-end="1308.73">just keep it alittle just I'm sorry if</span> <span data-start="1308.73" data-end="1309.96">it doesn't match it'll go to the second</span> <span data-start="1309.96" data-end="1313.47">stream so going back here I guess we</span> <span data-start="1313.47" data-end="1316.23">have five minutes left so that worked</span> <span data-start="1316.23" data-end="1318.96">alright cool so we routed what else do</span> <span data-start="1318.96" data-end="1321.33">we do in a nap well let's for example if</span> <span data-start="1321.33" data-end="1323.91">we want to say like hello we wanted to</span> <span data-start="1323.91" data-end="1325.2">say like a name like if you want to say</span> <span data-start="1325.2" data-end="1327.27">hello mean you could capture something</span> <span data-start="1327.27" data-end="1329.16">there and so all that would look like is</span> <span data-start="1329.16" data-end="1333.81">basically</span> <span data-start="1333.82" data-end="1335.51">actually you know what let's do HTML</span> <span data-start="1335.51" data-end="1338.66">first HTML actually you know I'm going</span> <span data-start="1338.66" data-end="1339.5">to slide back because I'm only five</span> <span data-start="1339.5" data-end="1340.46">minutes left I'm going to tell you about</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1340.46" data-end="1343.97">HTML I have an HTML ideas about HTML</span> <span data-start="1343.97" data-end="1346.01">template is like the literally the</span> <span data-start="1346.01" data-end="1348.35">biggest thing and the node modules it's</span> <span data-start="1348.35" data-end="1349.61">like the biggest less after databases</span> <span data-start="1349.61" data-end="1350.78">right it's huge there's a zillion</span> <span data-start="1350.78" data-end="1352.04">templates and they all do it differently</span> <span data-start="1352.04" data-end="1355.25">and I'm not a huge fan of any of them so</span> <span data-start="1355.25" data-end="1357.41">i created my own it's called fab market</span> <span data-start="1357.41" data-end="1364.64">language and so all right so all right</span> <span data-start="1364.64" data-end="1365.96">so if you created a template what would</span> <span data-start="1365.96" data-end="1367.13">it look like mustache is awesome i</span> <span data-start="1367.13" data-end="1368.87">really like mustache a lot of like you</span> <span data-start="1368.87" data-end="1370.94">know the power of rustics what's it</span> <span data-start="1370.94" data-end="1374">called but basically here's I I think it</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1374" data-end="1376.58">Maps pretty well ok we have HTML we have</span> <span data-start="1376.58" data-end="1381.13">JavaScript right so like are you with me</span> <span data-start="1381.13" data-end="1388.52">all right good okay all right sure okay</span> <span data-start="1388.52" data-end="1392.02">sure close that and your contents and</span> <span data-start="1392.02" data-end="1401.87">close that okay these are identical</span> <span data-start="1401.88" data-end="1404.46">okay that's a win I think cuz it's like</span> <span data-start="1404.46" data-end="1405.66">you don't have to learn anything I have</span> <span data-start="1405.66" data-end="1407.34">to learn that like you know since I</span> <span data-start="1407.34" data-end="1409.05">means this and it's like I don't want to</span> <span data-start="1409.05" data-end="1410.87">reinvent pearl in the template engine</span> <span data-start="1410.87" data-end="1414.12">and so basically what your HTML app</span> <span data-start="1414.12" data-end="1418.32">looks like is this right take a pipe</span> <span data-start="1418.32" data-end="1421.17">right the open tag push everything</span> <span data-start="1421.17" data-end="1422.4">through as long as there's data when</span> <span data-start="1422.4" data-end="1424.53">data ends all right push the close tag</span> <span data-start="1424.53" data-end="1426.48">that's it's really easy there's a</span> <span data-start="1426.48" data-end="1427.59">special case in this that I'm not</span> <span data-start="1427.59" data-end="1431.01">showing here for I'm sorry I'd like your</span> <span data-start="1431.01" data-end="1433.67">argument what you call those attributes</span> <span data-start="1433.67" data-end="1436.5">but that's basically it you know all</span> <span data-start="1436.5" data-end="1438.48">right right the div return this function</span> <span data-start="1438.48" data-end="1441.12">if there's data right it return read</span> <span data-start="1441.12" data-end="1444.75">really back when data ends right there</span> <span data-start="1444.75" data-end="1447.39">okay cool and so basically what we can</span> <span data-start="1447.39" data-end="1449.63">do here at this point is import HTML</span> <span data-start="1449.63" data-end="1453.12">right and so and here's you guys this is</span> <span data-start="1453.12" data-end="1456.48">where you might deport with me all right</span> <span data-start="1456.48" data-end="1458.37">you see we're doing here is the</span> <span data-start="1458.37" data-end="1459.78">namespace all this thing is a namespace</span> <span data-start="1459.78" data-end="1461.55">for each element but what that means is</span> <span data-start="1461.55" data-end="1462.84">we can do like really cool stuff left</span> <span data-start="1462.84" data-end="1465.39">except actually what we can do this we</span> <span data-start="1465.39" data-end="1466.62">can actually put this around the route</span> <span data-start="1466.62" data-end="1468.18">we can put this here so we can go you</span> <span data-start="1468.18" data-end="1475.98">know HTML body you know ID equals you</span> <span data-start="1475.98" data-end="1481.02">know James Jaya school and then mmm</span> <span data-start="1481.02" data-end="1484.47">that's here actually whole what I do</span> <span data-start="1484.47" data-end="1486.06">hope that this year to you right we want</span> <span data-start="1486.06" data-end="1487.32">this not found to be in there so</span> <span data-start="1487.32" data-end="1488.82">basically instead of having a router in</span> <span data-start="1488.82" data-end="1490.65">front of your app your router is your</span> <span data-start="1490.65" data-end="1491.82">appt your router is just another app in</span> <span data-start="1491.82" data-end="1493.2">this chain you can route anywhere you</span> <span data-start="1493.2" data-end="1495.06">mean of course you can abused this and</span> <span data-start="1495.06" data-end="1497.52">your code can look like PHP but you</span> <span data-start="1497.52" data-end="1498.75">don't have to i mean you could you could</span> <span data-start="1498.75" data-end="1499.86">put it wherever you want but the idea is</span> <span data-start="1499.86" data-end="1503.48">that it's super easy to get started oh</span> <span data-start="1503.48" data-end="1509.72">man get there whoo there it is right</span> <span data-start="1509.72" data-end="1513.39">there's enough phone okay HTML and again</span> <span data-start="1513.39" data-end="1515.52">this entire thing is asynchronous this</span> <span data-start="1515.52" data-end="1516.87">think it's it forever okay check this</span> <span data-start="1516.87" data-end="1518.1">out how much done</span> <span data-start="1518.1" data-end="1520.98">am I done I got two minutes check this</span> <span data-start="1520.98" data-end="1525.6">out I have something called sleep what</span> <span data-start="1525.6" data-end="1529.289">do you think this does is it synchronous</span> <span data-start="1529.289" data-end="1532.35">who thinks at synchronous you guys know</span> <span data-start="1532.35" data-end="1535.5">me so well all right cool let's put
