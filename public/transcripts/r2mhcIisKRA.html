data-start="76.31" data-end="78.35">very different from a non responsive one</span> <span data-start="78.35" data-end="79.84">and I learned this the hard way</span> <span data-start="79.84" data-end="83.689">so this because in responsive web divide</span> <span data-start="83.689" data-end="86.899">an on responsive website you have a site</span> <span data-start="86.899" data-end="88.999">that is supposed to work on several</span> <span data-start="88.999" data-end="91.399">browsers and it should only work on</span> <span data-start="91.399" data-end="95.499">desktop but on responsive site you have</span> <span data-start="95.499" data-end="98.149">several different screen sizes and</span> <span data-start="98.149" data-end="100.069">different devices that you need to take</span> <span data-start="100.069" data-end="102.829">into account off and during my time</span> <span data-start="102.829" data-end="105.17">working on the project I noticed that</span> <span data-start="105.17" data-end="107.329">there are three common problems that</span> <span data-start="107.329" data-end="109.909">keep on recurring and this problem</span> <span data-start="109.909" data-end="112.459">always centers on how designers and</span> <span data-start="112.459" data-end="114.799">developers work together how to ensure</span> <span data-start="114.799" data-end="116.389">that you're writing maintainable code</span> <span data-start="116.389" data-end="119.539">and coming up with testing and debugging</span> <span data-start="119.539" data-end="122.479">strategy more often than not I think</span> <span data-start="122.479" data-end="124.969">responsive web development will force</span> <span data-start="124.969" data-end="127.85">you to change your design development</span> <span data-start="127.85" data-end="130.009">and testing workflow and I find that</span> <span data-start="130.009" data-end="132.709">changing this workflow is especially</span> <span data-start="132.709" data-end="134.81">challenging especially when you're</span> <span data-start="134.81" data-end="137.27">working on revamping a non responsive</span> <span data-start="137.27" data-end="142.1">site to a responsive one because chances</span> <span data-start="142.1" data-end="144.23">are you and your team members are</span> <span data-start="144.23" data-end="145.56">already used to</span> <span data-start="145.56" data-end="148.62">working on the non responsive web</span> <span

data-end="155.91">initially during our responsive web</span> <span data-start="155.91" data-end="158.76">project we had a lack of collaboration</span> <span data-start="158.76" data-end="161.1">between designers and developers</span> <span data-start="161.1" data-end="163.89">there's a lot of back-and-forth style of</span> <span data-start="163.89" data-end="167.79">communication between us and initially</span> <span data-start="167.79" data-end="169.65">this communication works fine for us</span> <span data-start="169.65" data-end="172.56">during our pre responsive era but during</span> <span data-start="172.56" data-end="174.81">the project itself it becomes a major</span> <span data-start="174.81" data-end="177.42">problem and as you know old habits die</span> <span data-start="177.42" data-end="177.959">hard</span> <span data-start="177.959" data-end="180.39">without actually noticing it we adopt</span> <span data-start="180.39" data-end="182.13">the same communication style in a</span> <span data-start="182.13" data-end="186.39">responsive web project and it turns out</span> <span data-start="186.39" data-end="190.59">to be a problem for us so what do I</span> <span data-start="190.59" data-end="193.11">meant by a back and forth style</span> <span data-start="193.11" data-end="195.72">communication so you have a designer and</span> <span data-start="195.72" data-end="198.06">designer will pass a high fidelity</span> <span data-start="198.06" data-end="201.12">design markup to developer and during</span> <span data-start="201.12" data-end="202.98">the development stage this is when the</span> <span data-start="202.98" data-end="205.769">developers start to find problems with</span> <span data-start="205.769" data-end="208.59">the design and when problems are found</span> <span data-start="208.59" data-end="211.459">design gets passed back to the designer</span> <span data-start="211.459" data-end="213.66">this is when the designers start to get</span> <span data-start="213.66" data-end="216.51">stressed out and start thinking about</span> <span data-start="216.51" data-end="218.37">all of the possible solutions that they</span> <span data-start="218.37" data-end="221.19">can use in order to solve the problem</span> <span data-start="221.19" data-end="224.03">and once the solution is found the</span> <span data-start="224.03" data-end="226.799">design mock-up gets updated and get</span> <span data-start="226.799" data-end="230.04">passed back to developer but it's not</span> <span data-start="230.04" data-end="232.11">the end of the story because problems</span> <span data-start="232.11" data-end="236.4">will keep on being found and the cycle</span> <span data-start="236.4" data-end="238.95">will just keep on repeating itself so I</span> <span data-start="238.95" data-end="242.19">have three reasons why this type of</span> <span data-start="242.19" data-end="244.68">communication actually failed during</span> <span data-start="244.68" data-end="247.44">responsive web development and the first</span> <span data-start="247.44" data-end="249.78">thing is limitation see designers are</span> <span data-start="249.78" data-end="252.93">creative beings I wish I can be half as</span> <span data-start="252.93" data-end="254.91">creative as them but most of the time I</span> <span data-start="254.91" data-end="257.25">only like to pretend to be a designer on</span> <span data-start="257.25" data-end="260.97">a daily basis and so whenever I look at</span> <span data-start="260.97" data-end="263.28">my designers working it impresses me</span> <span data-start="263.28" data-end="264.75">because there's no limitation to their</span> <span data-start="264.75" data-end="266.88">creativity but there's always going to</span> <span data-start="266.88" data-end="269.1">be limitation when you start developing</span> <span data-start="269.1" data-end="272.729">their ideas for example a designer may</span> <span data-start="272.729" data-end="274.879">come to you with fancy anime</span> <span data-start="274.879" data-end="277.24">and there's always going to be</span> <span data-start="277.24" data-end="279.979">limitations on how this animation would</span> <span data-start="279.979" data-end="282.529">render on smaller screen dividers â€” and</span> <span data-start="282.529" data-end="285.86">and also in older browsers designers</span> <span data-start="285.86" data-end="288.229">will come to you with big images to be</span> <span data-start="288.229" data-end="290.27">implemented on the site but there's</span> <span data-start="290.27" data-end="292.49">always going to be limitations on how</span> <span data-start="292.49" data-end="295.009">this images would affect the performance</span> <span data-start="295.009" data-end="297.02">of your site and also the art direction</span> <span data-start="297.02" data-end="299.779">on your smaller screen devices of your</span> <span data-start="299.779" data-end="302.889">site and designers may also come with</span> <span data-start="302.889" data-end="305.719">beautiful and intricate layouts but</span> <span data-start="305.719" data-end="308.539">there's always going to be limitation in</span> <span data-start="308.539" data-end="311.209">terms of the difference in expectation</span> <span data-start="311.209" data-end="313.909">on how this layouts supposed to render</span> <span data-start="313.909" data-end="315.979">on smaller screen to larger screen</span> <span data-start="315.979" data-end="319.189">devices for example my designer come up</span> <span data-start="319.189" data-end="320.959">to me one day and show me this mock-up</span> <span data-start="320.959" data-end="323.179">this is the blueprint of the mock-up and</span> <span data-start="323.179" data-end="325.219">how it should render on large screen</span> <span data-start="325.219" data-end="328.039">device as you can see the episodes clips</span> <span data-start="328.039" data-end="329.99">and trailers should appear as a sidebar</span> <span data-start="329.99" data-end="332.869">so at a glance I understand that on</span> <span data-start="332.869" data-end="335.8">smaller screen device the sidebar should</span> <span data-start="335.8" data-end="338.539">appear right under the main content area</span> <span data-start="338.539" data-end="340.969">and in this case the episodes clips and</span> <span data-start="340.969" data-end="344.139">trailers should appear under collections</span> <span data-start="344.139" data-end="347.589">but my designer has a totally different</span> <span data-start="347.589" data-end="352.519">expectation so he expects the episodes</span> <span data-start="352.519" data-end="355.209">to appear right below the About section</span> <span data-start="355.209" data-end="357.469">while the clips and trailers should</span> <span data-start="357.469" data-end="359.779">appear right below collections so this</span> <span data-start="359.779" data-end="361.219">is an example of the difference of</span> <span data-start="361.219" data-end="364.249">expectations that you may encounter when</span> <span data-start="364.249" data-end="365.749">you're working on such a project and</span> <span data-start="365.749" data-end="367.189">when you're working closely with the</span> <span data-start="367.189" data-end="370.339">designer this is the kind of</span> <span data-start="370.339" data-end="372.289">expectations that you should communicate</span> <span data-start="372.289" data-end="374.479">verbally to each other and that you</span> <span data-start="374.479" data-end="377.479">should not rely on markups alone to pass</span> <span data-start="377.479" data-end="380.24">the message effectively which brings me</span> <span data-start="380.24" data-end="382.009">to my second reason on why such a</span> <span data-start="382.009" data-end="384.769">communication style fail the markups</span> <span data-start="384.769" data-end="387.139">itself mock-ups don't really tell you</span> <span data-start="387.139" data-end="388.789">much about what's the performance of</span> <span data-start="388.789" data-end="390.979">your site's going to be like it doesn't</span> <span data-start="390.979" data-end="393.379">tell you much about the development</span> <span data-start="393.379" data-end="395.569">complexity that you may run into when</span> <span data-start="395.569" data-end="398.059">you start developing the site and most</span> <span data-start="398.059" data-end="400.279">importantly it doesn't really tell you</span> <span data-start="400.279" data-end="402.409">about the interaction types it's going</span> <span data-start="402.409" data-end="405.62">to be on your site so there's this</span> <span data-start="405.62" data-end="408.08">amazing quote by Tom Maslin Tom</span> <span data-start="408.08" data-end="411.699">is actually a developer working on</span> <span data-start="411.699" data-end="415.55">responsive web development at BBC I got</span> <span data-start="415.55" data-end="417.819">this quote from a book called real life</span> <span data-start="417.819" data-end="420.71">responsive web design by Smashing</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="420.71" data-end="423.11">Magazine I was out earlier this year I</span> <span data-start="423.11" data-end="424.849">suggest everyone who's working on</span> <span data-start="424.849" data-end="426.68">responsive website to read the book I</span> <span data-start="426.68" data-end="429.47">wish I stumbled upon it earlier</span> <span data-start="429.47" data-end="432.5">so basically Tom's quote summarizes that</span> <span data-start="432.5" data-end="435.05">you can't really assume that small</span> <span data-start="435.05" data-end="437.509">screen devices interaction is going to</span> <span data-start="437.509" data-end="441.02">be done by touch while a large screen</span> <span data-start="441.02" data-end="443.3">one will be done by mouse and you would</span> <span data-start="443.3" data-end="446">understand where Tom is coming from if</span> <span data-start="446" data-end="449.09">you actually take an iPad visit a site</span> <span data-start="449.09" data-end="451.509">on iPad and switch it to landscape mode</span> <span data-start="451.509" data-end="454.639">if most of it I will take the desktop</span> <span data-start="454.639" data-end="456.44">set of design and depending on your</span> <span data-start="456.44" data-end="459.53">design where your interaction type works</span> <span data-start="459.53" data-end="462.319">seamlessly on desktop it will start to</span> <span data-start="462.319" data-end="465.83">fail on the iPad landscape mode so this</span> <span data-start="465.83" data-end="468.8">is the kind of design problems that you</span> <span data-start="468.8" data-end="472.009">may encounter this is the kind of</span> <span data-start="472.009" data-end="474.289">limitations that you may encounter and</span> <span data-start="474.289" data-end="478.009">the third reason is shortcomings design</span> <span data-start="478.009" data-end="480.409">shortcomings will be discovered really</span> <span data-start="480.409" data-end="482.63">late and in our case it's always</span> <span data-start="482.63" data-end="484.25">discovered during the development stage</span> <span data-start="484.25" data-end="487.58">and this is when you will start thinking</span> <span data-start="487.58" data-end="489.639">about employing different kinds of hacks</span> <span data-start="489.639" data-end="492.65">shortcuts and libraries and I don't</span> <span data-start="492.65"

data-end="500.599">also if there's any last-minute picture</span> <span data-start="500.599" data-end="503.779">that you forgot to include it will</span> <span data-start="503.779" data-end="505.639">actually you won't be able to squeeze it</span> <span data-start="505.639" data-end="509">and for example @viki we have very</span> <span data-start="509" data-end="512.719">passionate users we have users working</span> <span data-start="512.719" data-end="515.209">as volunteers to actually provide</span> <span data-start="515.209" data-end="517.789">subtitles on the site on a daily basis</span> <span data-start="517.789" data-end="520.579">and we actually value the opinions of</span> <span data-start="520.579"

data-end="552.83">style of communicating with each other</span> <span data-start="552.83" data-end="555.14">once we start to roll it up for better</span> <span data-start="555.14" data-end="557.99">testing and ask users but their opinions</span> <span data-start="557.99" data-end="559.76">on the side this is when they start</span> <span data-start="559.76" data-end="561.529">suggesting feature requests that we have</span> <span data-start="561.529" data-end="565.07">no time for so after applying some</span> <span data-start="565.07"

backlash</span> <span data-start="570.05" data-end="573.05">from the users because we actually did</span> <span data-start="573.05" data-end="574.85">not include the cinematic mode feature</span> <span data-start="574.85" data-end="577.76">that they liked so much so initially pre</span> <span data-start="577.76" data-end="580.459">responsive era we had the cinematic mode</span> <span

data-end="1058.8">development straight away and one of</span> <span data-start="1058.8" data-end="1061.05">them is to actually quickly just use</span> <span data-start="1061.05"

data-end="1072.85">just bloat the CSS file</span> <span data-start="1072.85" data-end="1075.19">and also I found that certain frameworks</span> <span data-start="1075.19" data-end="1078.309">could be

not that</span> <span data-start="1082.78" data-end="1086.169">straightforward also I noticed that it</span> <span data-start="1086.169" data-end="1089.5">is important to pick the right framework</span> <span data-start="1089.5" data-end="1091.96">because an unsuitable framework can be</span> <span data-start="1091.96" data-end="1094.919">more harmful than no frameworks at all</span> <span data-start="1094.919" data-end="1097.39">this is because with unsuitable</span> <span data-start="1097.39" data-end="1098.95">frameworks you're going to spend a lot</span> <span data-start="1098.95" data-end="1101.169">of time just taking those code out and</span> <span data-start="1101.169" data-end="1103.12">rewriting everything at the end of the</span> <span

data-end="1110.2">there are justified reasons for you to</span> <span data-start="1110.2" data-end="1113.049">use CSS frameworks I just think that it</span> <span data-start="1113.049" data-end="1114.7">is important to pick the right one</span> <span data-start="1114.7" data-end="1116.86">there's different school of thoughts to</span> <span data-start="1116.86" data-end="1119.049">this for example for some people</span> <span data-start="1119.049" data-end="1121.21">bootstrap may not be a good framework</span> <span data-start="1121.21" data-end="1123.37">but for some other people it's a good</span> <span data-start="1123.37" data-end="1127.48">one so I think that ultimately you</span> <span data-start="1127.48" data-end="1129.7">should go with a battle-tested framework</span> <span data-start="1129.7" data-end="1133.9">that is well known like bootstrap or</span> <span data-start="1133.9"
