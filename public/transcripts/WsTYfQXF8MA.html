data-end="395.44">advancement to give you an example early</span> <span data-start="395.44" data-end="397.81">on when I joined Microsoft I joined in</span> <span data-start="397.81"

data-end="404.61">that that wasn't really the place that I</span> <span data-start="404.61" data-end="407.1">wanted to be but I was working with a</span> <span data-start="407.1" data-end="408.75">lot of different partners in different</span> <span data-start="408.75" data-end="410.85">product teams at Microsoft and I was</span> <span data-start="410.85" data-end="413.73">trying to make those

my</span> <span data-start="420.69" data-end="422.18">entire career through those connections</span> <span data-start="422.18" data-end="424.32">because one of the people that I worked</span> <span

data-end="436.62">career so I would really advise making</span> <span data-start="436.62" data-end="439.2">those kinds of connections is really</span> <span data-start="439.2" data-end="440.88">going to benefit you and there's a lot</span> <span data-start="440.88" data-end="442.47">of different ways that you can do that</span> <span data-start="442.47" data-end="443.49">from meetups</span> <span data-start="443.49" data-end="448.46">to social — in your own work environment</span> <span data-start="448.46" data-end="451.11">another thing that mentors can do is</span> <span data-start="451.11" data-end="454.38">they can create opportunities because</span> <span data-start="454.38" data-end="456.99">you're in the back of the mentors mind</span> <span data-start="456.99" data-end="458.43">and they're thinking about you whoever</span> <span data-start="458.43" data-end="461.28">the mentor is when an opportunity comes</span> <span data-start="461.28" data-end="463.32">up that they think might be a good fit</span> <span data-start="463.32" data-end="465.39">for you they can actually put your name</span> <span data-start="465.39" data-end="467.43">in and I've seen this happen several</span> <span data-start="467.43" data-end="469.5">times in my own career like when I was</span> <span data-start="469.5" data-end="472.2">at Microsoft I had a mentor who was a</span> <span data-start="472.2" data-end="474">partner at Microsoft he'd been there for</span> <span data-start="474" data-end="475.83">a very long time so I didn't work for</span> <span data-start="475.83" data-end="478.11">him and he became my mentor because I</span> <span data-start="478.11" data-end="479.91">approached him and asked him I just said</span> <span data-start="479.91" data-end="481.68">hey can you be my mentor and he said</span> <span data-start="481.68" data-end="483.69">sure I'll do that because somebody had</span> <span data-start="483.69" data-end="485.49">advised me that having mentors was a</span> <span data-start="485.49" data-end="488.25">good thing and he actually created tons</span> <span data-start="488.25" data-end="490.02">of opportunity in my career where he</span> <span data-start="490.02" data-end="492.419">said oh yeah he heard about something</span> <span data-start="492.419" data-end="493.35">that was happening at a different</span> <span data-start="493.35" data-end="495.33">organization and said that's a good fit</span> <span data-start="495.33" data-end="499.25">for Glen let's let's get Glen to do that</span> <span data-start="499.25" data-end="501.57">so let's talk about the different types</span> <span data-start="501.57" data-end="503.97">of career mentors there actually are</span> <span data-start="503.97" data-end="505.53">many different mentors you can have life</span> <span data-start="505.53" data-end="508.59">mentors but I'm gonna I classify career</span> <span data-start="508.59" data-end="511.169">mentors into kind of three so there's a</span> <span data-start="511.169" data-end="513.39">role focused mentor that's somebody who</span> <span data-start="513.39" data-end="515.789">really just helps you do your job they</span> <span data-start="515.789" data-end="517.89">know your job better than you and they</span> <span data-start="517.89" data-end="519.39">can help you do that and many</span> <span data-start="519.39" data-end="521.19">organizations have like a buddy system</span> <span data-start="521.19" data-end="524.64">for example where you join in a</span> <span data-start="524.64" data-end="526.44">particular role and your junior they're</span> <span data-start="526.44" data-end="529.05">going to assign somebody to you but a</span> <span data-start="529.05" data-end="532.49">key thing I would say about mentoring is</span> <span data-start="532.49" data-end="534.47">you can go after it you don't have to</span> <span data-start="534.47" data-end="536.42">wait til somebody comes to you and says</span> <span data-start="536.42" data-end="538.76">oh we have a mentoring program and we</span> <span data-start="538.76" data-end="541.67">want to match you up you can go out</span> <span data-start="541.67" data-end="543.709">there and you can find a mentor to fill</span> <span data-start="543.709" data-end="547.7">the gaps that you've identified career</span> <span data-start="547.7" data-end="551.36">growth focused so a career growth</span> <span data-start="551.36" data-end="553.16">focused mentor is kind of like the one</span> <span data-start="553.16" data-end="554.99">that I mentioned before somebody who</span> <span data-start="554.99" data-end="557.99">generally has a lot more experience they</span> <span data-start="557.99" data-end="560.06">may be much more senior than you and</span> <span data-start="560.06" data-end="562.25">they're looking across a much broader</span> <span data-start="562.25" data-end="564.589">perspective and they're helping you to</span> <span data-start="564.589" data-end="568.43">see things from a different angle so for</span> <span data-start="568.43" data-end="570.709">example the person that I mentioned his</span> <span data-start="570.709" data-end="573.41">name was John Gossman I remember when I</span> <span data-start="573.41" data-end="574.82">was at Microsoft when there were some</span> <span data-start="574.82" data-end="576.77">things that were going on within the</span> <span data-start="576.77" data-end="578.69">organization that I didn't understand</span> <span data-start="578.69" data-end="580.76">and I was able to go to him and say hey</span> <span data-start="580.76" data-end="582.95">can you explain this to me and he would</span> <span data-start="582.95" data-end="585.05">look at he would show it to me from a</span> <span data-start="585.05" data-end="586.91">completely different perspective and</span> <span data-start="586.91" data-end="589.52">over time I actually started to see</span> <span data-start="589.52" data-end="591.529">things from that perspective so that's</span> <span data-start="591.529" data-end="594.41">how mentoring really helped me it helped</span> <span data-start="594.41" data-end="597.079">me to basically orientate my lens to</span> <span data-start="597.079" data-end="598.91">look at things in a different way and to</span> <span data-start="598.91" data-end="601.13">start to think of things in a broader</span> <span data-start="601.13" data-end="604.73">perspective you can also get a mentor</span> <span data-start="604.73" data-end="606.29">that helps you just with a very specific</span> <span data-start="606.29" data-end="608.779">skill I talked I gave you my pricing</span> <span data-start="608.779" data-end="611">example where I just wanted to learn how</span> <span data-start="611" data-end="613.22">to do pricing and I went to somebody who</span> <span data-start="613.22" data-end="618.98">really knew pricing to work with me see</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="618.98" data-end="623">I think I'm missing a slide no actually</span> <span data-start="623" data-end="625.76">no those are all of them ok so let's</span> <span data-start="625.76" data-end="628.49">talk about what makes a good mentor one</span> <span data-start="628.49" data-end="630.56">key thing is that a mentor is more</span> <span data-start="630.56" data-end="634.339">experienced than you now many people may</span> <span data-start="634.339" data-end="636.5">be thinking well how much experience do</span> <span data-start="636.5" data-end="638.12">I have to have really to be a mentor</span> <span data-start="638.12" data-end="640.459">really you just have to have experience</span> <span data-start="640.459" data-end="642.92">that somebody else needs and why I'm</span> <span data-start="642.92" data-end="644.39">saying that is you don't have to wait</span> <span data-start="644.39" data-end="646.7">until you have 10 years of experience in</span> <span data-start="646.7" data-end="649.339">industry for example to be a mentor as</span> <span data-start="649.339" data-end="651.649">long as you have acquired a certain</span> <span data-start="651.649" data-end="653.18">amount of knowledge that you think that</span> <span data-start="653.18" data-end="656.42">other people need you can actually be a</span> <span data-start="656.42" data-end="661.829">mentor to that to that individual a</span> <span data-start="661.839" data-end="664.22">mentor should be somebody that you feel</span> <span data-start="664.22" data-end="665.73">comfortable talking to</span> <span data-start="665.73" data-end="668.73">they're gonna help you and they're only</span> <span data-start="668.73" data-end="670.41">going to be able to help you in as much</span> <span data-start="670.41" data-end="672.48">as you're able to give them the</span> <span data-start="672.48" data-end="674.279">information that they need to help you</span> <span data-start="674.279" data-end="676.889">be successful what are your goals what</span> <span data-start="676.889" data-end="678.389">are your desires what are the things</span> <span data-start="678.389" data-end="680.22">that you're actually struggling with I'm</span> <span data-start="680.22" data-end="681.779">not saying they're a therapist let's</span> <span data-start="681.779" data-end="683.809">keep it in the work kind of career</span> <span data-start="683.809" data-end="686.759">context but you should feel comfortable</span> <span data-start="686.759" data-end="689.1">talking to them I often advise people</span> <span data-start="689.1" data-end="691.259">that are trying to find mentors to</span> <span data-start="691.259" data-end="693.209">really look at this if you don't feel</span> <span data-start="693.209" data-end="694.819">comfortable talking to that person</span> <span data-start="694.819" data-end="696.989">you're not really going to be they're</span> <span data-start="696.989" data-end="698.1">not really going to be able to help you</span> <span data-start="698.1" data-end="699.269">and you're not really gonna be able to</span> <span data-start="699.269" data-end="701.209">find the help that you need</span> <span data-start="701.209" data-end="703.559">trust this goes hand-in-hand with that</span> <span data-start="703.559" data-end="706.199">as well the whole idea of a mentor is</span> <span data-start="706.199" data-end="708.679">someone that you feel that you can</span> <span data-start="708.679" data-end="710.939">reveal to them a whole bunch of details</span> <span data-start="710.939" data-end="712.889">in order for them to be able to help you</span> <span data-start="712.889" data-end="714.899">but you're not gonna do that if you feel</span> <span data-start="714.899" data-end="718.139">you can't trust them so one thing about</span> <span data-start="718.139" data-end="721.109">trust really is confidentiality that's</span> <span data-start="721.109" data-end="722.91">what that means that the things that are</span> <span data-start="722.91" data-end="725.1">told to the mentor stay with the mentor</span> <span data-start="725.1" data-end="727.439">or at least that mentor gets your</span> <span data-start="727.439" data-end="730.439">permission and will say that so I mentor</span> <span data-start="730.439" data-end="731.73">a lot of people and I will say are you</span> <span data-start="731.73" data-end="734.699">okay if I say so and so I'm not gonna</span> <span data-start="734.699" data-end="738.909">just go go ahead and do it on my own</span> <span data-start="738.919" data-end="741.629">this has certainly been a challenge for</span> <span data-start="741.629" data-end="746.699">me they have to be a good listener the</span> <span data-start="746.699" data-end="748.709">mentor is really there to serve you</span> <span data-start="748.709" data-end="751.259">remember that if you get a mentor it's</span> <span data-start="751.259" data-end="753.059">not that you're there to make the mends</span> <span data-start="753.059" data-end="755.1">who are happy the whole idea of the</span> <span data-start="755.1" data-end="757.23">mentor is to help you make that journey</span> <span data-start="757.23" data-end="760.169">if they're not a good listener they're</span> <span data-start="760.169" data-end="762.359">not gonna really be understanding and</span> <span data-start="762.359" data-end="764.22">understanding your problems and they're</span> <span data-start="764.22" data-end="765.749">not gonna be giving you the space to</span> <span data-start="765.749" data-end="768.389">really try to work through them because</span> <span data-start="768.389" data-end="770.459">a mentors job is not to solve the</span> <span data-start="770.459" data-end="773.189">problem for you that's the whole idea of</span> <span data-start="773.189" data-end="775.319">advice it's to help you see help you</span> <span data-start="775.319" data-end="777.449">look at things in a different way think</span> <span data-start="777.449" data-end="778.98">about how to get up that trail but</span> <span data-start="778.98" data-end="780.72">you're the one who ultimately has to do</span> <span data-start="780.72" data-end="785.459">it consistency and availability is</span> <span data-start="785.459" data-end="787.889">really important now there's a</span> <span data-start="787.889" data-end="789.839">relationship that builds between a</span> <span data-start="789.839" data-end="791.519">mentor and a mentee and there's an</span> <span data-start="791.519" data-end="793.86">agreement that happens and whatever that</span> <span data-start="793.86" data-end="796.47">agreement is as far as availability and</span> <span data-start="796.47" data-end="798.869">time that should be something that the</span> <span data-start="798.869" data-end="799.26">men</span> <span data-start="799.26" data-end="802.35">or sticks to it's also on the menti it</span> <span data-start="802.35" data-end="805.17">goes both ways but if you have a mentor</span> <span data-start="805.17" data-end="807.54">that's flaking out who's not willing to</span> <span data-start="807.54" data-end="809.1">give the time then you should find</span> <span data-start="809.1" data-end="811.41">another mentor who is willing to give</span> <span data-start="811.41" data-end="812.91">that time because otherwise you're just</span> <span data-start="812.91" data-end="814.56">you're just wasting your time and you're</span> <span data-start="814.56" data-end="820.14">not actually making the progress so I</span> <span data-start="820.14" data-end="821.46">wanted to give a couple of pointers</span> <span data-start="821.46" data-end="824.16">about how to find a mentor so one thing</span> <span data-start="824.16" data-end="826.95">you can do is many companies do have a</span> <span data-start="826.95" data-end="830.82">mentoring program and one thing I always</span> <span data-start="830.82" data-end="834.08">found kooky just telling a story is that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="834.08" data-end="838.46">Microsoft has a mentoring program and</span> <span data-start="838.46" data-end="842.46">they basically require at the time would</span> <span data-start="842.46" data-end="845.01">require required that you were an</span> <span data-start="845.01" data-end="847.65">employee for a year before you could get</span> <span data-start="847.65" data-end="850.11">a mentor I hope that's actually changed</span> <span data-start="850.11" data-end="851.88">because what I really needed the mentor</span> <span data-start="851.88" data-end="854.34">was earliest on so what did I do when</span> <span data-start="854.34" data-end="856.47">the program wouldn't really allow me to</span> <span data-start="856.47" data-end="859.02">be in it I just went and found a mentor</span> <span data-start="859.02" data-end="861.54">on my own anyway so you don't need the</span> <span data-start="861.54" data-end="863.55">program but if there is a program it can</span> <span data-start="863.55" data-end="866.22">be a really useful resource to be able</span> <span data-start="866.22" data-end="871.32">to connect with others you can just</span> <span data-start="871.32" data-end="873.84">approach a friend or a co-worker tell</span> <span data-start="873.84" data-end="875.37">your friend your coworker like hey</span> <span data-start="875.37" data-end="877.05">here's something I really like to learn</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="877.05" data-end="879.12">I think you have a bunch of experience</span> <span data-start="879.12" data-end="881.79">that I could benefit from would you be</span> <span data-start="881.79" data-end="884.25">willing to be my mentor and I have found</span> <span data-start="884.25" data-end="886.26">consistently that most of the time when</span> <span data-start="886.26" data-end="888.33">or I would say consistently when I've</span> <span data-start="888.33" data-end="889.89">gone to people and said to them hey</span> <span data-start="889.89" data-end="892.11">would you mentor me the answer is</span> <span data-start="892.11" data-end="894.6">generally a yes once in a while it might</span> <span data-start="894.6" data-end="896.64">be a no and if they're not at a place</span> <span data-start="896.64" data-end="899.04">where there will able to give that</span> <span data-start="899.04" data-end="901.41">commitment then no is actually a good</span> <span data-start="901.41" data-end="903.48">thing it's saving both of us a lot of</span> <span data-start="903.48" data-end="906.63">heartache and hardship a key thing I</span> <span data-start="906.63" data-end="908.76">would say too is that people respond to</span> <span data-start="908.76" data-end="912.75">honesty and when someone is genuine so</span> <span data-start="912.75" data-end="914.64">when you go to someone and ask them for</span> <span data-start="914.64" data-end="917.25">a mentor to be your mentor be prepared</span> <span data-start="917.25" data-end="920.49">to actually work because every mentor is</span> <span data-start="920.49" data-end="922.05">going to they're going to get</span> <span data-start="922.05" data-end="924.6">discouraged as a mentor if they see that</span> <span data-start="924.6" data-end="927.12">they're advising you or giving you like</span> <span data-start="927.12" data-end="928.77">they might say a mentor might say hey go</span> <span data-start="928.77" data-end="930.84">read this book this book is really going</span> <span data-start="930.84" data-end="931.72">to help you</span> <span data-start="931.72" data-end="933.82">well if you're not going to do those</span> <span data-start="933.82" data-end="935.92">things that the mentor is advising on</span> <span data-start="935.92" data-end="937.96">that's going to help you to learn then</span> <span data-start="937.96" data-end="940.42">that relationship is probably not going</span> <span data-start="940.42" data-end="943.78">to work out very well there's lots of</span> <span data-start="943.78" data-end="947.86">online communities where you can go to</span> <span data-start="947.86" data-end="950.47">find mentors one that because I come</span> <span data-start="950.47" data-end="952.33">from the product side one I'll call out</span> <span data-start="952.33" data-end="954.88">is the mind the product slack so for any</span> <span data-start="954.88" data-end="956.38">folks here that are interested in like</span> <span data-start="956.38"

them gonto</span> <span data-start="970.36" data-end="975.61">and he recently went went on Twitter and</span> <span data-start="975.61" data-end="977.74">he posted and said hey you know I'd like</span> <span data-start="977.74" data-end="979.29">to talk to somebody who has experience</span> <span data-start="979.29" data-end="982.48">in a company our size leading a product</span> <span

data-end="990.28">this is a good illustration of someone</span> <span data-start="990.28" data-end="992.53">who is quite seasoned in their career</span> <span data-start="992.53" data-end="994.66">who's going out there and asking for</span> <span data-start="994.66" data-end="996.73">help so you're never too old or too</span> <span data-start="996.73"

data-end="1019.56">successful and if you believe in the</span> <span data-start="1019.56" data-end="1021.78">concept of pay it forward that when you</span> <span data-start="1021.78" data-end="1023.58">do good things it's going to come back</span> <span data-start="1023.58" data-end="1025.949">to you I truly believe in that and have</span> <span data-start="1025.949"

data-end="1037.65">personal for me you know I know for</span> <span data-start="1037.65" data-end="1040.92">example as a white male that I have had</span> <span data-start="1040.92"
