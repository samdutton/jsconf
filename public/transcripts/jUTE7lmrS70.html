exist so I just</span> <span data-start="276.79" data-end="278.26">wanted to take take a second and</span> <span data-start="278.26" data-end="282.22">recognize those people mm-hmm so you</span> <span data-start="282.22" data-end="284.26">know we wanted to kind of create this</span> <span data-start="284.26" data-end="285.91">higher level story about what webpack</span> <span data-start="285.91" data-end="289.15">four meant meant for our users meant for</span> <span data-start="289.15" data-end="291.64">us and so you know the first thing with</span> <span data-start="291.64" data-end="295.63">smaller builds and faster builds the</span> <span data-start="295.63" data-end="299.11">second was modernization and then</span> <span data-start="299.11" data-end="300.46">finally probably one of the most</span> <span data-start="300.46" data-end="302.98">important well I mean all of these are</span> <span data-start="302.98" data-end="305.14">really important and not mutually</span> <span data-start="305.14" data-end="305.89">exclusive</span> <span data-start="305.89" data-end="310.81">which is developer experience and if I</span> <span data-start="310.81" data-end="313.06">talk about smaller and faster builds and</span> <span data-start="313.06" data-end="316">we try and break it down you can kind of</span> <span data-start="316" data-end="317.95">categorize it here so like to have a</span> <span data-start="317.95" data-end="320.56">smaller build you're going to need to do</span> <span data-start="320.56" data-end="324.34">more analysis on the code and you're</span> <span data-start="324.34" data-end="326.41">gonna have to process more of the module</span> <span data-start="326.41" data-end="329.86">graph and then for faster builds though</span> <span data-start="329.86" data-end="332.88">you're gonna have to do less work and</span> <span data-start="332.88" data-end="336.28">reuse existing work that's already been</span> <span data-start="336.28" data-end="340.95">done so these are kind of conflicting</span> <span data-start="340.95" data-end="346.08">but for faster builds we completely</span> <span data-start="346.08" data-end="348.13">reacted the way that we define what a</span> <span data-start="348.13" data-end="350.64">chunk is and a chunk is just the</span> <span data-start="350.64" data-end="353.02">in-memory version of the bundle you see</span> <span data-start="353.02" data-end="355.96">created but we also added additional</span> <span data-start="355.96" data-end="358.69">features like uglify j/s we're gonna be</span> <span data-start="358.69" data-end="360.82">using it in parallel and cashing it out</span> <span data-start="360.82" data-end="364.39">of the box and we also modernized a lot</span> <span data-start="364.39" data-end="367.26">of the pieces that we had in just old</span> <span data-start="367.26" data-end="370.36">es5 object syntax and we moved to using</span> <span data-start="370.36" data-end="375.04">maps and sets but specifically I think</span> <span data-start="375.04" data-end="377.29">one of the most important is the</span> <span data-start="377.29" data-end="380.44">migration of our plug-in system we wrote</span> <span data-start="380.44" data-end="382.15">it completely from the graph from the</span> <span data-start="382.15" data-end="386.11">ground up and now we have what are</span> <span data-start="386.11" data-end="387.82">called hooks which are create</span> <span data-start="387.82" data-end="390.82">monomorphic code and we lazy compile</span> <span data-start="390.82" data-end="392.23">them and I want to actually take a</span> <span data-start="392.23" data-end="394.9">moment to explain well what is what is</span> <span data-start="394.9" data-end="395.36">this</span> <span data-start="395.36" data-end="398.87">mean who here is familiar with mano</span> <span data-start="398.87" data-end="402.439">morphism or polymorphism okay so this</span> <span data-start="402.439" data-end="403.659">may look familiar</span> <span data-start="403.659" data-end="406.43">so this is an example of one of the</span> <span data-start="406.43" data-end="408.5">methods that is available in our plug-in</span> <span data-start="408.5" data-end="412.46">system prior to rewriting it and so if</span> <span data-start="412.46" data-end="416.05">you see here this this method is what</span> <span data-start="416.05" data-end="418.34">certain classes in web pack will call</span> <span data-start="418.34" data-end="420.469">and plugins are listening to this event</span> <span data-start="420.469" data-end="423.53">and what's passed in is a arbitrary like</span> <span data-start="423.53" data-end="425.36">event string it's like an event emitter</span> <span data-start="425.36" data-end="427.55">if you've ever used it before but the</span> <span data-start="427.55" data-end="429.849">problem here is that this is polymorphic</span> <span data-start="429.849" data-end="432.849">it can be any amount of arguments and</span> <span data-start="432.849" data-end="435.289">there's no way for the JavaScript engine</span> <span data-start="435.289" data-end="440.539">stopped mices so you know our initial</span> <span data-start="440.539" data-end="442.099">answer was like oh why don't we get</span> <span data-start="442.099" data-end="444.05">clever and just make separate methods</span> <span data-start="444.05" data-end="446.33">with single arguments for each of them</span> <span data-start="446.33" data-end="448.34">well that was not going to work one</span> <span data-start="448.34" data-end="450.62">because we could have a plug-in system</span> <span data-start="450.62" data-end="452.93">that's ginormous you have infinite</span> <span data-start="452.93" data-end="454.639">amount of different event names and</span> <span data-start="454.639" data-end="457.219">argument types that can be passed in and</span> <span data-start="457.219" data-end="458.87">so it's unmaintainable and not really a</span> <span data-start="458.87" data-end="462.74">great contributor experience and so it's</span> <span data-start="462.74" data-end="465.74">like how could we how could we solve</span> <span data-start="465.74" data-end="469.25">this where we're creating monomorphic</span> <span data-start="469.25" data-end="473.93">functions but they're unique and you</span> <span data-start="473.93" data-end="475.159">know we don't have a billion of them</span> <span data-start="475.159" data-end="478.61">that we have to maintain so we use the</span> <span data-start="478.61" data-end="482.779">technique to lazily compile based on</span> <span data-start="482.779" data-end="484.759">what is listening to these events and I</span> <span data-start="484.759" data-end="486.319">know I'm going a little deep here but it</span> <span data-start="486.319" data-end="488.99">might make more sense in a moment but</span> <span data-start="488.99" data-end="490.879">you can see at the bottom we're</span> <span data-start="490.879" data-end="494.11">literally just composing a bunch of</span> <span data-start="494.11" data-end="497.449">strings that are JavaScript that compile</span> <span data-start="497.449" data-end="500.919">to these hooks and then we evaluate it</span> <span data-start="500.919" data-end="503.479">and so like a really great resource if</span> <span data-start="503.479" data-end="505.49">you're interested in this and I'll try</span> <span data-start="505.49" data-end="507.56">not to butcher the name but V dot J's</span> <span data-start="507.56" data-end="511.219">luff I got off wrote a great explainer</span> <span data-start="511.219" data-end="512.599">article that you can go to and take a</span> <span data-start="512.599" data-end="514.399">look at it to understand how this</span> <span data-start="514.399" data-end="517.729">accomplishes monomorphic code and if</span> <span data-start="517.729" data-end="519.949">you're on Twitter a lot like myself you</span> <span data-start="519.949" data-end="521.81">may have seen this article that was like</span> <span data-start="521.81"

data-end="528.18">well it turns out</span> <span data-start="528.18" data-end="531">like how that looks pretty familiar the</span> <span data-start="531" data-end="535.29">code that he showcased and look he's</span> <span data-start="535.29" data-end="537.75">doing the same thing so the point is</span> <span data-start="537.75" data-end="540.17">that we can create this monomorphic code</span> <span data-start="540.17" data-end="543.18">but we're doing it kind of evaluative ly</span> <span data-start="543.18" data-end="546.33">or lazy compiling it but please do not</span> <span data-start="546.33" data-end="549.6">do this in your normal projects this is</span> <span data-start="549.6" data-end="551.94">you know there are some parts of webpack</span> <span data-start="551.94"

data-start="861.05" data-end="862.82">that kind of gets into what developer</span> <span data-start="862.82" data-end="864.95">experience is about all you should have</span> <span data-start="864.95" data-end="869">to do is freakin run web pack and so out</span> <span data-start="869" data-end="873.26">of the box now in web pack four we</span> <span data-start="873.26" data-end="876.47">default to

developer</span> <span data-start="882.89" data-end="884.66">experience to us meant we need to lower</span> <span data-start="884.66" data-end="886.22">the barrier to entry to people who are</span>

data-end="912.05">doesn't mean you know like letting you</span> <span data-start="912.05" data-end="913.64">do whatever you want and shoving it into</span> <span data-start="913.64"

data-end="920.029">causes a major breaking change it means</span> <span data-start="920.029" data-end="925.699">being able to actually extend a base</span> <span data-start="925.699"

data-end="961.04">not everybody will end up you know just</span> <span data-start="961.04" data-end="963.01">ripping out their web pack config</span> <span data-start="963.01"

instead why don't we extend this</span> <span data-start="974" data-end="976.91">idea so we also created this feature</span> <span data-start="976.91" data-end="979.91">called mode and so mode is a

<span data-start="983.39" data-end="987.08">like I said and you know what it</span> <span data-start="987.08" data-end="988.61">represents is that for development</span> <span data-start="988.61" data-end="989.84">you're going to want to have tooling for</span> <span data-start="989.84" data-end="991.49">the browser you're going to want to have</span> <span data-start="991.49"

data-end="1026.38">and web pack for it's gone we've</span> <span data-start="1026.38" data-end="1029.26">replaced it with an API that does much</span> <span data-start="1029.26" data-end="1032.56">of this out of the box by default but on</span> <span data-start="1032.56" data-end="1034.69">top of that we have properties that give</span> <span data-start="1034.69" data-end="1037.8">you more control

seriously</span> <span data-start="1043.75" data-end="1045.64">that we wanted to be able to profile and</span> <span data-start="1045.64" data-end="1049.39">analyze really deeply any

data-end="1447.21">and then the other big feature that I'm</span> <span data-start="1447.21" data-end="1449.58">really excited about which is called web</span> <span data-start="1449.58" data-end="1453.12">packing lazon part two so you know when</span> <span data-start="1453.12" data-end="1454.86">we introduce what web assembly is a</span> <span data-start="1454.86" data-end="1456.96">first-class citizen we kind of can you</span> <span data-start="1456.96" data-end="1458.76">know the module type is called web</span> <span data-start="1458.76" data-end="1462.66">assembly / experimental and so the first</span> <span data-start="1462.66" data-end="1463.59">thing is to stay</span> <span data-start="1463.59" data-end="1466.289">lies it but then we're going to go ahead</span> <span data-start="1466.289" data-end="1469.159">and add a bunch of the features that we</span> <span data-start="1469.159" data-end="1472.14">that we already have on JavaScript and</span> <span data-start="1472.14" data-end="1474.179">apply it to web assembly and so this</span> <span data-start="1474.179" data-end="1476.539">means tree-shaking you can do that</span> <span data-start="1476.539" data-end="1480.15">dead code elimination scope hosting wise</span> <span data-start="1480.15" data-end="1484.679">modules and so this is super exciting</span> <span data-start="1484.679" data-end="1487.44">because now web assembly goes from being</span> <span data-start="1487.44" data-end="1488.82">something that you can use once or twice</span> <span

<p><span data-start="1491.549" data-end="1493.38">JavaScript module and not taking a</span> <span data-start="1493.38" data-end="1496.58">perfect or a size hit or a runtime hit</span> <span

data-start="1512.279" data-end="1515.6">say at web pack can use Babel if exists</span> <span data-start="1515.6" data-end="1518.279">you can install that package and it just</span> <span data-start="1518.279" data-end="1520.35">reads your babel RC and throws in babel</span> <span data-start="1520.35" data-end="1524.82">loader what if as a package author you</span> <span

data-start="1529.409" data-end="1531.45">similar to babel if you understand their</span> <span data-start="1531.45" data-end="1533.88">package structure and we're you know at</span> <span data-start="1533.88" data-end="1535.35">least i took the inspiration in this</span> <span data-start="1535.35" data-end="1538.5">prototype to kind of leverage it but can</span> <span data-start="1538.5" data-end="1540.48">use typescript really could just be can</span> <span data-start="1540.48" data-end="1541.86">it resolve type scripting can it load it</span> <span

data-start="1548.669" data-end="1549.96">with a couple packages that you would</span> <span data-start="1549.96" data-end="1551.88">add you still don't need a web pack</span> <span data-start="1551.88" data-end="1561.029">config yep thank you and so what's</span> <span data-start="1561.029" data-end="1564.21">beyond what's beyond for point X so</span> <span data-start="1564.21" data-end="1565.98">those are they're kind of like the</span> <span data-start="1565.98" data-end="1568.11">things that we can do right now without</span> <span data-start="1568.11" data-end="1569.52">causing a breaking change but what</span> <span data-start="1569.52" data-end="1572.549">what's beyond that so one of the most</span> <span data-start="1572.549" data-end="1574.77">important things that is lacking for web</span> <span data-start="1574.77" data-end="1578.039">pack is that we don't have a fully</span> <span data-start="1578.039"
