abuse you Shaz open dev tools</span> <span data-start="101.049" data-end="105.039">and run an audit of your sign this is</span> <span data-start="105.039" data-end="107.14">not very interesting but it's probably</span> <span data-start="107.14" data-end="110.799">the easiest way of running these kind of</span> <span data-start="110.799" data-end="114.189">performance analysis and it gives

then</span> <span data-start="214.56" data-end="216.72">another tool that really really like is</span> <span data-start="216.72" data-end="219.15">webpagetest in web page this is</span> <span data-start="219.15" data-end="222.9">basically something you just put the</span> <span data-start="222.9" data-end="225.51">link to your site and waiting in a queue</span> <span data-start="225.51" data-end="228.15">for for a machine to be assigned to you</span> <span data-start="228.15" data-end="231.45">and the way this works is it will fire</span> <span data-start="231.45" data-end="235.32">up your side and it'll shoot the video</span> <span data-start="235.32" data-end="238.8">have the site is loaded and then it will</span> <span data-start="238.8" data-end="241.32">give you a bunch of different analytics</span> <span data-start="241.32" data-end="244.98">and metrics that you can act on for</span> <span data-start="244.98" data-end="248.16">example it gives you the load time in</span> <span data-start="248.16" data-end="251.69">seconds the time to first by the time to</span> <span data-start="251.69" data-end="254.64">pagelet page complete and all these</span> <span data-start="254.64" data-end="259.56">different points in the life cycle of</span> <span data-start="259.56" data-end="262.049">your page and also gives you rough</span> <span data-start="262.049" data-end="266.24">scores like in page speed using grades</span> <span data-start="266.24" data-end="269.969">for time to first byte keep alive</span> <span data-start="269.969" data-end="273.599">compressed transfer caching where you're</span> <span data-start="273.599" data-end="275.429">using a CDN or not where you're</span> <span data-start="275.429" data-end="280.069">compressing images um things like that</span> <span data-start="280.069" data-end="285.389">besides this brace you also get the</span> <span data-start="285.389" data-end="289.889">waterfall view which is a very easy way</span> <span data-start="289.889" data-end="293.249">to look at how your page is loaded and</span> <span data-start="293.249" data-end="296.519">what resources plug the next few so for</span> <span data-start="296.519" data-end="299.689">example in this example you can see that</span> <span data-start="299.689" data-end="303.719">fonts are blocking everything else and</span> <span data-start="303.719" data-end="305.669">maybe if you were able to love those</span> <span data-start="305.669" data-end="308.789">fonts asynchronously or not all of them</span> <span data-start="308.789" data-end="310.919">at all maybe because they are cached</span> <span data-start="310.919" data-end="313.979">you'll save like 600 milliseconds or</span> <span data-start="313.979" data-end="317.069">even more so it's really easy looking at</span> <span data-start="317.069" data-end="321.059">this to figure out how to parallel eyes</span> <span data-start="321.059" data-end="323.969">your downloads so that even takes a</span> <span data-start="323.969" data-end="328.019">shorter amount of time and just as you</span> <span data-start="328.019" data-end="331.019">had the grades in general you can also</span> <span data-start="331.019" data-end="333.599">look at these grades on a per resource</span> <span data-start="333.599" data-end="338.059">basis so if you for instance have bad</span> <span data-start="338.059" data-end="342.749">static caching you may want to look at</span> <span data-start="342.749" data-end="347.759">this because most of those failed grades</span> <span data-start="347.759" data-end="350.909">may be due to third-party ads and stuff</span> <span data-start="350.909" data-end="353.61">like that that you probably have on your</span> <span data-start="353.61" data-end="359.809">side so it's one other thing to consider</span> <span data-start="359.809" data-end="362.759">um and like I said they take a video of</span> <span data-start="362.759" data-end="364.829">your side loading and this makes it very</span> <span data-start="364.829" data-end="367.469">easy to spot things like flashes of</span> <span data-start="367.469" data-end="370.079">invisible text and it helps you</span> <span data-start="370.079" data-end="374.61">calculate the how fast your site is</span> <span data-start="374.61" data-end="376.739">loading using a metric called the speed</span> <span data-start="376.739" data-end="382.489">index which is I'll just read this</span> <span data-start="382.489" data-end="385.169">spandex takes the visual progress of the</span> <span data-start="385.169" data-end="387.36">visual page loading and computes an</span> <span data-start="387.36" data-end="390.059">overall score for how quickly the</span> <span data-start="390.059" data-end="392.729">content was painting so this basically</span> <span data-start="392.729" data-end="396.839">means spandex tells you how fast content</span> <span data-start="396.839" data-end="401.22">is viewable to your users</span> <span data-start="401.22" data-end="404.1">and generally speaking and speed index</span> <span data-start="404.1" data-end="407.82">of 1000 or less is a good value to be in</span> <span data-start="407.82" data-end="411.09">the lower is the faster your patients</span> <span data-start="411.09" data-end="415.41">showing content to you your users so in</span> <span data-start="415.41" data-end="419.82">short web page that gives you a very</span>

data-start="425.49" data-end="429.84">shows you all of these low-level things</span> <span data-start="429.84" data-end="432.66">like handshakes honor than what's going</span> <span data-start="432.66" data-end="435.06">on in every single step of the</span> <span data-start="435.06" data-end="437.91">connection it helps you identify</span> <span data-start="437.91" data-end="440.82">bottlenecks and visualize progress and</span> <span data-start="440.82" data-end="443.01">this makes it very very easy to figure</span> <span data-start="443.01"

data-end="454.68">much time the problem with every single</span> <span data-start="454.68" data-end="457.77">one of these tools is that you have to</span> <span data-start="457.77" data-end="460.32">proactively go to these sites or open up</span> <span data-start="460.32" data-end="465.33">devtools and run the audit and it's just</span> <span data-start="465.33" data-end="467.31">something that you may just do once</span> <span data-start="467.31" data-end="471.48">after my talk and then never do again so</span> <span data-start="471.48" data-end="474.54">this is not what i recommend are all i</span> <span data-start="474.54" data-end="477.12">recommend that you automate this stuff</span> <span data-start="477.12" data-end="480.45">and you measure often not just once</span> <span data-start="480.45" data-end="486.96">after check on BP so there are a few</span> <span data-start="486.96" data-end="488.4">different tools we can use to automate</span> <span data-start="488.4" data-end="491.28">all of this one of them is called PSI</span> <span data-start="491.28" data-end="495.83">it's an admiral that comes with a CLI</span> <span data-start="495.83" data-end="501.09">grunt and gulp plugins someone that when</span> <span data-start="501.09" data-end="503.13">use it on the comment

<span data-start="518.969" data-end="524.67">useful to to automate the these</span> <span data-start="524.67" data-end="526.92">measurements and maybe make some sort of</span> <span data-start="526.92" data-end="529.02">graph over time and five your site is</span> <span data-start="529.02" data-end="532.26">evolving I one not so it's one thing to</span> <span data-start="532.26" data-end="534.72">consider there's a similar to</span> <span data-start="534.72" data-end="537.98">for a web page since it's a little bit</span> <span data-start="537.98" data-end="542.129">slower because again you need to be put</span> <span data-start="542.129" data-end="544.11">in a queue for so that you are assigned</span> <span data-start="544.11" data-end="547.98">a computer where your
