<p><span data-start="219.15" data-end="222.21">I think switch statements handy too so</span> <span data-start="222.21" data-end="226.15">let's check how switch statement works</span> <span data-start="226.16" data-end="229.71">so if statement is a it's good whenever</span> <span data-start="229.71" data-end="233.55">you have you need to react to a couple</span> <span data-start="233.55" data-end="236.82">of choice or you have a lot of a lot of</span> <span data-start="236.82" data-end="240.69">chunk of code to execute but when you</span> <span data-start="240.69" data-end="242.7">have a multiple choices and I just a</span> <span data-start="242.7" data-end="245.39">small a small set of comments I think</span> <span data-start="245.39" data-end="247.59">sweet statement could be a good choice</span> <span data-start="247.59" data-end="250.44">the switch statement works as the</span> <span data-start="250.44" data-end="253.59">following are given an expression inside</span> <span data-start="253.59" data-end="256.95">the parentheses and switch it tries to</span> <span data-start="256.95" data-end="261.39">match with each one of this case</span> <span data-start="261.39" data-end="263.49">statement and when it matches with the</span> <span data-start="263.49" data-end="266.13">first one it yep that's the starting</span> <span data-start="266.13" data-end="269.52">point or point of this block statement</span> <span data-start="269.52" data-end="272.97">and then that's why we have the break</span> <span data-start="272.97" data-end="280.39">statement just to finalize the the block</span> <span data-start="280.4" data-end="285.12">so come back to our initial example this</span> <span data-start="285.12" data-end="288.72">is how we would write something using</span> <span data-start="288.72" data-end="290.88">switch statement there are two things I</span> <span data-start="290.88" data-end="293.19">want to highlight here first I'm not</span> <span data-start="293.19" data-end="296.28">used using a break statement because</span> <span data-start="296.28" data-end="300.419">just by using a return I have my</span> <span data-start="300.419" data-end="302.94">function stopping at that at that line</span> <span data-start="302.94" data-end="304.5">so that's why I don't need to use break</span> <span data-start="304.5" data-end="308.52">and the second thing is people may not</span> <span data-start="308.52" data-end="313.2">get it but the case Staton accepts</span> <span data-start="313.2" data-end="315.69">expression as well so I can put instead</span> <span data-start="315.69" data-end="317.61">of just a constant that this is not most</span> <span data-start="317.61" data-end="321.24">used used use case there you just put a</span> <span data-start="321.24" data-end="323.1">constant and you put this expression in</span> <span data-start="323.1" data-end="325.68">switch so then I swap like I use the X</span> <span data-start="325.68" data-end="328.29">and the constant in switch and I use the</span> <span data-start="328.29" data-end="330.66">expression there</span> <span data-start="330.66" data-end="333.93">so the ternary operator become popular</span> <span data-start="333.93" data-end="336.93">recently because more for the functional</span> <span data-start="336.93" data-end="340.38">developer fan and who tried to write the</span> <span data-start="340.38" data-end="342.09">the code with as much expression as</span> <span data-start="342.09" data-end="344.91">possible it basically works as the</span> <span data-start="344.91" data-end="348.39">following given a condition if this if</span> <span

data-end="363.09">ternary expression eternal is a</span> <span data-start="363.09" data-end="366">expression we can write that function</span> <span data-start="366" data-end="369.54">using error
