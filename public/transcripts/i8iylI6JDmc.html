<span data-start="593.52" data-end="596.52">in a completely transparent way over the</span> <span data-start="596.52" data-end="598.29">real world so things are just overlaid</span> <span data-start="598.29" data-end="601.59">and you can sort of see it's not like</span> <span data-start="601.59" data-end="603.69">putting on you know the Google cardboard</span> <span data-start="603.69" data-end="606.99">blinders you can actually stay in the</span> <span data-start="606.99" data-end="609.12">context of your living room or you know</span> <span data-start="609.12" data-end="610.95">go out into the real world and sort of</span> <span data-start="610.95" data-end="615.99">interact with it naturally but so that's</span> <span data-start="615.99" data-end="617.7">cool like it's cool that sort of we have</span> <span data-start="617.7" data-end="620.61">progressed beyond VR and that this is</span> <span data-start="620.61" data-end="623.34">sort of becoming feasible but as this</span> <span data-start="623.34" data-end="625.77">post called progressive WebEx or which</span> <span data-start="625.77" data-end="629.51">is on the mozilla VR blog points out</span> <span data-start="629.51" data-end="632.55">this is a lot of things there's a lot of</span> <span data-start="632.55" data-end="634.05">there's a lot of new considerations here</span> <span data-start="634.05" data-end="636.27">so the post so the post is called</span> <span data-start="636.27" data-end="638.37">progressive web excite which is sort of</span> <span data-start="638.37" data-end="640.65">like tagging sort of leading on in the</span> <span data-start="640.65" data-end="642.18">tradition of progressive enhancement</span> <span data-start="642.18" data-end="645.18">so whereas progressive enhancement you</span> <span data-start="645.18" data-end="647.04">know a upgrades or web pages</span> <span data-start="647.04" data-end="648.6">capabilities depending on what device</span> <span data-start="648.6" data-end="651.03">you're on this sort of changes the way</span> <span data-start="651.03" data-end="653.31">that the web page is displayed based on</span> <span data-start="653.31" data-end="656.09">what sort of immersive</span> <span data-start="656.09" data-end="660.14">our capability you can have so XR is</span> <span data-start="660.14" data-end="662.51">basically just like a like meta acronym</span> <span data-start="662.51" data-end="666.29">for AR and VR together and in its its</span> <span data-start="666.29" data-end="669.56">web XR because this is all we're focused</span> <span data-start="669.56" data-end="671.78">to just on websites but instead of just</span> <span data-start="671.78" data-end="673.52">having a desktop or just having a mobile</span> <span data-start="673.52" data-end="675.62">version now you can have a mobile AR</span> <span data-start="675.62" data-end="677.33">version or you can have a mobile VR</span> <span data-start="677.33" data-end="679.43">version or a true VR version or</span> <span data-start="679.43" data-end="681.32">eventually write like an AR headset</span> <span data-start="681.32" data-end="683.6">version and so there's a lot to keep</span> <span data-start="683.6" data-end="685.91">straight here and I think it's it's good</span> <span data-start="685.91" data-end="686.99">it's good that we're beginning to</span> <span data-start="686.99" data-end="689.69">develop methodologies around how to sort</span> <span data-start="689.69" data-end="692.3">of how to how to work around all of</span> <span data-start="692.3" data-end="695.05">these all of these sort of constraints</span> <span data-start="695.05" data-end="698.63">and out of this the web via our API</span> <span data-start="698.63" data-end="701.39">itself has been renamed to the WebEx our</span> <span data-start="701.39" data-end="703.79">device API and the working group that is</span> <span data-start="703.79" data-end="706.1">working on it in the w3c is now the</span> <span data-start="706.1" data-end="708.47">immersive web working group and they're</span> <span data-start="708.47" data-end="711.32">actually that's the they used to be the</span> <span data-start="711.32" data-end="714.11">immersive web interest group and the</span> <span data-start="714.11" data-end="715.19">difference between an interest and a</span> <span data-start="715.19" data-end="716.6">working group is that now their actual</span> <span data-start="716.6" data-end="718.4">charge is to publish a spec so that's</span> <span data-start="718.4" data-end="719.78">really exciting</span> <span data-start="719.78" data-end="726.89">and yeah so the the so that that's sort</span> <span data-start="726.89" data-end="728.21">of basically how we got to where we are</span> <span data-start="728.21" data-end="731.51">now right like we have that that it's</span> <span data-start="731.51" data-end="732.71">kind of unsatisfying right it's</span> <span data-start="732.71" data-end="734.36">basically I've said like there's a bunch</span> <span data-start="734.36" data-end="736.01">of problems and we're trying to solve</span> <span data-start="736.01" data-end="739.58">them but I think there's still some good</span> <span data-start="739.58" data-end="740.93">solutions that we've like come up with</span> <span data-start="740.93" data-end="744.62">so a frame is still really viable Google</span> <span data-start="744.62" data-end="746.48">has used it Google and Mozilla both have</span> <span data-start="746.48" data-end="748.19">used it for a bunch of different sort of</span> <span data-start="748.19" data-end="750.59">production projects you can do fancy</span> <span data-start="750.59" data-end="753.14">stuff like Network it you can recreate</span> <span data-start="753.14" data-end="755.87">you know drawing applications it's</span> <span data-start="755.87" data-end="757.73">really useful and really easy it's</span> <span data-start="757.73" data-end="760.16">designed for web designers and people</span> <span data-start="760.16" data-end="763.61">who sort of only know 2d JavaScript to</span> <span data-start="763.61" data-end="765.41">sort of get their feet wet with VR and</span> <span data-start="765.41" data-end="767.57">with WebGL so it's still really</span> <span data-start="767.57" data-end="770.21">accessible way which is and it's good to</span> <span data-start="770.21" data-end="771.68">see that there's so much support around</span> <span data-start="771.68" data-end="774.11">a VR a sort of immersive web library</span> <span data-start="774.11" data-end="777.38">like this Facebook has also gotten into</span> <span data-start="777.38" data-end="779.6">the game it used to be called react VR</span> <span data-start="779.6" data-end="781.67">but now it's just react 360 and it's</span> <span data-start="781.67" data-end="784.94">basically just a it's basically an API</span> <span data-start="784.94" data-end="788.63">that allows react to sort of handle and</span> <span data-start="788.63" data-end="789.49">gracefully</span> <span data-start="789.49" data-end="792.55">display 3d there sorry three yeah 3d and</span> <span data-start="792.55" data-end="796.72">360 video and photos so it's cool to see</span> <span data-start="796.72" data-end="798.19">that people are sort of building around</span> <span data-start="798.19" data-end="801.01">this technology and finally I think one</span> <span data-start="801.01" data-end="802.09">of the things that's most personally</span> <span data-start="802.09" data-end="803.35">exciting to me is that there's this</span> <span data-start="803.35" data-end="804.82">company called eighth wall that actually</span> <span data-start="804.82" data-end="807.97">just like launched their first thing for</span> <span data-start="807.97" data-end="810.75">the the spider-man release last year</span> <span data-start="810.75" data-end="813.45">their whole thing is like a web AR</span> <span data-start="813.45" data-end="816.94">marketing well ideally more applications</span> <span data-start="816.94" data-end="818.17">than marketing but marketing is a pretty</span> <span data-start="818.17" data-end="821.62">obvious one right now but yeah they so</span> <span data-start="821.62" data-end="823.57">this is there isn't you there's no one</span> <span data-start="823.57" data-end="825.7">there's no AR kit or a our core here</span> <span data-start="825.7" data-end="829.42">there's no sort of like on device API</span> <span data-start="829.42" data-end="831.76">being used it's all this is completely</span> <span data-start="831.76" data-end="835.3">running in Safari in the browser in a</span> <span data-start="835.3" data-end="837.55">normal standard browser so it's just</span> <span data-start="837.55" data-end="840.49">really cool to see that companies in you</span> <span data-start="840.49" data-end="841.9">know at the end of 2018 and sort of</span> <span data-start="841.9" data-end="843.46">going into 2019 are actually beginning</span> <span data-start="843.46" data-end="846.18">to invest in VR and they are</span> <span data-start="846.18" data-end="850.15">professionally and then there is some</span> <span data-start="850.15" data-end="852.13">also some exciting stuff sort of</span> <span data-start="852.13" data-end="854.2">happening already in 2019 around the</span> <span data-start="854.2" data-end="857.44">immersive web so the very first thing is</span> <span data-start="857.44" data-end="860.89">that just two days ago on February 5th</span> <span data-start="860.89" data-end="864.76">on Tuesday the first public draft</span> <span data-start="864.76" data-end="867.61">working draft of the WebEx our spec was</span> <span data-start="867.61" data-end="870.49">published and so what this means is that</span> <span data-start="870.49" data-end="873.19">basically now we're like on a track to</span> <span data-start="873.19" data-end="876.7">actually publishing a an actual web X</span> <span data-start="876.7" data-end="879.55">our spec which means it'll go to you</span> <span data-start="879.55" data-end="880.93">know the Safari that you know and love</span> <span data-start="880.93" data-end="884.53">and Firefox and Chrome and every other</span> <span data-start="884.53" data-end="887.14">browser and Samsung browsers and opera</span> <span data-start="887.14" data-end="889.78">etcetera etcetera right whatever browser</span> <span data-start="889.78" data-end="891.34">decides to implement it they can</span> <span data-start="891.34" data-end="893.77">implement it knowing that the API won't</span> <span data-start="893.77" data-end="895.27">all of a sudden change and you know</span> <span data-start="895.27" data-end="896.44">three months and then they'll have to</span> <span data-start="896.44" data-end="898.21">scrap a bunch of their engineering work</span> <span data-start="898.21" data-end="900.94">so it's really exciting to see the API</span> <span data-start="900.94" data-end="904.15">sort of reach maturity and along with</span> <span data-start="904.15" data-end="906.31">this it also means that like</span> <span data-start="906.31" data-end="908.53">experimental implementations that have</span> <span data-start="908.53" data-end="910.96">been built around the draft version of</span> <span data-start="910.96" data-end="913.09">the webex our API will hopefully get</span> <span data-start="913.09" data-end="915.54">better so there are a couple projects</span> <span data-start="915.54" data-end="918.61">one is from Google well there there's</span> <span data-start="918.61" data-end="920.65">there under two names but it's this</span> <span data-start="920.65" data-end="922.04">they're basically the same thing</span> <span data-start="922.04" data-end="924.62">fusing the Safari or the Chrome browser</span> <span data-start="924.62" data-end="928.42">on Android and iOS devices respectfully</span> <span data-start="928.42" data-end="933.199">to a 3GS session and so this really</span> <span data-start="933.199" data-end="936.13">gives you really really two accurate AR</span> <span data-start="936.13" data-end="939.259">capabilities with just a smartphone or</span> <span data-start="939.259" data-end="941.06">just an iPad as you can see in the gif</span> <span data-start="941.06" data-end="944.389">here and that those cubes are actually</span> <span data-start="944.389" data-end="946.43">rendered just using regular WebGL so</span> <span data-start="946.43" data-end="948.47">basically as long as you use this custom</span> <span data-start="948.47" data-end="950.329">browser you're able to sort of prototype</span> <span data-start="950.329" data-end="953">with what the webex our API could look</span> <span data-start="953" data-end="956.47">like and Mozilla has a similar effort</span> <span data-start="956.47" data-end="958.88">they actually published an iOS app that</span> <span data-start="958.88" data-end="961.37">makes this process super easy so you can</span> <span data-start="961.37" data-end="962.93">just make a normal web page and as long</span> <span data-start="962.93" data-end="965.06">as you visit it in this special little</span> <span data-start="965.06" data-end="968.36">iOS app or or custom compiled an Android</span> <span data-start="968.36" data-end="971.99">app you can sort of use regular WebGL or</span> <span data-start="971.99" data-end="975.5">3GS and and sort of begin to play around</span> <span data-start="975.5" data-end="977.81">with really experimental really sort of</span> <span data-start="977.81" data-end="982.67">spatial computing concepts and then yeah</span> <span data-start="982.67" data-end="984.529">so that's that's that's so basically all</span> <span data-start="984.529" data-end="988.55">that I have for the immersive web the</span> <span data-start="988.55" data-end="991.01">immersive web itself and I'm really</span> <span data-start="991.01" data-end="993.41">excited for sort of to see like to have</span> <span data-start="993.41" data-end="995.5">seen this like years long progression</span> <span data-start="995.5" data-end="1001.87">into 2018 and 2019 but yeah so one last</span> <span data-start="1001.87" data-end="1004.63">thing is that I've actually just sort of</span> <span data-start="1004.63" data-end="1007.18">started a consulting business and I</span> <span data-start="1007.18" data-end="1010.98">don't actually want to have clients and</span> <span data-start="1010.98" data-end="1014.5">so basically I I'm putting this slide</span> <span data-start="1014.5" data-end="1016.48">here not for asking for work basically</span> <span data-start="1016.48" data-end="1017.589">if you're interested in the immersive</span> <span data-start="1017.589" data-end="1019.48">web if you want to learn more if you</span> <span data-start="1019.48" data-end="1021.43">want to talk to me this is a good way to</span> <span data-start="1021.43" data-end="1023.28">do it and have a bunch of free time now</span> <span data-start="1023.28" data-end="1027.01">so yeah if you can either reach me here</span> <span data-start="1027.01" data-end="1030.189">or at these other various places on the</span> <span data-start="1030.189" data-end="1032.72">internet yeah thank you</span> <span data-start="1032.72" data-end="1034.62">[Applause]</span> <span data-start="1034.62" data-end="1034.8">you</span> </p>
