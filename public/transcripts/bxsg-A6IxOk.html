data-start="252.36" data-end="256.62">you cannot give in any other way so how</span> <span data-start="256.62" data-end="259.739">do you do parallax in web design this</span> <span data-start="259.739" data-end="262.98">was one of the challenges when I started</span> <span data-start="262.98" data-end="265.56">with this talk there are so many ways of</span> <span

data-end="274.35">the other one is Suzanne</span> <span data-start="274.35" data-end="277.65">library CSS or something called pillar</span> <span data-start="277.65" data-end="280.95">which is not

data-start="298.8" data-end="301.98">important about the CSS is that you must</span> <span data-start="301.98" data-end="304.71">generate overflow because without</span> <span data-start="304.71" data-end="307.11">overflow parallax really doesn't work</span> <span data-start="307.11" data-end="311.46">and then info which is this red thing</span> <span data-start="311.46" data-end="314.61">about and must be relative if it's not</span> <span data-start="314.61" data-end="318.47">relative then you will have this problem</span> <span data-start="318.47" data-end="322.68">that when you apply parallax the image</span> <span data-start="322.68" data-end="324.81">will cover the text and you will be able</span> <span data-start="324.81"

relative and wiped out</span> <span data-start="343.11" data-end="346.83">when we apply parallax in this in this</span> <span data-start="346.83" data-end="350.4">form we will apply it through transform</span> <span data-start="350.4" data-end="352.89">property it's a CSS turn for property</span> <span data-start="352.89" data-end="357.33">and we're not really telling the image</span> <span data-start="357.33" data-end="360.33">to be relative or absolute or fixed so</span> <span data-start="360.33" data-end="364.26">why does it cover the text well because</span> <span data-start="364.26" data-end="369">the transform property and create the</span> <span data-start="369" data-end="370.77">hips like position relative when Tim it</span> <span data-start="370.77" data-end="372.87">means that grace and us talking context</span> <span data-start="372.87" data-end="376.2">so that means its original space is</span> <span data-start="376.2" data-end="380.1">still occupied but with it this

<span data-start="386.85" data-end="389.34">a static when we apply transform</span> <span data-start="389.34" data-end="391.5">property to it it's al aliy wicka wicka</span> <span data-start="391.5" data-end="395.91">and becomes relative it's a strange but</span> <span data-start="395.91" data-end="400.08">it does so info must be relative a list</span> <span data-start="400.08" data-end="404.79">or have AC index so when we have the CSS</span> <span data-start="404.79" data-end="406.68">then we apply some shake wearing any</span> <span data-start="406.68" data-end="407.969">version of jQuery</span> <span data-start="407.969" data-end="410.819">will do and then we write some jQuery</span> <span data-start="410.819" data-end="413.879">it's not that

data-end="820.54">the only problem is that once you play</span> <span data-start="820.54" data-end="823.66">it you cannot replay it that's the</span> <span data-start="823.66"

out a cure hmm well can't you get a</span> <span data-start="860.83" data-end="865.6">layer it works and then you are these</span> <span data-start="865.6" data-end="868.81">thing with cheese and well

data-end="907.84">different with parallax and it doesn't</span> <span data-start="907.84" data-end="909.43">give the sensation of perspective</span> <span data-start="909.43" data-end="911.32">because there is known perspective in</span> <span data-start="911.32" data-end="914.32">this but you don't write a line of code</span> <span data-start="914.32" data-end="919.21">in JavaScript or CSS additional so Oh</span> <span data-start="919.21" data-end="922.17">what our final recommendations for</span> <span data-start="922.17" data-end="926.459">parallax well first of all and</span> <span data-start="926.459" data-end="929.589">responsive first then animations them</span> <span data-start="929.589" data-end="932.11">parallax than everything when you apply</span> <span data-start="932.11" data-end="935.76">parallax to a website you destroy the</span> <span data-start="935.76" data-end="938.11">the organization and the flow of the</span> <span data-start="938.11" data-end="940.149">content because you begin creating</span> <span data-start="940.149" data-end="943.18">relative absolute and fixed elements and</span> <span data-start="943.18" data-end="946.06">everything's closed crazy so if you</span> <span data-start="946.06" data-end="947.86">apply parallax before making your web</span> <span data-start="947.86" data-end="951.07">site for mobile or responsive then at</span> <span data-start="951.07" data-end="952.57">the time you want you to make you want</span> <span data-start="952.57" data-end="954.67">to make it responsive you go Gracie</span> <span data-start="954.67" data-end="956.649">because I or the whole of your website</span> <span data-start="956.649" data-end="959.649">is kind of weird so make responsive</span> <span data-start="959.649" data-end="961.839">first and then up the animation of the</span> <span data-start="961.839" data-end="966.25">parallax but parallax and especially a</span> <span data-start="966.25" data-end="967.99">scroller doesn't work really well</span> <span data-start="967.99" data-end="970.72">neither on mobile devices and on touch</span> <span data-start="970.72" data-end="973.51">devices what can you do about it you can</span> <span data-start="973.51" data-end="977.56">turn it off with inquiries or and you</span> <span data-start="977.56" data-end="979.63">can use moderniser to turn it off on</span> <span data-start="979.63" data-end="982.57">touchscreens yes because touch screens</span> <span data-start="982.57" data-end="984.97">and parallax and especially scroller</span> <span data-start="984.97" data-end="987.66">like don't get along really well and</span> <span data-start="987.66" data-end="989.92">what else it's better to animate</span> <span data-start="989.92" data-end="992.16">transform property and opacity</span> <span data-start="992.16" data-end="995.8">transforming in scale askew rotate and</span> <span data-start="995.8" data-end="998.709">translate because those are cheaper and</span> <span data-start="998.709" data-end="1000.18">they were better they have better</span> <span data-start="1000.18" data-end="1003.75">performance and opacity as well and if</span> <span data-start="1003.75" data-end="1005.73">you want to animate colors you cannot</span> <span data-start="1005.73" data-end="1009.66">use Excel SML and because you cannot go</span> <span data-start="1009.66" data-end="1013.05">through an f 20 there's no transition</span> <span data-start="1013.05" data-end="1015.51">between them you have to use our cpa or</span> <span data-start="1015.51" data-end="1019.35">hsl and simply because you can go</span> <span data-start="1019.35" data-end="1023.88">through 255 20 but no from f20 it</span> <span data-start="1023.88" data-end="1027.72">doesn't work that is simple changing the</span> <span data-start="1027.72" data-end="1030.75">mode the color mode and don't go crazy</span> <span data-start="1030.75" data-end="1032.97">over absolute position in because</span> <span data-start="1032.97" data-end="1034.89">there's this idea that I have two</span> <span data-start="1034.89" data-end="1037.26">absolution everything and</span> <span data-start="1037.26" data-end="1039.57">it's not really necessary because once</span> <span data-start="1039.57" data-end="1041.64">you apply transform the element will</span> <span data-start="1041.64" data-end="1044.85">have as the index and you can apply</span> <span data-start="1044.85" data-end="1047.55">relative the only problem with up to the</span> <span data-start="1047.55" data-end="1050.31">positioning it does is really like the</span> <span data-start="1050.31" data-end="1052.8">black sheep of the family because it's</span> <span data-start="1052.8" data-end="1057.3">and just like a rebellion in it and it</span> <span data-start="1057.3" data-end="1059.91">does whatever you wants so you have to</span> <span data-start="1059.91" data-end="1061.98">be certain that you can handle a lot of</span> <span data-start="1061.98" data-end="1064.98">absolute elements otherwise i recommend</span> <span data-start="1064.98" data-end="1068.13">you to go for a relative or fixed</span> <span data-start="1068.13" data-end="1071.25">elements but on the other hand absolute</span> <span data-start="1071.25" data-end="1073.32">and fitch have better performance than</span> <span data-start="1073.32" data-end="1076.89">relative so you can like go from one on</span> <span data-start="1076.89" data-end="1082.44">the order so and go soon and choose the</span> <span data-start="1082.44"
