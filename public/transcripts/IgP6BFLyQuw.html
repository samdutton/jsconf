<p><span data-start="138.79" data-end="141.69">So we're writing a ton of java script.</span> <span data-start="141.69" data-end="149.41">And in fact, by using compression, we were saving about 50% of all that JavaScript traffic.</span> <span data-start="149.41" data-end="151.849">So that's why I wanted to talk about compression.</span> <span data-start="151.849" data-end="159.62">I know I lured you in here by Phil Collins, but we won't actually do any Phil Collins.</span> <span data-start="159.62" data-end="160.909">It's just HTTP compression.</span> <span data-start="160.909" data-end="163.299">I'm really sorry.</span> <span data-start="163.299" data-end="165.8">So what is compression?</span> <span data-start="165.8" data-end="172.909">You start off with a file that, for example, index HTML will look something like this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="172.909" data-end="173.909">Right?</span> <span data-start="173.909" data-end="175.56">You compress it.</span> <span data-start="175.56" data-end="177.81">And hopefully it works.</span> <span data-start="177.81" data-end="180.42">Compress it, compress it, compress it.</span> <span data-start="180.42" data-end="185.109">And then at some point you end up with a much smaller output.</span> <span data-start="185.109" data-end="190.65">So if you were to, like, the compress file, looks wonkier, much different than the first</span> <span data-start="190.65" data-end="193.73">one we had to begin with.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="193.73" data-end="194.73">Cool.</span> <span data-start="194.73" data-end="200.19">And a bunch of that, if you think about it, if it happens over HTTP, you have the client</span> <span data-start="200.19" data-end="205.62">talking with each other and you want to pass in the information.</span> <span data-start="205.62" data-end="212.379">What the client says, is I'm going to accept some types of compression.</span> <span data-start="212.379" data-end="219.56">These and these, that goes under code header.</span> <span data-start="219.56" data-end="227.459">Cool, I'm reading that through, but I'll send it based on whatever you can accept.</span> <span data-start="227.459" data-end="236.629">So if the client says I'll do Deflate, G zip, it will send in whatever it feels is necessary.</span> <span data-start="236.629" data-end="237.83">What are these names?</span> <span data-start="237.83" data-end="240.629">They're a little bit confusing.</span> <span data-start="240.629" data-end="245.11">Let's kind of work through these as we go through the talk.</span> <span data-start="245.11" data-end="251.18">So if you were to actually look into your headers and stuff like that in your console,</span> <span data-start="251.18" data-end="257.419">you can see that the accept encoding could be seen through the request headers and then</span> <span data-start="257.419" data-end="261.12">if you were to look at the response headers, they're just the same.</span> <span data-start="261.12" data-end="265.8">And that's what the� that's what the page sends you back.</span> <span data-start="265.8" data-end="268.55">Finally, this is from acceptance coding.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="268.55" data-end="269.569">Cool.</span> <span data-start="269.569" data-end="277.13">So a lot of these� a lot of these compression things started off with something called Deflate.</span> <span data-start="277.13" data-end="282.56">That's kind of the basic algorithm that most of these will use.</span> <span data-start="282.56" data-end="285.92">Things like Gzip.</span> <span data-start="285.92" data-end="291.629">But Deflate is a basis of two Huffman and LZ77.</span> <span data-start="291.629" data-end="296.25">And these are kind of compression algorithms that take in a bunch of data and see whether</span> <span data-start="296.25" data-end="303.16">or not it's similar in one way or another and look at distances between similar codings.</span> <span data-start="303.16" data-end="309.02">I won't talk too much about them because it's a little bit boring.</span> <span data-start="309.02" data-end="313.949">So I have a bunch of sketched notes on those two in particular so you can look at those</span> <span data-start="313.949" data-end="314.949">later.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="314.949" data-end="316.24">But I will talk about Deflate.</span> <span data-start="316.24" data-end="320.33">Deflate is the basis for everything else to begin with.</span> <span data-start="320.33" data-end="327.03">So Deflate's used to quite� quite primarily with PNGs and Gzip.</span> <span data-start="327.03" data-end="330.01">Those are the ones we're used to seeing to begin with.</span> <span data-start="330.01" data-end="332.099">What it is a stream of blocks.</span> <span data-start="332.099" data-end="334.699">All of these compression things are streams.</span> <span data-start="334.699" data-end="337.979">With Deflate, stream of blocks.</span> <span data-start="337.979" data-end="340.88">That each block is individually made up of three different bits.</span> <span data-start="340.88" data-end="345.159">And the first one is the one that indicates whether or not there will be more data coming</span> <span data-start="345.159" data-end="347.889">through in your stream of data.</span> <span data-start="347.889" data-end="352.2">One means we're done here, we can close out that stream.</span> <span data-start="352.2" data-end="354.759">And zero means there will be more stuff coming in.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="354.759" data-end="356.889">So it's binary.</span> <span data-start="356.889" data-end="362.97">The second bit, it passes on the actual raw data and the block.</span> <span data-start="362.97" data-end="368.849">The ones they talked about that I won't actually mention as much.</span> <span data-start="368.849" data-end="370.759">And the rest of it is a little bit more dynamic.</span> <span data-start="370.759" data-end="378.379">So it's the dynamic blocks and the table that kind of references all the other ones to themselves.</span> <span data-start="378.379" data-end="380.78">And there's like a little bit that you don't touch.</span> <span data-start="380.78" data-end="386.25">So that's kind of what a single individual Deflate look looks like.</span> <span data-start="386.25" data-end="387.56">Awesome.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="387.56" data-end="395.38">And so the mention that I will do with LZAT77 and Huffman, is the compression works with</span> <span data-start="395.38" data-end="399.509">the pointers, and the pointers are handled by the 77.</span> <span data-start="399.509" data-end="404.889">And when we talk about weighted symbols with and symbols in general and how these are a</span> <span data-start="404.889" data-end="410.08">lot more than a letter A, has a lot more meaning.</span> <span data-start="410.08" data-end="411.08">So that's Deflate.</span> <span data-start="411.08" data-end="415.24">And all of these other ones are basis of that.</span> <span data-start="415.24" data-end="420.3">And the one we hear a lot more about than Deflate is Gzip compression.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="420.3" data-end="424.199">Those are the ones that most of the content on the Internet actually moves through.</span> <span data-start="424.199" data-end="426.82">So Gzip is kind of cool.</span> <span data-start="426.82" data-end="432.819">And an implementation of that, that's probably the mostused software library out there, maybe</span> <span data-start="432.819" data-end="436.229">after like MySQL lite, is zlib.</span> <span data-start="436.229" data-end="444.199">It's the one that actually has a noted limitation.</span> <span data-start="444.199" data-end="446.15">That's the one we'll talk about in a bit.</span> <span data-start="446.15" data-end="450.729">So you get a little bit more control over processing and memory.</span> <span data-start="450.729" data-end="455.83">So that means that you can create a tradeoff as to Whether or not you want a more compressed</span> <span data-start="455.83" data-end="458.349">content or you want it to be faster.</span> <span data-start="458.349" data-end="460.539">That's how you get around it.</span> <span data-start="460.539" data-end="465.86">And it comes with three levels that you can do to create that kind of compression.</span> <span data-start="465.86" data-end="469.699">So on level one or level zero, you don't do any compression.</span> <span data-start="469.699" data-end="474.96">But on level nine you are able to compress content a lot further and you are able to</span> <span data-start="474.96" data-end="481.3">go back further in your static blocks to copy content over and pass it through.</span> <span data-start="481.3" data-end="486.8">So what would be cool is if we do a little bit of work with zlib.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="486.8" data-end="488.83">So I mostly wrote node.</span> <span data-start="488.83" data-end="495.12">And so zlib is a builtin API in Node.</span> <span data-start="495.12" data-end="499.75">So I want to� what I want to do is actually� let's work through it and see what we can</span> <span data-start="499.75" data-end="507.44">do in terms of compressing content as we serve our files over to the client.</span> <span data-start="507.44" data-end="513.889">So let's actually do that.</span> <span data-start="513.889" data-end="515.909">Awesome.</span> <span data-start="515.909" data-end="522.43">So I kind of started us off� yeah.</span> <span data-start="522.43" data-end="528.04">There's a lull in case of forget file.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="528.04" data-end="532.399">So I started us off with having an HTTP.</span> <span data-start="532.399" data-end="535.55">We'll have assessed because we wanted to create a stream.</span> <span data-start="535.55" data-end="537.95">When we serve stuff over.</span> <span data-start="537.95" data-end="540.98">And I've started us off with actually having a server.</span> <span data-start="540.98" data-end="541.98">Cool.</span> <span data-start="541.98" data-end="550.649">And so when I was mentioning previously what the client does is it says, I'm going to accept</span> <span data-start="550.649" data-end="552.65">certain types of encoding.</span> <span data-start="552.65" data-end="559.56">And based on those types of encoding, we should be able to work with certain types of data.</span> <span data-start="559.56" data-end="561.32">So I said we'll be working with zlib.</span> <span data-start="561.32" data-end="568.72">So actually, let's get zlib in here.</span> <span data-start="568.72" data-end="570.2">And we'll be using streams.</span> <span data-start="570.2" data-end="574.51">So I'm just going to require pump.</span> <span data-start="574.51" data-end="579.37">And pump is a nonbroken version of pipe.</span> <span data-start="579.37" data-end="580.72">[ Laughter ] Whoops.</span> <span data-start="580.72" data-end="584.79">Did I say that out loud?</span> <span data-start="584.79" data-end="588.67">I was just getting there� cool.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="588.67" data-end="593.7">So what we want to be able to do is we want to have a source.</span> <span data-start="593.7" data-end="601.19">So this will be our stream.</span> <span data-start="601.19" data-end="605.1">So we'll have a stream that takes in our indexed HTML.</span> <span data-start="605.1" data-end="611.43">And I should have an indexed HTML�in here.</span> <span data-start="611.43" data-end="613.06">Cool.</span> <span data-start="613.06" data-end="617.67">And what we want to be able to do is based on this accept header that we get, we want</span> <span data-start="617.67" data-end="622.899">to do different types of content.</span> <span data-start="622.899" data-end="644.79">So this would be a basic match for Gzip and I'll get the index in a bit because I forgot.</span> <span data-start="644.79" data-end="659.2">So we'll be working with either Gzip or Deflate.</span> <span data-start="659.2" data-end="672.199">Now we'll actually copy the matches over because there's a little bit easier.</span> <span data-start="672.199" data-end="677.709">And then based on that particular match that is Deflate, I want to be able to create a</span> <span data-start="677.709" data-end="680.64">Deflate compressed file.</span> <span data-start="680.64" data-end="687.15">And what pump does is it takes your source and it handles your operation, handles your</span> <span data-start="687.15" data-end="690.339">output, which is the response.</span> <span data-start="690.339" data-end="694.04">And I also have a handler that does the error handling for us.</span> <span data-start="694.04" data-end="701.12">And then what else I want is just like to be able to make sure that whatever's the response</span> <span data-start="701.12" data-end="703.029">that comes out is fine.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="703.029" data-end="710.62">So our content encoding here is� I'm stuck.</span> <span data-start="710.62" data-end="712.589">Oh.</span> <span data-start="712.589" data-end="714.199">I'm on a different keyboard.</span> <span data-start="714.199" data-end="715.5">I'm sorry.</span> <span data-start="715.5" data-end="723.36">Persian is not going to work in� neither will Russian.</span> <span data-start="723.36" data-end="725.029">Cool.</span> <span data-start="725.029" data-end="733.18">So I'll copy these over as well to go a little bit faster.</span> <span data-start="733.18" data-end="738.519">And then if we have a Gzip kind of content we will then do the same thing.</span> <span data-start="738.519" data-end="740.38">Zlib has a Gzip implementation.</span> <span data-start="740.38" data-end="747.509">Zlib will always have a G zip implementation, the Node API.</span> <span data-start="747.509" data-end="750.07">And do the same thing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="750.07" data-end="751.079">Pump it over.</span> <span data-start="751.079" data-end="752.079">Okay.</span> <span data-start="752.079" data-end="753.079">Awesome.</span> <span data-start="753.079" data-end="755.13">So let's actually test this out.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="755.13" data-end="760.639">Because we want to be able to see whether the content will actually get.</span> <span data-start="760.639" data-end="768.389">So let's start up a Node server.</span> <span data-start="768.389" data-end="775.7">And what we want to do is we want to be able to curl the command.</span> <span data-start="775.7" data-end="777.079">And we need to pass in headers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="777.079" data-end="779.009">Because that's what basically we're looking for.</span> <span data-start="779.009" data-end="789.79">So the headers is accept encoding.</span> <span data-start="789.79" data-end="792.07">And that would be Gzip.</span> <span data-start="792.07" data-end="799.509">Let's start off with G zip and local host.</span> <span data-start="799.509" data-end="806.3">And I've done this literally every time the command is header.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="806.3" data-end="809.779">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="809.779" data-end="822.44">Funny story, my track pad stopped working yesterday.</span> <span data-start="822.44" data-end="823.48">Okay.</span> <span data-start="823.48" data-end="828.69">We'll type it out again.</span> <span data-start="828.69" data-end="836.49">And we'll actually get the information right away to be able to see this.</span> <span data-start="836.49" data-end="841.649">So header is accept encoding.</span> <span data-start="841.649" data-end="844.69">And it's G zip, again.</span> <span data-start="844.69" data-end="848.19">And local host.</span> <span data-start="848.19" data-end="850.76">Cool.</span> <span data-start="850.76" data-end="853.529">That actually did not get zipped.</span> <span data-start="853.529" data-end="858.149">That's not cool.</span> <span data-start="858.149" data-end="861.209">But what we can see is it's going through okay.</span> <span data-start="861.209" data-end="864.759">Well, at least we get the file back.</span> <span data-start="864.759" data-end="867.92">So let's go back to our editor.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="867.92" data-end="876.22">So that's� should be lower cased is the issue.</span> <span data-start="876.22" data-end="878.5">And if we go back.</span> <span data-start="878.5" data-end="879.5">No.</span> <span data-start="879.5" data-end="880.91">That's still not working.</span> <span data-start="880.91" data-end="881.91">Cool.</span> <span data-start="881.91" data-end="882.91">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="882.91" data-end="887.48">Probably a good idea.</span> <span data-start="887.48" data-end="889.899">Ha.</span> <span data-start="889.899" data-end="892.309">Cool.</span> <span data-start="892.309" data-end="896.56">[ Applause ] And what would be kind of interesting to see</span> <span data-start="896.56" data-end="900.649">here is actually how much space this takes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="900.649" data-end="904.66">So what we can do is� huh?</span> <span data-start="904.66" data-end="908.52">Okay, you can't see the bottom.</span> <span data-start="908.52" data-end="910.3">Cool.</span> <span data-start="910.3" data-end="917.44">That would be important.</span> <span data-start="917.44" data-end="922.009">I think my keyboard also stopped working.</span> <span data-start="922.009" data-end="925.44">Awesome.</span> <span data-start="925.44" data-end="937.72">So what we also want to do is� is maybe just see some output.</span> <span data-start="937.72" data-end="941.37">Okay.</span> <span data-start="941.37" data-end="945.85">We'll silence everything else and then we'll still pass it in the header.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="945.85" data-end="962">Which is accept encoding, G zip� and then what we'll do is we'll pipe it over and just</span> <span data-start="962" data-end="965.5">look at the word count.</span> <span data-start="965.5" data-end="967.65">Which is 235 with Deflate.</span> <span data-start="967.65" data-end="972.88">I'm going to minus this a bit.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="972.88" data-end="982.73">Just for a second.</span> <span data-start="982.73" data-end="990.34">And then what else we wanted to do is compare it to what a Deflate output would look like</span> <span data-start="990.34" data-end="991.649">instead.</span> <span data-start="991.649" data-end="993.99">And kind of do the same thing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="993.99" data-end="997.819">So it will also compress, but the word count should be a little bit different.</span> <span data-start="997.819" data-end="1000.06">There is 305.</span> <span data-start="1000.06" data-end="1005.32">So Gzip is smaller than what a Deflatecompatible thing is.</span> <span data-start="1005.32" data-end="1007.86">Which is kind of interesting.</span> <span data-start="1007.86" data-end="1013.64">So that was kind of the Zlib example I wanted to show you, which is neat.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1013.64" data-end="1019.41">And then let's look at other methods that you could use.</span> <span data-start="1019.41" data-end="1027.98">So we looked at like 305 Deflate, 235 Gzip just so you keep those in mind.</span> <span data-start="1027.98" data-end="1030">Cool.</span> <span data-start="1030" data-end="1031.699">Another one I wanted to talk about is Broccoli.</span> <span data-start="1031.699" data-end="1037.689">It's been in out in the wild for about a year or two.</span> <span data-start="1037.689" data-end="1041.309">So it's a fairly new kind of way of compressing.</span> <span data-start="1041.309" data-end="1045.959">And what it does, it's specifically was made to handle HTTP compression.</span> <span data-start="1045.959" data-end="1048.209">So it's made specifically for web development.</span> <span data-start="1048.209" data-end="1049.809">Which is kind of cool.</span> <span data-start="1049.809" data-end="1055.46">If we look and go back into this stream of blocks that Deflate does.</span> <span data-start="1055.46" data-end="1060.51">A single block has the literals, if you don't think about it in bits that I was talking</span> <span data-start="1060.51" data-end="1061.6">about before.</span> <span data-start="1061.6" data-end="1064.44">Has literals and a length and a distance.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1064.44" data-end="1069.1">So like the pointers and then the weighted symbols.</span> <span data-start="1069.1" data-end="1070.1">That's Deflate.</span> <span data-start="1070.1" data-end="1074.44">And for Broccoli, a single block is actually a set of commands.</span> <span data-start="1074.44" data-end="1075.65">You can see at the bottom.</span> <span data-start="1075.65" data-end="1081.02">So instead of just actually these interpretations, it's a set of commands.</span> <span data-start="1081.02" data-end="1087.42">And then what it has is insert, copy, distance, and actual insert literals.</span> <span data-start="1087.42" data-end="1093.059">And what's interesting about this is that normally weighted symbols have a dictionary</span> <span data-start="1093.059" data-end="1097.559">that you only insert while working in a specific window.</span> <span data-start="1097.559" data-end="1102.85">But what you can do is go back further at any point in time instead of just in a specific</span> <span data-start="1102.85" data-end="1105.59">window and apply that dictionary.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1105.59" data-end="1108.44">Which makes for a much smaller compressed file.</span> <span data-start="1108.44" data-end="1110.13">Which is neat.</span> <span data-start="1110.13" data-end="1116.62">But it also comes with a dictionary of commonlyused HTML terms, which is, again, specifically</span> <span data-start="1116.62" data-end="1121.12">made for HTTP compression so makes for a much smaller file.</span> <span data-start="1121.12" data-end="1123.83">But at the base, you can tweak it.</span> <span data-start="1123.83" data-end="1130.87">But at its base it's much slower and you have to wait a little bit longer for the compression</span> <span data-start="1130.87" data-end="1131.87">to happen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1131.87" data-end="1137.56">So a lot of the times it gets used when it's static content rather than doing it on the</span> <span data-start="1137.56" data-end="1138.95">fly.</span> <span data-start="1138.95" data-end="1145.6">And what I wanted to show you now is actually being able to use this library I found called</span> <span data-start="1145.6" data-end="1150.96">Broccoli backwards, because I can pronounce that.</span> <span data-start="1150.96" data-end="1162.25">And actually, so you should be able to see the difference kind of between the two things.</span> <span data-start="1162.25" data-end="1166.18">Okay.</span> <span data-start="1166.18" data-end="1169.01">So let's start up another file.</span> <span data-start="1169.01" data-end="1181.32">And</span> <span data-start="1181.32" data-end="1182.32">what will� oh.</span> <span data-start="1182.32" data-end="1188.09">What we'll need is kind of the same deal.</span> <span data-start="1188.09" data-end="1194.11">It's just copied over.</span> <span data-start="1194.11" data-end="1203.549">We need Zlib and I'll just call it compress.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1203.549" data-end="1207.02">Okay, backwards.</span> <span data-start="1207.02" data-end="1210.48">Tr� no.</span> <span data-start="1210.48" data-end="1219.77">Oh, so we'll use pump and we'll still use this.</span> <span data-start="1219.77" data-end="1227.51">And we'll still do it on the fly rather than actually compressing files� static files.</span> <span data-start="1227.51" data-end="1230.779">Just so you see the difference.</span> <span data-start="1230.779" data-end="1233.159">Okay.</span> <span data-start="1233.159" data-end="1234.71">Let's not worry about the headers.</span> <span data-start="1234.71" data-end="1236.179">We'll still need a source.</span> <span data-start="1236.179" data-end="1242.75">Let's not worry about having these.</span> <span data-start="1242.75" data-end="1254.67">What we'll have is, then, instead of having compressed, we'll create a stream with this</span> <span data-start="1254.67" data-end="1256.45">stuff.</span> <span data-start="1256.45" data-end="1265.37">I think it's "Create stream"?</span> <span data-start="1265.37" data-end="1267.15">Ah.</span> <span data-start="1267.15" data-end="1268.94">Maybe.</span> <span data-start="1268.94" data-end="1274.19">That is correct.</span> <span data-start="1274.19" data-end="1286.7">It's called this��create stream.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1286.7" data-end="1289.83">Awesome.</span> <span data-start="1289.83" data-end="1295.47">Let's again start up a server.</span> <span data-start="1295.47" data-end="1297.87">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="1297.87" data-end="1301.95">And let's look at� I mean, the compressed file is going to look the same.</span> <span data-start="1301.95" data-end="1305.779">I want to look at what the word count is like.</span> <span data-start="1305.779" data-end="1309.559">So we'll do the same thing.</span> <span data-start="1309.559" data-end="1313.85">We kind of don't need to send in headers, I think, but it doesn't matter.</span> <span data-start="1313.85" data-end="1316.09">And also look at the word count.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1316.09" data-end="1317.09">Oh.</span> <span data-start="1317.09" data-end="1320.08">Well, the word count didn't work.</span> <span data-start="1320.08" data-end="1325.529">Create stream is not a function.</span> <span data-start="1325.529" data-end="1330.27">Okay.</span> <span data-start="1330.27" data-end="1340.37">There's a bunch of different methods, so you can do asynchronous.</span> <span data-start="1340.37" data-end="1341.46">I like this stuff.</span> <span data-start="1341.46" data-end="1348.7">It's create stream� cool.</span> <span data-start="1348.7" data-end="1351.669">That would make sense.</span> <span data-start="1351.669" data-end="1356.36">You're compressing.</span> <span data-start="1356.36" data-end="1358.72">Okay.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1358.72" data-end="1364.659">And we were going to need a server again.</span> <span data-start="1364.659" data-end="1370.69">Which is like 148, which is neat.</span> <span data-start="1370.69" data-end="1371.69">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="1371.69" data-end="1373.669">So there's that.</span> <span data-start="1373.669" data-end="1376.84">And that's how Broccoli works.</span> <span data-start="1376.84" data-end="1387.049">If we need to, actually, I think, in� I think it's super neat to be able to work with</span> <span data-start="1387.049" data-end="1391.27">something that's more static so you're probably going to have a ton of images.</span> <span data-start="1391.27" data-end="1395.36">You're probably going to have a ton of static assets you want to share.</span> <span data-start="1395.36" data-end="1401.299">If they're taking up your space, it's nice to use it.</span> <span data-start="1401.299" data-end="1404.23">And most major browsers will accept it.</span> <span data-start="1404.23" data-end="1407.2">All� the big four.</span> <span data-start="1407.2" data-end="1414.82">The big four are all on board, so Edge, Firefox, the big three and Chrome are all accepting.</span> <span data-start="1414.82" data-end="1416.23">I'm to the sure about Safari.</span> <span data-start="1416.23" data-end="1417.309">So you'll have that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1417.309" data-end="1424.32">And then when you're working with your usual kind of bundles of JavaScript and CSS, working</span> <span data-start="1424.32" data-end="1429.76">with something like G zip if you're not already doing that.</span> <span data-start="1429.76" data-end="1433.96">We went through the example.</span> <span data-start="1433.96" data-end="1440.51">So I wanted to kind of show you what it is like to kind of work with HTTP compression.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1440.51" data-end="1446.02">I hope you learned something about Zlib and I hope you get to use it in your daytoday</span> <span data-start="1446.02" data-end="1447.02">work.</span> <span data-start="1447.02" data-end="1448.02">Thanks.</span> </p>
