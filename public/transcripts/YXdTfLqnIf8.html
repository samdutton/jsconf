we're all here</span> <span data-start="151.25" data-end="152.959">because we love JavaScript well then</span> <span data-start="152.959" data-end="154.879">that javascript is really easy to learn</span> <span data-start="154.879" data-end="157.239">but it's even harder to learn completely</span> <span data-start="157.239" data-end="161.03">so once I fit this we're gonna enter the</span>

data-end="217.459">here this fail number instead so yeah</span> <span data-start="217.459" data-end="219.349">you know the problem with nan is that</span> <span data-start="219.349" data-end="221.06">perhaps the label name is a little bit</span> <span data-start="221.06" data-end="222.919">misleading maybe it would be easier to</span> <span data-start="222.919" data-end="224.599">think of it as our own fail number</span> <span data-start="224.599" data-end="226.489">invalid number back numbered I'm</span> <span data-start="226.489" data-end="228.59">thinking of it as not a number because</span> <span data-start="228.59" data-end="230.659">bottom line nan is still a numeric type</span> <span data-start="230.659" data-end="232.94">however it represents a value that could</span> <span data-start="232.94" data-end="236.269">not represent a valid number so you know</span> <span data-start="236.269" data-end="238.909">it's a script ezpz mathematical</span> <span data-start="238.909" data-end="240.44">operations cannot crash or cause errors</span> <span data-start="240.44" data-end="244.34">they just give you nan so what if we</span> <span data-start="244.34" data-end="246.849">wanted to know if a batter is not or not</span> <span data-start="246.849" data-end="249.799">this was your first guess oh let me tell</span> <span data-start="249.799" data-end="252.169">you something guys nan is not equal</span> <span data-start="252.169" data-end="254.54">greater than or less than anything</span> <span data-start="254.54" data-end="257.09">including itself and you have you</span> <span data-start="257.09" data-end="258.919">already know this but do you know why a</span> <span data-start="258.919" data-end="260.51">man is not equal to man</span> <span data-start="260.51" data-end="263.12">so to give you a little bit of context</span> <span data-start="263.12" data-end="265.37">nan is actually part of the I Triple E</span> <span data-start="265.37" data-end="268.849">754 a floating point standard that to</span> <span data-start="268.849" data-end="270.71">keep things short he finds that there</span> <span

data-end="283.949">different kind of man's that it's highly</span> <span data-start="283.949" data-end="286.289">unlikely that one man is equal to</span> <span data-start="286.289" data-end="289.56">another now so yes indeed none is not</span> <span data-start="289.56" data-end="292.11">equal to none and at this point I guess</span> <span data-start="292.11" data-end="294.9">we can all say that man stands for not a</span> <span data-start="294.9" data-end="299.49">not a number if we actually want to know</span> <span data-start="299.49" data-end="301.949">if a value is man

what</span> <span data-start="312.65" data-end="315.389">we all know that no is a primitive the</span> <span data-start="315.389" data-end="317.4">value and therefore type of no should be</span> <span

these</span> <span data-start="368.789" data-end="372.21">errors so now let's talk about sorting</span> <span data-start="372.21" data-end="373.74">arrays that seems like a little bit more</span>

<p><span data-start="378.87" data-end="381.089">I get definitely not this outcome</span> <span data-start="381.089" data-end="383.669">because normally in planet Earth for</span> <span data-start="383.669" data-end="387.81">comes before 25 and 33 no right but not</span> <span data-start="387.81" data-end="390.719">in JavaScript so what's actually</span> <span data-start="390.719" data-end="392.669">happening here the thing is that the</span> <span data-start="392.669" data-end="395.159">elements to be sorted they are</span> <span data-start="395.159" data-end="396.99">transforming two strings and then they</span> <span data-start="396.99" data-end="399.089">are comparing lexicographical order you</span> <span data-start="399.089" data-end="400.74">know what is this lexicographical order</span> </p>
