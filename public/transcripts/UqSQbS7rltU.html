<p><span data-start="63.1" data-end="68.47">Everything we know about 80 hour work weeks says that why we're not working them when</span> <span data-start="68.47" data-end="72.079">we think they're and two they're not sustainable.</span> <span data-start="72.079" data-end="78.93">I really like this, you get sent to Bora Bora if you work too much.</span> <span data-start="78.93" data-end="85.969">The third thing is what I want to talk about today, we expect and ask more of are jobs</span> <span data-start="85.969" data-end="92.45">than we get from them, so there is this gap of what we need and what we have and if it</span> <span data-start="92.45" data-end="99.56">goes on for too long, or it gets too large, that's when we start to feel burnt out.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="99.56" data-end="104.18">You know, I often think that these things can to go, write, like I know for myself,</span> <span data-start="104.18" data-end="109.39">being creative is so much a part of being happy, burn out, depression, where does one</span> <span data-start="109.39" data-end="113.01">begin and the other one end, they're distinct problems.</span> <span data-start="113.01" data-end="123.78">A few years ago I moved to Australia to run an iOS team, we went to, it was started before</span> <span data-start="123.78" data-end="130.09">I arrived within six months, I kept my hours 45 a week, I would still come home on Friday</span> <span data-start="130.09" data-end="133.95">night and feel like my brain had bled out through my eyes.</span> <span data-start="133.95" data-end="140.37">Then it was done and you know, they would like this guy is going to ship next month,</span> <span data-start="140.37" data-end="146.239">go and help him, he didn't ship next month, or the month after.</span> <span data-start="146.239" data-end="149.79">In fact I think it was about eight months later.</span> <span data-start="149.79" data-end="157.819">It was really hard from running my own little team to working on a project that wasn't really</span> <span data-start="157.819" data-end="159.87">running effectively.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="159.87" data-end="166.62">In this position where like I had no influence over making that better.</span> <span data-start="166.62" data-end="173.139">Add to this like the super miserable experience of being harassed at work and the awful HR</span> <span data-start="173.139" data-end="178.569">process that ensued, I was in a really bad place emotionally and my job was just like</span> <span data-start="178.569" data-end="181.15">not fulfilling.</span> <span data-start="181.15" data-end="187.239">So I tried to double down on my career, I'll just work on Saturdays, I just need to work</span> <span data-start="187.239" data-end="191.18">harder, I'm going to do a side project.</span> <span data-start="191.18" data-end="196.22">So I started doing a side project and then there was a reorganisation and it was clear</span> <span data-start="196.22" data-end="201.829">that the side project was never going to launch either, I realised that what I needed was</span> <span data-start="201.829" data-end="205.629">to ship, that's what I missed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="205.629" data-end="211.919">The answer was not internal side projects, but my own personal side project.</span> <span data-start="211.919" data-end="217.019">As an extra thing I had to — I think this was the worst manager I ever had, he explained</span> <span data-start="217.019" data-end="221.89">to me that he believed by never giving me positive feedback he was training me not to</span> <span data-start="221.89" data-end="226.589">need any \{Laughter\}.</span> <span data-start="226.589" data-end="230.199">If anyone is contemplating this, it doesn't work!</span> <span data-start="230.199" data-end="238.139">\{Laughter\} So, as I shifted my focus to external projects I got some much needed positive feedback</span> <span data-start="238.139" data-end="239.389">as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="239.389" data-end="246.139">So, it turns out that this was not an entirely, like, random realisation and I didn't invent</span> <span data-start="246.139" data-end="247.189">anything here.</span> <span data-start="247.189" data-end="253.599">There are six main causes of professional burn out, the Maslach burn out, there is an</span> <span data-start="253.599" data-end="260.07">inventory and a book associated with it called 'The truth about burn out' the first one is</span> <span data-start="260.07" data-end="264.11">lack of control, that sounds familiar, hey!</span> <span data-start="264.11" data-end="273.47">Wait, then the next one, in sufficient reward, also familiar.</span> <span data-start="273.47" data-end="277.37">Lack of community.</span> <span data-start="277.37" data-end="282.52">I went through this list and I'm like, Huh, you know, this was the first project in a</span> <span data-start="282.52" data-end="286.27">while that I'd been on where I was the only woman on the team and there were a number</span> <span data-start="286.27" data-end="290.3">of reasons why I felt very lonely but that was one of them.</span> <span data-start="290.3" data-end="293.33">The fourth, absence of fairness.</span> <span data-start="293.33" data-end="300.83">Yeah, you know I've been successful and like the result was that I ended up in a place</span> <span data-start="300.83" data-end="304.02">where I felt like I couldn't succeed.</span> <span data-start="304.02" data-end="307.58">The fifth is conflict in values.</span> <span data-start="307.58" data-end="311.99">You know, I value execution on a product.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="311.99" data-end="317.66">The team, they like decided that what they should be doing is replying a platform to</span> <span data-start="317.66" data-end="322.56">build their project on, obviously I disagree with that, but this not a talk about poor</span> <span data-start="322.56" data-end="326.9">engineering decisions, that would need way more than 25 minutes!</span> <span data-start="326.9" data-end="330.479">The 6th is work overload.</span> <span data-start="330.479" data-end="336.52">I look at this list and like these are all problems we could use side projects to help</span> <span data-start="336.52" data-end="344.599">with except for number 6, yeah, it would probably hurt with number 6, I do see that.</span> <span data-start="344.599" data-end="350.27">It's really hard to think of a side project when you are feeling, you know, a bit dead</span> <span data-start="350.27" data-end="352.819">inside.</span> <span data-start="352.819" data-end="357.77">It's really hard to think that you have anything to offer anybody else's side project when</span> <span data-start="357.77" data-end="363.43">the people that you work with day-to-day don't seem to appreciate what you do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="363.43" data-end="371.12">My solution was to go back to my most recently abandoned side project, we all have one, right.</span> <span data-start="371.12" data-end="376.18">So, I had this idea that, like, you know when you look on your photographs on flickr or</span> <span data-start="376.18" data-end="381.61">whatever I thought it would be cool to visualise a photograph stream just pulling out the dominant</span> <span data-start="381.61" data-end="389.849">colours from them, so the cool whites of Iceland, lush green of Bali, the like orange and red</span> <span data-start="389.849" data-end="397.15">of Canadian Fall, it would tell it's only story in a abstract way.</span> <span data-start="397.15" data-end="401.93">So I got so far as this layout, this is the most efficient way to layout circles, it's</span> <span data-start="401.93" data-end="408.819">called a sunflower layout, so I just was tainting the RGB value and in the one on the right</span> <span data-start="408.819" data-end="414.479">I just made it very close together, I kind of like this, I imagine if I was to time travel</span> <span data-start="414.479" data-end="420.759">it would jump through something like that.</span> <span data-start="420.759" data-end="426.36">The next step was to pull the dominant colour out of a photograph, like if someone solved</span> <span data-start="426.36" data-end="429.61">this the internet will help me.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="429.61" data-end="431.36">The internet failed me.</span> <span data-start="431.36" data-end="441.06">But it did provide some interesting information, image is array of pixels, a pixel is a square</span> <span data-start="441.06" data-end="454.949">of colour, there is a colour space all the HSV space, the HSV is actually a lot closer</span> <span data-start="454.949" data-end="461.219">to the way we think about colour, so the different colours go round in the circle and those are</span> <span data-start="461.219" data-end="468.21">the hue, the saturation, that we might think about as intensity is the diameter and then</span> <span data-start="468.21" data-end="470.4">the high is brightness.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="470.4" data-end="472.529">So at the bottom everything is black.</span> <span data-start="472.529" data-end="479.88">So, I was like, ok, you know, count the pixels, check the colour.</span> <span data-start="479.88" data-end="483.59">Put them in buckets and, you know, we'll have that dominant colour.</span> <span data-start="483.59" data-end="485.669">It will be fine.</span> <span data-start="485.669" data-end="490.61">This totally worked, but it turns out that the dominant colour is often a little bit</span> <span data-start="490.61" data-end="499.259">sludgy, so the dominant colour on the left that's the dominant colour extracted from</span> <span data-start="499.259" data-end="500.259">the image.</span> <span data-start="500.259" data-end="505.61">So I'm making these test images to see what happens, I would only show things in a certain</span> <span data-start="505.61" data-end="510.069">range of the dominant colour, I started making the cool partially coloured images and I could</span> <span data-start="510.069" data-end="516.279">see better what was going on.</span> <span data-start="516.279" data-end="521.59">So I made my visualisation, here it is.</span> <span data-start="521.59" data-end="528.25">It wasn't quite as incredible as I had imagined, you know, it also took a really long time</span> <span data-start="528.25" data-end="531.49">to like, at least 30 minutes to calculate these right.</span> <span data-start="531.49" data-end="538.41">One of the things that I discovered is that for different images like, you need different</span> <span data-start="538.41" data-end="543.649">settings to really kind of capture what I would perceive as the dominant colour, which</span> <span data-start="543.649" data-end="550.99">kind of makes sense, right, the way we perceive things, we abstract things, summarise things,</span> <span data-start="550.99" data-end="558.13">dominant colour is largely a matter of perception, but I considered this to be the completion</span> <span data-start="558.13" data-end="560.47">of a successful side project, you know.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="560.47" data-end="562.38">I moved on to other things.</span> <span data-start="562.38" data-end="567.93">Then I got asked to write a book chapter, I was like, oh well, I guess I wrote this</span> <span data-start="567.93" data-end="571.87">algorithm, so I could write a book chapter.</span> <span data-start="571.87" data-end="577.089">So I made it into a little photograph, Ited all of this in processing, by the way, whilst</span> <span data-start="577.089" data-end="581.55">doing that I tried to put it online.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="581.55" data-end="588.579">I used processing Java, not processing JavaScript, I'm sorry, I know it's a JavaScript conference.</span> <span data-start="588.579" data-end="593.22">As I started trying to put this online, I started trying to run into things, I didn't</span> <span data-start="593.22" data-end="601.279">want to deal — cross site describing permissions and stuff, at some point on this journey,</span> <span data-start="601.279" data-end="607.5">I remembered I'm an expert mobile developer, I was like Cate Huston why are you building</span> <span data-start="607.5" data-end="615.98">a mediocre desktop only app, clearly it should be a web app, I started working, it got a</span> <span data-start="615.98" data-end="623.86">working prototype, I ran into terrible performance problems, then I ended up creating a library</span> <span data-start="623.86" data-end="633.04">for testing, for generating and comparing images on iOS, I ended up — you heard that</span> <span data-start="633.04" data-end="639.11">correctly, I optimised it for space and Time Out side of the context of a technical interview,</span> <span data-start="639.11" data-end="640.81">it does occasionally happen.</span> <span data-start="640.81" data-end="650.24">The app is called show and hide, it will be out pretty soon, I located to the UK, quit</span> <span data-start="650.24" data-end="656.74">the job I hated and started working for myself, this kind of remains my side project, the</span> <span data-start="656.74" data-end="660.86">definition of side project is the things you do for love not money.</span> <span data-start="660.86" data-end="665.029">Let's go back to that list.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="665.029" data-end="668.56">Because now I had control.</span> <span data-start="668.56" data-end="673.509">Sometimes too much control, but like I definitely have control.</span> <span data-start="673.509" data-end="676.54">Reward, people started to appreciate my work.</span> <span data-start="676.54" data-end="681.86">It was tied to other things I did at the same time but till you know, I got much more positive</span> <span data-start="681.86" data-end="686.21">feedback from the community than I ever did from that terrible manager.</span> <span data-start="686.21" data-end="692.661">Community, I had editors and support on the book chapter, I work with a designer and a</span> <span data-start="692.661" data-end="695.279">branding person.</span> <span data-start="695.279" data-end="702.24">Fairness, proceeds from the book go to charity, indie apps don't really make money I am excited</span> <span data-start="702.24" data-end="711.41">to get same share of nothing as everyone else \{laughter\} values so the kind of project I</span> <span data-start="711.41" data-end="712.41">burnt out on</span> <span data-start="712.41" data-end="719.39">it was like an enormous yak shaving project, I did shave a lot of yaks in this process,</span> <span data-start="719.39" data-end="724.459">but everyone of them filled a need, I was able to share that outcome with other people.</span> </p>
