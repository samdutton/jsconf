<p><span data-start="538.8" data-end="540.84">I've changed is in my usage I can call</span> <span data-start="540.84" data-end="542.79">react use state and it does exactly the</span> <span data-start="542.79" data-end="545.37">same thing everyone with me alright okay</span> <span data-start="545.37" data-end="548.61">cool so so I've done I put I created my</span> <span data-start="548.61" data-end="551.31">react module and I've sort of wrapped up</span> <span data-start="551.31" data-end="553.05">my functionality I can do that to my</span> <span data-start="553.05" data-end="553.74">hook as well</span> <span data-start="553.74" data-end="555.42">what wraps are on a hook a component</span> <span data-start="555.42" data-end="560.03">right so I can declare a component and</span> <span data-start="560.03" data-end="563.22">and that's just a regular function and</span> <span data-start="563.22" data-end="565.44">put the hook in there normally I'd be</span> <span data-start="565.44" data-end="567.9">rendering to the Dom but in this case I</span> <span data-start="567.9" data-end="568.77">don't have a door might just have the</span> <span data-start="568.77" data-end="571.11">console so I'm just going to return an</span> <span data-start="571.11" data-end="574.44">object and simulate that we'll get to</span> <span data-start="574.44" data-end="576.26">the other stuff in a second so render</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="576.26" data-end="579.6">I'm gonna have consult log counts and</span> <span data-start="579.6" data-end="582.96">then click this is just for simulating I</span> <span

data-end="595.41">thing that we need to do is we need to</span> <span data-start="595.41" data-end="597.72">teach we have react and we have the</span> <span data-start="597.72" data-end="599.28">component we need we need to we need to</span> <span data-start="599.28" data-end="600.96">teach react how to render the component</span> <span data-start="600.96"

a function right so let's just call</span> <span data-start="610.56" data-end="616.41">it and then the when you call it you get</span> <span data-start="616.41" data-end="618.36">an object that has a render and it click</span> <span data-start="618.36" data-end="620.04">right so let's just called the render</span> <span data-start="620.04" data-end="622.26">all right let's actually just put log</span> <span data-start="622.26" data-end="623.67">something out on the screen and then</span> <span data-start="623.67" data-end="625.11">we'll just return it so that we can do</span> <span data-start="625.11" data-end="627.3">other stuff with the component and I'm</span> <span data-start="627.3" data-end="629.58">gonna expose that inside of my react</span> <span data-start="629.58" data-end="631.89">module over here so we're at 16 lines</span> <span data-start="631.89" data-end="633.36">not too bad</span> <span data-start="633.36" data-end="635.22">and now I can replace all this logging</span> <span data-start="635.22" data-end="639.9">stuff and do something like react render</span> <span data-start="639.9" data-end="642.839">component we should see something show</span> <span data-start="642.839" data-end="644.61">up on the screen up that's not exactly</span> <span data-start="644.61" data-end="647.79">what I want but whatever and I can</span> <span data-start="647.79" data-end="649.35">because there's there's a return value</span> <span data-start="649.35" data-end="651.72">over here I can take this and I can</span> <span data-start="651.72" data-end="654">start accessing stuff on the object</span> <span data-start="654" data-end="655.82">right like the click function that I</span> <span data-start="655.82" data-end="658.71">wrote so I can just say click and I can</span> <span data-start="658.71" data-end="662.01">render it again react I'll click is not</span> <span data-start="662.01" data-end="663.68">a function oh it's</span> <span data-start="663.68" data-end="666.199">okay cool it's a little bit like TDD</span> <span data-start="666.199" data-end="667.999">instant feedback in this rebel thing is</span> <span data-start="667.999" data-end="668.93">really nice</span> <span data-start="668.93" data-end="671.029">okay so the only thing that's wrong with</span> <span data-start="671.029" data-end="672.439">this now is I'm logging the state get er</span> <span data-start="672.439" data-end="673.85">right that's the that's the thing that</span> <span data-start="673.85" data-end="674.959">we did just now there was like a hacky</span> <span data-start="674.959" data-end="676.699">thing let's just get rid of that let's</span> <span data-start="676.699" data-end="679.55">lift the value up to the the internal</span> <span data-start="679.55" data-end="683.689">value up to the scope of react and we're</span> <span data-start="683.689" data-end="686.059">going to get rid of the getter function</span> <span data-start="686.059" data-end="687.649">we don't need it anymore and we're just</span> <span data-start="687.649" data-end="689.6">gonna let the getter function close over</span> <span data-start="689.6" data-end="691.939">the internal value the the you stay</span> <span data-start="691.939" data-end="694.399">close over the internal value so now it</span> <span data-start="694.399" data-end="697.22">just returns every single time it</span> <span data-start="697.22" data-end="703.369">renders so so this is the okay so this</span> <span data-start="703.369" data-end="710.059">is I'm running into something that I</span> <span data-start="710.059" data-end="712.61">didn't expect over here so I'm gonna try</span> <span data-start="712.61" data-end="720.73">to debunk a little bit I think okay so</span> <span data-start="720.73" data-end="724.04">it comes yeah I think I think I said</span> <span data-start="724.04" data-end="726.439">comes oh yeah I need two plus one of</span> <span data-start="726.439" data-end="728.809">course if I'm selling cars to the</span> <span data-start="728.809" data-end="730.069">original accounts it's not gonna</span> <span data-start="730.069" data-end="733.55">increment so yeah okay so I practice</span> <span data-start="733.55" data-end="735.35">this a lot so it's very unusual for me</span> <span data-start="735.35" data-end="737.48">to screw up like that so you can see we</span> <span data-start="737.48" data-end="738.8">have our stateful functions back right</span> <span data-start="738.8" data-end="739.97">but we've gone through a whole buncha</span> <span data-start="739.97" data-end="741.8">ceremony but now we have a react module</span> <span data-start="741.8" data-end="744.35">we have a component right it kind of</span> <span data-start="744.35" data-end="746.99">looks like a component and and we can we</span> <span data-start="746.99" data-end="748.79">can do things to the component and it</span> <span data-start="748.79" data-end="750.889">updates in state so that's really good</span> <span data-start="750.889" data-end="753.74">until you try to have multiple states</span> <span data-start="753.74" data-end="755.959">multiple hooks so let's just have a text</span> <span data-start="755.959" data-end="756.949">hook it's gonna look slightly different</span> <span data-start="756.949" data-end="758.689">so that you can differentiate between</span> <span data-start="758.689" data-end="760.759">the number and the text I'm gonna call</span> <span data-start="760.759" data-end="762.379">it apple just because that's the first</span> <span data-start="762.379" data-end="765.05">thing I think about I'm gonna log it out</span> <span data-start="765.05" data-end="767.36">as well so we're gonna log it out in our</span> <span data-start="767.36" data-end="768.86">render and I'm gonna have a new method</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="768.86" data-end="772.1">I'm just going to call it type I'm just</span> <span data-start="772.1" data-end="773.6">gonna take a word and it's gonna set</span> <span data-start="773.6" data-end="778.129">text to that word okay let's get rid of</span> <span data-start="778.129" data-end="781.759">this and we'll use that type function</span> <span data-start="781.759" data-end="783.949">here and you'll see what's wrong with it</span> <span data-start="783.949" data-end="785.929">in a second so I'm gonna set that to</span> <span data-start="785.929" data-end="788.689">pear okay so so what's happening here</span> <span data-start="788.689" data-end="790.72">our component is here it's got two hooks</span> <span data-start="790.72" data-end="794.089">the first click happens and and both</span> <span data-start="794.089" data-end="795.799">counts and texts are both set to two and</span> <span data-start="795.799" data-end="796.97">then we</span> <span data-start="796.97" data-end="800.149">at that type and both counts in Texas</span> <span data-start="800.149" data-end="802.43">both set to pair so what's wrong with</span> <span data-start="802.43" data-end="804.709">this this image we are trying to use to</span> <span data-start="804.709" data-end="806">a hoax but they're they're they're just</span> <span data-start="806" data-end="807.829">oh they're just using the same store in</span> <span data-start="807.829" data-end="809.509">the memory right because we only have</span> <span data-start="809.509" data-end="810.98">one variable and it's constantly</span> <span data-start="810.98" data-end="814.1">overwriting that single variable so the</span> <span data-start="814.1" data-end="815.54">the mental image of hooks that you have</span> <span data-start="815.54" data-end="817.37">now should grow a little bit and you</span> <span data-start="817.37" data-end="819.25">should think of hooks as a rays of</span> <span data-start="819.25" data-end="822.529">effects so let's just use an array and</span> <span data-start="822.529" data-end="824.629">we'll stand to know which hook we're</span> <span data-start="824.629" data-end="826.16">currently operating on we also need an</span> <span data-start="826.16" data-end="828.579">index so I'm gonna have an index of zero</span> <span data-start="828.579" data-end="831.8">so so now now we're now it's pretty</span> <span data-start="831.8" data-end="833.209">clear we're gonna replace all the</span> <span data-start="833.209" data-end="835.97">internal values with just hooks and in</span> <span data-start="835.97" data-end="838.189">the current index so now nothing has</span> <span data-start="838.189" data-end="841.639">changed because we're still not oh it's</span> <span data-start="841.639" data-end="843.439">not incrementing the index so I'm gonna</span> <span data-start="843.439" data-end="845.269">have a rule there at the end of the at</span> <span data-start="845.269" data-end="847.31">the end of a hook after we're done we</span> <span data-start="847.31" data-end="848.449">should just always increment the index</span> <span data-start="848.449" data-end="850.339">so that the next hook can take and can</span> <span data-start="850.339" data-end="851.629">take place so now we have an</span> <span data-start="851.629" data-end="854.389">independently updating counts and text</span> <span data-start="854.389" data-end="856.339">is not changing that's good but over</span> <span data-start="856.339" data-end="858.649">here we still have this weird bug and</span> <span data-start="858.649" data-end="860.209">that's because I just keep incrementing</span> <span data-start="860.209" data-end="862.22">index plus one plus one plus one plus</span> <span data-start="862.22" data-end="863.899">one I need to reset it back to zero so</span> <span data-start="863.899" data-end="866.449">that every single time a rerender it's</span> <span data-start="866.449" data-end="868.309">gonna start and go through all these</span> <span data-start="868.309" data-end="869.769">hooks from scratch because it's</span> <span data-start="869.769" data-end="871.939">referring to their internal hook storage</span> <span data-start="871.939" data-end="874.67">so yeah let's just set it to zero and</span> <span data-start="874.67" data-end="877.61">now I'm gonna break everything and this</span> <span data-start="877.61" data-end="879.5">is because of a very subtle bug again</span> <span data-start="879.5" data-end="882.079">set state is called asynchronously set</span> <span data-start="882.079" data-end="884.029">state is called after a render right and</span> <span data-start="884.029" data-end="886.67">and by that time hope the the indexes</span> <span data-start="886.67" data-end="889.129">actually set back to zero so this this</span> <span data-start="889.129" data-end="890.629">index being a live value that's a</span> <span data-start="890.629" data-end="892.73">problem for us the way to fix that</span> <span data-start="892.73" data-end="895.639">problem is to freeze it so let's have an</span> <span data-start="895.639" data-end="897.069">internal index and we'll just freeze it</span> <span data-start="897.069" data-end="900.379">and we'll that set state closed over</span> <span data-start="900.379" data-end="903.29">second NewsAsia closure close over that</span> <span data-start="903.29" data-end="906.41">internal frozen index value okay so now</span> <span data-start="906.41" data-end="908.899">we have a component we are rendering it</span> <span data-start="908.899" data-end="911.329">we have a count of one we're clicking</span> <span data-start="911.329" data-end="914.24">the account updates to to the text</span> <span data-start="914.24" data-end="916.43">doesn't change then we type pair and</span> <span data-start="916.43" data-end="918.319">then count doesn't change and tax</span> <span data-start="918.319" data-end="920.18">changes so we have independently moving</span> <span data-start="920.18" data-end="922.279">states right and that's something that's</span> <span data-start="922.279" data-end="924.889">a new paradigm in the hooks model as</span> <span data-start="924.889" data-end="926.569">well that you every component used to</span> <span data-start="926.569" data-end="928.279">have one object for state and everything</span> <span data-start="928.279" data-end="929.809">you're just forced to put every all you</span> <span data-start="929.809" data-end="930.499">stay on today</span> <span data-start="930.499" data-end="931.879">checked now you have independently</span> <span data-start="931.879" data-end="933.649">moving states and you can be a bit more</span> <span data-start="933.649" data-end="937.009">precise with that alright so and you can</span> <span data-start="937.009" data-end="938.809">already start to see some of the issues</span> <span data-start="938.809" data-end="940.639">we've hooked some of the rules of hooks</span> <span data-start="940.639" data-end="942.529">so these are when the people introduce</span> <span data-start="942.529" data-end="944.509">hooks I think one of the biggest</span> <span data-start="944.509" data-end="946.699">problems with folks that people had was</span> <span data-start="946.699" data-end="948.319">that you you can you have to call them</span> <span data-start="948.319" data-end="949.579">unconditionally you couldn't put them</span> <span data-start="949.579" data-end="952.099">inside an if or a loop or some sort of</span> <span data-start="952.099" data-end="954.109">dynamic value so I just want you to</span> <span data-start="954.109" data-end="955.969">imagine what happens to this if I do</span> <span data-start="955.969" data-end="959.089">like math dot random more than five</span> <span data-start="959.089" data-end="961.789">point five right so this gets this gets</span> <span data-start="961.789" data-end="965.269">called half of the time what is the hook</span> <span data-start="965.269" data-end="967.009">index value of this this is this should</span> <span data-start="967.009" data-end="969.139">be one the okay next value but sometimes</span> <span data-start="969.139" data-end="970.729">it's zero because this doesn't execute</span> <span data-start="970.729" data-end="973.999">and so the the the state values get get</span> <span data-start="973.999" data-end="976.099">off right so you're just not allowed to</span> <span data-start="976.099" data-end="977.689">do that and that's what we have linters</span> <span data-start="977.689" data-end="979.729">that's why you understand the rules</span> <span data-start="979.729" data-end="983.379">looks just a fundamental basis okay so</span> <span data-start="983.379" data-end="986.389">we're not done I'm not happy we only</span> <span data-start="986.389" data-end="988.069">have the state hook we also have the</span> <span data-start="988.069" data-end="990.439">effect hook the best way to model this</span> <span data-start="990.439" data-end="992.059">is to just use it and then we'll</span> <span data-start="992.059" data-end="994.639">backfill what that what that is so a use</span> <span data-start="994.639" data-end="998.299">effects hook takes a call back or just</span> <span data-start="998.299" data-end="1002.859">say console.log yes calm and then it</span> <span data-start="1002.859"
