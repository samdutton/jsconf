was</span> <span data-start="1607.53" data-end="1608.91">that it allows us to get to the point</span> <span data-start="1608.91" data-end="1611.64">where application developers that had</span> <span data-start="1611.64" data-end="1613.74">been using flash and had been reliant on</span> <span data-start="1613.74" data-end="1615.87">plugins in the browser to get access to</span> <span data-start="1615.87" data-end="1618.51">that native functionality no longer had</span> <span data-start="1618.51" data-end="1621.24">to do so and through web assembly we</span> <span data-start="1621.24" data-end="1622.95">were able to provide a mechanism where</span> <span data-start="1622.95" data-end="1625.29">we could deprecated native plugins and</span> <span data-start="1625.29" data-end="1627.72">deprecated flash and that was all not</span> <span data-start="1627.72" data-end="1630.21">because we built it into Firefox but</span> <span data-start="1630.21" data-end="1631.65">because we designed it and built it for</span> <span data-start="1631.65" data-end="1633.42">the web and we advocated it from a</span> <span data-start="1633.42" data-end="1635.52">developer perspective for all browser</span> <span data-start="1635.52" data-end="1638.4">vendors to adopt additionally it's</span> <span data-start="1638.4" data-end="1639.63">important for us from a developer</span> <span data-start="1639.63" data-end="1641.13">perspective to be aligned with</span> <span data-start="1641.13" data-end="1642.27">everything else that's going on in</span> <span data-start="1642.27" data-end="1643.98">emerging technologies and so we're just</span> <span data-start="1643.98" data-end="1646.14">as happy to talk to you about the api's</span> <span data-start="1646.14" data-end="1648.54">or the tools or the standards or</span> <span data-start="1648.54" data-end="1650.429">anything else that you may require as</span> <span data-start="1650.429" data-end="1654.809">developers to really help you adopt or</span> <span data-start="1654.809" data-end="1656.55">become more involved with any of the</span> <span data-start="1656.55" data-end="1658.98">other technologies that i've just talked</span> <span data-start="1658.98" data-end="1661.14">about that we're working on in emerging</span> <span data-start="1661.14" data-end="1663.09">technology so we're just as happy to</span> <span data-start="1663.09" data-end="1665.73">talk about where your needs may be if</span> <span data-start="1665.73" data-end="1667.08">you're interested in building a speech</span> <span data-start="1667.08" data-end="1669.99">based interface to the web or a mixed</span> <span data-start="1669.99" data-end="1673.05">reality based one and all that work can</span> <span data-start="1673.05" data-end="1675">be taken up through the developer</span> <span data-start="1675" data-end="1676.38">outreach team as part of the emerging</span> <span data-start="1676.38" data-end="1682.26">technologies group and so that brings us</span> <span data-start="1682.26" data-end="1684.45">to the end of our tour I didn't actually</span> <span data-start="1684.45" data-end="1686.49">talk about everything that we're doing</span> <span data-start="1686.49" data-end="1688.41">in emerging technologies we have a</span> <span data-start="1688.41" data-end="1691.32">number of other efforts that are</span> <span data-start="1691.32" data-end="1693.66">underway that are probably less relevant</span> <span data-start="1693.66" data-end="1695.69">in this audience but I will highlight</span> <span data-start="1695.69" data-end="1698.64">that we're doing work on a royalty-free</span> <span data-start="1698.64" data-end="1700.92">high-quality audio and video codecs and</span> <span data-start="1700.92" data-end="1702.33">so if you're interested in delivering</span> <span data-start="1702.33" data-end="1704.97">high-quality media on the web and in</span> <span data-start="1704.97" data-end="1707.52">doing so in a royalty-free way we should</span> <span data-start="1707.52" data-end="1709.8">talk we're part of the Alliance for open</span> <span data-start="1709.8" data-end="1712.2">media in support of those technologies</span> <span data-start="1712.2" data-end="1714.15">that are becoming available and we also</span> <span data-start="1714.15" data-end="1717.15">have some early phase work on the web of</span> <span data-start="1717.15" data-end="1719.88">things and so some of the technologies</span> <span data-start="1719.88" data-end="1721.89">that Flocka showed us earlier in terms</span> <span data-start="1721.89" data-end="1724.67">of bringing javascript and the web into</span> <span data-start="1724.67" data-end="1727.41">microcontrollers and hardware is work</span> <span data-start="1727.41" data-end="1729.45">that we're also engaged in and we'd</span> <span data-start="1729.45" data-end="1730.429">certainly be happy</span> <span data-start="1730.429" data-end="1733.629">to talk to you about any of that work</span> <span data-start="1733.629" data-end="1736.49">lastly in this space we're spending a</span> <span data-start="1736.49" data-end="1737.809">bunch of time on I mentioned machine</span> <span data-start="1737.809" data-end="1739.49">learning as part of speech but we know</span> <span data-start="1739.49" data-end="1741.44">that machine learning is a technology or</span> <span data-start="1741.44" data-end="1743.269">that's going to be pervasively</span> <span data-start="1743.269" data-end="1745.49">interesting or replicable in a wide</span> <span data-start="1745.49" data-end="1747.649">range of ways across the the broader web</span> <span data-start="1747.649" data-end="1749.869">and we're happy to explore the</span> <span data-start="1749.869" data-end="1751.669">intersection of machine learning and</span> <span data-start="1751.669"
