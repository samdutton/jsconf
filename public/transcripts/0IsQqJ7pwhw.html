how vocabulary interacts so</span> <span data-start="373.759" data-end="378.289">you know that the multiplication sign</span> <span data-start="378.289" data-end="381.289">can be only be between two

data-end="396.919">between two injured integers and once we</span> <span data-start="396.919" data-end="399.71">take a look and how that's being parsed</span> <span data-start="399.71" data-end="400.5">we can see</span> <span data-start="400.5" data-end="405.51">that that plus is that Gaza is at the</span> <span data-start="405.51" data-end="408.6">top at left side of the three you

data-end="422.85">take advantage of it and generate some</span> <span data-start="422.85" data-end="428.64">kind of result so let's go a little bit</span> <span data-start="428.64" data-end="432.38">deeper into it so parsing contains</span> <span data-start="432.38" data-end="435.68">lexical analysis and syntax analysis</span> <span data-start="435.68" data-end="439.41">lexical analysis is usually being also</span> <span data-start="439.41" data-end="443.93">called lectures or tokenizer z' it is</span> <span data-start="443.93" data-end="447.96">the that part of parser is basically</span> <span data-start="447.96" data-end="451.47">creating the tokens and tokens are the</span> <span data-start="451.47" data-end="455.4">smallest elements that a parser can use</span> <span data-start="455.4" data-end="461.15">if here and the second thing is parsers</span> <span data-start="461.15" data-end="464.58">parses apply the syntax rules here we</span> <span data-start="464.58" data-end="468.63">can see a diagram where we have a lexer</span> <span data-start="468.63" data-end="471.87">and parser parser is going to constantly</span> <span data-start="471.87" data-end="475.46">request tokens from the lecture and</span> <span data-start="475.46" data-end="478.38">lecture is going to reply with with</span> <span data-start="478.38" data-end="482.31">sending the tokens parser is always</span> <span data-start="482.31" data-end="485.55">going to try to use the token based on</span> <span data-start="485.55" data-end="487.77">the syntax rules but if that is not</span> <span data-start="487.77" data-end="490.38">possible it is going to store the token</span> <span data-start="490.38" data-end="493.86">and at later time is going to see if</span> <span data-start="493.86" data-end="498.46">that token can be matched to something</span> <span data-start="498.47" data-end="502.229">so you could go the route of developing</span> <span data-start="502.229" data-end="505.8">your own parsers and that might be a</span> <span data-start="505.8" data-end="509.49">good thing to do but usually there are</span> <span data-start="509.49" data-end="512.28">ready available parsers like flex legs</span> <span data-start="512.28" data-end="516.12">yak and BISM and for these parsers you</span> <span data-start="516.12" data-end="518.099">had to just feed it with your grammar</span> <span data-start="518.099" data-end="522.32">and they are going to work using it and</span> <span data-start="522.32" data-end="525.54">the funny thing is even WebKit is using</span> <span data-start="525.54" data-end="528.93">two of these parsers WebKit is using a</span> <span data-start="528.93"

<span data-start="884.179" data-end="887.059">is so there is also this global and</span> <span data-start="887.059" data-end="891.289">incremental layout global layout is when</span> <span data-start="891.289" data-end="896.029">you're doing a resize of your browser or</span> <span data-start="896.029" data-end="900.079">you apply new font then the whole layout</span> <span data-start="900.079" data-end="902.6">is going to be executed through the</span> <span data-start="902.6" data-end="906.259">whole page and the incremental layout is</span> <span data-start="906.259" data-end="909.379">basically using the dirty bit system to</span> <span data-start="909.379" data-end="910.939">render some of the things but not</span> <span data-start="910.939"
