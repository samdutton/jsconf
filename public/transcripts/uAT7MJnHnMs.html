stars in the website let me add Ajax</span> <span data-start="618" data-end="619.32">like there was no javascript in the</span> <span data-start="619.32" data-end="621.93">original version of the of the web app</span> <span data-start="621.93" data-end="624.78">and seizure comes in and she's like okay</span> <span data-start="624.78" data-end="626.78">we are going to add metrics and logging</span> <span data-start="626.78" data-end="629.85">immediately and I was like why would we</span> <span data-start="629.85" data-end="632.22">do that that makes no sense right now</span> <span data-start="632.22" data-end="634.35">our servers keep falling over our</span> <span data-start="634.35" data-end="636.72">community is really upset with us we</span> <span data-start="636.72" data-end="639.78">need to build stuff fast well there's a</span> <span data-start="639.78" data-end="642.36">reason why CJ is now the CTO and I've</span> <span data-start="642.36" data-end="643.53">only made my way up to engineering</span> <span data-start="643.53" data-end="646.58">manager because it turns out that</span> <span data-start="646.58" data-end="649.41">metrics give you the information that</span> <span data-start="649.41" data-end="651.9">you didn't know you needed metrics tell</span> <span data-start="651.9" data-end="654.18">you what your users and what your</span> <span data-start="654.18" data-end="656.25">systems are doing because while you can</span> <span data-start="656.25" data-end="657.75">guess what they're doing you can't</span> <span data-start="657.75" data-end="660.24">actually know with real hard data until</span> <span data-start="660.24" data-end="662.73">you start adding metrics logs allow you</span> <span data-start="662.73" data-end="664.44">to basically record those metrics and</span> <span data-start="664.44" data-end="666.39">search them later so those two things</span> <span data-start="666.39" data-end="668.79">really come hand-in-hand for you to</span> <span data-start="668.79" data-end="670.95">really understand what the heck is going</span> <span data-start="670.95" data-end="673.05">on and let me tell you the sooner you do</span> <span data-start="673.05" data-end="674.37">it the easier</span> <span data-start="674.37" data-end="676.02">is to continue doing it and you'll have</span> <span data-start="676.02" data-end="678.21">all of that data from the beginning the</span> <span data-start="678.21" data-end="679.89">worst thing is when product comes in and</span> <span data-start="679.89" data-end="682.17">says hey so we have this idea what do</span> <span data-start="682.17" data-end="686.22">you think you're like hmm when you have</span> <span data-start="686.22" data-end="688.529">the actual data that's when you can</span> <span data-start="688.529" data-end="690.6">really kind of push forward and say yes</span> <span data-start="690.6" data-end="692.94">this is a great idea or no our users are</span> <span data-start="692.94" data-end="696.24">never going to want to do this to see</span> <span data-start="696.24" data-end="699.089">something a little bit yeah interesting</span> <span data-start="699.089" data-end="700.8">but I'm gonna give it to from a</span> <span data-start="700.8" data-end="703.8">different angle at some point so the</span> <span data-start="703.8" data-end="707.22">original website that Isaac built it was</span> <span data-start="707.22" data-end="711.27">a hand-rolled just kind of framework</span> <span data-start="711.27" data-end="714.12">that he built on his own and it was fine</span> <span data-start="714.12" data-end="716.76">except for the part where when I needed</span> <span data-start="716.76" data-end="718.77">to come on to on board it took me six</span> <span data-start="718.77" data-end="720.81">months to figure out how it all worked</span> <span data-start="720.81" data-end="723.21">and that was really difficult so we</span> <span data-start="723.21" data-end="724.98">decided to scrap it all entirely and</span> <span data-start="724.98" data-end="727.86">start from scratch now when you're</span> <span data-start="727.86" data-end="729.57">starting an app from scratch there are</span> <span data-start="729.57" data-end="731.43">so many options so many opportunities</span> <span data-start="731.43" data-end="735.029">and honestly it doesn't matter which one</span> <span data-start="735.029" data-end="737.31">you choose or if you even choose one at</span> <span data-start="737.31" data-end="741.93">all at the ultimately that it comes down</span> <span data-start="741.93" data-end="744.779">to the fact that your framework if you</span> <span data-start="744.779" data-end="748.5">choose one it okay let me phrase it this</span> <span data-start="748.5" data-end="752.37">way there is no one framework to solve</span> <span data-start="752.37" data-end="755">every single problem never ever ever</span> <span data-start="755" data-end="757.32">it's important if you're going to pick a</span> <span data-start="757.32" data-end="760.5">framework to pick one that suits your</span> <span data-start="760.5" data-end="763.38">needs specifically so assess what your</span> <span data-start="763.38" data-end="766.11">needs are and then focus on that I don't</span> <span data-start="766.11" data-end="769.41">care which one you choose if at all that</span> <span data-start="769.41" data-end="771.99">said use a framework please use a</span> <span data-start="771.99" data-end="773.76">framework when you're an early stage</span> <span data-start="773.76" data-end="775.8">startup you don't have time to be making</span> <span data-start="775.8" data-end="778.5">a billion in seven decisions right let</span> <span data-start="778.5" data-end="779.97">me tell you if you have 20 engineers in</span> <span data-start="779.97" data-end="781.5">a room you're going to have 50 different</span> <span data-start="781.5" data-end="782.97">opinions on how things should be done</span> <span data-start="782.97" data-end="785.64">right like we all know this a framework</span> <span data-start="785.64" data-end="787.08">gives you the opportunity to let</span> <span data-start="787.08" data-end="788.91">somebody else make those decisions let</span> <span data-start="788.91" data-end="790.17">someone else have the opinions and</span> <span data-start="790.17" data-end="791.52">everyone else just kind of fall in line</span> <span data-start="791.52" data-end="794.4">because you have to get product out you</span> <span data-start="794.4" data-end="795.99">don't have to sit there fighting about</span> <span data-start="795.99" data-end="796.77">whether or not you should have</span> <span data-start="796.77" data-end="798.72">semicolons or call backs or promises or</span> <span data-start="798.72" data-end="800.73">what you don't need that on your on your</span> <span data-start="800.73" data-end="805.11">plate you just don't that said we</span> <span data-start="805.11" data-end="808.08">ultimately decided to use happy j/s for</span> <span data-start="808.08" data-end="809.76">back-end framework if you want to know</span> <span data-start="809.76" data-end="812.46">why we chose happy over say something</span> <span data-start="812.46" data-end="813.81">like Express let's talk about that</span> <span data-start="813.81" data-end="815.76">afterwards but that was a decision that</span> <span data-start="815.76" data-end="819.09">we made similarly for our front-end we</span> <span data-start="819.09" data-end="820.68">haven't implemented a front-end</span> <span data-start="820.68" data-end="822.45">framework

which</span> <span data-start="825.87" data-end="828.66">one you choose but it does matter that</span> <span data-start="828.66" data-end="831.27">you pick something and stick with it the</span> <span data-start="831.27" data-end="833.13">absolute worst thing you can ever do is</span> <span data-start="833.13" data-end="835.86">implement a framework into your app and</span> <span data-start="835.86" data-end="838.71">then either not use it at all or fight</span> <span data-start="838.71" data-end="841.41">it if you find yourself fighting your</span> <span data-start="841.41" data-end="844.08">framework just stop get rid of your</span> <span data-start="844.08" data-end="845.67">framework and pick a new one that will</span> <span data-start="845.67" data-end="850.44">actually work with what you need as the</span> <span data-start="850.44" data-end="852.51">websites as the web team started to grow</span> <span data-start="852.51" data-end="854.13">an interesting thing started happening</span> <span data-start="854.13" data-end="856.26">because at first I was the only one</span> <span data-start="856.26" data-end="858.09">working on the website it was great</span> <span data-start="858.09" data-end="859.92">right because I had everything in my</span> <span data-start="859.92" data-end="861.87">brain I knew everything that I needed to</span> <span data-start="861.87" data-end="864.06">know every decision that was made all of</span> <span data-start="864.06" data-end="866.37">it the whole code base was in my head at</span> <span data-start="866.37" data-end="869.49">all times but then an interesting thing</span> <span data-start="869.49" data-end="871.26">happens when you bring someone else to</span> <span data-start="871.26" data-end="875.1">new to get the team right it's suddenly</span> <span data-start="875.1" data-end="877.61">like you have this whole arc</span> <span data-start="877.61" data-end="880.29">archaeological dig site you can see all</span> <span data-start="880.29" data-end="882.27">the decisions that were made but you'll</span> <span data-start="882.27" data-end="884.91">never know why they were made you you</span> <span data-start="884.91" data-end="887.37">can see what was done you'll never</span> <span data-start="887.37" data-end="889.08">understand what were the things that led</span> <span data-start="889.08" data-end="891.75">up to those decisions so ultimately</span> <span data-start="891.75" data-end="894.24">people would come and be like why why</span> <span data-start="894.24" data-end="896.37">are we doing it this way and I would</span> <span data-start="896.37" data-end="898.08">look at them like well isn't it obvious</span> <span data-start="898.08" data-end="900.09">and you're like no there's no</span> <span data-start="900.09" data-end="902.4">documentation this one function isn't</span> <span data-start="902.4" data-end="905.36">tested at all there's nothing here so</span> <span data-start="905.36" data-end="907.92">that was a huge moment for me to realize</span> <span data-start="907.92" data-end="911.61">that in order to get people to be in to</span> <span data-start="911.61" data-end="913.5">understand what's going on in this code</span> <span data-start="913.5" data-end="915.03">base we had to implement some new</span> <span data-start="915.03" data-end="917.25">processes that meant more pair</span> <span data-start="917.25" data-end="919.37">programming and even more importantly</span> <span data-start="919.37" data-end="921.84">whenever we get new things from product</span> <span data-start="921.84" data-end="924.03">we actually sit down and and have a</span> <span data-start="924.03" data-end="925.47">discussion about what decisions we</span> <span data-start="925.47" data-end="927.81">should be making and that was super</span> <span data-start="927.81" data-end="930.12">critical and so valuable because now</span> <span data-start="930.12" data-end="931.77">everybody is on the same page at the</span> <span data-start="931.77"

data-end="948.45">it's probably because you're not as</span> <span data-start="948.45" data-end="949.56">confident in your code is you really</span> <span data-start="949.56" data-end="951.99">want to be ultimately this comes down to</span> <span data-start="951.99" data-end="954.24">testing right you know that you can put</span> <span data-start="954.24" data-end="957.24">stuff out when when it's really good</span> <span data-start="957.24" data-end="959.46">quality code when you trust your code</span> <span data-start="959.46" data-end="962.55">that means you are happy to let it go</span> <span data-start="962.55" data-end="964.86">out into production when I first started</span> <span data-start="964.86" data-end="966.51">when this team first started we thought</span> <span

data-end="978.09">where we would throw things up into</span> <span data-start="978.09" data-end="980.52">staging and while all the individual</span> <span data-start="980.52" data-end="982.68">pieces

data-end="1152.13">interesting because we have a CLI and</span> <span data-start="1152.13" data-end="1154.049">that's where all of our users interact</span> <span data-start="1154.049" data-end="1157.44">with us but our marketing team and our</span> <span data-start="1157.44" data-end="1160.41">support team and our Doc's team they all</span> <span data-start="1160.41" data-end="1162.809">need to use the only to talk to you some</span> <span data-start="1162.809" data-end="1165.15">way somehow and that's in addition to</span> <span data-start="1165.15" data-end="1167.04">all the products that we're building so</span> <span data-start="1167.04" data-end="1169.44">one of the biggest difficulties we had</span> <span data-start="1169.44" data-end="1172.23">early on and actually even still to this</span> <span data-start="1172.23" data-end="1174.96">day is figuring out how to really</span> <span data-start="1174.96" data-end="1177.21">prioritize all of the different</span> <span data-start="1177.21" data-end="1179.61">requirements and needs which are all</span> <span data-start="1179.61" data-end="1182.79">valid in a way that we can really push</span> <span data-start="1182.79" data-end="1184.95">everything out the door especially given</span> <span data-start="1184.95" data-end="1187.2">that we have such a tiny tiny team the</span> <span data-start="1187.2" data-end="1188.91">fact that everybody wants their say on</span> <span data-start="1188.91" data-end="1190.799">how the website should look or act or</span> <span data-start="1190.799" data-end="1193.919">feel it can be really overwhelming so we</span> <span data-start="1193.919" data-end="1196.26">started we did two things and like I</span> <span data-start="1196.26" data-end="1198.059">said it's a work in progress but the</span> <span data-start="1198.059" data-end="1200.34">first thing we did was we started adding</span> <span data-start="1200.34" data-end="1201.87">some kind of project management some</span> <span data-start="1201.87" data-end="1203.79">product management to get people to kind</span> <span data-start="1203.79" data-end="1205.77">of line up and say okay here are the</span> <span data-start="1205.77" data-end="1208.59">major things that we need to accomplish</span> <span data-start="1208.59" data-end="1210.63">and that's been really helpful because</span> <span data-start="1210.63" data-end="1211.98">it allows us to kind of put into</span> <span data-start="1211.98" data-end="1213.779">perspective okay this is the next thing</span> <span data-start="1213.779" data-end="1215.34">that we need to accomplish everybody's</span> <span data-start="1215.34" data-end="1217.62">on board cool but the other thing that</span> <span data-start="1217.62" data-end="1219.419">we did from a technical side is we</span> <span data-start="1219.419" data-end="1221.64">started breaking the website down it's a</span> <span data-start="1221.64" data-end="1224.159">massive monolith at the moment but we're</span> <span data-start="1224.159" data-end="1224.97">starting to breaking it down into</span> <span data-start="1224.97" data-end="1227.13">different micro services which will</span> <span data-start="1227.13" data-end="1230.94">allow individual teams a 10pm to kind of</span> <span data-start="1230.94" data-end="1233.85">take over their own personal piece so</span> <span data-start="1233.85" data-end="1235.95">for example the marketing team will have</span> <span data-start="1235.95" data-end="1239.85">their own kind of marketing service that</span> <span data-start="1239.85" data-end="1241.23">you as the user won't ever actually</span> <span data-start="1241.23" data-end="1243.72">notice any difference but at least what</span> <span data-start="1243.72" data-end="1245.34">that means is the marketing team can go</span> <span data-start="1245.34" data-end="1246.809">ahead and push out the code they need</span> <span data-start="1246.809" data-end="1249.059">whenever they want without having to</span> <span data-start="1249.059" data-end="1251.1">incur the three-team three-person team</span> <span data-start="1251.1" data-end="1255.72">bottleneck now probably the hardest</span> <span data-start="1255.72" data-end="1257.82">lesson that we've learned in the last</span> <span data-start="1257.82" data-end="1260.929">two and a half years comes down to this</span> <span data-start="1260.929" data-end="1263.789">when Isaac first started NPM he did</span> <span data-start="1263.789" data-end="1265.35">everything an open source and it was</span> <span data-start="1265.35" data-end="1267.45">fantastic it was really really really</span> <span data-start="1267.45" data-end="1269.909">wonderful in fact all of us who joined</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1269.909" data-end="1271.59">NPM especially on the engineering team</span> <span data-start="1271.59" data-end="1274.289">we were super ecstatic because how great</span> <span data-start="1274.289" data-end="1275.909">is it to have somebody else pay you to</span> <span data-start="1275.909" data-end="1277.649">work on open source like that is just</span> <span data-start="1277.649" data-end="1279.059">the coolest thing ever no more nights</span> <span data-start="1279.059" data-end="1281.94">and weekends this is your day job and it</span> <span data-start="1281.94" data-end="1285.809">was great but then something happened we</span> <span data-start="1285.809" data-end="1287.64">had to get stuff out the door we had a</span> <span data-start="1287.64" data-end="1289.89">move on product our team was too small</span> <span data-start="1289.89" data-end="1292.529">we didn't have any bandwidth or the</span> <span data-start="1292.529" data-end="1294.899">people or the time to really focus on</span> <span data-start="1294.899" data-end="1297.63">the user community so people would put</span> <span data-start="1297.63" data-end="1299.13">in pull requests and issues and we were</span> <span data-start="1299.13" data-end="1301.5">like okay well let's get to this but</span> <span data-start="1301.5" data-end="1303.6">then another thing happened which is</span> <span data-start="1303.6" data-end="1305.58">that the registry team decided to break</span> <span data-start="1305.58" data-end="1307.649">out the registry into lots of different</span> <span data-start="1307.649" data-end="1310.679">micro services which was great it made</span> <span data-start="1310.679" data-end="1312.87">us move a lot faster internally but it</span> <span data-start="1312.87" data-end="1314.94">meant that our user base couldn't</span> <span data-start="1314.94" data-end="1317.34">replicate the website locally because</span> <span data-start="1317.34" data-end="1319.26">all of these services were private and</span> <span data-start="1319.26" data-end="1320.789">everything like that and it was just</span> <span data-start="1320.789" data-end="1323.429">suddenly you could clone the repo but</span> <span data-start="1323.429" data-end="1326.25">you couldn't actually do anything with</span> <span data-start="1326.25" data-end="1328.59">it and Sippie would put in issues and</span> <span data-start="1328.59" data-end="1331.08">they'd be like hey I think I think this</span> <span data-start="1331.08" data-end="1332.399">is wrong but I don't know because I</span> <span data-start="1332.399" data-end="1335.46">can't replicate it but maybe you could</span> <span data-start="1335.46" data-end="1338.039">do it for us it's like we don't have the</span> <span data-start="1338.039" data-end="1340.32">time to do that oh gosh this is really</span> <span data-start="1340.32" data-end="1341.7">bad and</span> <span data-start="1341.7" data-end="1343.08">just kind of kept building up and</span> <span data-start="1343.08" data-end="1344.789">building up and it was kind of terrible</span> <span data-start="1344.789" data-end="1347.46">and at the same time we had the</span> <span data-start="1347.46" data-end="1351.57">situation where because our repo was</span> <span data-start="1351.57" data-end="1354.029">open source at the time like we've been</span> <span data-start="1354.029" data-end="1356.87">using Travis continuous integration for</span> <span data-start="1356.87" data-end="1359.22">last year and a half or so and it's been</span> <span data-start="1359.22" data-end="1364.529">fantastic at the time the if you have a</span> <span data-start="1364.529" data-end="1367.2">public repo you end up in the same queue</span> <span data-start="1367.2" data-end="1369.09">as all the other public repose which</span> <span data-start="1369.09" data-end="1371.22">sometimes meant that even if it was a</span> <span data-start="1371.22" data-end="1374.07">massive security bug fix it could take</span> <span data-start="1374.07" data-end="1376.799">up to an hour maybe two to get our build</span> <span data-start="1376.799" data-end="1379.32">to go that's not acceptable for a</span> <span data-start="1379.32" data-end="1381.75">production level website so we did a</span> <span data-start="1381.75" data-end="1384.029">little experiment we we went ahead and</span> <span data-start="1384.029" data-end="1386.669">we've made a private Fork of the website</span> <span data-start="1386.669" data-end="1389.07">just to see what happens well first of</span> <span data-start="1389.07" data-end="1391.169">all the Travis fields went the the</span> <span data-start="1391.169" data-end="1393.36">timing went down super it was super fast</span> <span data-start="1393.36" data-end="1395.669">right so great we can move forward and</span> <span data-start="1395.669" data-end="1398.1">we can move really quickly but then</span> <span data-start="1398.1" data-end="1401.36">another thing happened nobody noticed</span> <span data-start="1401.36" data-end="1403.98">nobody noticed that we made a private</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1403.98" data-end="1407.1">Fork of everything like the public open</span> <span data-start="1407.1" data-end="1409.019">source version of our website was stale</span> <span data-start="1409.019" data-end="1411.539">for months and there may be two people</span> <span data-start="1411.539" data-end="1413.039">who are like hey wait a second this</span> <span data-start="1413.039" data-end="1415.5">doesn't quite look right but I'm talking</span> <span data-start="1415.5" data-end="1419.88">to out of all of our users that was it</span> <span data-start="1419.88" data-end="1423.179">was kind of like well so at this point</span> <span data-start="1423.179" data-end="1426.299">it kind of just feels like just a view</span> <span data-start="1426.299" data-end="1428.85">source button which it was really</span> <span data-start="1428.85" data-end="1430.95">awesome talking to miles the other night</span> <span data-start="1430.95" data-end="1433.919">he talked about open source vs. view</span> <span data-start="1433.919" data-end="1435.09">source and I thought it was a brilliant</span> <span data-start="1435.09" data-end="1437.669">brilliant idea but that was basically we</span> <span data-start="1437.669" data-end="1438.75">were doing we're just kind of showing</span> <span data-start="1438.75" data-end="1440.34">off our website but we couldn't let</span> <span data-start="1440.34" data-end="1444.059">anybody really comment on it or work</span> <span data-start="1444.059" data-end="1446.49">with it or play with it and so we made</span> <span data-start="1446.49" data-end="1448.83">the really tough decision to go ahead</span> <span data-start="1448.83" data-end="1454.35">and just shut it down that's hard it's</span> <span data-start="1454.35" data-end="1456.63">really hard believe me there was a lot</span> <span data-start="1456.63" data-end="1459.299">of angry people internally to the</span> <span data-start="1459.299" data-end="1460.98">company there were a lot of discussions</span> <span data-start="1460.98" data-end="1462.779">there were very heated discussions that</span> <span data-start="1462.779" data-end="1465.12">happen because of it now the way that</span> <span data-start="1465.12" data-end="1466.71">we've mollified it is that in the</span> <span data-start="1466.71" data-end="1468.929">process of taking our monolithic app and</span> <span data-start="1468.929" data-end="1470.22">breaking it down into smaller pieces</span> <span data-start="1470.22" data-end="1472.799">we're open sourcing the tiny modules</span> <span data-start="1472.799" data-end="1474.899">right and those are a lot easier to</span> <span data-start="1474.899" data-end="1475.35">maintain</span> <span data-start="1475.35" data-end="1478.95">because it's 30 lines of code there's a</span> <span data-start="1478.95" data-end="1481.32">pull request great and it's easy to see</span> <span data-start="1481.32" data-end="1484.549">an easy to test and it's fantastic so</span> <span data-start="1484.549" data-end="1488.34">that was rough but it happened now</span> <span data-start="1488.34" data-end="1491.07">through all of this we have learned a</span> <span data-start="1491.07" data-end="1493.89">ton of lessons right we've made a bunch</span> <span data-start="1493.89" data-end="1495.57">of mistakes we've made some really good</span> <span data-start="1495.57" data-end="1497.76">decisions and we paid a ton of progress</span> <span data-start="1497.76" data-end="1502.799">and just change this website so much but</span> <span data-start="1502.799" data-end="1504.36">ultimately no matter what mistakes we</span> <span data-start="1504.36"

data-end="1511.679">continue cycling because change is</span> <span data-start="1511.679" data-end="1514.08">inevitable as we move forward as we</span> <span data-start="1514.08"
