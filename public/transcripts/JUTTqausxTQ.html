<p><span data-start="224.28" data-end="232.22">Basically, it means you come home and your space is empty and nothing is broken.</span> <span data-start="232.22" data-end="233.5">Of course, that could happen.</span> <span data-start="233.5" data-end="239.129">If somebody else has a key, he can open it and steal whatever he wants.</span> <span data-start="239.129" data-end="240.23">Or put new stuff in.</span> <span data-start="240.23" data-end="242.739">That's also possible.</span> <span data-start="242.739" data-end="251.9">But generally, in that case, we have a problem with trusting in our locks and keys.</span> <span data-start="251.9" data-end="258.47">That's what's happening if we know that there are some copies of our keys out.</span> <span data-start="258.47" data-end="263.94">And so gain back access, the only solution we have, we can exchange the lock and the</span> <span data-start="263.94" data-end="267.94">key in total.</span> <span data-start="267.94" data-end="272.07">And out of this there was a new question coming up.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="272.07" data-end="274.53">And I have a lot of questions.</span> <span data-start="274.53" data-end="276.06">Could we detect copies?</span> <span data-start="276.06" data-end="282.85">Is there any way how we are able to detect that our keys are copied?</span> <span data-start="282.85" data-end="289.11">And in the physical world� oops.</span> <span data-start="289.11" data-end="291.61">Good.</span> <span data-start="291.61" data-end="294.48">In the physical world this is difficult.</span> <span data-start="294.48" data-end="300.73">But the important thing is to know that in the physical world no exactly same objects</span> <span data-start="300.73" data-end="302.07">exist at any moment.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="302.07" data-end="308.79">So it's not possible to replicate to 100% equal in the physical world.</span> <span data-start="308.79" data-end="310.2">It's too complicated.</span> <span data-start="310.2" data-end="321.55">And there's a lot of things which says, okay, I have� there are natures line the bullets</span> <span data-start="321.55" data-end="324.38">fired through a specific gun.</span> <span data-start="324.38" data-end="329.19">Or you could say it a little bit different, there is no perfect crime in the physical</span> <span data-start="329.19" data-end="330.19">world.</span> <span data-start="330.19" data-end="333.81">So there's every time an evidence which says, okay.</span> <span data-start="333.81" data-end="336.16">That's a copy.</span> <span data-start="336.16" data-end="342.12">That is whatever makes it visible that it doesn't work out.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="342.12" data-end="345.12">In digital, it's a completely different story.</span> <span data-start="345.12" data-end="354.72">And in digital, copying of data generates 100% perfect objects.</span> <span data-start="354.72" data-end="359.75">Which are absolutely identical to the original object.</span> <span data-start="359.75" data-end="371.46">And that causes that we are asking the question, are physical objects� digital objects copied</span> <span data-start="371.46" data-end="372.74">or not copied?</span> <span data-start="372.74" data-end="373.74">Is there an original?</span> <span data-start="373.74" data-end="374.74">No.</span> <span data-start="374.74" data-end="378.55">We are all copies.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="378.55" data-end="383">There's also some other constraints coming into place.</span> <span data-start="383" data-end="388.12">If you tried to replicate 1,000 keys, it's hard work to do.</span> <span data-start="388.12" data-end="391.46">It's pretty complex.</span> <span data-start="391.46" data-end="400.56">In digital, it's basically impossible to distinguish between the original and the copied thing.</span> <span data-start="400.56" data-end="409.56">So that's� for me it was a very important understanding to get the knowledge that everything</span> <span data-start="409.56" data-end="413.26">in digital is a perfect copy.</span> <span data-start="413.26" data-end="416.06">And this is a very common scenario.</span> <span data-start="416.06" data-end="417.71">Of course, I'm on the left.</span> <span data-start="417.71" data-end="420.1">No, I am this.</span> <span data-start="420.1" data-end="423.45">The guy behind with the green lock, I'm very happy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="423.45" data-end="427.2">And on the other side, that's the server guy.</span> <span data-start="427.2" data-end="430.07">And he has his own private key.</span> <span data-start="430.07" data-end="435.27">And in this scenario, we have� in the first place, we did not see any copies.</span> <span data-start="435.27" data-end="438.83">There is no copy of the private key information.</span> <span data-start="438.83" data-end="445.95">They're just handing it off, we are seeing that the transport to use, we can see the</span> <span data-start="445.95" data-end="448.26">transfer is still in place.</span> <span data-start="448.26" data-end="453.58">And we know that there might not be a third party which can read this.</span> <span data-start="453.58" data-end="456.54">Can read the data, which we are transferring.</span> <span data-start="456.54" data-end="459.25">So it's okay.</span> <span data-start="459.25" data-end="470.32">But what happens if we have a third party coming into this session?</span> <span data-start="470.32" data-end="474.33">And� go back.</span> <span data-start="474.33" data-end="479.27">What happens if a third party is coming into this session?</span> <span data-start="479.27" data-end="486.61">And the nice thing in that case is� the right one, so the server guy� hands out</span> <span data-start="486.61" data-end="490.58">his key to this guy in the middle.</span> <span data-start="490.58" data-end="493.87">And for us that means everything stays green.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="493.87" data-end="496.06">We still see the green lock.</span> <span data-start="496.06" data-end="501.28">But there's another person who is also able to� yeah.</span> <span data-start="501.28" data-end="506.56">Modify the data we are transferring and so on.</span> <span data-start="506.56" data-end="510.88">That's why I called it the perfect man in the middle impersonation.</span> <span data-start="510.88" data-end="525.8">Which, based on that we are having losing the key between two partners.</span> <span data-start="525.8" data-end="530.98">And in the digital universe, it's basically impossible to identify that this scenario</span> <span data-start="530.98" data-end="533.31">that we saw before has happened.</span> <span data-start="533.31" data-end="534.74">Of course, we have no proof.</span> <span data-start="534.74" data-end="542.769">We have no test, nothing different from the outside to gain any evidence that there's</span> <span data-start="542.769" data-end="546.16">a copy created of the key.</span> <span data-start="546.16" data-end="552.38">And the next question is, what about a private key?</span> <span data-start="552.38" data-end="560.24">Are private keys usually copied?</span> <span data-start="560.24" data-end="561.93">I asked another question.</span> <span data-start="561.93" data-end="566.649">Is it possible to detect copies out of private keys from the outside?</span> <span data-start="566.649" data-end="576.77">Could I find any measurement which allows me to determine if there are copies generated</span> <span data-start="576.77" data-end="578.99">on the server side?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="578.99" data-end="584.14">And what I did is, I just measured how long.</span> <span data-start="584.14" data-end="590.139">But I only measured the time how long it takes to open a TLS connection.</span> <span data-start="590.139" data-end="596.55">My assumption was like that, if only one key exists and I do these measurements from different</span> <span data-start="596.55" data-end="607.12">places on this planet, then I will see proportional factor, which is related to the speed of light,</span> <span data-start="607.12" data-end="613.48">of the distance between me and the key.</span> <span data-start="613.48" data-end="624.269">And out of this, I discovered� I discovered the following, that, for example, Amazon.com</span> <span data-start="624.269" data-end="627.35">has only one key in one place.</span> <span data-start="627.35" data-end="632.24">So you can hop around to the whole world and try to access them and measure the time how</span> <span data-start="632.24" data-end="635.55">long it takes to open the connection.</span> <span data-start="635.55" data-end="639.829">And you will see that the� that is in proportion to the speed of light.</span> <span data-start="639.829" data-end="645.92">Which we need to transfer data from A to B.

<p><span data-start="661.269" data-end="662.57">And there are four points.</span> <span data-start="662.57" data-end="671.17">I measure somewhere in the U.S., somewhere in Europe, I measure somewhere in Japan.</span> <span data-start="671.17" data-end="675.439">And last, but not least, in Australia.</span> <span data-start="675.439" data-end="683.029">And I discover that the keys must be within a perimeter of 2,000 kilometers around my</span> <span data-start="683.029" data-end="685.269">measurement points.</span> <span data-start="685.269" data-end="687.959">And out of this there are no intersections.</span> <span data-start="687.959" data-end="698.86">I could basically induct and say, okay, there must be four copies of the key, at least.</span> <span data-start="698.86" data-end="700.54">To get this pattern working.</span> <span data-start="700.54" data-end="706.769">Of course, every open TLS connection needs to make use of the private key.</span> <span data-start="706.769" data-end="714.399">And to get these timings, it's only possible if you are having the key copied over to the</span> <span data-start="714.399" data-end="720.559">specific location or you will see� the highlight and see during the transfer to a central point</span> <span data-start="720.559" data-end="727.779">where the keys are living.</span> <span data-start="727.779" data-end="732.139">And this ends up with one interesting thing.</span> <span data-start="732.139" data-end="733.139">Okay.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="733.139" data-end="736.639">It's normal that we have copies of keys out.</span> <span data-start="736.639" data-end="747.759">So it's not like my house at home where I know, okay, I have one key or three keys.</span> <span data-start="747.759" data-end="751.41">And in this case, I definitely know there will be copies.</span> <span data-start="751.41" data-end="755.649">And it's a very common pattern to copy the private key on the Internet.</span> <span data-start="755.649" data-end="757.879">It's not the same.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="944.059" data-end="950.05">And they are built to maintain the integrity of public keys.</span> <span data-start="950.05" data-end="952.639">That's the only thing they do.</span> <span data-start="952.639" data-end="962.42">They never do anything or touches the private key integrity.</span> <span data-start="962.42" data-end="963.459">That's a vacuum.</span> <span data-start="963.459" data-end="965.259">There's nothing in.</span> <span data-start="965.259" data-end="968.81">So nobody cares about the private keys at all.</span> <span data-start="968.81" data-end="975.429">And� but they are�the reason why we are trusting on keys.</span> <span data-start="975.429" data-end="981.579">So it's pretty difficult.</span> <span data-start="981.579" data-end="987.509">And I came to the conclusion saying, okay, the weakest link of the chain of trust we</span> <span data-start="987.509" data-end="992.43">have is the private key of my communication partner.</span> <span data-start="992.43" data-end="996.41">That's basically� or that is the fundamental thing.</span> <span data-start="996.41" data-end="1004.68">So if I did not know how my partner and communication handles his private keys, I barely could trust</span> <span data-start="1004.68" data-end="1005.68">him.</span> <span data-start="1005.68" data-end="1014.329">Which a little bit means we cannot trust anybody.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1014.329" data-end="1025.93">This raises the question which is there any solution to these problems to maintain the</span> <span data-start="1025.93" data-end="1029.2">private key integrity?</span> <span data-start="1029.2" data-end="1034.26">And my honest answer to that is, I have no clue.</span> <span data-start="1034.26" data-end="1043.16">So there is� in the scale of worldwide organizations� no chance to deal with that.</span> <span data-start="1043.16" data-end="1050.64">There are some approaches, generally speaking, on current technology basis we have to solution</span> <span data-start="1050.64" data-end="1058.3">to trust on other keys if they are copied.</span> <span data-start="1058.3" data-end="1063.97">But luckily, there is a little tiny solution.</span> <span data-start="1063.97" data-end="1067.72">That we could use to our own private keys.</span> <span data-start="1067.72" data-end="1074.39">So every private key you have and use on a daily basis, you can protect.</span> <span data-start="1074.39" data-end="1079.41">You can protect with the use of smart cuts.</span> <span data-start="1079.41" data-end="1086.71">So smart cards are these devices I had before which says, okay, it is only a oneway road.</span> <span data-start="1086.71" data-end="1092.04">You can put a key in, but you will never get a key out, or better, smart cards are also</span> <span data-start="1092.04" data-end="1095.4">able to generate the key within the card.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1095.4" data-end="1100.46">So it never exposed the card� the key to anyone else.</span> <span data-start="1100.46" data-end="1106.94">But you can still use it to protect it and copy.</span> <span data-start="1106.94" data-end="1110.19">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="1110.19" data-end="1114.36">You can still use this for encryption, sign, and so on.</span> <span data-start="1114.36" data-end="1121.17">But you will never, ever, as your own� you will never get your private key material in</span> <span data-start="1121.17" data-end="1123.82">hand so that you could copy it.</span> <span data-start="1123.82" data-end="1129.36">The only ability to access it is to take a smart card and use it.</span> <span data-start="1129.36" data-end="1133.03">So that's pretty cool that these kind of things exist.</span> <span data-start="1133.03" data-end="1135.25">And� yeah.</span> <span data-start="1135.25" data-end="1136.63">I'm done at this point.</span> <span data-start="1136.63" data-end="1142.96">Of course, I lost control a little bit of time out of the starting problems.</span> <span data-start="1142.96" data-end="1149.78">So you have to say thank you to my friends, Myles, and the JSConf and you, audience.</span> <span data-start="1149.78" data-end="1150.78">Thanks.</span> <span data-start="1150.78" data-end="1151.78">[ Applause ]</span> <span data-start="1151.78" data-end="1152.78"Audience member: All right.</span> </p>
