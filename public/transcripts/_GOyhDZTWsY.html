<p><span data-start="0" data-end="4.04">um so yeah hi my name is Adam Brett's</span> <span data-start="4.04" data-end="7.95">that's a or b on github and a or b on</span> <span data-start="7.95" data-end="11.16">IRC and the happy channel and Adam</span> <span data-start="11.16" data-end="14.13">Brett's on the Twitter so I work at</span> <span data-start="14.13" data-end="16.65">Walmart on the open source team believe</span> <span data-start="16.65" data-end="19.439">it or not that is a real thing and so I</span> <span data-start="19.439" data-end="22.5">pretty much spent my day working on the</span> <span data-start="22.5" data-end="24.869">happy basically universe and everything</span> <span data-start="24.869" data-end="27.48">that sort of goes along with it if you</span> <span data-start="27.48" data-end="30.689">follow any of the activity stream for</span> <span data-start="30.689" data-end="32.16">that you'll notice I do a lot of work on</span> <span data-start="32.16" data-end="36.059">the good ops monitoring plug-in and sort</span> <span data-start="36.059" data-end="38.55">of the the pieces that make that up so</span> <span data-start="38.55" data-end="40.02">as you can probably guess I'm here to</span> <span data-start="40.02" data-end="44.1">talk to you about lab so lab is the</span> <span data-start="44.1" data-end="47.07">testing framework that we use at walmart</span> <span data-start="47.07" data-end="49.969">we use it both internally and externally</span> <span data-start="49.969" data-end="53.82">for the entire happy j/s stack before i</span> <span data-start="53.82" data-end="57.05">get too far into this all the examples</span> <span data-start="57.05" data-end="60.18">are for lab version 5 so if you're using</span> <span data-start="60.18" data-end="63.3">an older version yeah you're encouraged</span> <span data-start="63.3" data-end="67.32">to move to five there's read me Thanks</span> <span data-start="67.32" data-end="69.75">there's read Me's and sort of help as to</span> <span data-start="69.75" data-end="71.49">how to do that it's it's pretty easy</span> <span data-start="71.49" data-end="75.27">though so today I'm going to talk</span> <span data-start="75.27" data-end="78.27">basically about three things why use lab</span> <span data-start="78.27" data-end="82.049">at all talk about a new assertion module</span> <span data-start="82.049" data-end="84.57">named code and then I'm going to give</span> <span data-start="84.57" data-end="90.78">you a pep talk so why use lab three</span> <span data-start="90.78" data-end="93.42">things three main points really it's</span> <span data-start="93.42" data-end="97.02">been battle-tested it's easy to use like</span> <span data-start="97.02" data-end="98.49">hopefully you find the other happy</span> <span data-start="98.49" data-end="101.759">modules to use and it's got useful</span> <span data-start="101.759" data-end="104.13">options and features that are you know</span> <span data-start="104.13" data-end="111.39">enterprise-grade so all the all the 30</span> <span data-start="111.39" data-end="114.36">or more it keeps changing open-source</span> <span data-start="114.36" data-end="117">repos under the happy j/s umbrella all</span> <span data-start="117" data-end="120.119">use lab in addition to that every</span> <span data-start="120.119" data-end="123.95">project inside walmart uses lab as well</span> <span data-start="123.95" data-end="127.11">so you know labs been built to test high</span> <span data-start="127.11" data-end="129.989">demand high uptime systems like happy</span> <span data-start="129.989" data-end="133.47">and the servers that run inside</span> <span data-start="133.47" data-end="136.23">that that power the walmart sites so you</span> <span data-start="136.23" data-end="138.21">know it's really been been run through</span> <span data-start="138.21" data-end="143.73">the ringer so um these are just two</span> <span data-start="143.73" data-end="145.76">examples to make sure that one plus one</span> <span data-start="145.76" data-end="150.75">does equal to and if you look at them</span> <span data-start="150.75" data-end="154.02">one is TDD ones BDD I don't know which</span> <span data-start="154.02" data-end="155.43">one I don't really understand the</span> <span data-start="155.43" data-end="157.62">difference but ones one and one is the</span> <span data-start="157.62" data-end="162.21">other so it's on a pit onion opinionated</span> <span data-start="162.21" data-end="164.22">how you build and lay out your tests if</span> <span data-start="164.22" data-end="167.4">you can see you kind of sort of can it's</span> <span data-start="167.4" data-end="169.23">basically just aliases you flip around</span> <span data-start="169.23" data-end="173.64">to make it TDD or BDD and so change it</span> <span data-start="173.64" data-end="177.54">to to suit suit your needs all right so</span> <span data-start="177.54" data-end="179.31">some of those features i mentioned</span> <span data-start="179.31" data-end="181.29">earlier we have talked about some of the</span> <span data-start="181.29" data-end="185.19">really handy ones these are all like CLI</span> <span data-start="185.19" data-end="188.4">options the dash C and T sets this is</span> <span data-start="188.4" data-end="191.91">all CLI stuff the next few slides so</span> <span data-start="191.91" data-end="194.91">dash C and dash T for coverage and</span> <span data-start="194.91" data-end="198.51">threshold so r out of the box lad gives</span> <span data-start="198.51" data-end="201.84">you code coverage basically is their cup</span> <span data-start="201.84" data-end="204.3">is their lines of code being hit in the</span> <span data-start="204.3" data-end="207.12">test context that you have define yes or</span> <span data-start="207.12" data-end="211.17">no the dash t sets up the threshold for</span> <span data-start="211.17" data-end="213.84">a failed versus passed test so if your</span> <span data-start="213.84" data-end="216.66">code coverage is less than X then you</span> <span data-start="216.66" data-end="219.84">get you know a frowny face your tests do</span> <span data-start="219.84" data-end="222.75">not pass once you start using it you</span> <span data-start="222.75" data-end="224.519">will find that the code coverage is</span> <span data-start="224.519" data-end="228.18">annoyingly thorough so in this example</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="228.18" data-end="230.61">I've got here you will need code that</span> <span data-start="230.61" data-end="232.739">exercises both sides of that or</span> <span data-start="232.739" data-end="235.5">statement for settings both sides of the</span> <span data-start="235.5" data-end="237.81">ternary operator for results and all</span> <span data-start="237.81" data-end="242.61">three sides of that if statement it's</span> <span data-start="242.61" data-end="244.62">annoying but it's no way to know for</span> <span data-start="244.62" data-end="248.31">sure that you've hit everything so</span> <span data-start="248.31" data-end="250.44">there's built-in linting right out of</span> <span data-start="250.44" data-end="254.04">the box it comes lab comes default with</span> <span data-start="254.04" data-end="258.12">a as a lint file that sort of matches</span> <span data-start="258.12" data-end="261.299">the happy style guide it uses es Lynn as</span> <span data-start="261.299" data-end="264.06">the rule engine if you don't like our</span> <span data-start="264.06" data-end="265.41">style guide which I don't know why you</span> <span data-start="265.41" data-end="267.03">wouldn't but if you don't</span> <span data-start="267.03" data-end="270.03">you can override it with your own es</span> <span data-start="270.03" data-end="271.83">lint our C file at the root of your</span> <span data-start="271.83" data-end="274.98">project and one thing I want to note</span> <span data-start="274.98" data-end="276.54">there if you do that you need to supply</span> <span data-start="276.54" data-end="278.55">your own entire file it doesn't like</span> <span data-start="278.55" data-end="280.62">merge or anything wacky like that so if</span> <span data-start="280.62" data-end="281.82">you want to use your own you've got</span> <span data-start="281.82" data-end="283.889">right you're your own and this example</span> <span data-start="283.889" data-end="285.69">here is basically what what it looks</span> <span data-start="285.69" data-end="291.33">like if lint is mad so this is new in</span> <span data-start="291.33" data-end="293.97">five the dash a option you basically</span> <span data-start="293.97" data-end="296.639">tell lab the name of the assertion</span> <span data-start="296.639" data-end="299.43">library using and that is helpful</span> <span data-start="299.43" data-end="300.96">because then it can keep track of how</span> <span data-start="300.96" data-end="304.14">many assertions you've run it doesn't</span> <span data-start="304.14" data-end="306.06">sound very useful but sometimes you</span> <span data-start="306.06" data-end="307.59">think you've run an assertion but you</span> <span data-start="307.59" data-end="309.57">actually don't and you can sometimes get</span> <span data-start="309.57" data-end="311.79">like a mysterious test that pasts but</span> <span data-start="311.79" data-end="313.29">you don't end up actually testing</span> <span data-start="313.29" data-end="315.66">anything so the dash day is a very</span> <span data-start="315.66" data-end="322.02">powerful new feature to lab so we got</span> <span data-start="322.02" data-end="324.81">verbose and ID verbose prints out all</span> <span data-start="324.81" data-end="327.3">that test verbiage you spent time</span> <span data-start="327.3" data-end="330.54">reading for your t dds and BDDs it</span> <span data-start="330.54" data-end="333.419">prints out you know math module shump</span> <span data-start="333.419" data-end="335.43">sums numbers it does not crash on empty</span> <span data-start="335.43" data-end="337.44">raised it prints out how long it took to</span> <span data-start="337.44" data-end="340.05">run the test a little glyph for past</span> <span data-start="340.05" data-end="343.31">fails and it also prints out a test ID</span> <span data-start="343.31" data-end="346.8">that test ID is useful for the ID flag</span> <span data-start="346.8" data-end="349.979">so that lets you basically run specific</span> <span data-start="349.979" data-end="352.919">subsets of tests if you're trying to get</span> <span data-start="352.919" data-end="354.75">coverage or make a particular feature</span> <span data-start="354.75" data-end="357.36">work you can run an ID and just keep</span> <span data-start="357.36" data-end="359.58">hitting the one or two tests over and</span> <span data-start="359.58" data-end="360.72">over again instead of rewriting the</span> <span data-start="360.72" data-end="364.65">entire suite and I'll take a range 1</span> <span data-start="364.65" data-end="367.56">through 2 1 & 2 it'll also take a little</span> <span data-start="367.56" data-end="370.14">mix and match so you can do 1 comma 2 3</span> <span data-start="370.14" data-end="374.76">through four let's see so there's a few</span> <span data-start="374.76" data-end="377.16">other quick features that I want to</span> <span data-start="377.16" data-end="378.77">mention that don't need a whole slide</span> <span data-start="378.77" data-end="381.57">async testing is easy because every test</span> <span data-start="381.57" data-end="383.97">is passed a call back I know some other</span> <span data-start="383.97" data-end="386.669">testing frameworks it's you do something</span> <span data-start="386.669" data-end="388.47">a little different to get a sink testing</span> <span data-start="388.47" data-end="390.84">in lab everything's already assumed to</span> <span data-start="390.84" data-end="392.82">be a sink you have a bunch of different</span> <span data-start="392.82" data-end="395.31">output options not just console so if</span> <span data-start="395.31" data-end="397.86">you have a very involved project manager</span> <span data-start="397.86" data-end="400.09">who wants to see graphs and charts</span> <span data-start="400.09" data-end="402.6">you can print it out to HTML or</span> <span data-start="402.6" data-end="405.07">coveralls there's a bunch of different</span> <span data-start="405.07" data-end="411.34">reporting options as well so how we use</span> <span data-start="411.34" data-end="413.59">lab and again when i say we i really</span> <span data-start="413.59" data-end="415.54">mean walmart internally and externally</span> <span data-start="415.54" data-end="419.47">and again it's the same pretty much in</span> <span data-start="419.47" data-end="421.9">both cases so that dash t option i</span> <span data-start="421.9" data-end="425.26">talked about threshold is 100 so the</span> <span data-start="425.26" data-end="427.12">threshold for code coverage always has</span> <span data-start="427.12" data-end="429.76">to be a hundred if you've ever made any</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="429.76" data-end="432.49">PRS into the happy universe and I hope</span> <span data-start="432.49" data-end="434.61">you have and encourage you to do so you</span> <span data-start="434.61" data-end="437.77">will probably get comments about hey</span> <span data-start="437.77" data-end="440.139">this is missing coverage or tests don't</span> <span data-start="440.139" data-end="442.45">pass taking you to add test it's the</span> <span data-start="442.45" data-end="446.229">dash t 100 that that's doing that to you</span> <span data-start="446.229" data-end="449.19">so that that's where that comes from</span> <span data-start="449.19" data-end="451.99">always use a CI server that runs a</span> <span data-start="451.99" data-end="455.169">designated test command and we have we</span> <span data-start="455.169" data-end="456.58">use a make file but the make thought</span> <span data-start="456.58" data-end="458.729">really just has different lab configs</span> <span data-start="458.729" data-end="461.74">but NPM test is usually fine for most</span> <span data-start="461.74" data-end="466.03">people and nothing ever no PR ever gets</span> <span data-start="466.03" data-end="468.34">merged in unless the CI server says that</span> <span data-start="468.34" data-end="470.86">everything passed so you have to meet</span> <span data-start="470.86" data-end="472.87">that coverage dress threshold you have</span> <span data-start="472.87" data-end="474.599">to pass linting rules if you use it</span> <span data-start="474.599" data-end="476.8">unless your errand then you can merge</span> <span data-start="476.8" data-end="480.82">anything so what you get from all this</span> <span data-start="480.82" data-end="484.45">you get the sort of neat automatic</span> <span data-start="484.45" data-end="485.889">feedback loop that doesn't require</span> <span data-start="485.889" data-end="488.77">humans so you open a pull request</span> <span data-start="488.77" data-end="491.44">against something your CI server will</span> <span data-start="491.44" data-end="494.56">run and you'll see that little glyph on</span> <span data-start="494.56" data-end="496.9">github warning you that it can't be</span> <span data-start="496.9" data-end="499.51">merged in and so then hopefully you look</span> <span data-start="499.51" data-end="501.25">at the details and see hey coverage is</span> <span data-start="501.25" data-end="503.08">less than one hundred percent or your</span> <span data-start="503.08" data-end="505.36">linting failed or you know you're</span> <span data-start="505.36" data-end="508.57">missing a test entirely and so the you</span> <span data-start="508.57" data-end="510.039">know the cool thing there is that you</span> <span data-start="510.039" data-end="511.63">have this feedback loop it's pretty much</span> <span data-start="511.63" data-end="514.36">automatic and you kind of pull people</span> <span data-start="514.36" data-end="517.15">through writing better code without</span> <span data-start="517.15" data-end="519.88">having to harass them to do it so it's a</span> <span data-start="519.88" data-end="522.729">pretty pretty nice little cycle and it's</span> <span data-start="522.729" data-end="524.29">definitely worth setting up just for</span> <span data-start="524.29" data-end="525.88">that alone you get higher quality code</span> <span data-start="525.88" data-end="528.94">and you sort of get that for free by</span> <span data-start="528.94" data-end="530.95">having this sort of come continuous</span> <span data-start="530.95" data-end="533.47">feedback loop</span> <span data-start="533.47" data-end="536.27">so quickly going to touch on the this</span> <span data-start="536.27" data-end="539.72">code module I talked about so that's a</span> <span data-start="539.72" data-end="543.17">new one and yeah it's just a base a</span> <span data-start="543.17" data-end="546.11">pretty simple assertion library lab</span> <span data-start="546.11" data-end="550.16">formally came bundled with chai but but</span> <span data-start="550.16" data-end="552.14">we broke that out because child was kind</span> <span data-start="552.14" data-end="554.27">of a little more than what we really</span> <span data-start="554.27" data-end="558.08">needed at a lab and it was also he sort</span> <span data-start="558.08" data-end="560.36">of this problem here where you couldn't</span> <span data-start="560.36" data-end="562.07">remember if it was a property or a</span> <span data-start="562.07" data-end="565.82">method so encode every like assertion is</span> <span data-start="565.82" data-end="568.28">always a method and this also goes back</span> <span data-start="568.28" data-end="570.83">to that assert command I mentioned</span> <span data-start="570.83" data-end="573.62">earlier where this expect property</span> <span data-start="573.62" data-end="577.13">versus expect method if you didn't if it</span> <span data-start="577.13" data-end="578.57">was a method but it wasn't supposed to</span> <span data-start="578.57" data-end="581.42">be you could inadvertently get a a true</span> <span data-start="581.42" data-end="583.31">test when you actually didn't assert</span> <span data-start="583.31" data-end="585.68">anything because that exists might not</span> <span data-start="585.68" data-end="588.89">actually be a property so yeah codes</span> <span data-start="588.89" data-end="591.14">cool it's consistent everything is</span> <span data-start="591.14" data-end="592.84">always a method and there's a lot fewer</span> <span data-start="592.84" data-end="595.22">human words to sort memorized so it's</span> <span data-start="595.22" data-end="601.91">easy to to commit to memory okay so how</span> <span data-start="601.91" data-end="604.43">can you get started hopefully you have</span> <span data-start="604.43" data-end="607.01">tests already but if you don't this is</span> <span data-start="607.01" data-end="608.66">supposed to make you go and do that now</span> <span data-start="608.66" data-end="614.56">if you don't so number one do something</span> <span data-start="614.56" data-end="616.79">yeah you're not getting one hundred</span> <span data-start="616.79" data-end="619.25">percent coverage and tests that say it</span> <span data-start="619.25" data-end="622.01">work is going to take some time so just</span> <span data-start="622.01" data-end="625.73">start small write the test that the it</span> <span data-start="625.73" data-end="628.82">works type of tests and you know just</span> <span data-start="628.82" data-end="630.53">the simple sort of integration tests</span> <span data-start="630.53" data-end="633.2">like that you'll probably hit 50 60 even</span> <span data-start="633.2" data-end="634.91">70 percent code coverage right out of</span> <span data-start="634.91" data-end="639.05">the gate once you get there you know</span> <span

data-end="649.01">should have a test to prove the feature</span> <span data-start="649.01" data-end="651.89">works if you fix a bug either create or</span> <span data-start="651.89" data-end="654.8">add a test to make sure that the test is</span> <span data-start="654.8" data-end="656.39">good and doesn't cause any regressions</span> <span data-start="656.39" data-end="658.52">once you change your process and get</span> <span data-start="658.52" data-end="660.77">that part of it code coverage will go up</span> <span data-start="660.77" data-end="665.3">and and you'll be happy and once you put</span> <span data-start="665.3" data-end="666.17">that time into</span> <span data-start="666.17" data-end="668.45">get you know testing built in your</span> <span

data-start="675.279" data-end="679.79">yeah so 87.5 percent they probably</span> <span data-start="679.79" data-end="681.38">thought this truck was okay but it</span> <span data-start="681.38" data-end="682.79">doesn't really look like it still works</span> <span data-start="682.79" data-end="685.94">so one hundred percent should probably</span> <span data-start="685.94"
