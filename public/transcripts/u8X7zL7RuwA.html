data-end="825.36">implementation of coach DB in JavaScript</span> <span data-start="825.36" data-end="829.02">client so the possible we could live in</span> <span data-start="829.02" data-end="832.47">your application where JavaScript it</span> <span data-start="832.47" data-end="836.51">with a little or a bit little size and</span> <span data-start="836.51" data-end="842.31">it it has approach sweet must multi</span> <span data-start="842.31" data-end="845.73">master nodes so actually that database</span> <span data-start="845.73" data-end="848.34">replication the database not only on the</span> <span data-start="848.34" data-end="852.95">cloud but your device is also a database</span> <span data-start="852.95" data-end="856.47">and it comes with a HTTP protocol

data-start="863.07" data-end="868.17">because it was ready by the design okay</span> <span data-start="868.17" data-end="870.09">so what I'll tell you what do we choose</span> <span data-start="870.09" data-end="872.85">actually for all of ours of course we</span> <span data-start="872.85" data-end="875.67">need some requirement we need to web</span> <span data-start="875.67" data-end="876.87">development ready we need to mobile</span> <span data-start="876.87" data-end="878.49">development ready and time to implement</span> <span data-start="878.49" data-end="883.14">faster I don't put any economical</span> <span data-start="883.14" data-end="888.9">constraint here and I just caught the be</span> <span data-start="888.9" data-end="891.51">enforced to be with react why would</span> <span data-start="891.51" data-end="895.98">react yeah because I we were familiar</span> <span data-start="895.98" data-end="897.93">with react and react native that's way</span> <span data-start="897.93" data-end="902.07">and we can react react already</span> <span data-start="902.07" data-end="903.75">implemented surface rock already so you</span> <span data-start="903.75" data-end="908.52">just uncomment or sorry you just remove</span> <span data-start="908.52" data-end="912.39">two words the unregister change you to</span> <span data-start="912.39" data-end="914.03">register</span> <span data-start="914.03" data-end="917.28">that's we we gather offline first web</span> <span data-start="917.28" data-end="918.06">app</span> <span data-start="918.06" data-end="920.7">but it's not very simple development you</span> <span data-start="920.7" data-end="922.44">get who you have a lot of boilerplate</span> <span data-start="922.44" data-end="923.97">then you have to make a lot of</span> <span data-start="923.97" data-end="925.98">abstraction with the pots and pots DB</span> <span data-start="925.98" data-end="930.24">and we are coming with the another ideas</span> <span data-start="930.24" data-end="932.79">how do what if we create a reactive</span> <span data-start="932.79" data-end="934.98">rendering for pots and coats so your</span> <span data-start="934.98" data-end="939.74">your application cool render by</span> <span data-start="939.74" data-end="945.11">instantly yeah how do you interact with</span> <span data-start="945.11" data-end="948.57">in like a stack container what if we</span> <span data-start="948.57" data-end="949.86">create like a stack to endure to</span> <span data-start="949.86" data-end="956.4">interfacing odds with page century side</span> <span data-start="956.4" data-end="961.47">and this was classic approaching whereas</span> <span data-start="961.47" data-end="962.94">we have surfer we have component</span> <span data-start="962.94" data-end="966.72">renderer and this component state and if</span> <span data-start="966.72" data-end="970.65">we introduce offline first by using this</span> <span data-start="970.65" data-end="976.77">kind of thinking if we use redux we have</span> <span data-start="976.77" data-end="980.94">global stat Redux that that halt with</span> <span data-start="980.94" data-end="984.15">local storage that that interact with</span> <span data-start="984.15" data-end="987.75">surfer interact with component and if we</span> <span data-start="987.75" data-end="992.1">design with without Redux you only need</span> <span data-start="992.1" data-end="994.65">a local storage to store your data state</span> <span data-start="994.65" data-end="998.76">and if you remember this one from its</span> <span data-start="998.76" data-end="1003.38">tremolo I think we're gonna use the</span> <span data-start="1003.38" data-end="1006.47">offline for sweet at radix because it's</span> <span data-start="1006.47" data-end="1008.72">much more similar with what other people</span> <span data-start="1008.72" data-end="1011.6">already had and we won't take another</span> <span data-start="1011.6" data-end="1014.35">step to reinvent the wheel</span> <span data-start="1014.35" data-end="1016.88">so we're creating that container</span> <span data-start="1016.88" data-end="1021.23">interfacing with data synchronization we</span> <span data-start="1021.23" data-end="1024.86">call it pot store it was in production</span> <span data-start="1024.86" data-end="1027.59">ready yet but we use it for our internal</span> <span data-start="1027.59" data-end="1033.23">tools and we have a story what gist or</span> <span data-start="1033.23" data-end="1035.33">example and it was a it is a to-do list</span> <span data-start="1035.33" data-end="1037.76">because nothing to trail in the world</span> <span data-start="1037.76" data-end="1040.43">that came with tout a to-do list simple</span> <span data-start="1040.43" data-end="1044.48">app ok this is how we initialize the</span> <span data-start="1044.48" data-end="1050.6">store which you just need to set your</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1050.6" data-end="1052.01">URL remote</span> <span data-start="1052.01" data-end="1057.46">config and your authentication if it's a</span> <span data-start="1057.46" data-end="1063.38">label and this one is for the component</span> <span data-start="1063.38" data-end="1070.1">side you went to component mount you</span> <span data-start="1070.1" data-end="1074.51">have to subscribe the VIP I to render to</span> <span data-start="1074.51" data-end="1080.78">render your pets reactively and if you</span> <span data-start="1080.78" data-end="1083.6">want to add some item you just call the</span> <span data-start="1083.6" data-end="1087.11">add item API and for dello to you you</span> <span data-start="1087.11" data-end="1090.23">could just call the direct item so we</span> <span data-start="1090.23" data-end="1094.07">abstracted more of odd squad of pods</span> <span data-start="1094.07" data-end="1095.54">implementation to add end to the other</span> <span data-start="1095.54" data-end="1103.76">item and if you want to fetch the data</span> <span data-start="1103.76" data-end="1107.99">you could just call the dotted data it</span> <span data-start="1107.99" data-end="1110.63">contains your data and you can play with</span> <span data-start="1110.63" data-end="1117.5">it because this one this is our store</span> <span data-start="1117.5" data-end="1120.98">looks like in detail you have local deep</span> <span data-start="1120.98" data-end="1125.51">local DB ok remote DB and it will</span> <span data-start="1125.51" data-end="1129.31">replicate from and synchronous from</span> <span data-start="1129.31" data-end="1134.24">local

basically your your</span> <span data-start="1141.53" data-end="1143.09">application will read from the memory</span> <span data-start="1143.09" data-end="1148.22">not from the local storage and it comes</span> <span data-start="1148.22" data-end="1153.41">with crude IPA called mitosis really so</span> <span data-start="1153.41" data-end="1154.58">you don't have to create another</span> <span data-start="1154.58" data-end="1162.2">boilerplate few lines of code we are we</span> <span data-start="1162.2" data-end="1165.58">put in front for react different ring</span> <span data-start="1165.58" data-end="1168.11">but how about the relative support</span> <span data-start="1168.11" data-end="1170.78">because we we want to make what will</span> <span data-start="1170.78"
