<p><span data-start="15.32" data-end="17.14">so I'm going to talk to you guys about</span> <span data-start="17.14" data-end="19.73">circuits that's the title my talk what</span> <span data-start="19.73" data-end="24.08">our circuits circuits are like streams</span> <span data-start="24.08" data-end="29.27">and streams are like circuits and they</span> <span data-start="29.27" data-end="31.22">all I mean they both represent the</span> <span data-start="31.22" data-end="34.58">notion of something that receives a</span> <span data-start="34.58" data-end="37.55">value and can emit a value so this</span> <span data-start="37.55" data-end="41.87">yellow box here is the construct the red</span> <span data-start="41.87" data-end="44">arrow is whatever input can it can</span> <span data-start="44" data-end="45.589">receive the blue arrows whatever output</span> <span data-start="45.589" data-end="49.969">it emits um so if you're lying down at</span> <span data-start="49.969" data-end="52.46">the moment this talk may put you to</span> <span data-start="52.46" data-end="56.149">sleep so if you could sit up if you want</span> <span data-start="56.149" data-end="58.129">to listen otherwise just go to sleep you</span> <span data-start="58.129" data-end="61.399">know it's cool i know its second day I</span> <span data-start="61.399" data-end="64.91">was out last night too so and plus you</span> <span data-start="64.91" data-end="66.289">know as you're sleeping the mind is</span> <span data-start="66.289" data-end="68.18">vulnerable and I can just say anything I</span> <span data-start="68.18" data-end="74.84">want uh so how I started down this track</span> <span data-start="74.84" data-end="79.07">of exploring circuits was through</span> <span data-start="79.07" data-end="81.29">asynchronous function so I do a lot of</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="81.29" data-end="84.409">JavaScript programming where I have to</span> <span data-start="84.409" data-end="89.02">wait on something to to to basically</span> <span data-start="89.02" data-end="92.06">happen before I can act on it so how</span> <span data-start="92.06" data-end="93.74">this is represented a note is through a</span> <span data-start="93.74" data-end="97.88">call back where you have the first first</span> <span data-start="97.88" data-end="99.74">parameter being an error in the second</span> <span data-start="99.74" data-end="102.59">the result right so everyone knows you</span> <span data-start="102.59" data-end="104.27">have a function foo it does something</span> <span data-start="104.27" data-end="107.149">calls back and then it you do stuff with</span> <span data-start="107.149" data-end="109.7">whatever the result is is that that</span> <span data-start="109.7" data-end="112.34">clear some guy's face is like he doesn't</span> <span data-start="112.34" data-end="113.689">understand this but if you don't</span> <span data-start="113.689" data-end="114.619">understand this this is going to be</span> <span data-start="114.619" data-end="116.72">tough because it's like the very basic</span> <span data-start="116.72" data-end="120.079">thing if you want to use foo with</span> <span data-start="120.079" data-end="122.24">another asynchronous function bar you</span> <span data-start="122.24" data-end="125.93">know you got a nest them right so use</span> <span data-start="125.93" data-end="129.079">foo calls back into bar and then you</span> <span data-start="129.079" data-end="130.88">pass it another callback and then you</span> <span data-start="130.88" data-end="132.86">finally do stuff with both the results</span> <span data-start="132.86" data-end="136.09">this is this is I mean it's quite simple</span> <span data-start="136.09" data-end="138.59">however I wasn't I wasn't really happy</span> <span data-start="138.59" data-end="142.209">with this because if you have to keep</span> <span data-start="142.209" data-end="145.01">composing asynchronous functions</span> <span data-start="145.01" data-end="146.87">together with other asynchronous</span> <span data-start="146.87" data-end="148.25">functions with others asynchronous</span> <span data-start="148.25" data-end="148.61">function</span> <span data-start="148.61" data-end="151.34">then what happens after a while as you</span> <span data-start="151.34" data-end="153.77">get callback hell and everyone's</span> <span data-start="153.77" data-end="155.57">familiar with that right it's what when</span> <span data-start="155.57" data-end="157.34">your code is moving off the side of your</span> <span data-start="157.34" data-end="159.23">screen it's also really hard to sort of</span> <span data-start="159.23" data-end="164.45">follow so call back he'll I talked about</span> <span data-start="164.45" data-end="168.08">call back hell in El xjs and and some</span> <span data-start="168.08" data-end="170.45">people said basically that they had</span> <span data-start="170.45" data-end="173.48">never experienced it so I was really</span> <span data-start="173.48" data-end="175.94">surprised because this is sort of one of</span> <span data-start="175.94" data-end="177.14">the patterns that you first encounter</span> <span data-start="177.14" data-end="180.26">when you start with JavaScript so I I</span> <span data-start="180.26" data-end="182">looked into it I was like well maybe</span> <span data-start="182" data-end="184.22">this might be something a phenomenon</span> <span data-start="184.22" data-end="187.25">that only I am experiencing so i looked</span> <span data-start="187.25" data-end="191.57">at the top 10 node categories and you</span> <span data-start="191.57" data-end="194.75">know the control flow async goodies</span> <span data-start="194.75" data-end="197.6">that's you know that's a sizable chunk</span> <span data-start="197.6" data-end="199.88">it's you know a third of the size of</span> <span data-start="199.88" data-end="203.239">third of the size of web frameworks</span> <span data-start="203.239" data-end="205.93">which is like the top module category so</span> <span data-start="205.93" data-end="208.82">control flow goodies what are they</span> <span data-start="208.82" data-end="212.3">exactly i was looking at npm and the</span> <span data-start="212.3" data-end="214.67">third most dependent upon module is a</span> <span data-start="214.67" data-end="218.09">sink so if you're not familiar with</span> <span data-start="218.09" data-end="221.42">async async is a utility module which</span> <span data-start="221.42" data-end="222.709">provides straightforward powerful</span> <span data-start="222.709" data-end="223.94">functions for working with a signatures</span> <span data-start="223.94" data-end="225.47">javascript so I just got that from the</span> <span data-start="225.47" data-end="228.68">readme right so other people are</span> <span data-start="228.68" data-end="230.72">experiencing callback hell as well</span> <span data-start="230.72" data-end="232.1">that's why there are so many modules</span> <span data-start="232.1" data-end="234.95">around that try to tackle asynchronous</span> <span data-start="234.95" data-end="241.19">control flow so I think I think um hell</span> <span data-start="241.19" data-end="246.53">is real callback hell is real so I mean</span> <span data-start="246.53" data-end="250.1">if you're experiencing this then this</span> <span data-start="250.1" data-end="251.72">talk will be interesting for you because</span> <span data-start="251.72" data-end="254.93">you'll have like a lot of I'm going to</span> <span data-start="254.93" data-end="256.4">try to give you like some other ideas</span> <span data-start="256.4" data-end="258.769">about control flow so one of them is</span> <span data-start="258.769" data-end="260.87">streams and I think James talks a lot</span> <span data-start="260.87" data-end="262.01">about streams but I want to give you</span> <span data-start="262.01" data-end="264.919">some other ones too taken from you know</span> <span data-start="264.919" data-end="266.87">category theory and functional reactive</span> <span data-start="266.87" data-end="271.62">programming and all that good stuff so</span> <span data-start="271.63" data-end="273.8">right so I want to start with</span> <span data-start="273.8" data-end="277.37">drag-and-drop so this is how to create a</span> <span data-start="277.37" data-end="281.36">drag-and-drop behavior just using normal</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="281.36" data-end="282.48">JavaScript with</span> <span data-start="282.48" data-end="285.03">bit of jQuery in there because it it's</span> <span data-start="285.03" data-end="288.41">it's a it's a good piece of sugar so</span> <span data-start="288.41" data-end="290.67">basically you have a function move it</span> <span data-start="290.67" data-end="292.71">takes a Down event and a mouse move</span> <span data-start="292.71" data-end="296.07">event and then it updates your the Dom</span> <span data-start="296.07" data-end="299.55">element style that should be pretty</span> <span data-start="299.55" data-end="301.56">straightforward so now in the</span> <span data-start="301.56" data-end="303.72">drag-and-drop function it takes a Dom</span> <span data-start="303.72" data-end="305.76">element it listens it waits for a mouse</span> <span data-start="305.76" data-end="309.99">down and then it um waits for a mouse</span> <span data-start="309.99" data-end="313.89">move calls move each time mousemove is</span> <span data-start="313.89" data-end="317.25">emitted and on mouse up it kills all the</span> <span data-start="317.25" data-end="321.93">other callbacks right so we can we can</span> <span data-start="321.93" data-end="327.9">actually test this out um so right here</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="327.9" data-end="330.3">I pretty much it can use is a screen</span> <span data-start="330.3" data-end="336.93">shared so can you oh I don't know how</span> <span data-start="336.93" data-end="340.11">much bigger this can go but I mean it's</span> <span data-start="340.11" data-end="343.11">exactly the same code right so if i run</span> <span data-start="343.11" data-end="345.42">that you can see you know i can drag</span> <span data-start="345.42" data-end="351">this thing so it's you just have to</span> <span data-start="351" data-end="353.37">trust me i can i can even taste it for</span> <span data-start="353.37" data-end="354.3">you but you know what I'm not going to</span> <span data-start="354.3" data-end="355.59">do that you're just gonna have to trust</span> <span data-start="355.59" data-end="357.45">me so that is exactly the same code</span> <span data-start="357.45" data-end="360.75">that's in the jsfiddle and um it it's</span> <span data-start="360.75" data-end="364.74">pretty succinct uh if you've ever tried</span> <span data-start="364.74" data-end="366.87">to program like if code drag and drop</span> <span data-start="366.87" data-end="368.49">behavior before I mean I don't know if</span> <span data-start="368.49" data-end="371.33">you can get it down smaller than that</span> <span data-start="371.33" data-end="374.13">maybe maybe we can like take off this</span> <span data-start="374.13" data-end="380.52">mouse down event actually but so if we</span> <span data-start="380.52" data-end="382.56">think of it as a faz a state machine</span> <span data-start="382.56" data-end="384.45">this is how it might look we have like</span> <span data-start="384.45" data-end="387.09">two states one is idle and the other is</span> <span data-start="387.09" data-end="391.67">dragging and you move between the states</span> <span data-start="391.67" data-end="398.34">via mouse down or Mouse up so how might</span> <span data-start="398.34" data-end="400.74">this look with async since you know</span> <span data-start="400.74" data-end="402.93">that's the module that everyone uses for</span> <span data-start="402.93" data-end="405.42">asynchronous control flow so you</span> <span data-start="405.42" data-end="409.65">represent the first state q0 with by</span> <span data-start="409.65" data-end="411.21">just waiting for a mouse down event and</span> <span data-start="411.21" data-end="416.07">then when that gets called it</span> <span data-start="416.07" data-end="418.02">moves to the second state Q 1 which</span> <span data-start="418.02" data-end="419.85">waits for a must move event so this</span> <span data-start="419.85" data-end="421.68">should be pretty straightforward so</span> <span data-start="421.68" data-end="423.48">what's happened here is like instead of</span> <span data-start="423.48" data-end="427.59">having everything together like in the</span> <span data-start="427.59" data-end="431.64">same drag and drop in the same drag and</span> <span data-start="431.64" data-end="433.8">drop body function function body I've</span> <span data-start="433.8" data-end="436.29">basically just separated it out into two</span> <span data-start="436.29" data-end="440.27">states one is one is idle and one is</span> <span data-start="440.27" data-end="446.07">dragging so this is how it would look</span> <span data-start="446.07" data-end="452.1">when composed together so the big thing</span> <span data-start="452.1" data-end="453.57">about this is what you're doing is</span> <span data-start="453.57" data-end="455.43">you're you're you don't have that</span> <span data-start="455.43" data-end="459.96">nesting that happens with with the</span> <span data-start="459.96" data-end="462.45">normal call back in like nesting</span> <span data-start="462.45" data-end="465.93">callbacks but what you do lose is maybe</span> <span data-start="465.93" data-end="470.7">like how if we didn't have a sink we</span> <span data-start="470.7" data-end="472.02">might have to compose them in a</span> <span data-start="472.02" data-end="474">different way that hides the execution</span> <span data-start="474" data-end="477.27">flow of each of the callback handlers</span> <span data-start="477.27" data-end="479.94">but async sort of allows us to grab them</span> <span data-start="479.94" data-end="481.62">together and sort of describe them in</span> <span data-start="481.62" data-end="483.63">one place drag and drop is a waterfall</span> <span data-start="483.63" data-end="487.8">of q0 and q1 mouse down and drag</span> <span data-start="487.8" data-end="492.5">everyone's like going but you get it</span> <span data-start="492.5" data-end="497.37">it's so awesome right okay so if we look</span> <span data-start="497.37" data-end="499.53">at both of the code site like both of</span> <span data-start="499.53" data-end="502.23">these pieces of code side by side you</span> <span data-start="502.23" data-end="504.03">can see that the vanilla JavaScript is</span> <span data-start="504.03" data-end="506.46">pretty I mean it's pretty readable async</span> <span data-start="506.46" data-end="509.49">sort of clutters it up a bit um but we</span> <span data-start="509.49" data-end="511.65">are allowed to separate the state's q0</span> <span data-start="511.65" data-end="516.15">and q1 which sort of it lets us do other</span> <span data-start="516.15" data-end="518.34">things with them for example if we</span> <span data-start="518.34" data-end="520.5">wanted to reuse q0 for something else</span> <span data-start="520.5" data-end="522.81">like a mouse down something else is</span> <span data-start="522.81" data-end="524.52">waiting for mass now we can we can use</span> <span data-start="524.52" data-end="530.85">that so it's modular however it does</span> <span data-start="530.85" data-end="534.2">sort of like make the code a little bit</span> <span data-start="534.2" data-end="537.12">it's it's sort of fatter right now the</span> <span data-start="537.12" data-end="543.27">async code so Michael said javascript is</span> <span data-start="543.27" data-end="545.97">done like in LX yes I mean paraphrase I</span> <span data-start="545.97" data-end="547.38">wasn't actually there but Brian McKenna</span> <span data-start="547.38" data-end="548.91">tweeted something like this language is</span> <span data-start="548.91" data-end="549.84">done</span> <span data-start="549.84" data-end="551.82">the script is it and you know what maybe</span> <span data-start="551.82" data-end="556.05">that's true because I mean there are I</span> <span data-start="556.05" data-end="557.76">mean if we just wanted to do drag and</span> <span data-start="557.76" data-end="559.86">drop why would we why would we have this</span> <span data-start="559.86" data-end="562.8">a sink module that that clutters up our</span> <span data-start="562.8" data-end="564.75">code allows us to separate the states it</span> <span data-start="564.75" data-end="566.07">makes it more modular but what if we</span> <span data-start="566.07" data-end="569.28">don't ever want to use Q 0 or q1 just</span> <span data-start="569.28" data-end="572.28">independently it sort of doesn't need to</span> <span data-start="572.28" data-end="575.58">be done so I do it right so this is sort</span> <span data-start="575.58" data-end="578.87">of like the important point of this talk</span> <span data-start="578.87" data-end="581.13">so michael says you know there's a point</span> <span data-start="581.13" data-end="582.96">where something is good enough and we</span> <span data-start="582.96" data-end="585.42">move on to more important higher-order</span> <span data-start="585.42"

<span data-start="778.32" data-end="780.75">now we're looking at we're looking at it</span> <span data-start="780.75" data-end="783.45">as a stream and I don't really know how</span> <span data-start="783.45" data-end="785.91">to assess this it's just kind of cool</span> <span data-start="785.91" data-end="790.65">it's a stream we can even stream fi the</span> <span data-start="790.65" data-end="795.3">move function and pipe mouse mouse</span> <span data-start="795.3" data-end="797.4">events into the move function so that</span> <span data-start="797.4" data-end="799.38">every time it admits something you know</span> <span data-start="799.38" data-end="802.14">it just moves so that's kind of neat you</span> <span data-start="802.14" data-end="805.079">know like thinking of some

<span data-start="813.51" data-end="816.85">really do that streams</span> <span data-start="816.85" data-end="819.56">so the thing with streams it's a little</span> <span data-start="819.56" data-end="824.41">weird you can call our RS emit data and</span> <span data-start="824.41" data-end="827.269">you can pass it any number of arguments</span> <span data-start="827.269" data-end="830.24">but somewhere in the stream code and I</span> <span data-start="830.24" data-end="833.509">mean I could show you this just you know</span> <span data-start="833.509" data-end="835.1">what it's not it's not important but</span> <span data-start="835.1" data-end="836.569">somewhere in the stream code it only</span> <span data-start="836.569" data-end="838.91">passes like one argument I hope someone</span> <span data-start="838.91" data-end="840.41">fixes that so right now have to like</span> <span data-start="840.41" data-end="842.75">wrap it just in like a parrot uppal and</span> <span data-start="842.75" data-end="845.63">and then i can i still have to change</span> <span data-start="845.63" data-end="849.529">the move function here so what's what</span> <span data-start="849.529" data-end="850.94">would be handy if i didn't have to</span> <span data-start="850.94" data-end="852.319">change a move function is that i could</span> <span data-start="852.319" data-end="854.24">just you know use the same function with</span> <span data-start="854.24" data-end="856.85">any kind of control flow construct</span> <span data-start="856.85" data-end="858.649">whether it was a waterfall whether it</span> <span data-start="858.649" data-end="860.269">was jquery whether it was a stream i</span> <span data-start="860.269" data-end="863.36">could just use move with d like down</span> <span data-start="863.36" data-end="865.31">event and mouse move event but you know</span> <span data-start="865.31" data-end="869.3">until that changes um so what we have</span> <span data-start="869.3" data-end="870.86">here is we can see the stream as a pipe</span> <span data-start="870.86" data-end="875.029">between two processes one is a something</span> <span data-start="875.029" data-end="876.35">that emits and the other is something</span> <span data-start="876.35" data-end="879.41">that receives and I drew boxes around</span> <span data-start="879.41" data-end="882.319">them because so basically the the state</span> <span data-start="882.319" data-end="888.04">machine here it's separated right and</span> <span data-start="888.04" data-end="892.459">what streams allows us to do is it</span> <span data-start="892.459" data-end="894.769">allows us to use anything that is</span> <span data-start="894.769" data-end="898.579">readable and smoosh it together with</span> <span data-start="898.579" data-end="900.8">anything that is writable and we don't</span> <span data-start="900.8" data-end="902.44">need to think about what's actually</span> <span data-start="902.44" data-end="906.38">friggin inside the boxes and that's</span> <span data-start="906.38" data-end="909.29">something that's really cool you know</span> <span data-start="909.29" data-end="911.6">because it's very so I I don't remember</span> <span data-start="911.6" data-end="914.12">who talked it was but someone was</span> <span data-start="914.12" data-end="915.92">talking about how when you have a really</span> <span data-start="915.92" data-end="917.6">heavy framework like a plug-in system</span> <span data-start="917.6" data-end="919.61">everything has to follow this same</span> <span data-start="919.61" data-end="922.6">everything has to like identify like</span> <span data-start="922.6" data-end="924.829">identify itself as a plug-in and</span> <span data-start="924.829" data-end="926.81">sometimes it can the interface can be</span> <span data-start="926.81" data-end="928.67">really heavy weight but streams</span> <span data-start="928.67" data-end="931.25">interface is really quite simple so a</span> <span data-start="931.25" data-end="934.67">lot of things can be streams and as you</span> <span data-start="934.67" data-end="936.8">can see like to make something into a</span> <span data-start="936.8" data-end="939.199">stream it's not a it's not it's not</span> <span data-start="939.199" data-end="940.67">super heavyweight you know you just</span> <span data-start="940.67" data-end="943.029">create a just instantiate a stream</span> <span data-start="943.029" data-end="945.5">declare it like it set it to be writable</span> <span data-start="945.5" data-end="947.3">readable and then just start emitting</span> <span data-start="947.3" data-end="949.48">things</span> <span data-start="949.48" data-end="952.199">so the interface is really simple</span> <span data-start="952.199" data-end="954.699">streams what do we get for free we</span> <span data-start="954.699" data-end="957.19">really get this pipe for free so if we</span> <span data-start="957.19" data-end="961.029">if we stream if I whatever components</span> <span data-start="961.029" data-end="963.22">we're using an hour control flow we get</span> <span data-start="963.22" data-end="965.68">the pipe for free and this is really</span> <span data-start="965.68" data-end="969.07">important because pipes are kind of</span> <span data-start="969.07" data-end="972.209">their kind of like a composition a</span> <span data-start="972.209" data-end="974.589">operator right so it allows you to</span> <span data-start="974.589" data-end="978.699">compose two streams together into one</span> <span data-start="978.699" data-end="981.519">and and the result of that is itself a</span> <span data-start="981.519" data-end="983.62">stream and then you can use that in</span> <span data-start="983.62" data-end="987.91">other streams and so the whole lure of</span> <span data-start="987.91" data-end="991.51">streams and pipes and compositions is</span> <span data-start="991.51" data-end="994.6">that you get like this really you get to</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="994.6" data-end="997.209">I switch the slide too early this has</span> <span data-start="997.209" data-end="998.29">nothing to do either one talking about</span> <span data-start="998.29" data-end="1002.54">right now but but hey it's a burrito so</span> <span data-start="1002.54" data-end="1006.87">what you get is like what I like to</span> <span data-start="1006.87" data-end="1010.26">think of a piece of code is as is</span> <span data-start="1010.26" data-end="1013.139">basically a composition of just</span> <span data-start="1013.139" data-end="1016.62">different bits smooshed together right</span> <span data-start="1016.62" data-end="1019.529">so everything can exist independently</span> <span data-start="1019.529" data-end="1021.54">like a function or an object or whatever</span> <span data-start="1021.54" data-end="1023.94">and depending on how it's composed</span> <span data-start="1023.94" data-end="1027.689">together is what makes a program</span> <span data-start="1027.689" data-end="1030.54">different so pipe is a sequential it</span> <span data-start="1030.54" data-end="1033.12">basically sequences things you you have</span> <span data-start="1033.12" data-end="1036.36">the first thing sequenced with the</span> <span data-start="1036.36" data-end="1038.85">second thing a pipes to be that means</span> <span data-start="1038.85" data-end="1040.709">something has to go through a to get to</span> <span data-start="1040.709" data-end="1045.27">be um and that's just a really simple</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1045.27" data-end="1047.4">Combinator the pipe is a sequencing</span> <span data-start="1047.4" data-end="1051.51">Combinator there are so many other ones</span> <span

data-start="1057.57" data-end="1060.72">you have this thing called em right and</span> <span data-start="1060.72" data-end="1063.929">it has just two things right so a stream</span> <span data-start="1063.929" data-end="1066.96">it has a what's a stream it just it's it</span> <span data-start="1066.96" data-end="1071.22">emits something or you have a right</span> <span data-start="1071.22" data-end="1073.44">function so that it can receive</span> <span data-start="1073.44" data-end="1075.84">something right so that that's the</span> <span data-start="1075.84" data-end="1078.51">interface of a stream so the interface</span> <span data-start="1078.51" data-end="1080.97">of this particular construct that I'm</span> <span data-start="1080.97" data-end="1082.36">showing you now M</span> <span data-start="1082.36" data-end="1087.22">a you have to you have two functions so</span> <span data-start="1087.22" data-end="1089.2">you have it then which is also a</span> <span data-start="1089.2" data-end="1090.85">sequencing Combinator and then you have</span> <span data-start="1090.85" data-end="1093.76">a unit so what then does it's something</span> <span data-start="1093.76" data-end="1095.8">very similar to what the pipe does it</span> <span data-start="1095.8" data-end="1100.75">takes one kind of this ma takes another</span> <span data-start="1100.75" data-end="1104.29">mb is just smushes them together this</span> <span data-start="1104.29" data-end="1109.15">unit function takes some raw value and</span> <span data-start="1109.15" data-end="1111.6">then it puts it into the context of em</span> <span data-start="1111.6" data-end="1114.43">so if you think of this as a stream</span> <span data-start="1114.43" data-end="1118.06">actually is that no let's start with a</span> <span data-start="1118.06" data-end="1119.71">list because everyone's familiar with</span> <span data-start="1119.71" data-end="1125.55">lists right so a list is of a type ma</span> <span data-start="1125.55" data-end="1129.85">the then function you can basically it</span> <span data-start="1129.85" data-end="1136.51">takes it takes a function and then it it</span> <span data-start="1136.51" data-end="1138.34">basically like runs this function on</span> <span data-start="1138.34" data-end="1143.59">each of its you know what I'm have you</span> <span data-start="1143.59" data-end="1145.51">ever like written some code and come</span> <span data-start="1145.51" data-end="1148.09">back to it and not understood what the</span> <span data-start="1148.09" data-end="1149.62">it man this is what I'm</span> <span data-start="1149.62" data-end="1152.68">it man this is what I'm experiencing now but it totally works I</span> <span data-start="1152.68" data-end="1156.28">promise you just get so let's look at</span> <span data-start="1156.28" data-end="1159.07">unit because unit is pretty it's pretty</span> <span data-start="1159.07" data-end="1160.93">simple it's much more simple than the</span> <span data-start="1160.93" data-end="1163.99">then Combinator for list but basically</span> <span data-start="1163.99" data-end="1165.94">you pass it in X so it could be a number</span> <span data-start="1165.94" data-end="1168.19">it could be like one it could be a could</span> <span data-start="1168.19" data-end="1170.32">be a string and then it just puts it</span> <span data-start="1170.32" data-end="1173.62">inside of a list the context em right so</span> <span data-start="1173.62" data-end="1177.7">remember unit takes a raw value and it</span> <span data-start="1177.7" data-end="1179.68">puts it inside of a context and that's</span> <span data-start="1179.68" data-end="1182.71">exactly what this is for the list the</span> <span data-start="1182.71" data-end="1184.21">then function I think what it does is it</span> <span data-start="1184.21" data-end="1185.68">takes many lists and like if you take</span> <span data-start="1185.68" data-end="1187.69">two lists and then you put them together</span> <span data-start="1187.69" data-end="1189.82">basically like concatenates the whole</span> <span data-start="1189.82" data-end="1191.98">thing plus there's a mapping function so</span> <span data-start="1191.98" data-end="1195.25">that's what it's doing there the idea of</span> <span data-start="1195.25" data-end="1198.07">a continuation so this is like an</span> <span
