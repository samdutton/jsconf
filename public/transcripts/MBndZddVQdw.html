<p><span data-start="8.37" data-end="13.75"Audience member: Hello, everyone, welcome to my awesome talk.</span> <span data-start="13.75" data-end="16.61">My name is Ashley Williams.</span> <span data-start="16.61" data-end="26.72">You may know me as AB.Dubs from the internet, I'm sorry!</span> <span data-start="26.72" data-end="28.009">What is this talk about?</span> <span data-start="28.009" data-end="30.029">This talk is about a couple of things.</span> <span data-start="30.029" data-end="32.18">The first thing is it about is performance.</span> <span data-start="32.18" data-end="37.9">More importantly, performance that makes things more accessible, and, unlike a lot of the</span> <span data-start="37.9" data-end="43.239">talks that we've seen at this conference, this talk is also about infrastructure.</span> <span data-start="43.239" data-end="46.579">Can I get a shout out from any of the ops people in the room?</span> <span data-start="46.579" data-end="47.579">Come on!</span> <span data-start="47.579" data-end="49.57">Who is on pager duty right now!</span> <span data-start="49.57" data-end="51.7">Someone, I'm so sorry.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="51.7" data-end="55.249">That sucks!</span> <span data-start="55.249" data-end="61.05">I want this talk to be a little bit about how the internet works, and potentially, how</span> <span data-start="61.05" data-end="63.66">the internet could work.</span> <span data-start="63.66" data-end="68.6">And so this talk is called "JavaScript's journey to the edge" and so there's a little bit of</span> <span data-start="68.6" data-end="69.77">journeying.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="69.77" data-end="74.09">Perhaps you're more familiar with these journeys if you're from the United States, but I just</span> <span data-start="74.09" data-end="81.55">wanted to say a small thing, as this is JSConf about how important this conference has been</span> <span data-start="81.55" data-end="82.55">to me.</span> <span data-start="82.55" data-end="91.28">I spoke at the last Reject JS in 2015, and I was the second-to-last reject only to Marika</span> <span data-start="91.28" data-end="94.43">who was the last reject.</span> <span data-start="94.43" data-end="96.42">It was one of the most amazing conferences.</span> <span data-start="96.42" data-end="102.74">The next day I went to JSConf EU and saw someone wearing a shirt with my face on it which was</span> <span data-start="102.74" data-end="105.49">a fascinating surprise.</span> <span data-start="105.49" data-end="110.37">This was from a musical number they had done using quotes from a previous talks of mine,</span> <span data-start="110.37" data-end="116.81">and they did that again in 2017, or 2016, with the classic "people got mad" which was</span> <span data-start="116.81" data-end="121.72">an auto tune of my voice talking about how people get mad if you put all of your code</span> <span data-start="121.72" data-end="123.05">in one file!</span> <span data-start="123.05" data-end="127">They do get mad!</span> <span data-start="127" data-end="131.51">But then I spoke at JSConf EU in 2017 and I wore an Antifa shirt.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="131.51" data-end="136.46">It was a super fun talk.</span> <span data-start="136.46" data-end="139.209">Man, I have so many friends at this conference.</span> <span data-start="139.209" data-end="145.06">The last time I was here was last year where I did an impromptu Rust and WebAssembly workshop</span> <span data-start="145.06" data-end="154.15">for 100 people from the Mozilla booth, and it's cool.</span> <span data-start="154.15" data-end="156.959">This conference is super awesome, so can we give it a round of applause?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="156.959" data-end="164.049">I love this place.</span> <span data-start="164.049" data-end="168.989">But this talk is obviously not about my journey, this talk is about JavaScript's journey, so</span> <span data-start="168.989" data-end="173.799">I'm about to show you some very scientific timelines that I made using Wikipedia and</span> <span data-start="173.799" data-end="176.389">Keynote.</span> <span data-start="176.389" data-end="183.12">JavaScript has had a fascinating history, and people talk about history, about this</span> <span data-start="183.12" data-end="188.47">one being the tenth one, and Node being announced in 2009.</span> <span data-start="188.47" data-end="197.11">We've seen a lot of development from JavaScript, and we've seen it develop really, really quickly,</span> <span data-start="197.11" data-end="200.989">and I think it's kind of developed in one particular way, so here we see the first website</span> <span data-start="200.989" data-end="206.069">in 1991, and then we end with Wasm up in 2017.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="206.069" data-end="209.15">Wasm was only born in 2017?</span> <span data-start="209.15" data-end="210.15">Amazing.</span> <span data-start="210.15" data-end="216.629">But, we saw the appearance of a fair number of things, including a lot of browser engines,</span> <span data-start="216.629" data-end="217.959">and a lot of frameworks.</span> <span data-start="217.959" data-end="222.92">And I think one of the most pivotal things in this timeline that people don't usually</span> <span data-start="222.92" data-end="229.68">see is the emergence much Google Maps in 2004 really motivated people to see what you could</span> <span data-start="229.68" data-end="235.73">do inside of a website, and made it so that we started developing all of these things</span> <span data-start="235.73" data-end="239.65">that you could do browser computations so much faster.</span> <span data-start="239.65" data-end="242.669">So if we put these graphs together and take a look at this, what is happening is that</span> <span data-start="242.669" data-end="248.279">the speed of computation in the browser is just exponentially growing, and that is so</span> <span data-start="248.279" data-end="253.17">awesome, and I'm a big WebAssembly fan, I'm super here for this.</span> <span data-start="253.17" data-end="259.12">However, because the browser has become such a computationally awesome agent, we've run</span> <span data-start="259.12" data-end="261.63">into some costs.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="261.63" data-end="264.44">How much does doing this cost?</span> <span data-start="264.44" data-end="268.36">And fundamentally, this comes back to the idea of accessibility, and it's spelled wrong</span> <span data-start="268.36" data-end="271.889">here, but it really comes down to the fact that what we are talking about is the ability</span> <span data-start="271.889" data-end="276.17">for people even to access content.</span> <span data-start="276.17" data-end="284.53">Mani in his talk the Cost of JavaScript in 2018 said the web is bloated by user experience.</span> <span data-start="284.53" data-end="286.84">And he's genuinely completely right.</span> <span data-start="286.84" data-end="290.4">So how many people here have ever checked out HTTP Archive?</span> <span data-start="290.4" data-end="293.75">If you haven't, it's amazing, and you could loan at these numbers.</span> <span data-start="293.75" data-end="295.6">This is just one of the graphs.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="295.6" data-end="302.58">What this graph is showing is the median size of desktop and mobile applications with the</span> <span data-start="302.58" data-end="308.861">JavaScript bytes that are being downloaded to the device, and we have seen a 353 per</span> <span data-start="308.861" data-end="316.68">cent increase for desktop, and it's worse for mobile — 577 per cent growth in how much</span> <span data-start="316.68" data-end="318.18">here sending to the browser.</span> <span data-start="318.18" data-end="323.99">It's cool because the browser can take that stuff and use it really fast.</span> <span data-start="323.99" data-end="328.569">Moving those bytes over the wire takes a lot of time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="328.569" data-end="333.33">So, on average, remember, this is on average, there are people who are on the really bad</span> <span data-start="333.33" data-end="339.25">end of this, mobile loading time for an average website takes nine seconds.</span> <span data-start="339.25" data-end="342.21">All right?</span> <span data-start="342.21" data-end="344.5">That's unacceptable.</span> <span data-start="344.5" data-end="349.18">So this is going to be part of the problem we are going to solve in my talk today.</span> <span data-start="349.18" data-end="355.569">So, my intro did not entirely say this but I'm a systems engineer for a big orange cloud,</span> <span data-start="355.569" data-end="360.75">not to be confused with a big orange website which I'm not a fan of, or SoundCloud which</span> <span data-start="360.75" data-end="362.81">has a surprisingly spectacular logo.</span> <span data-start="362.81" data-end="368.319">I work for Cloudflare, I know it doesn't look super big here.</span> <span data-start="368.319" data-end="371.47">What does it do?</span> <span data-start="371.47" data-end="374.07">Cloudflare is an infrastructure company.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="374.07" data-end="378.34">Cloudflare is not super good at actually defining what it does, but the thing you definitely</span> <span data-start="378.34" data-end="383.49">don't call it is a DNS company, because also, I mean, no-one likes DNS.</span> <span data-start="383.49" data-end="384.67">I can't figure that out.</span> <span data-start="384.67" data-end="387.939">I work at a DNS now.</span> <span data-start="387.939" data-end="393.319">But we call ourselves an infrastructure company, and sometimes, I describe Cloudflare as a</span> <span data-start="393.319" data-end="400.52">hardware company, and that is because our primary asset is this, and this is a map of</span> <span data-start="400.52" data-end="406.46">180 data centres and growing all over the world.</span> <span data-start="406.46" data-end="413.22">And so, this set of data centres contains something which is called "the Edge", and</span> <span data-start="413.22" data-end="414.31">this is a terrible name.</span> <span data-start="414.31" data-end="416.819">It doesn't make any sense to most people.</span> <span data-start="416.819" data-end="418.3">Someone said there's a wrestler called the Edge.</span> <span data-start="418.3" data-end="419.669">I don't know who that is, whatever.</span> <span data-start="419.669" data-end="426.28">To talk to you about what the Edge is, we will talk about the classic dichotomies in</span> <span data-start="426.28" data-end="429.15">web programming: client and server.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="429.15" data-end="432.05">To do so, let's talk about pizza.</span> <span data-start="432.05" data-end="433.27">Who likes pizza?</span> <span data-start="433.27" data-end="435.49">All right, there we go!</span> <span data-start="435.49" data-end="438.52">I'm originally from New York, so pizza is cool, right?</span> <span data-start="438.52" data-end="442.569">We are going to talk about pizza delivery, and I want you to view that in the eyes of</span> <span data-start="442.569" data-end="447.16">pizza accessibility, because it would be terrible to deny people pizza, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="447.16" data-end="449.199">Especially, warm, fresh pizza.</span> <span data-start="449.199" data-end="453.789">So obviously, you guys smoosh them together for pizza accessibility, all one word.</span> <span data-start="453.789" data-end="459.61">Here is animation mere HP your JavaScript programmer will be represented by this lovely</span> <span data-start="459.61" data-end="461.86">chef.</span> <span data-start="461.86" data-end="466.449">The JavaScript's generated output is a pizza.</span> <span data-start="466.449" data-end="472.259">Your end using is a super hero because this is how we should think about our users, and</span> <span data-start="472.259" data-end="475.74">we are going to have this interesting thing that is a basket, and so there you can think</span> <span data-start="475.74" data-end="479.77">of that as a data centre, a point of presence, or a cache node.</span> <span data-start="479.77" data-end="482.52">Let's take a look at what client-side rendering looks like.</span> <span data-start="482.52" data-end="487.86">With client-side rendering, what we do is we have our chef in New York, and we have</span> <span data-start="487.86" data-end="490.59">our person who wants to eat pizza in Australia.</span> <span data-start="490.59" data-end="496.699">When we render on the client, we send the chef to Australia.</span> <span data-start="496.699" data-end="497.9">That's a lot, right?</span> <span data-start="497.9" data-end="501.8">And then, what the chef has to do is then the chef has to cook.</span> <span data-start="501.8" data-end="505.57">And then, at that point, you have delivered your pizza in Australia.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="505.57" data-end="508.62">But that's a little concerning, right?</span> <span data-start="508.62" data-end="514.159">Like, maybe the person in Australia doesn't have like a whole room with an oven for a</span> <span data-start="514.159" data-end="516.28"><to move in and start cooking.</span> <span data-start="516.28" data-end="520.26">Like maybe they have a flip phone that literally can't do that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="520.26" data-end="523.3">This is a little bit after complicated situation.</span> <span data-start="523.3" data-end="525.69">So, of course be what do we do?</span> <span data-start="525.69" data-end="526.69">Let's throw a cache on it.</span> <span data-start="526.69" data-end="528.85">That should make it better, right?</span> <span data-start="528.85" data-end="535.82">Instead, with our cache, we send our chef to a basket, you know, and the Pacific Ocean,</span> <span data-start="535.82" data-end="537.38">South Pacific.</span> <span data-start="537.38" data-end="544.38">We send the whole chef and then we still have to send the whole chef to Australia where</span> <span data-start="544.38" data-end="546.38">they cook and they make their pizza.</span> <span data-start="546.38" data-end="550.35">Again, we still have this situation, even with the cache, where the chef is travelling</span> <span data-start="550.35" data-end="554.82">for maybe a closer location, but these still have to go into that person's house and make</span> <span data-start="554.82" data-end="555.82">that pizza.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="555.82" data-end="557.94">That's pretty invasive be think.</span> <span data-start="557.94" data-end="559.36">All right?</span> <span data-start="559.36" data-end="563">So we can keep sending those chefs, but, yes.</span> <span data-start="563" data-end="564.82">Again, we have another option, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="564.82" data-end="569.63">We have server-side rendering, and of course as everyone said, ten years ago at JSConf</span> <span data-start="569.63" data-end="577.97">you, Ryan Dahl announced node.js and it was cool because it promised to unify web development</span> <span data-start="577.97" data-end="579.53">on the client side and the server.</span> <span data-start="579.53" data-end="581.76">It's like why do it in two languages?</span> <span data-start="581.76" data-end="583.71">Let's do it in one.</span> <span data-start="583.71" data-end="587.85">That made the server accessible to JavaScript developers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="587.85" data-end="592.87">Maybe not for the first time, but for the first time for fin who didn't want to learn</span> <span data-start="592.87" data-end="594.13">a new language.</span> <span data-start="594.13" data-end="598.03">So let's take a look at what server-side rendering looks like.</span> <span data-start="598.03" data-end="601.8">We got our chef in New York and our super hero in Australia.</span> <span data-start="601.8" data-end="603.12">They're going to cook in New York.</span> <span data-start="603.12" data-end="605.68">No more moving into the house to make pizza.</span> <span data-start="605.68" data-end="607.12">They're going to send that right on over.</span> <span data-start="607.12" data-end="610.66">Not bad, but that's a pretty long trip for some pizza, right?</span> <span data-start="610.66" data-end="612.26">I'm not sure that's going to hold up.</span> <span data-start="612.26" data-end="614.97">Fresh pizza's very important, right?</span> <span data-start="614.97" data-end="618.139">So maybe that's not the freshest of pizzas.</span> <span data-start="618.139" data-end="619.56">Let's throw a cache on it, right?</span> <span data-start="619.56" data-end="621.38">Cool, we will throw a cache on it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="621.38" data-end="622.449">So cool.</span> <span data-start="622.449" data-end="627.5">The chef can still make their pizza in New York, and now they can just send it on over</span> <span data-start="627.5" data-end="633.2">to that cache and the pizza can hang out there, and then our Australia person can happily</span> <span data-start="633.2" data-end="636.61">eat all the pizza they would like.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="636.61" data-end="639.08">But that pizza maybe, it's a little old.</span> <span data-start="639.08" data-end="640.08">I don't know.</span> <span data-start="640.08" data-end="641.81">What if they wanted an extra topping on something?</span> <span data-start="641.81" data-end="645.19">They would have to go all the way back, and that's really not efficient.</span> <span data-start="645.19" data-end="650.22">So, when we talk about the client and server, and we've heard other people talk about this</span> <span data-start="650.22" data-end="655.42">at this conference already, is that we are seeing frameworks realise they have to negotiate</span> <span data-start="655.42" data-end="657.3">this boundary better.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="657.3" data-end="662.31">But that's really only just starting, and we are still genuinely talking about these</span> <span data-start="662.31" data-end="668.209">trade-offs between the client and the server, and they're tricky trade-offs.</span> <span data-start="668.209" data-end="672.67">Now, it wouldn't be an Ashley Williams talk if, when I said "trade doc" I didn't immediately</span> <span data-start="672.67" data-end="676.149">start talking about dialectics.</span> <span data-start="676.149" data-end="683.88">Who here knows what a dialectics is?</span> <span data-start="683.88" data-end="684.88">Dia what?</span> <span data-start="684.88" data-end="686.56">It is super foreign.</span> <span data-start="686.56" data-end="692.78">There's an idea of formal logic where you say A equals A. This is a thing, and then</span> <span data-start="692.78" data-end="695.24">that thing is always equal to this thing.</span> <span data-start="695.24" data-end="696.5">We use this a lot in science.</span> <span data-start="696.5" data-end="703.41">We say when we reach a contradiction, maybe where A doesn't equal A, we are wrong, right?</span> <span data-start="703.41" data-end="709.32">A does not equal A. However, I think that this is completely backwards.</span> <span data-start="709.32" data-end="717.3">In fact, the dialectical method, in contrast of formal logic, challenges to contradictions.</span> </p>
