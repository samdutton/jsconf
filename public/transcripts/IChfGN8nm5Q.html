the SVG it's a little bit nicer so</span> <span data-start="278.669" data-end="281.13">let's talk about exporting SVG's from</span> <span data-start="281.13" data-end="284.55">sketch so within sketch we have this</span> <span data-start="284.55" data-end="287.25">infinite canvas and so what happens is</span> <span data-start="287.25" data-end="289.5">the SVG element itself will have</span> <span

data-end="299.37">that reason doing really advanced</span> <span data-start="299.37" data-end="301.169">effects can be difficult because you</span> <span data-start="301.169" data-end="302.639">also

<span data-start="310.71" data-end="313.8">that generally is not very helpful and</span> <span data-start="313.8" data-end="315.27">so what you want to be doing is actually</span> <span

data-end="1495.51">one of the other ones that I really like</span> <span data-start="1495.51" data-end="1497.94">and so this is that same point light</span> <span data-start="1497.94" data-end="1500.34">you're applying but now I'm applying an</span> <span data-start="1500.34" data-end="1503.31">actual animate element to it and taking</span> <span data-start="1503.31" data-end="1505.08">and moving the light across the plane</span> <span data-start="1505.08" data-end="1509.04">the X plane back and forth across the</span> <span data-start="1509.04" data-end="1510.57">page and so one of the things that</span> <span data-start="1510.57" data-end="1512.97">you'll see within here is on the right</span> <span data-start="1512.97" data-end="1516.18">hand side the light actually goes off of</span> <span data-start="1516.18" data-end="1519">the canvas itself so you're applying a</span> <span data-start="1519" data-end="1521.61">negative value to that whereas you want</span> <span data-start="1521.61" data-end="1523.14">to be starting if you want to be</span> <span data-start="1523.14" data-end="1525.06">starting right at zero you'll see that</span> <span data-start="1525.06" data-end="1533.21">it hits the limits of the actual box and</span> <span data-start="1533.21" data-end="1535.74">so within here I've defined the filter</span> <span data-start="1535.74" data-end="1540.9">of the spot light moving I will open</span> <span data-start="1540.9" data-end="1548.01">this hopefully it works okay super so</span> <span data-start="1548.01" data-end="1549.63">again we're taking in applying the</span> <span data-start="1549.63" data-end="1554.31">effect we're giving it an ID now what's</span> <span data-start="1554.31" data-end="1557.04">happening in here is we were applying a</span> <span data-start="1557.04" data-end="1560.4">blur effect to the to the original</span> <span data-start="1560.4" data-end="1562.05">source graphic itself we're calling that</span> <span data-start="1562.05" data-end="1564.3">result by applying a standard deviation</span> <span data-start="1564.3" data-end="1567.87">of to blur one from there we are taking</span> <span data-start="1567.87" data-end="1570.21">and that end results and we're putting</span> <span data-start="1570.21" data-end="1574.35">it into the next filter that we want to</span> <span data-start="1574.35" data-end="1575.85">be creating and we're calling the</span> <span data-start="1575.85" data-end="1576.419">results of</span> <span data-start="1576.419" data-end="1581.19">that SPECT 1 from there I'm taking and</span> <span data-start="1581.19" data-end="1583.2">adding a special specular exponent so</span> <span data-start="1583.2" data-end="1585.059">remember in that first example that we</span> <span data-start="1585.059" data-end="1586.919">had with the light where we had a really</span> <span data-start="1586.919" data-end="1589.259">high or really low value of the light</span> <span data-start="1589.259" data-end="1592.83">and so within this particular SVG the</span> <span data-start="1592.83" data-end="1595.82">light source is actually really narrow</span> <span data-start="1595.82" data-end="1598.85">and I'm applying a lighting color of</span> <span data-start="1598.85" data-end="1605.369">just off-white okay um I'll wrap it up</span> <span data-start="1605.369" data-end="1608.46">real quick then from there I'm taking</span> <span data-start="1608.46" data-end="1610.71">and defining where within this cube I</span> <span data-start="1610.71" data-end="1612.96">actually want this light source to be</span> <span data-start="1612.96" data-end="1617.22">living okay from there I want to animate</span> <span data-start="1617.22" data-end="1619.08">the point light itself so I want it to</span> <span data-start="1619.08" data-end="1624.09">be going across the X plane then from</span> <span data-start="1624.09" data-end="1626.419">all of that I'm gonna take and merge</span> <span data-start="1626.419" data-end="1630.779">everything together into one SVG and so</span> <span data-start="1630.779" data-end="1634.32">this particular effect it takes the</span> <span data-start="1634.32" data-end="1636.45">original source graphic and it takes the</span> <span data-start="1636.45" data-end="1638.759">results of the other three effects that</span> <span data-start="1638.759" data-end="1640.44">we had applied and it merges it all into</span> <span data-start="1640.44" data-end="1645.19">one does that make sense</span> <span data-start="1645.2" data-end="1650.609">super okay so let's talk about browser</span> <span data-start="1650.609"
