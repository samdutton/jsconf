<p><span data-start="1.64" data-end="27.13">Okay. So, suppose that you are reading hackernews.</span> <span data-start="27.13" data-end="35.38">On monday you see someone post D3 based reusable chart library.</span> <span data-start="35.38" data-end="40.98">And on Wednesday, Chartist.</span> <span data-start="40.98" data-end="51.39">That is strange. On Sunday, somebody posts Dimple.Js. Easy and flexible D3 charter.</span> <span data-start="51.39" data-end="53.3">What?!</span> <span data-start="53.3" data-end="60.129">You google it. Okay. There is a Wikipedia comparing 30 javascript charters.</span> <span data-start="60.129" data-end="65.1">And a blog post comparing 50.</span> <span data-start="65.1" data-end="71.03">The blogpost is 2 years old. What?!</span> <span data-start="71.03" data-end="76.75">There might be one explanation for it. Maybe all of these libraries are doing different</span> <span data-start="76.75" data-end="77.75">things.</span> <span data-start="77.75" data-end="81.2">We are not making the same charts over and over again.</span> <span data-start="81.2" data-end="88.74">Look at the websites. And thinking feeling sets in. When you think, you are all doing</span> <span data-start="88.74" data-end="91.02">the same thing. What?!</span> <span data-start="91.02" data-end="96.009">Do we really like reinventing the piechart?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="96.009" data-end="105.369">So, if we are going to get to the bottom, we need to look at o a library D3. Most are</span> <span data-start="105.369" data-end="110.009">based on D3. Most of the visualisations.</span> <span data-start="110.009" data-end="112.86">Interestingly enough there is only 1 D3.</span> <span data-start="112.86" data-end="120.21">Not 100 different versions. Something different is happening here.</span> <span data-start="120.21" data-end="125.07">This timer is not working. Wave when I have 3 minutes.</span> <span data-start="125.07" data-end="132.56">It turns D3 has a lot of examples. Here is a scatterplot. A line chart. Bar chart. Area</span> <span data-start="132.56" data-end="133.56">chart.</span> <span data-start="133.56" data-end="139.459">You might say, putting this together, D3 is a charting library.</span> <span data-start="139.459" data-end="145.14">Which is weird. Why would you be building charting libraries out of charting libraries.</span> <span data-start="145.14" data-end="154.61">There is cluster layout. Congressional influences. Who is killing whom in Game of Thrones.</span> <span data-start="154.61" data-end="160.62">And is that Obama's budget dressed up as Jupiter?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="160.62" data-end="165.489">Something else is happening here. D3 is not just Charter library.</span> <span data-start="165.489" data-end="168.08">Data visualisation.</span> <span data-start="168.08" data-end="171.63">What does it mean in practice? What is it actually?</span> <span data-start="171.63" data-end="175.93">It is a Dom manipulation library.</span> <span data-start="175.93" data-end="182.06">It might seem random. When you think about it, it makes sense.</span> <span data-start="182.06" data-end="186.68">What is unique is the data.</span> <span data-start="186.68" data-end="193.83">And then you want to render the data in some way. You could start blank and invent internet</span> <span data-start="193.83" data-end="195.41">technolnogy.</span> <span data-start="195.41" data-end="202.33">You have these guys Html, Css and Svg. You know how to use them.</span> <span data-start="202.33" data-end="209.45">Why reinvent the wheel. Let's get the data and have it come hang with the rest. That's</span> <span data-start="209.45" data-end="211.12">what D3 does.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="211.12" data-end="216.04">Lets you take some data. You are going to create a correspondence between the data and</span> <span data-start="216.04" data-end="220.7">Dom nodes. Maybe Svg circles.</span> <span data-start="220.7" data-end="226.45">Since you have this mapping, you are going to use functions from the data into visual</span> <span data-start="226.45" data-end="228.01">attributes.</span> <span data-start="228.01" data-end="230.879">So, let's see it in action.</span> <span data-start="230.879" data-end="239.9">We have this. Woops. This is very low level.</span> <span data-start="239.9" data-end="243.519">You can do anything you imagine.</span> <span data-start="243.519" data-end="249.36">But there is a trade off. That is that the D3 makes simple things hard.</span> <span data-start="249.36" data-end="258.19">And to see this in action. You can see a scatterplot. It has some pieces, data, Svg, some scales.</span> <span data-start="258.19" data-end="266.4">If you are not familiar with a scale. A correspendence between the data and the property.</span> <span data-start="266.4" data-end="274.35">Some axes. We are going to have labels, the plot itself.</span> <span data-start="274.35" data-end="276.48">A legend. All seems reasonable.</span> <span data-start="276.48" data-end="279.03">Let's look at the code.</span> <span data-start="279.03" data-end="281.31">For the data we are going to do some basic cleanup.</span> <span data-start="281.31" data-end="291.2">For the Svg pixel math. The margins, we have to setup the Svg.</span> <span data-start="291.2" data-end="298.35">Scales, we are going to get the scales D3 provides and configure them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="298.35" data-end="304.72">Axes. The axis generating function</span> <span data-start="304.72" data-end="310.9">We setup some part of the dom.</span> <span data-start="310.9" data-end="318.2">Then labels. We have to do a lot more work. Pixel shifts. Svg properties.</span> <span data-start="318.2" data-end="321.79">The plot is where things get interesting.</span> <span data-start="321.79" data-end="326.85">You might imagine, since the plot is the biggest part of the chart and the part where all the</span> <span data-start="326.85" data-end="332.9">action happens, there is a lot of code correspondingly.</span> <span data-start="332.9" data-end="335.61">This code is neat. We will dig into it.</span> <span data-start="335.61" data-end="341.31">We select a part of the Svg. We put our data into it.</span> <span data-start="341.31" data-end="348.051">We are going to create a circle for every piece of data. A class, a radius, and for</span> <span data-start="348.051" data-end="354.78">the exposition, we are going to use a property of the data and the X-scale. To determine</span> <span data-start="354.78" data-end="358.87">where it goes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="358.87" data-end="361.04">What you might notice is a few things.</span> <span data-start="361.04" data-end="366.21">First every line of this code is purposeful and interesting.</span> <span data-start="366.21" data-end="370.95">We correspond to what we want to do.</span> <span data-start="370.95" data-end="375.7">And second, it is really fleysible. We made a scatterplot.</span> <span data-start="375.7" data-end="378.34">We could have done anything with an approach this level.</span> <span data-start="378.34" data-end="386.04">Unfortunately the  legend is different story.</span> <span data-start="386.04" data-end="390.62">It is 3 pieces of text, rectangles, it is straightforward.</span> <span data-start="390.62" data-end="394.68">And it is not.</span> <span data-start="394.68" data-end="395.99">Really what we have here is a mess.</span> <span data-start="395.99" data-end="407.45">We put in the data. Create a bunch of G's. We are going to create rectangles. Text. Hard</span> <span data-start="407.45" data-end="411.34">coded pixels. Text specification.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="411.34" data-end="414.58">And we are going to put in the actual text.</span> <span data-start="414.58" data-end="419.6">This shows cases, the strength and weaknesses of D3.</span> <span data-start="419.6" data-end="426.6">The strength being, when we want to just make something in our data it was incredible.</span> <span data-start="426.6" data-end="434.21">When we want to make a legend or layout, it is a little bit like writing a website with</span> <span data-start="434.21" data-end="435.591">the raw Dom api.</span> <span data-start="435.591" data-end="442.69">It is not impossible, but a huge pain.</span> <span data-start="442.69" data-end="447.31">We have understood the scatterplot. We can go through the other examples quickly.</span> <span data-start="447.31" data-end="449.02">To understand what is going on.</span> <span data-start="449.02" data-end="452.84">That is not a line chart!</span> <span data-start="452.84" data-end="455.75">What are these otters doing in my presentation?</span> <span data-start="455.75" data-end="461.36">You have your keynote attended for 3 minutes, and this happens.</span> <span data-start="461.36" data-end="467.32">But Making 3D charts would be more like that.</span> <span data-start="467.32" data-end="475.62">I'd use the time to hang out with my friends.</span> <span data-start="475.62" data-end="485.36">So, Since those 30 seconds are not going back, let's not go through the charts.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="485.36" data-end="489.6">Here is a chart that C3.Js makes. It looks the same.</span> <span data-start="489.6" data-end="496.05">When we look at the code, it fits all in 1 slide.</span> <span data-start="496.05" data-end="497.83">And it is pretty straightforward.</span> <span data-start="497.83" data-end="503.11">We create this json bag. And we pass it in.</span> <span data-start="503.11" data-end="514.97">Properties like what are the x's. The data. It is a scattered chart.</span> <span data-start="514.97" data-end="517.56">And you see this is readable, straightforward.</span> <span data-start="517.56" data-end="522.99">There is Nvd3. A similar approach. The scatterchart model.</span> <span data-start="522.99" data-end="531.18">So, okay. We found 2 good solutions. In both cases we didn't have to do weird text mocking.</span> <span data-start="531.18" data-end="537.09">We got the chart we wanted. This is great. Maybe we can just go home.</span> <span data-start="537.09" data-end="542.63">But, we haven't figured out this mystery. Why are we doing this over and over if it</span> <span data-start="542.63" data-end="544.66">is so easy.</span> <span data-start="544.66" data-end="550.27">Those libraries are good enough. Let's move on with our lives.</span> <span data-start="550.27" data-end="558.39">What would be great if another library would go ahead and inaddition to making a new library,</span> <span data-start="558.39" data-end="564.88">we know there are hundreds of libraries. Here is why we felt we had to make another.</span> <span data-start="564.88" data-end="573.09">Chartist, does just that. You may think this is another java script charting library.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="573.09" data-end="579.24">It is made by a community that was disappointed with other charting libraries.</span> <span data-start="579.24" data-end="583.94">There was always a tweak you wished for.</span> <span data-start="583.94" data-end="593.51">This  is really great if the chart you want to make</span> <span data-start="593.51" data-end="596.59">happens to look like this one.</span> <span data-start="596.59" data-end="598.9">Let's say we want to do something weird.</span> <span data-start="598.9" data-end="610.13">Two subplots. And axes. One is a scatterplotn and an area plot.</span> <span data-start="610.13" data-end="616.19">I looked in the Api. And there is no flag for turn on special chart.</span> <span data-start="616.19" data-end="619.3">So, we are basically screwed.</span> <span data-start="619.3" data-end="624.83">Unfortunately, what Chartist has done a good job of identifying the problem, they produced</span> <span data-start="624.83" data-end="626.53">a api spec.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="626.53" data-end="629.24">They are going to run into the same issues.</span> <span data-start="629.24" data-end="634.93">What we are seeing is not that they are idiots.</span> <span data-start="634.93" data-end="638.39">They are smart developers.</span> <span data-start="638.39" data-end="645.15">What is happening, every library offers a different mix of 12 features, nice to have.</span> <span data-start="645.15" data-end="649.07">Every consumer has a different mix.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="649.07" data-end="652.9">For every person, no charting library is quite there.</span> <span data-start="652.9" data-end="659.371">They see this. I know what to do. I'll make a new charting library and this will solve</span> <span data-start="659.371" data-end="660.4">the problem.</span> <span data-start="660.4" data-end="664.73">They have made the 102nd charting library.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="664.73" data-end="669.88">J basically, it is a trap.</span> <span data-start="669.88" data-end="674.01">This seems a good point as any to introduce myself.</span> <span data-start="674.01" data-end="687.92">I'm Dan Mane. Here is a picture. That's me, Justin. There is a flying rose. And a giant</span> <span data-start="687.92" data-end="693.51">cupcake. And inflatable dinosaur.</span> <span data-start="693.51" data-end="698.1">We are not taking goofy pictures, we solve problems.</span> <span data-start="698.1" data-end="706.88">Sometimes help areas recover. Drug discovery processes.</span> <span data-start="706.88" data-end="712.16">Sometimes making sure supermarkets in Japan have their shelves packed.</span> <span data-start="712.16" data-end="718.72">You have data. You want them to work with data.</span> <span data-start="718.72" data-end="721.48">You want to make visualisations.</span> <span data-start="721.48" data-end="727.73">In today's world that means Javascript charting libraries.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="727.73" data-end="735.94">When we were asked, how to make these visualisations across the company, we looked at the charting</span> <span data-start="735.94" data-end="736.94">libraries.</span> <span data-start="736.94" data-end="742.59">It was clear we had one feature that we wanted. Interactive zoom.</span> <span data-start="742.59" data-end="746.46">We need a library.</span> <span data-start="746.46" data-end="752.48">Second, we have a whole laboratory with designers. With ideas.</span> <span data-start="752.48" data-end="758.9">If we go to them. Here are the 12 charts we are going to make for you. They will not be</span> <span data-start="758.9" data-end="760.17">happy for you.</span> <span data-start="760.17" data-end="769.32">We could use D3. It works. But we know from experience it means for ages to come, we will</span> <span data-start="769.32" data-end="777.81">be forced to spend time, why is the axis off by 1 pixel.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="777.81" data-end="782.28">And they are not solving the problems we like to solve.</span> <span data-start="782.28" data-end="788.721">The question was, can we find a sweet spot. That exposes the power of D3. Also some of</span> <span data-start="788.721" data-end="792.21">the convenience of a charting library.</span> <span data-start="792.21" data-end="799.1">Spoiler alert, I think we did it. Plottable. Built on D3.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="799.1" data-end="806.28">It is written in TypeScript. Which is awesome.</span> <span data-start="806.28" data-end="814.74">And hosted on Github. I can talk about the philosophy. Like Socrates. While you look</span> <span data-start="814.74" data-end="821.19">away, fall asleep or bang your head in disgust.</span> <span data-start="821.19" data-end="823.33">But instead, we'll show examples.</span> <span data-start="823.33" data-end="828.21">Here is a D3. And the plottable.</span> <span data-start="828.21" data-end="829.95">We compare.</span> <span data-start="829.95" data-end="838.12">D3 we had to do data. We had to do a lot of Svg.</span> <span data-start="838.12" data-end="840.339">Plottable is going to handle it for you.</span> <span data-start="840.339" data-end="846.82">D3 we made the scales. Plottable, just makes the scale. Auto configure. You have all the</span> <span data-start="846.82" data-end="853.36">same Api points if you want something themselves.</span> <span data-start="853.36" data-end="856.79">The labels were weird.</span> <span data-start="856.79" data-end="859.12">When we come to the plot. This is interesting.</span> <span data-start="859.12" data-end="862.57">We loved what D3 was doing here.</span> <span data-start="862.57" data-end="869.45">Plottable is just 1 line. We have fallen into the trap of no flexibility.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="869.45" data-end="873.279">It is almost exactly the same.</span> <span data-start="873.279" data-end="876.33">All the api points are being revealed directly.</span> <span data-start="876.33" data-end="879.86">The only hidden is setting up circles.</span> <span data-start="879.86" data-end="888.63">And then of course the legend which was a mess. Becomes just 1 line.</span> <span data-start="888.63" data-end="892.56">You may be asking oykay, well, I have been paying close attention.</span> <span data-start="892.56" data-end="895.25">You never setup the layout of the chart.</span> <span data-start="895.25" data-end="901.38">What's the deal? Is it magic? Do I have to ask it?</span> <span data-start="901.38" data-end="904.37">No, it is just a layout engine.</span> <span data-start="904.37" data-end="910.13">1 is that you can merge different pieces together.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="910.13" data-end="911.301">You can align them in a table.</span> <span data-start="911.301" data-end="917.12">The table turns out to be convenient for representing charts.</span> <span data-start="917.12" data-end="921.55">It represents the constraint, different pieces need to align.</span> <span data-start="921.55" data-end="924.16">The axes need to be aligned.</span> <span data-start="924.16" data-end="929.22">And easy to represent in code.</span> <span data-start="929.22" data-end="939.12">So, we can see that we kept the strength of D3 that we liked. The power of the plot.</span> <span data-start="939.12" data-end="943.27">And all these weaknesses are gone.</span> <span data-start="943.27" data-end="949.06">You may say, it is great. We have seen that other libraries can make the exact same scatterplot.</span> <span data-start="949.06" data-end="950.8">This is not showing flexibility.</span> <span data-start="950.8" data-end="953.63">We'll have another example.</span> <span data-start="953.63" data-end="959.51">Suppose you have a kind of annoying customer. Not that those exist. Whatever.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="959.51" data-end="965.66">You want a barchart that is going to show the amount of rain in 3 cities in California.</span> <span data-start="965.66" data-end="966.66">That's straightforward.</span> <span data-start="966.66" data-end="972.38">This barplot. I'll set it up.</span> <span data-start="972.38" data-end="976">And you go and they say, you have misunderstood.</span> <span data-start="976" data-end="983.49">We wanted 3 barplots vertically on top of eachother. We can see the difference from</span> <span data-start="983.49" data-end="985.47">each.</span> <span data-start="985.47" data-end="988.51">Luckily, that's just a table.</span> <span data-start="988.51" data-end="990.48">We layout another table.</span> <span data-start="990.48" data-end="992.51">And we have this crazy chart.</span> <span data-start="992.51" data-end="995.58">Maybe they say, it is good.</span> <span data-start="995.58" data-end="1002.83">We want the Svg to be bigger, all the font sizes to be bigger. And all needs to be in</span> <span data-start="1002.83" data-end="1005.089">comic sense.</span> <span data-start="1005.089" data-end="1009.29">This is going to look terrible.</span> <span data-start="1009.29" data-end="1015.45">You change the Css. And you get this ugly chart.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1015.45" data-end="1020.26">But, let's not do that.</span> <span data-start="1020.26" data-end="1025.8">And maybe you want gridlines.</span> <span data-start="1025.8" data-end="1034.67">Maybe they want to add animations. You can set animation. And you get the animations.</span> <span data-start="1034.67" data-end="1041">It has default animator. For custom animations.</span> <span data-start="1041" data-end="1044.91">Maybe you know they want to change to line plots. You can do that.</span> <span data-start="1044.91" data-end="1052.57">Maybe they want time axis. Maybe they want to merge it together in 1 plot.</span> <span data-start="1052.57" data-end="1054.18">You can do it.</span> <span data-start="1054.18" data-end="1056.6">Change the grid lines. Sure.</span> <span data-start="1056.6" data-end="1059.23">Add interactive pan and zoom.</span> <span data-start="1059.23" data-end="1063.14">S why not.</span> <span data-start="1063.14" data-end="1069.36">So, the result is. We were able to create this chart.</span> <span data-start="1069.36" data-end="1074.4">And we weren't able to create it, but iterate quickly on different ideas.</span> <span data-start="1074.4" data-end="1080.83">It's an order of magnitude faster than pure D3.</span> <span data-start="1080.83" data-end="1089.98">If I would be given this a week ago, this would be the end.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1089.98" data-end="1092.75">Why don't you build a charting abrary out of it.</span> <span data-start="1092.75" data-end="1098.55">And a path back into plottable.</span> <span data-start="1098.55" data-end="1102.27">I had this long plane ride to Berlin.</span> <span data-start="1102.27" data-end="1103.53">And built chartographer.</span> <span data-start="1103.53" data-end="1112.46">It is plottable and easy mode zozer Couple indications follow. Setting up the chart is</span> <span data-start="1112.46" data-end="1114.04">1 line.</span> <span data-start="1114.04" data-end="1118.05">And then we configure some labels and render it in the other lines.</span> <span data-start="1118.05" data-end="1121.81">It is supersimple to use.</span> <span data-start="1121.81" data-end="1124.86">What is interesting to this.</span> <span data-start="1124.86" data-end="1127.24">It only gives you these charts.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1127.24" data-end="1135.95">And it has a path flexibility. Rather to be a charting library that does it all. You get</span> <span data-start="1135.95" data-end="1136.95">Getcomponents.</span> <span data-start="1136.95" data-end="1142.27">You can arap them, twittle with them.</span> <span data-start="1142.27" data-end="1147">So, this enables a new workflow for developing charts.</span> <span data-start="1147" data-end="1152.13">You can start with chartographer. 30 seconds and you have your chart.</span> <span data-start="1152.13" data-end="1154.59">You want to change it.</span> <span data-start="1154.59" data-end="1160.6">You can drop down into plottable. Every 5 minutes you can try out a new layout.</span> <span data-start="1160.6" data-end="1166.15">You discover you want fancy data visualisation that we don't have.</span> <span data-start="1166.15" data-end="1170.78">You can drop down to D3. Write a plugin and you have your chart.</span> <span data-start="1170.78" data-end="1174.44">And hopefully you submit it back to us.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1174.44" data-end="1188.5">So, now comes the moment in the presentation you didn't know you were waiting for.</span> <span data-start="1188.5" data-end="1192.37">Which is internet spaceships.</span> <span data-start="1192.37" data-end="1197.51">So, that was a clip from a videogame.</span> <span data-start="1197.51" data-end="1198.99">Eve online.</span> <span data-start="1198.99" data-end="1204.59">A mix of spaceships and spreadsheets.</span> <span data-start="1204.59" data-end="1209.62">A spreadsheet means someone is crying out for data visualisation.</span> <span data-start="1209.62" data-end="1216.5">It is kind of neat.</span> <span data-start="1216.5" data-end="1221.75">We have here a chart that is showing a couple of things about plottable. That my design</span> <span data-start="1221.75" data-end="1224.63">skills are not good to begin with.</span> <span data-start="1224.63" data-end="1233.19">We are seeing that we can hide data. Each is a spaceship.</span> <span data-start="1233.19" data-end="1234.79">Its color is what race.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1234.79" data-end="1239.23">How many have played Eve?</span> <span data-start="1239.23" data-end="1241.74">Okay.</span> <span data-start="1241.74" data-end="1248.99">Every circle is a spaceship. The color is representing the fraction.</span> <span data-start="1248.99" data-end="1257.47">It is stroke is showing what class identity it is.</span> <span data-start="1257.47" data-end="1263.18">Its X and Y position how much shield and armor.</span> <span data-start="1263.18" data-end="1271.809">So, the fact that all these are faction ships.</span> <span data-start="1271.809" data-end="1274.98">More shields.</span> <span data-start="1274.98" data-end="1280.91">And I got this data source from someone who did it by hand.</span> <span data-start="1280.91" data-end="1285.549">I sall of these typo's. We are not fitting the pattern.</span> <span data-start="1285.549" data-end="1294.65">It also has tool tips. This is not a feature in Plottable yet. It is just D3. You can use</span> <span data-start="1294.65" data-end="1295.65">other libraries.</span> <span data-start="1295.65" data-end="1299.39">It has this pan and zoom.</span> <span data-start="1299.39" data-end="1301.809">The interesting thing about this chart.</span> <span data-start="1301.809" data-end="1304.35">It is incomplete.</span> <span data-start="1304.35" data-end="1311.09">I think we should have a legend that shows stroke, rather filling the bubble.</span> <span data-start="1311.09" data-end="1318.76">And I think that we should have another legend that is showing different radius. This is</span> <span data-start="1318.76" data-end="1320.09">where you come up.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1320.09" data-end="1326.48">The idea is that it is very modular and easy to work with.</span> <span data-start="1326.48" data-end="1332.28">Maybe one of you guys will head over to our github.</span> <span data-start="1332.28" data-end="1333.8">And take a look at the code.</span> <span data-start="1333.8" data-end="1335.68">You can write these legend pieces.</span> <span data-start="1335.68" data-end="1338.74">Everybody will be able to use it.</span> <span data-start="1338.74" data-end="1344.16">That is the path forward. Out of this mess of 105 charting libraries.</span> <span data-start="1344.16" data-end="1349.04">We need to stop independently building separate things.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1349.04" data-end="1354.14">We need to find 1 Api, that is expressive.</span> <span data-start="1354.14" data-end="1361.86">And work together to build all the pieces. So, somebody can have a chart they want and</span> <span data-start="1361.86" data-end="1367.24">get back to saving the world or hanging at the aquarium with otters.</span> <span data-start="1367.24" data-end="1371.67">So, this is the end of my talk.</span> <span data-start="1371.67" data-end="1375.62">Let's see if I have more slides.</span> <span data-start="1375.62" data-end="1376.75">No.</span> <span data-start="1376.75" data-end="1378.67">My name is Dan Mané.</span> <span data-start="1378.67" data-end="1383.75">You can find me at@Danmane.</span> <span data-start="1383.75" data-end="1390.6">You can find us at this website.</span> <span data-start="1390.6" data-end="1392.97">Since I have 1.20minute. I take at least one question.</span> <span data-start="1392.97" data-end="1397.04">If anyone wants to ask.</span> <span data-start="1397.04" data-end="1405.61">I'll take that as a sign it was so conclusive. And you download it right away.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1405.61" data-end="1409.34">All right. Thank you guys.</span> </p>
