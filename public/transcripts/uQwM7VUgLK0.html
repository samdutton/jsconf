<p><span data-start="277.25" data-end="282.07">So three years ago, Alex McLean started this movement, and last year at JSConf</span> <span data-start="282.07" data-end="291.11">Asia, I met a PhD from UCSB, Charlie Roberts, who made JavaScript environments</span> <span data-start="291.11" data-end="293.34">for Algoravers.</span> <span data-start="293.34" data-end="298.71">And it's an online IDE with a DSL that allows you to write</span> <span data-start="298.71" data-end="303.19">code and, like, make people dance to that.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="368.49" data-end="369.51">You know?</span> <span data-start="369.51" data-end="372.33">If you're standing there in front of an audience, you can play</span> <span data-start="372.33" data-end="373.33">around with the parameters.</span> <span data-start="373.33" data-end="375.78">Nothing is very static.</span> <span data-start="375.78" data-end="379.43">Once you pick one, that's basically it.</span> <span data-start="379.43" data-end="381.25">That's what it's going to be.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="381.25" data-end="383.22">Then I thought..</span> <span data-start="383.22" data-end="385.78">What else do you see at concerts these days?</span> <span data-start="385.78" data-end="387.72">Like, way too much..</span> <span data-start="387.72" data-end="391.16">Mobile phones.</span> <span data-start="391.16" data-end="396.59">And mobile phones are now pretty good at, like, capturing what's happening</span> <span data-start="396.59" data-end="403.03">around you, because mobile phones have sensors, sensors, sensors, and sensors.</span> <span data-start="403.03" data-end="404.03">So..</span> <span data-start="404.03" data-end="407.84">Today we're going to do a nice little experiment, where you guys are</span> <span data-start="407.84" data-end="411.1">going to help me produce some music.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="411.1" data-end="414.43">Because we're going to use the sensor data of all your phones..</span> <span data-start="414.43" data-end="418.33">And I have no clue how many phones my computer is</span> <span data-start="418.33" data-end="420.05">going to be able to handle.</span> <span data-start="420.05" data-end="425.84">It'll all get uploaded to a node.js server, and</span> <span data-start="425.84" data-end="430.71">then we feed the data from all of you together into a music generating</span> <span data-start="430.71" data-end="432.03">algorithm.</span> <span data-start="432.03" data-end="435.13">So you guys have influence over how the music is going to sound</span> <span data-start="435.13" data-end="437.69">today.</span> <span data-start="437.69" data-end="441.56">If you want to play around with this later or if you are a cool Algoraver,</span> <span data-start="441.56" data-end="443.94">this code is on Github, so you can integrate it.</span> <span data-start="443.94" data-end="452.891">So instead of set variable for the pitch, we can get the yaw or the pitch</span> <span data-start="452.891" data-end="455.78">of all your phones, and then feed that into the algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="455.78" data-end="459.4">So when people start moving around the phones, music will actually change.</span> <span data-start="459.4" data-end="462.1">Here's a variable.</span> <span data-start="462.1" data-end="463.1">Okay.</span> <span data-start="463.1" data-end="468.06">This is one of the demos we're going to do today.</span> <span data-start="468.06" data-end="471.84">Another one..</span> <span data-start="471.84" data-end="477.1">Because your mobile phone is still really confined by what the sensor can detect.</span> <span data-start="477.1" data-end="479.85">Gyrometer or accelerometer.</span> <span data-start="479.85" data-end="485.97">But Bluetooth beacons  —  I have a few here.</span> <span data-start="485.97" data-end="487.9">They're tiny chips.</span> <span data-start="487.9" data-end="492.05">They don't run JavaScript, but they just broadcast their</span> <span data-start="492.05" data-end="493.3">existence.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="493.3" data-end="496.73">I can put one on the wall and for the next two years, it will just say..</span> <span data-start="496.73" data-end="499.78">Hey, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.</span> <span data-start="499.78" data-end="500.79">They're getting tiny.</span> <span data-start="500.79" data-end="501.81">This is the new estimation.</span> <span data-start="501.81" data-end="504.3">They go for $10.</span> <span data-start="504.3" data-end="510.91">Tiny, small, you can broadcast a value like a URL or sensor values.</span> <span data-start="510.91" data-end="517.13">Now, the cool thing is that the ability to detect beacons, to walk into a room</span> <span data-start="517.13" data-end="521.8">and see  —  okay, there's ten around you in five meters  —  is coming to</span> <span data-start="521.8" data-end="525.88">JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="525.88" data-end="529.24">We actually finished implementing this in Firefox OS and hope to</span> <span data-start="529.24" data-end="534.01">bring it to Firefox for Android on short notice.</span> <span data-start="534.01" data-end="536.73">After June it's going to be accessible.</span> <span data-start="536.73" data-end="539.62">So we have phones that run this and I'll do some demos for that.</span> <span data-start="539.62" data-end="542.02">How do you scan for beacons?</span> <span data-start="542.02" data-end="543.7">It's straightforward.</span> <span data-start="543.7" data-end="548.8">The most Bluetooth thing is not standardized yet, but in the web Bluetooth</span> <span data-start="548.8" data-end="552.45">standards, we're talking about implementing low energy support for Bluetooth.</span> <span data-start="552.45" data-end="555.81">So this is coming to the standards track.</span> <span data-start="555.81" data-end="559.03">We can get the adapter, start a low energy scan.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="559.03" data-end="562.91">We're not interested in all the devices around us.</span> <span data-start="562.91" data-end="565.69">And then when a device is found, we get an event.</span> <span data-start="565.69" data-end="569.37">A couple seconds later, we can stop.</span> <span data-start="569.37" data-end="572.01">The event you get contains a scan record.</span> <span data-start="572.01" data-end="575.63">And that basically is all the data you send it.</span> <span data-start="575.63" data-end="579.28">Most things currently follow the iBeacon standards from Apple, and that gives</span> <span data-start="579.28" data-end="582.15">you three IDs, essentially.</span> <span data-start="582.15" data-end="585.6">A UUID for a manufacturer, a major, and a minor.</span> <span data-start="585.6" data-end="588.4">So that's how you can detect which beacon is what.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="588.4" data-end="591.17">Now, what are we going to do with this today?</span> <span data-start="591.17" data-end="594.15">The JavaScript baby monitor.</span> <span data-start="594.15" data-end="600.65">So you're going to tag a baby with a phone.</span> <span data-start="600.65" data-end="604.28">Then on the phone, we run some JavaScript that constantly</span> <span data-start="604.28" data-end="606.94">searches around for the beacons.</span> <span data-start="606.94" data-end="611.25">Then based on how strong the signal is, we're going to triangulate from the three beacons</span> <span data-start="611.25" data-end="616.12">with some math, and that way we know where in the room the baby is located.</span> <span data-start="616.12" data-end="619.44">Now, you might think..</span> <span data-start="619.44" data-end="622.29">Tagging a baby with a phone  —  is that really necessary,</span> </p>
