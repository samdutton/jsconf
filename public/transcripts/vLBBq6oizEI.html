<p><span data-start="5.5" data-end="12.71">Hi, everyone, I'm head of development for an online platform for showcasing and discovering</span> <span data-start="12.71" data-end="13.83">creative work.</span> <span data-start="13.83" data-end="20.84">I want to share about our journey of growing and maintaining a large codebase in an area</span> <span data-start="20.84" data-end="27.63">where front-end technology is changing extremely fast, from our original days of using vanilla</span> <span data-start="27.63" data-end="34.14">CSS through to the introduction of preprocessors, and into our current day in JS implementations.</span> <span data-start="34.14" data-end="40.89">I will go over some of our trials and tribulations, growing pains, and I will even air some of</span> <span data-start="40.89" data-end="46.41">our dirty laundry, but, perhaps most importantly, how I learned to stop worrying and love the</span> <span data-start="46.41" data-end="50.65">website.</span> <span data-start="50.65" data-end="54.899">The front-end web development ecosystem is moving insanely fast these days.</span> <span data-start="54.899" data-end="59.79">It seems like a new tool or methodology for authoring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript becomes</span> <span data-start="59.79" data-end="62.56">available every other day.</span> <span data-start="62.56" data-end="66.799">Whereas a few years ago, there weren't nearly as many tools with which to work on these</span> <span data-start="66.799" data-end="71.56">things, probably in large part because complex front-end requirements like responsive web</span> <span data-start="71.56" data-end="76.81">development, or single-page web apps weren't even concerns near our radars yet.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="76.81" data-end="84.1">Now we are seeing huge rapid advancements in the languages themselves to how we generate</span> <span data-start="84.1" data-end="88.59">basically every single kind of code we write, to the frameworks we use to organise our code,</span> <span data-start="88.59" data-end="92.219">all the way to the build tools that we use to build, compile, optimise, and serve our</span> <span data-start="92.219" data-end="94.63">code.</span> <span data-start="94.63" data-end="101.329">Because there's always some better or faster tool becoming available, it can feel overwhelming</span> <span data-start="101.329" data-end="105.229">to choose and adopt these new technologies all the time.</span> <span data-start="105.229" data-end="111.159">This is hard enough to do on a brand new project, where there is no pre-exist ing code concerns,</span> <span data-start="111.159" data-end="116.279">but it can be especially hard in a large codebase, or one has been around for a long time.</span> <span data-start="116.279" data-end="121.92">Where, when the moment you add something new, suddenly, everything else becomes legacy code,</span> <span data-start="121.92" data-end="126.899">and now, not only do you have all of this new stuff that you need to learn and maintain,</span> <span data-start="126.899" data-end="130.86">you also have to consider how it's going to play with all of your old code, and how or</span> <span data-start="130.86" data-end="137.97">even if you're ever going to update that old code to use this new stuff.</span> <span data-start="137.97" data-end="142.44">When you compound these technical challenges with the industry pressure that you should</span> <span data-start="142.44" data-end="148.61">be using a certain tool, or doing things a certain way in order to be a real web developer,</span> <span data-start="148.61" data-end="152.59">it can create kind of a harsh environment for being able to make the best decisions</span> <span data-start="152.59" data-end="156.06">for your team and for your product, and for your users.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="156.06" data-end="160.92">Which, on the code side, that can lead to things like an increase in technical debt,</span> <span data-start="160.92" data-end="166.01">or missed project deadlines, but on the human side of things, it can create negative feelings</span> <span data-start="166.01" data-end="169.18">like imposter syndrome or burn-out which are really harmful.</span> <span data-start="169.18" data-end="174.42">Today, I want to tell you about how we've dealt with these kinds of challenges over</span> <span data-start="174.42" data-end="179.46">the years, and, if any of you have felt like you've experienced anything like these, or</span> <span data-start="179.46" data-end="186.79">might experience anything like this, I want you to know you're not alone.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="186.79" data-end="189.54">We've been involving the codebase since 2010.</span> <span data-start="189.54" data-end="194.73">When I joined the team eight years ago, they had finished a wholesale rewrite of the website</span> <span data-start="194.73" data-end="200.51">from scratch but since then we've not started over but working in the same evolving codebase</span> <span data-start="200.51" data-end="205.49">through the years, and we've moved through a number of different template engines, CSS</span> <span data-start="205.49" data-end="210.13">pro processors, JavaScript libraries and frameworks — you name it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="210.13" data-end="215.09">I joined as the fourth developer on the team, and, since then, we've grown to be about 40</span> <span data-start="215.09" data-end="221.57">developers, and, in that time, we have faced a really wide variety of challenges.</span> <span data-start="221.57" data-end="227.18">We are also constantly considering which new technologies we can use which will serve us</span> <span data-start="227.18" data-end="229.28">and the website and the users' needs best.</span> <span data-start="229.28" data-end="233.74">We have had to figure out how to actually implement these new technologies into our</span> <span data-start="233.74" data-end="238.16">existing track, even when there were massive functional disparities with what was already</span> <span data-start="238.16" data-end="239.16">there.</span> <span data-start="239.16" data-end="245.79">We have had to figure out when to start implementing these things, in particular, having to balance</span> <span data-start="245.79" data-end="250.24">our product goals, and road maps with our developer happiness as well as the health</span> <span data-start="250.24" data-end="251.39">of the codebase.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="251.39" data-end="256.609">We have had to clean up any messes we left behind along the way.</span> <span data-start="256.609" data-end="262.889">So, there is a ton of opinions out there on the internet on what the best or the right</span> <span data-start="262.889" data-end="266.249">way to build a website is.</span> <span data-start="266.249" data-end="271.4">I'm not here to tell you that there is any one right or wrong way to do any of these</span> <span data-start="271.4" data-end="272.4">things.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="272.4" data-end="276.71">In fact, I'm kind of here to demonstrate the opposite.</span> <span data-start="276.71" data-end="281.569">What I do want to tell you is about how we've handled these challenges over the years, how</span> <span data-start="281.569" data-end="288.34">and why we've made the decisions that we did, and how they did or did not work out for us.</span> <span data-start="288.34" data-end="291.65">And what I really kind of want to reveal is that, no matter how pretty and put-together</span> <span data-start="291.65" data-end="296.849">things may seem from the outside, whenever you pull back the curtain, there's no website</span> <span data-start="296.849" data-end="301.029">or process as perfect or pretty as it may seem.</span> <span data-start="301.029" data-end="306.87">So, first, a little extra insight into our size and complexity.</span> <span data-start="306.87" data-end="313.479">As of today, I counted 50 pages on our website which exist in various states of logged in</span> <span data-start="313.479" data-end="320.46">our out, or empty states or not, and that's made up of over 500 JavaScript files, roughly</span> <span data-start="320.46" data-end="324.909">the same number of style sheets and almost 1,000 markup templates.</span> <span data-start="324.909" data-end="328.36">Of course, this nuclear missile has been in — this number has been in flux over the years</span> <span data-start="328.36" data-end="335.86">as we've removed various pages and sections of the site, but the website has also evolved</span> <span data-start="335.86" data-end="340.99">to become a little bit more like a WhatsApp as opposed to its — like a web app as opposed</span> <span data-start="340.99" data-end="347.069">to its traditional website origins, we have way more interactive modular components that</span> <span data-start="347.069" data-end="353.029">exist across many of the site — for example, a notifications and a messages feed that you</span> <span data-start="353.029" data-end="360.379">can see on any page, like a project pop-up or user card that can be incited from many</span> <span data-start="360.379" data-end="364.33">different areas of the website as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="364.33" data-end="365.87">We have humble begins.</span> <span data-start="365.87" data-end="368.069">This screen shot is from the Way Back Machine.</span> <span data-start="368.069" data-end="370.49">There used to be something on the right side.</span> <span data-start="370.49" data-end="374.099">Some things get lost even to the internet.</span> <span data-start="374.099" data-end="377.229">Back in 2010 when I first joined, we weren't using anything but CSS to satisfactorily the</span> <span data-start="377.229" data-end="378.229">website.</span> <span data-start="378.229" data-end="379.49">I would — to style the website.</span> <span data-start="379.49" data-end="386.949">I would say our CSS style back then could be called copy-paste-driven development at</span> <span data-start="386.949" data-end="388.069">this point.</span> <span data-start="388.069" data-end="394.289">We pretty much had no tools on the front-end to help us reduce repetition, or weren't using</span> <span data-start="394.289" data-end="400.479">any methodologies or naming conventions to help keep our CSS clean.</span> <span data-start="400.479" data-end="405.879">This is what the website looked like, and I would say anything on the website that wasn't</span> <span data-start="405.879" data-end="409.74">plain text or a solid colour was probably an image.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="409.74" data-end="414.99">CSS just wasn't nearly as robust as it is today, and we were trying to create something</span> <span data-start="414.99" data-end="421.409">more visually interesting than native CSS would allow at the time.</span> <span data-start="421.409" data-end="426.939">We started to get comfortable using CSS features for visual flair where we could, understanding</span> <span data-start="426.939" data-end="432.449">the website didn't have to look the same in every single browser all the time, and once</span> <span data-start="432.449" data-end="437.099">our designers realised that we could make any CSS gradient we wanted without them having</span> <span data-start="437.099" data-end="443.38">to make images for it, I got to become intimately familiar with this tool.</span> <span data-start="443.38" data-end="448.389">There is like a dozen different ways to make gradients in different browsers, and I was</span> <span data-start="448.389" data-end="451.159">not about to memorise all that syntax.</span> <span data-start="451.159" data-end="456.499">In time, browser technology started to pick up more seam.</span> <span data-start="456.499" data-end="462.02">CSS as a language was advancing, and we were having a lot of fun with the cool visual visual</span> <span data-start="462.02" data-end="470.039">tricks and treats with CSS and getting comfortable with making images starting to implement with</span> <span data-start="470.039" data-end="473.869">native CSS.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="473.869" data-end="478.36">We had an interesting additional challenge in that we also had all of these offshoots</span> <span data-start="478.36" data-end="483.909">of the site that were themed galleries for different creative fields and these white-label</span> <span data-start="483.909" data-end="490.669">almost miniature Behance's school and organisations which used the same markup and JavaScript</span> <span data-start="490.669" data-end="496.139">with the main website but with an additional style sheet loaded to customise them for their</span> <span data-start="496.139" data-end="499.449">own look for brand.</span> <span data-start="499.449" data-end="503.74">All these lived within the same one codebase which means if you changed something in the</span> <span data-start="503.74" data-end="510.99">main website, you had to make sure you didn't change it on the other 40-plus versions of</span> <span data-start="510.99" data-end="511.99">the website.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="511.99" data-end="512.99">No big deal.</span> <span data-start="512.99" data-end="518.69">So, by now, we had a clear need of a tool that would help us with our CSS development.</span> <span data-start="518.69" data-end="523.71">Not only were vendor prefixes starting to slip through the cracks, but thanks to the</span> <span data-start="523.71" data-end="530.77">themed galleries and websites, we were inundated with copy and pasted CSS where largely the</span> <span data-start="530.77" data-end="535.69">differences were font names or colour values.</span> <span data-start="535.69" data-end="541.38">Fortunately which by this time, CSS processors were picking up steam looking like the perfect</span> <span data-start="541.38" data-end="546.35">tool to make, more dry.</span> <span data-start="546.35" data-end="552.93">Now, the story I'm about to tell is not about the merits of any one CSS preprocessor over</span> <span data-start="552.93" data-end="559.33">the other, but I do want to use it was a real-world example of the messy path to choosing, implementing,</span> <span data-start="559.33" data-end="561.11">and using new tools.</span> <span data-start="561.11" data-end="568.39">For us, we were debating between Less and Sass, good tools on their own, but wanted</span> <span data-start="568.39" data-end="574.06">to make sure we picked the tool for our specific needs.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="574.06" data-end="580.69">Sass had more compelling implementations and features for our use case and Compass on top</span> <span data-start="580.69" data-end="586.4">of that offered a ton of extra power that was going to be absolutely perfect for all</span> <span data-start="586.4" data-end="589.25">those sites and our sprite management.</span> <span data-start="589.25" data-end="593.96">Sass and Compass were set to improve our lives drastically.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="593.96" data-end="596.41">The answer could not be more clear.</span> <span data-start="596.41" data-end="602.74">We obviously went with Less!</span> <span data-start="602.74" data-end="606.18">Why we would do that?</span> <span data-start="606.18" data-end="611.07">For a couple of of reasons: the time, there was only Ruby Sass, and since the site was</span> <span data-start="611.07" data-end="617.38">not built on a Ruby stack, it wasn't easy for us to implement or even start using Sass</span> <span data-start="617.38" data-end="620.09">and it was a little bit in Tim dating.</span> <span data-start="620.09" data-end="627.8">Since Less could be compiled by downloading a GUI app to your computer, it had a low barrier</span> <span data-start="627.8" data-end="629.12">of entry for us.</span> <span data-start="629.12" data-end="634.37">We were still a tiny dev team at this point, but this meant we could start getting a lot</span> <span data-start="634.37" data-end="640.37">of the benefits of a CSS preprocessor sooner and way less friction and engineering time</span> <span data-start="640.37" data-end="645.09">than if we had chosen to go with Sass at that point.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="645.09" data-end="650.21">It afforded us another interesting benefit as well in that we were able to use Less as</span> <span data-start="650.21" data-end="656.39">a proof of concept that implement be a CSS preprocessor was a worthwhile investment.</span> <span data-start="656.39" data-end="662.43">The time it took to get it up and running for everyone to use paid off drastically in</span> <span data-start="662.43" data-end="666.25">development time and development improvements down the line which meant that we were able</span> <span data-start="666.25" data-end="671.17">to get more team buy-in for actually adopting Sass as well as negotiate for the development</span> <span data-start="671.17" data-end="675.2">time that we needed to do so and make the switch to the tool that we ultimately felt</span> <span data-start="675.2" data-end="679.26">would serve us best.</span> <span data-start="679.26" data-end="681.5">But our journey does not end there.</span> <span data-start="681.5" data-end="685.3">Although we had decided that the higher-end investment in setting up Sass was worth it,</span> <span data-start="685.3" data-end="688.89">we had to cut some corners to get there.</span> <span data-start="688.89" data-end="693.7">To complicate things, we were now dealing with the dreaded technical debt of working</span> <span data-start="693.7" data-end="700.8">in a codebase that had partially vanilla CSS and partially less syntax, and now we would</span> <span data-start="700.8" data-end="705.01">have to spend the time to convert that all into Sass.</span> <span data-start="705.01" data-end="710.39">We still didn't have a tech stack that could compile Sass for us, but what we could do</span> <span data-start="710.39" data-end="717.02">was install Ruby and Sass on each of our individual computers and compile and commit the Sass</span> <span data-start="717.02" data-end="721.43">and the CSS to our repositories from there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="721.43" data-end="729.59">Now, we violated a lot of web development best practices by compiling CSS on our own</span> <span data-start="729.59" data-end="734.7">machines instead of by using a build tool within the tech stack, and we were committing</span> <span data-start="734.7" data-end="741.53">an even worse crime of actually committing exiled code to our repository.</span> <span data-start="741.53" data-end="748.23">I seriously doubt you would ever find a Medium think-piece advocating for this kind of implementation,</span> <span data-start="748.23" data-end="754.1">and gives me some anxiety to admit on stage in front of you all that we were committing</span> <span data-start="754.1" data-end="759.9">such an egregious violation of best practice by having literally hundreds of preprocessed</span> <span data-start="759.9" data-end="763.43">CSS files in our library.</span> <span data-start="763.43" data-end="768.52">On the flip side, I can't tell you how much benefit we were having by having Sass available</span> <span data-start="768.52" data-end="772.29">for us in this way.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="772.29" data-end="777.39">For what sounds like a nightmare situation on the surface, I have to say, for the most</span> <span data-start="777.39" data-end="780.14">part, actually it worked really well for us.</span> <span data-start="780.14" data-end="785.3">Suddenly, we were able to build our themed galleries in white-labelled website in a fraction</span> <span data-start="785.3" data-end="790.22">of the time which meant that we were helping our users in our mission to give more exposure</span> <span data-start="790.22" data-end="792.37">to creatives.</span> <span data-start="792.37" data-end="797.41">We were able to do it with way less code than before which meant that now our codebase became</span> <span data-start="797.41" data-end="802.45">much easier to understand and maintain.</span> <span data-start="802.45" data-end="807.5">Although committing compiled code is considered a bad practice, for a large, complex codebase</span> <span data-start="807.5" data-end="812.99">with a lot of interdependencies, it actually ended up giving us extremely clear visibility</span> <span data-start="812.99" data-end="817.39">into the reach that any single change actually was having.</span> <span data-start="817.39" data-end="821.66">In the — and the last cool thing is that we suddenly had tools that could do grunt work</span> <span data-start="821.66" data-end="823.61">for us.</span> <span data-start="823.61" data-end="827.66">For example, this meant that our designers could focus on working on and designing things</span> <span data-start="827.66" data-end="831.92">that actually mattered rather than spending their time doing menial tasks like stitching</span> <span data-start="831.92" data-end="836.18">sprites together.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="993.38" data-end="997.4">There was literally nothing about how the site was built to that point that was conducive</span> <span data-start="997.4" data-end="999.32">to being responsive.</span> <span data-start="999.32" data-end="1006.05">The way we built the site layout was rigid, the existing design was not immediately adaptable</span> <span data-start="1006.05" data-end="1011.73">to smaller screen sizes, and we were still lacking the tools on the front-end that we</span> <span data-start="1011.73" data-end="1017.279">need to structure and implement the kind of responsive functionality and modularity that</span> <span data-start="1017.279" data-end="1020.94">we really wanted to.</span> <span data-start="1020.94" data-end="1025.16">We knew we wanted to make the website responsive but despite the challenges in place by the</span> <span data-start="1025.16" data-end="1031.57">existing foundation, we knew a full rewrite of the website was out of the question.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1031.57" data-end="1034.79">It was a huge website and would have have taken far too long.</span> <span data-start="1034.79" data-end="1037.62">So we continued working on Behance.</span> <span data-start="1037.62" data-end="1043.01">We would add new features and convert the site over to be responsive page by page, and</span> <span data-start="1043.01" data-end="1048.82">we used our JavaScript framework NBD for any new code that we were creating, and updating</span> <span data-start="1048.82" data-end="1054.92">existing areas of the site needed also, whether it was because that page was due for maintenance</span> <span data-start="1054.92" data-end="1057.62">or any other kind of update.</span> <span data-start="1057.62" data-end="1067.91">So, both Sass and NBD carried us all the way into 2015 when we started working on another</span> <span data-start="1067.91" data-end="1069.75">brand new single-page web app.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1069.75" data-end="1074.65">This time it was a website builder called the W portfolio and turned to be the most</span> <span data-start="1074.65" data-end="1079">complex single web app we've created to date.</span> <span data-start="1079" data-end="1084.05">We had a ton of new technical challenges on portfolio that we never had to deal with before</span> <span data-start="1084.05" data-end="1086.49">in our single-page web app.</span> <span data-start="1086.49" data-end="1093.52">We wanted to build a few GUI what you see is what you get editor, building where one</span> <span data-start="1093.52" data-end="1099.02">of any literally hundreds of customisation dialogues, you could make a change to your</span> <span data-start="1099.02" data-end="1103.58">website and see it reflected in the editor in real time.</span> <span data-start="1103.58" data-end="1108.99">We needed to do this while maintaining an editor chrome that didn't interfere with user</span> <span data-start="1108.99" data-end="1113.18">customisations in any way.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1113.18" data-end="1118.73">We started building Portfolio with NBD but building and maintaining a framework is not</span> <span data-start="1118.73" data-end="1120.9">without its risks and downsides, either.</span> <span data-start="1120.9" data-end="1126.35">Now, we had started to feel the growing pains of using our own home-grown framework.</span> <span data-start="1126.35" data-end="1132.43">It was originally build by one of our developers and maintained by only a couple of more, so</span> <span data-start="1132.43" data-end="1135.81">this meant that it didn't move particularly fast.</span> <span data-start="1135.81" data-end="1140.62">It meant that other open-source frameworks were moving at a much faster rate.</span> <span data-start="1140.62" data-end="1145.26">It also meant that it was much more challenging for new hires to learn it.</span> <span data-start="1145.26" data-end="1150.26">Documentation on it was sparse because the developers who knew how it worked were busy</span> <span data-start="1150.26" data-end="1155.15">developing, whether it was the framework, or for a new feature for our websites.</span> <span data-start="1155.15" data-end="1162.1">And it also the universe of resources to get help with it was scoped entirely to an extremely</span> <span data-start="1162.1" data-end="1170.69">small portion of our dev team which made it hard for anyone who needed help to be self-sufficient.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1170.69" data-end="1175.58">On the flip side, popular open-source frameworks came with the benefit of way more active and</span> <span data-start="1175.58" data-end="1178.94">visible communities to tap into for help.</span> <span data-start="1178.94" data-end="1183.59">Which not only means that you have a way bigger pool of resources to get help from but it</span> <span data-start="1183.59" data-end="1188.559">also means that there is a community need that you can give back to when you solve a</span> <span data-start="1188.559" data-end="1191.72">specific challenge, or interesting problem yourself.</span> <span data-start="1191.72" data-end="1196.96">So, by then, it was easy enough to acknowledge that our home-grown framework was no longer</span> <span data-start="1196.96" data-end="1201.33">the best tool for our team, or for the new types of products and features that we were</span> <span data-start="1201.33" data-end="1204.48">building.</span> <span data-start="1204.48" data-end="1210.47">After spending some time on portfolio's development, we turned our attention back to Behance.</span> <span data-start="1210.47" data-end="1216.33">In the time we had been building Adobe Portfolio, our designers had been working on a new look</span> <span data-start="1216.33" data-end="1221.96">of the Behance website, and we wanted this to make a big splash.</span> <span data-start="1221.96" data-end="1226.42">We wanted to it to be a release where the look and feel of the entire website would</span> <span data-start="1226.42" data-end="1229.93">change for our users all at once.</span> <span data-start="1229.93" data-end="1234.53">Despite this once again, we still knew that starting the whole thing over from scratch</span> <span data-start="1234.53" data-end="1237.52">was simply not going to be an option for us.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1237.52" data-end="1246.04">We had adopted modular JavaScript with require.js and attempted to scope and componentise our</span> <span data-start="1246.04" data-end="1254.1">CSS as much as possible using BEM but the truly scoped nature of JS and CSS was becoming</span> <span data-start="1254.1" data-end="1261.09">enticing for our increasingly modular website and web apps.</span> <span data-start="1261.09" data-end="1264.88">The time was ripe for us to look for new technology.</span> <span data-start="1264.88" data-end="1270.08">In the same way that the industry at large has a lot of opinions on the best tools to</span> <span data-start="1270.08" data-end="1276.8">use, so does any individual given dev team, so, what we did to figure out what was going</span> <span data-start="1276.8" data-end="1282.92">to work best for us is hold group discussions, lunch-and-learns, different learning sessions</span> <span data-start="1282.92" data-end="1292.1">for anyone interested where we would discuss the pros and cons of CSS and JS solutions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1292.1" data-end="1296.27">When we could get some kind of agreement on which one seemed the most compelling, we would</span> <span data-start="1296.27" data-end="1302.79">actually try them out by building parts of the website for them, specifically our admin</span> <span data-start="1302.79" data-end="1307.46">section of our websites which were just pages that only employees can access for different</span> <span data-start="1307.46" data-end="1313.07">maintenance tasks but what it meant was we could use these things in a near real-world</span> <span data-start="1313.07" data-end="1314.98">proving ground.</span> <span data-start="1314.98" data-end="1322.28">So, for Behance, we ultimately decided on vue and CSS modules as our preferred tools,</span> <span data-start="1322.28" data-end="1327.16">and, once again, we continued to use a lot of the same techniques for implementing new</span> <span data-start="1327.16" data-end="1329.95">technology that we had done in the past.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1329.95" data-end="1334">We exclusively built if you Norwegians using these new tools and frameworks.</span> <span data-start="1334" data-end="1336.97">It meant they got to be in use immediately.</span> <span data-start="1336.97" data-end="1343.34">We rebuilt existing UI components such as buttons and inputs using these new tools and</span> <span data-start="1343.34" data-end="1349.6">frameworks alongside their existing implementations which could then be moved over to different</span> <span data-start="1349.6" data-end="1355.21">areas of the site as pose pages why updated to use vue as well.</span> <span data-start="1355.21" data-end="1362.33">Perhaps most critically, we did it behind feature flags, which is a set of code depending</span> <span data-start="1362.33" data-end="1370.78">on one user's code or another — it meant we could build everything we needed alongside</span> <span data-start="1370.78" data-end="1376.47">the existing website without according about interfering with it, while also still having</span> <span data-start="1376.47" data-end="1382.11">the ability to see all of this new stuff in action in a production environment, even before</span> <span data-start="1382.11" data-end="1384.7">it was ready for its public debut.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1384.7" data-end="1391.62">So, this actually brings us to where we are today: the website is not fully converted</span> <span data-start="1391.62" data-end="1397.36">to vue and CSS and JS, but we continue to follow the same practices as we update and</span> <span data-start="1397.36" data-end="1403.37">develop new features, and, actually, as an aside, although we are fairly recently into</span> <span data-start="1403.37" data-end="1409.6">our transition into vue, we've recently made the decision to switch to React which I don't</span> <span data-start="1409.6" data-end="1413.3">have time to go into now, but we would be happy to chat about with anyone after this</span> <span data-start="1413.3" data-end="1415.46">if you want.</span> <span data-start="1415.46" data-end="1422.44">So, if you look at the arc of CSS development over the last eight years, it has changed</span> <span data-start="1422.44" data-end="1423.44">drastically.</span> <span data-start="1423.44" data-end="1430.09">In 2010, our biggest concerns were around perfecting the slickest CSS gradient and getting</span> <span data-start="1430.09" data-end="1434.06">the website to look pixel-perfect to the mock-ups that the designers gave us.</span> <span data-start="1434.06" data-end="1439.88">By 2018, not only are we concerned with how the website looks, but we have to think about</span> <span data-start="1439.88" data-end="1445.97">how to optimise the code for the least repetition, for the best browser performance, for how</span> <span data-start="1445.97" data-end="1452.08">it functions in the most browsers and devices than I think we have ever had to deal with.</span> <span data-start="1452.08" data-end="1457.78">Since the CSS has become more closely intertwined to our JavaScript and markup in modern frameworks</span> <span data-start="1457.78" data-end="1465.22">than ever before, our concerns are no longer isolated to the CSS itself.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1465.22" data-end="1469.74">Because JavaScript technology and frameworks moves so fast too, we end up having a much</span> <span data-start="1469.74" data-end="1475.17">bigger and more robust ecosystem than we need to have a deeper understanding of.</span> <span data-start="1475.17" data-end="1478.14">Front-end development is hard.</span> <span data-start="1478.14" data-end="1480.75">Front-end engineering is hard.</span> <span data-start="1480.75" data-end="1485.49">But I encourage empathy in your decision-making and interactions around it.</span> <span data-start="1485.49" data-end="1490.88">Every technical choice is relative, and there is no right or wrong way to build a website.</span> <span data-start="1490.88" data-end="1498.19">So, in case the example so far didn't illustrate the beautiful, unique messy path that web</span> <span data-start="1498.19" data-end="1503.87">development can take, I'm going to air a little bit of Behance's dirty laundry in case any</span> <span data-start="1503.87" data-end="1508.72">of you have felt bad about the cancel to see in your codebase's closet, maybe this will</span> <span data-start="1508.72" data-end="1514.19">help you feel you're not alone, and hopefully, this is also therapeutic for me.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1514.19" data-end="1521.18">The figure one is we are still using three different templating engines across the website</span> <span data-start="1521.18" data-end="1526.809">which is a relic of the transitions we've made over time, and, depending on what page</span> <span data-start="1526.809" data-end="1531.26">you're viewing, you might be seeing all three in action all at once.</span> <span data-start="1531.26" data-end="1536.36">This so happens to be the first page you see when you log into our website.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1536.36" data-end="1542.33">I searched our codebase for some to-dos because I thought there could be fun stuff in there.</span> <span data-start="1542.33" data-end="1547.73">I came across this one on the head tag of our website.</span> <span data-start="1547.73" data-end="1549.69">"To do".</span> <span data-start="1549.69" data-end="1553.02">A lot of stuff included here which is unnecessary.</span> </p>
