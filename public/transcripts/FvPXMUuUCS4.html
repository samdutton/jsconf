data-end="287.97">the outline so when you develop a use</span> <span data-start="287.97" data-end="290.01">case you typically start with a goal</span> <span data-start="290.01" data-end="292.26">then

cases and</span> <span data-start="353.34" data-end="356.01">then these use cases define exactly what</span> <span data-start="356.01" data-end="359.37">we should be documenting but there's a</span> <span data-start="359.37" data-end="363.75">problem with that approach first it</span> <span data-start="363.75" data-end="366.539">requires a fundamental change in how our</span> <span
