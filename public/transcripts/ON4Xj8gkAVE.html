data-start="644.43" data-end="646.05">very beginning to grasp the general</span> <span data-start="646.05" data-end="650.34">concept how it works and we believe that</span> <span data-start="650.34" data-end="653.1">asking questions is a crucial part of</span> <span data-start="653.1" data-end="655.2">the learning process so there are no</span> <span data-start="655.2" data-end="657.72">stupid questions and we wanted to our</span> <span data-start="657.72" data-end="660.18">participants to feel as comfortable as</span> <span data-start="660.18" data-end="662.88">it's possible and when we were seeing</span> <span data-start="662.88" data-end="664.35">that there are some of them is</span> <span data-start="664.35" data-end="666.84">struggling along with some hard code</span> <span data-start="666.84" data-end="669.3">problem we try to approach them we are</span> <span data-start="669.3" data-end="672.45">our mentors to help them and we also</span> <span data-start="672.45" data-end="675.48">tried to create a friendly family like</span> <span data-start="675.48" data-end="678.21">atmosphere so we divided them into</span> <span data-start="678.21" data-end="681.42">smaller sub groups yes and of course we</span> <span data-start="681.42" data-end="684.06">have a problem with naming them again we</span> <span data-start="684.06" data-end="686.19">needed five groups so the first idea was</span> <span data-start="686.19" data-end="688.17">oh maybe we could use the the Brett</span> <span data-start="688.17" data-end="690.9">web-browser names but who would like to</span> <span data-start="690.9" data-end="692.82">join the internet explorer group well</span> <span data-start="692.82" data-end="695.73">probably not so many people so we did it</span> <span data-start="695.73" data-end="698.76">we decided to change the concept and we</span> <span data-start="698.76" data-end="701.61">pick the pantent score names for for the</span> <span data-start="701.61" data-end="705.24">year it was 2016 and it gave the</span> <span data-start="705.24" data-end="707.19">artistic vibe to our workshops and</span> <span data-start="707.19" data-end="708.9">people were really that identifying</span> <span data-start="708.9" data-end="711.06">themselves with the colors so girls were</span> <span data-start="711.06" data-end="712.94">in rose quartz and they were very happy</span> <span data-start="712.94" data-end="715.11">there was David who can see in the</span> <span data-start="715.11" data-end="717.19">middle he was in</span> <span data-start="717.19" data-end="719.53">serenity group so it was a lot of fun</span> <span data-start="719.53" data-end="722.65">and there's some friendship started</span> <span data-start="722.65" data-end="725.2">among her participants so it was really</span> <span data-start="725.2" data-end="729.58">worth it to try to act like like big</span> <span data-start="729.58" data-end="730.9">family and there were some</span> <span data-start="730.9" data-end="732.85">collaborations between people from</span> <span data-start="732.85" data-end="735.01">different professions so it became</span> <span data-start="735.01" data-end="737.08">really interesting to see them all also</span> <span data-start="737.08" data-end="739.06">after the workshops I guess that even</span> <span data-start="739.06" data-end="741.64">some ideas for startups were initiated</span> <span data-start="741.64" data-end="744.75">so we're like a stirrup hop as well and</span> <span data-start="744.75" data-end="747.55">people love competition so this is why</span> <span data-start="747.55" data-end="750.01">we wanted to incorporate the l-man into</span> <span data-start="750.01" data-end="752.2">our work ships as well and after each of</span> <span data-start="752.2" data-end="755.02">the classes we prepare a quiz on the</span> </p>

data-start="758.26" data-end="761.95">and there were it's very beneficial</span> <span data-start="761.95" data-end="764.29">because of two reasons the first one is</span> <span data-start="764.29" data-end="767.11">that people were revising the moderator</span> <span data-start="767.11" data-end="769.63">material so they were getting more and</span> <span data-start="769.63" data-end="771.31">more experience and the second one is</span> <span data-start="771.31" data-end="773.38">just more engaging fun and we can you</span> <span data-start="773.38" data-end="775.12">can see right now on the video if you</span> <span data-start="775.12" data-end="778.09">can see this if not I'm so sorry but it</span> <span data-start="778.09" data-end="780.4">is the is our Meetup and we're so where</span> <span data-start="780.4" data-end="782.41">people were playing the the quiz and it</span> <span data-start="782.41" data-end="786.79">was so exciting as you can see and our</span> <span data-start="786.79" data-end="790.03">success was to bring more designers</span> <span data-start="790.03" data-end="792.04">throughout the end well our focus on</span> <span data-start="792.04" data-end="795.49">aesthetics really paid off and the code</span> <span data-start="795.49" data-end="798.85">appears to be really good so new tool</span> <span data-start="798.85" data-end="801.55">it's used for designers and help them</span> <span data-start="801.55" data-end="803.29">communicate more efficiently with</span> <span data-start="803.29" data-end="806.35">developers yes and designers started to</span> <span data-start="806.35" data-end="808.47">like us which was very nice feeling and</span> <span data-start="808.47" data-end="810.7">thanks to that we were reviving too many</span> <span data-start="810.7" data-end="813.64">events for designers mainly so this is</span> <span data-start="813.64" data-end="815.47">the workshops we gave during element</span> <span data-start="815.47" data-end="816.61">talks this is one of the biggest</span> <span data-start="816.61"

another workshops</span> <span data-start="829.57" data-end="832.9">for artists and we're mentioning this</span> <span data-start="832.9" data-end="835.48">not to boast off but to give you the</span> <span data-start="835.48" data-end="837.31">sense that sometimes it's really good to</span> <span data-start="837.31" data-end="840.79">step out of your comfort zone and and</span> <span
