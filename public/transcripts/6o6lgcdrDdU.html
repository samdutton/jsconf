data-start="596.11" data-end="599.949">creativity because sometimes you just</span> <span data-start="599.949" data-end="602.29">don't create a drama frontstretch but</span> <span data-start="602.29" data-end="604.42">you can still work on your creativity</span> <span data-start="604.42" data-end="607.569">why why are you a developing it and also</span> <span data-start="607.569" data-end="610.809">other technical topics such as CSS</span> <span data-start="610.809" data-end="613.929">positioning HTML tags CSS selectors</span> <span data-start="613.929" data-end="617.05">several elements and sort of and classes</span> <span data-start="617.05" data-end="619.839">in CSS and I was thinking like I told</span> <span data-start="619.839" data-end="622.269">you so I'm glad more people also learned</span> <span data-start="622.269" data-end="624.85">something it was not only me they the</span> <span data-start="624.85" data-end="626.8">people who created these things they</span> <span data-start="626.8" data-end="630.249">actually learn something from x but</span> <span data-start="630.249" data-end="632.62">there is this other code which I think</span> <span data-start="632.62" data-end="634.12">it's something that people say</span> <span data-start="634.12" data-end="636.069">especially when I talk about drawings a</span> <span data-start="636.069" data-end="638.139">lot of people say well not a lot of</span> <span data-start="638.139" data-end="640.509">people but someone say well you need to</span> <span data-start="640.509" data-end="643.059">be super creative about it I cannot just</span> <span data-start="643.059" data-end="645.129">make a drawing I don't have an idea for</span> <span data-start="645.129" data-end="647.769">it well it's true if you want to create</span> <span data-start="647.769" data-end="650.17">something new you need to have some</span> <span data-start="650.17" data-end="651.67">creativity but it doesn't mean that</span> <span data-start="651.67" data-end="654.519">every time you create a drawing or a</span> <span data-start="654.519" data-end="658.269">game you need to use your own idea like</span> <span data-start="658.269" data-end="661.84">100% you can't create it</span> <span data-start="661.84" data-end="664.69">using things that already exists so for</span> <span data-start="664.69" data-end="667.81">example my chip is if you don't have an</span> <span data-start="667.81" data-end="670.27">idea but you want to practice the SS but</span> <span data-start="670.27" data-end="672.07">creating a drawing you can recreate</span> <span data-start="672.07" data-end="674.53">something that already exists I did this</span> <span data-start="674.53" data-end="677.86">for example one of my first drawings was</span> <span data-start="677.86" data-end="680.14">this black cat from Sailor Moon called</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="680.14" data-end="683.11">Luna and I want to draw her I don't know</span> <span data-start="683.11" data-end="684.91">why I really like Sailor Moon when I was</span> <span data-start="684.91" data-end="688.66">younger and I searched on Google and I</span> <span data-start="688.66" data-end="691.96">decided to draw probably her head with</span> <span data-start="691.96" data-end="696.1">the moon over it and I created this code</span> <span data-start="696.1" data-end="699.25">but it's actually animator her ears move</span> <span data-start="699.25" data-end="701.7">and I was pretty happy with the result</span> <span data-start="701.7" data-end="704.34">because well I learned those things</span> <span data-start="704.34" data-end="707.2">especially how to create her cheeks and</span> <span data-start="707.2" data-end="709.66">everything else the moon so I could</span> <span data-start="709.66" data-end="711.64">practice things that I would get that I</span> <span data-start="711.64" data-end="718">am going to use on my job and well after</span> <span data-start="718" data-end="720.22">this okay I gave a shape how to start</span> <span data-start="720.22" data-end="723.25">but maybe people just say creating a</span> <span data-start="723.25" data-end="725.26">drawing is not like creating a website I</span> <span data-start="725.26" data-end="728.35">don't know how I can start I mean how do</span> <span data-start="728.35" data-end="729.69">you start a thing like that</span> <span data-start="729.69" data-end="733.57">so I created a cycle that works for me</span> <span data-start="733.57" data-end="736.06">it's not a rule you can use it if you</span> <span data-start="736.06" data-end="738.1">want if you already have yours that's</span> <span data-start="738.1" data-end="739.9">great it'll be cool to talk about it</span> <span data-start="739.9" data-end="741.85">please like let's know other regions</span> <span data-start="741.85" data-end="744.49">would you be ready to drawing and the</span> <span data-start="744.49" data-end="747.34">first step is you get an image and you</span> <span data-start="747.34" data-end="750.01">break it into geometric forms I'm not a</span> <span data-start="750.01" data-end="752.8">very good drawing on the paper but if I</span> <span data-start="752.8" data-end="754.87">create something that's on my head I</span> <span data-start="754.87" data-end="757.54">draw it very badly on paper and then I</span> <span data-start="757.54" data-end="759.43">try to break it into geometric forms</span> <span data-start="759.43" data-end="762.37">because by breaking into geometric forms</span> <span data-start="762.37" data-end="764.62">because it's easier to create something</span> <span data-start="764.62" data-end="767.11">in CSS from the geometric forms because</span> <span data-start="767.11" data-end="768.85">probably when we're developing a website</span> <span data-start="768.85" data-end="771.58">we already created like a circle or a</span> <span data-start="771.58" data-end="774.16">square or even triangle so it's better</span> <span data-start="774.16" data-end="777.25">to break these things step number two is</span> <span data-start="777.25" data-end="779.86">to use HTML to represent pieces of the</span> <span data-start="779.86" data-end="782.41">drawing for example you have a drawing</span> <span data-start="782.41" data-end="785.23">that have a head you can call you can</span> <span data-start="785.23" data-end="787.59">have a jib with a class called head and</span> <span data-start="787.59" data-end="790.09">step number three which is the one that</span> <span data-start="790.09" data-end="792.88">takes most of the time is to style each</span> <span data-start="792.88" data-end="794.75">piece of the HTML</span> <span data-start="794.75" data-end="797.779">so this cycle works for me but as I said</span> <span data-start="797.779" data-end="801.74">it's not rule right and we're gonna talk</span> <span data-start="801.74" data-end="803.66">a little bit about each one of these</span> <span data-start="803.66" data-end="805.91">steps and how we can create this a more</span> <span data-start="805.91" data-end="810.259">practical way so I am gonna choose Dino</span> <span data-start="810.259" data-end="812.81">keke as an example this is gonna take</span> <span data-start="812.81" data-end="816.17">his head which I made only with CSS so</span> <span data-start="816.17" data-end="818.72">first we break it into geometric forms</span> <span data-start="818.72" data-end="822.98">so here it is this hat is made by this</span> <span data-start="822.98" data-end="825.259">element some of them are repeated so we</span> <span data-start="825.259" data-end="829.04">have a kind of oval and a rectangle and</span> <span data-start="829.04" data-end="830.959">that yellow thing which like I have</span> <span data-start="830.959" data-end="835.269">circled I that's his mouth and his teeth</span> <span data-start="835.269" data-end="838.61">for this I'm gonna use his body or his</span> <span data-start="838.61" data-end="841.67">head in it as an example so I created</span> <span data-start="841.67" data-end="843.649">this day of called body and well there</span> <span data-start="843.649" data-end="845.389">will be another one for the eye another</span> <span data-start="845.389" data-end="849.05">one for the mouth and so on then I'm</span> <span data-start="849.05" data-end="852.079">gonna style using CSS so I broke it into</span> <span data-start="852.079" data-end="854.48">children choose their magic forms the</span> <span data-start="854.48" data-end="857.959">first one is the body which is an green</span> <span data-start="857.959" data-end="860.689">oval with border-radius to make it looks</span> <span data-start="860.689" data-end="863.209">like this and then there is another step</span> <span data-start="863.209" data-end="865.399">which is his neck which I use it the</span> <span data-start="865.399" data-end="868.759">potato element after which is just a</span> <span data-start="868.759" data-end="872.18">rectangle and well when we put both of</span> <span data-start="872.18" data-end="874.519">them together they look like Dino Kiki's</span> <span data-start="874.519" data-end="878.87">neck or head and you can do that with</span> <span data-start="878.87" data-end="880.579">different things if it's a more complex</span> <span data-start="880.579" data-end="882.23">drawing you're probably gonna have to do</span> <span data-start="882.23" data-end="883.939">it over and over again and you're</span> <span data-start="883.939" data-end="885.259">probably gonna have to worry about</span> <span data-start="885.259" data-end="889.389">pixels and how to combine things so</span> <span data-start="889.389" data-end="891.649">differently for a website which you can</span> <span data-start="891.649" data-end="894.439">use flexbox or grid in this case when</span> <span data-start="894.439" data-end="897.139">it's like a drawing from an animal or a</span> <span data-start="897.139" data-end="900.86">person I tend to use like left and top</span> <span data-start="900.86" data-end="902.329">positions more observable positions</span> <span data-start="902.329" data-end="904.16">because the same way as if we were</span> <span data-start="904.16" data-end="905.93">driving on the paper it would think oh</span> <span data-start="905.93" data-end="908.959">this looks better like right here so the</span> <span data-start="908.959" data-end="911.3">same thing happens with CSS it's just</span> <span data-start="911.3" data-end="913.399">one pixel I for one pixel right can</span> <span data-start="913.399" data-end="915.17">change the drawing so that's why I use</span> <span data-start="915.17" data-end="919.699">absolute positioning okay I talked about</span> <span data-start="919.699" data-end="921.559">drawings you may have an idea Hotch</span> <span data-start="921.559" data-end="923">greater drawing hopefully you really</span> <span data-start="923" data-end="924.35">think about

data-start="1177.25" data-end="1179.32">call card front which is the place that</span> <span data-start="1179.32" data-end="1182.41">the stars go this each of one of the</span> <span data-start="1182.41" data-end="1185.559">stars it's a see HTML chip it's just</span> <span data-start="1185.559" data-end="1188.77">like a white point like two pixels I</span> <span data-start="1188.77" data-end="1191.7">think with some opacity reduced</span> <span data-start="1191.7" data-end="1194.22">and then there is the card back which is</span> <span data-start="1194.22" data-end="1197.73">just a planet and the text of the planet</span> <span data-start="1197.73" data-end="1200.7">so both of them are on the label and I</span> <span data-start="1200.7" data-end="1202.679">just changed their visibility according</span> <span data-start="1202.679" data-end="1206.519">to the checkboxes state so let's think a</span> <span data-start="1206.519" data-end="1208.529">little bit more about the game logic and</span> <span data-start="1208.529" data-end="1210.72">this is something I just realized when I</span> <span data-start="1210.72" data-end="1212.61">when I was creating the game and I think</span> <span data-start="1212.61" data-end="1214.799">it's really cool it's allowed me present</span> <span data-start="1214.799" data-end="1217.2">this year I really like cycles so this</span> <span data-start="1217.2" data-end="1218.7">is the last one from the presentation</span> <span data-start="1218.7" data-end="1220.769">but the first thing that happens when we</span> <span data-start="1220.769" data-end="1222.99">start playing with the car is that you</span> <span data-start="1222.99" data-end="1225.179">click over the car when you click on it</span> <span data-start="1225.179" data-end="1227.309">they change both the checkbox we've</span> <span data-start="1227.309" data-end="1230.309">changed it to stay so if it was not</span> <span data-start="1230.309" data-end="1232.169">check it you can check it and vice versa</span> <span data-start="1232.169" data-end="1236.94">and then it will change the visible part</span> <span data-start="1236.94" data-end="1239.7">on the car but let's think a little bit</span> <span data-start="1239.7" data-end="1241.799">more about the step number two about the</span> <span data-start="1241.799" data-end="1244.529">check box so there are different states</span> <span data-start="1244.529" data-end="1246.33">they're different phases actually</span> <span data-start="1246.33" data-end="1248.909">there's the first one when the when you</span> <span data-start="1248.909" data-end="1250.889">start playing the card and all the cards</span> <span data-start="1250.889" data-end="1253.59">are with the Stars showing then you can</span> <span data-start="1253.59" data-end="1254.94">click over it and it's going to show the</span> <span data-start="1254.94" data-end="1256.95">planet and also there is the third one</span> <span data-start="1256.95" data-end="1259.049">which is when you click all of the cards</span> <span data-start="1259.049" data-end="1263.639">and you won the game so the case number</span> <span data-start="1263.639" data-end="1266.58">one it's when the checkbox get becomes</span> <span data-start="1266.58" data-end="1270.51">check it this is the cool thing if you</span> <span data-start="1270.51" data-end="1272.19">look at the code and you think how to</span> <span data-start="1272.19" data-end="1274.62">create a game you'd ended up trying to</span> <span data-start="1274.62" data-end="1277.08">use try to use conditionals such as a</span> <span data-start="1277.08" data-end="1279.929">else but there is no such thing in the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1279.929" data-end="1282.779">CSS so how do we create a similar</span> <span data-start="1282.779" data-end="1286.62">behavior if we don't have an if in CSS</span> <span data-start="1286.62" data-end="1288.659">because we want you click on the card</span> <span data-start="1288.659" data-end="1291.059">and if the stars are visible we're gonna</span> <span data-start="1291.059" data-end="1293.519">hide the Stars and show the earth or</span> <span data-start="1293.519" data-end="1296.909">another planet so here's the code I use</span> <span data-start="1296.909" data-end="1300.45">it to simulate this if which is I'm</span> <span data-start="1300.45" data-end="1303.419">gonna when the check box first is</span> <span data-start="1303.419" data-end="1307.139">checking then I'm gonna show the part of</span> <span data-start="1307.139" data-end="1310.35">the card which called card front so I'm</span> <span data-start="1310.35" data-end="1312.299">hiding this sorry I'm gonna hide this</span> <span data-start="1312.299" data-end="1314.34">part the card front which are the stars</span> <span data-start="1314.34" data-end="1318.659">and then in the same case which means if</span> <span data-start="1318.659" data-end="1320.429">the checkbox is checked</span> <span data-start="1320.429" data-end="1323.669">I'm gonna show the card back part which</span> <span data-start="1323.669" data-end="1325.3">are the planets witches</span> <span data-start="1325.3" data-end="1329.5">or and then there's the keys number two</span> <span data-start="1329.5" data-end="1331.39">which is the opposite it's actually</span> <span data-start="1331.39" data-end="1333.73">going back to its isness initial state</span> <span data-start="1333.73" data-end="1336.85">which is else if the earth is visible or</span> <span data-start="1336.85" data-end="1338.8">the stars are not visible I'm gonna hide</span> <span data-start="1338.8" data-end="1342.79">earth and display the Stars which is</span> <span data-start="1342.79" data-end="1344.62">just going back to the original state</span> <span data-start="1344.62" data-end="1347.41">which is not showing the card back which</span> <span data-start="1347.41" data-end="1350.65">is earth and then display in the card</span> <span data-start="1350.65" data-end="1355.21">fronts which are the stars and the case</span> <span data-start="1355.21" data-end="1357.91">number three which is when you won the</span> <span data-start="1357.91" data-end="1360.37">game you select all the cards you did</span> <span data-start="1360.37" data-end="1362.23">right you'll play the memory game and</span> <span data-start="1362.23" data-end="1365.5">then both of the planets the similar</span> <span data-start="1365.5" data-end="1367.33">planets are visible in this case earth</span> <span data-start="1367.33" data-end="1369.49">number one is visible and number two is</span> <span data-start="1369.49" data-end="1371.53">visible then I'm just gonna make the</span> <span data-start="1371.53" data-end="1373.33">background darker and include a small</span> <span data-start="1373.33" data-end="1377.98">animation and here it is so I think this</span> <span data-start="1377.98" data-end="1381.22">is school because when I look about I'm</span> <span data-start="1381.22" data-end="1384.22">gonna explain this what I can simulate</span> <span data-start="1384.22" data-end="1387.69">is like well if oryx's check it and</span> <span data-start="1387.69" data-end="1390.94">number two is check it then I'm going to</span> <span data-start="1390.94" data-end="1392.92">change the background color of the card</span> <span data-start="1392.92" data-end="1397.36">back so I think when we are using CSS on</span> <span data-start="1397.36" data-end="1399.58">our jobs creating website business</span> <span data-start="1399.58" data-end="1402.07">applications sometimes if we don't stop</span> <span data-start="1402.07" data-end="1405.13">and look at the selectors like this we</span> <span data-start="1405.13" data-end="1407.83">just keep doing our CSS and we have so</span> <span data-start="1407.83" data-end="1410.35">many things sure it is the code clean am</span> <span data-start="1410.35" data-end="1413.11">i using new technologies and it's pretty</span> <span data-start="1413.11" data-end="1415.63">cool to experiment and look at the CSS</span> <span data-start="1415.63" data-end="1419.23">in another way I think it's good and</span> <span data-start="1419.23" data-end="1420.7">you're probably gonna use that on work</span> <span data-start="1420.7" data-end="1422.95">later maybe there is one way that you're</span> <span data-start="1422.95" data-end="1424.48">gonna need to use the selectors or</span> <span data-start="1424.48" data-end="1426.43">create something similar to an if and</span> <span data-start="1426.43" data-end="1428.65">maybe you just haven't thought a lot</span> <span data-start="1428.65" data-end="1430.63">about it yet you just didn't give you</span> <span data-start="1430.63" data-end="1434.83">time to do that and well I created this</span> <span data-start="1434.83" data-end="1437.98">game initially because I wanted to use</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1437.98" data-end="1440.17">CSS grid and I was working a lot with</span> <span data-start="1440.17" data-end="1442.45">sass but I really wanted to use he</span> <span data-start="1442.45" data-end="1444.64">assess custom properties so there are a</span> <span data-start="1444.64" data-end="1446.65">list of few things that I wanted to</span> <span data-start="1446.65" data-end="1448.6">learn by creating this game but after I</span> <span data-start="1448.6" data-end="1450.43">created it and I started looking at the</span> <span data-start="1450.43" data-end="1454.08">code okay we have a notification</span> <span data-start="1454.09" data-end="1456.67">well I realized I learned more things</span> <span data-start="1456.67" data-end="1462.25">than I was expecting so here's here's a</span> <span data-start="1462.25" data-end="1465.28">list so as I told you CSS grid because</span> <span data-start="1465.28" data-end="1467.32">that was the main point of creating this</span> <span data-start="1467.32" data-end="1471.64">game and CSS custom properties but I</span> <span data-start="1471.64" data-end="1473.17">ended up learning more about the</span> <span data-start="1473.17" data-end="1475.84">limitations often for checkbox and do</span> </p>
