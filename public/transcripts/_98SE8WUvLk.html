data-start="298.75" data-end="301.36">opinion even if you like it like that</span> <span data-start="301.36" data-end="304.84">the which is fine the point is that you</span> <span data-start="304.84" data-end="305.89">can't control it</span> <span data-start="305.89" data-end="307.63">the viewport is controlling it and</span> <span data-start="307.63" data-end="309.7">sometimes it will be snug to

data-end="414.24">really annoying hard to get perfect a</span> <span data-start="414.24" data-end="417.28">more reliable and easier fix is to just</span> <span data-start="417.28" data-end="419.65">turn on flexbox for each field wrapper</span> <span data-start="419.65" data-end="422.68">because flex items across a row are</span> <span data-start="422.68" data-end="424.87">equal
