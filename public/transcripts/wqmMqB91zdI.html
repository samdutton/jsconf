it</span> <span data-start="460.009" data-end="466.779">not work this well one okay Photoshop</span> <span data-start="466.779" data-end="468.4">why it does not work</span> <span data-start="468.4"

<p><span data-start="480.87" data-end="482.85">I do not know why this would happen one</span> <span data-start="482.85" data-end="512.23">moment this is a nightmare</span> <span data-start="512.24"

jump</span> <span data-start="543" data-end="545.67">into the code so I can make it not um I</span> <span data-start="545.67" data-end="547.65">can make it stop looking at those other</span> <span

data-end="554.76">something here what it's doing is it's</span> <span data-start="554.76" data-end="556.29">doing voice recognition and then in</span> <span data-start="556.29" data-end="558.3">theory that would have it would have</span> <span data-start="558.3" data-end="559.56">understood me saying okay Photoshop and</span> <span data-start="559.56" data-end="561.03">then it would have done like
