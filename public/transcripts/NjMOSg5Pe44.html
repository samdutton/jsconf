<p><span data-start="832.829" data-end="835.05">NSA official declared that they have to</span> <span data-start="835.05" data-end="837.54">snoop on people because this is the only</span> <span

data-end="854.55">byproduct but it's certainly not the</span> <span data-start="854.55" data-end="857.22">major operation so this is just an</span> <span data-start="857.22" data-end="861.029">excuse and there's this imbalance we are</span> <span data-start="861.029" data-end="862.769">supposed to be completely transparent</span> <span data-start="862.769" data-end="866.069">while at the same time agencies are</span> <span data-start="866.069" data-end="868.29">allowed to have secrets and I think this</span> <span data-start="868.29" data-end="872.069">just doesn't work out I'm yeah I would</span> <span data-start="872.069" data-end="874.44">say they should have their secrets</span> <span data-start="874.44" data-end="876.87">because this protects the operation of</span> <span data-start="876.87" data-end="879.029">agencies but at the same time we should</span> <span data-start="879.029" data-end="882.149">be allowed to have our secrets too and I</span> <span data-start="882.149" data-end="884.43">want us to move back to something more</span> <span data-start="884.43" data-end="887.16">of mutual trust so by default the</span> <span data-start="887.16" data-end="888.93">government should trust its citizens</span> <span data-start="888.93" data-end="891.41">citizens and not the other way around</span> <span data-start="891.41" data-end="896.839">and this is really scary some German</span> <span data-start="896.839" data-end="899.579">politician actually claimed in public</span> <span data-start="899.579" data-end="901.56">that he believes that security is more</span> <span data-start="901.56" data-end="903.6">important than our personal freedom and</span> <span data-start="903.6" data-end="906.92">again I think this is because</span> <span data-start="906.92" data-end="909.66">your personal freedom is some form of</span> <span data-start="909.66" data-end="911.49">security and I think if they take this</span> <span data-start="911.49" data-end="913.68">away then there can be no security at</span> <span data-start="913.68" data-end="918.75">all now let me give you a quick</span> <span data-start="918.75" data-end="920.19">excursion of something that would</span> <span data-start="920.19" data-end="922.8">totally solve this for good and it's</span> <span data-start="922.8" data-end="925.16">called homomorphic encryption a</span> <span data-start="925.16" data-end="928.62">homomorphism is a mathematical function</span> <span data-start="928.62" data-end="931.26">that maps from one structure G to</span> <span data-start="931.26" data-end="933.959">another structure H it implies two</span> <span data-start="933.959" data-end="937.769">operations in GH and the clue of it is</span> <span data-start="937.769" data-end="939.899">that applying the function to the</span> <span data-start="939.899" data-end="943.11">combination of those two elements will</span> <span data-start="943.11" data-end="944.88">yield the same result as applying the</span> <span data-start="944.88" data-end="946.199">function to the elements individually</span> <span data-start="946.199" data-end="949.62">and then combining it pretty complicated</span> <span data-start="949.62" data-end="952.82">so let me give you an example</span> <span data-start="952.82" data-end="955.86">so for simplicity let's say our a</span> <span data-start="955.86" data-end="959.22">homomorphism is 1 over X and G H are the</span> <span data-start="959.22" data-end="961.11">same thing the real numbers as you know</span> <span data-start="961.11" data-end="965.04">them and the two operations are actually</span> <span data-start="965.04" data-end="968.25">also the same they're the multiplication</span> <span data-start="968.25" data-end="970.89">in real numbers so if you just simply</span> <span data-start="970.89" data-end="973.29">write out the definition then f apply to</span> <span data-start="973.29" data-end="977.52">a times b is 1 over a times B which by</span> <span data-start="977.52" data-end="979.8">the loss of multiplication is 1 over 8</span> <span data-start="979.8" data-end="982.38">times 1 over B and this is actually the</span> <span data-start="982.38" data-end="985.05">right hand side of the definition so 1</span> <span data-start="985.05" data-end="989.16">over X is a homomorphism we can find</span> <span data-start="989.16" data-end="991.95">this in crypto to RSA some example for</span> <span data-start="991.95" data-end="994.83">this as a quick recap RSA encryption is</span> <span data-start="994.83" data-end="997.2">defined as having a public key e a</span> <span data-start="997.2" data-end="999.69">modulus m and then the encryption is</span> <span data-start="999.69" data-end="1002.84">just taking X to the e and then taking</span> <span data-start="1002.84" data-end="1007.82">it modulo M if we look at this using</span> <span data-start="1007.82" data-end="1009.89">multiplication again then this will</span> <span data-start="1009.89" data-end="1011.75">again be home morphisms so the</span> <span data-start="1011.75" data-end="1016.55">encryption of X 1 times X 2 as x 1 x x 2</span> <span data-start="1016.55" data-end="1019.22">to the e by the loss of exponentiation</span> <span data-start="1019.22" data-end="1022.43">we can pull in the exponent there and by</span> <span data-start="1022.43" data-end="1025.03">loss of modular arithmetic we can apply</span> <span data-start="1025.03" data-end="1027.76">modulo operation individually and then</span> <span data-start="1027.76" data-end="1030.11">again we have the right hand side of the</span> <span data-start="1030.11" data-end="1032.87">definition but if we try the same thing</span> <span data-start="1032.87" data-end="1035.63">for addition it won't work out because</span> <span data-start="1035.63" data-end="1038.06">there's no law that would allow us to do</span> <span data-start="1038.06" data-end="1042.98">the last line there so this holds true</span> <span data-start="1042.98" data-end="1044.959">in general it's pretty easy to find a</span> <span data-start="1044.959" data-end="1047.209">homomorphism for one of the operations</span> <span data-start="1047.209" data-end="1049.76">so in mathematical fields usually have</span> <span data-start="1049.76" data-end="1053.99">two operations for example addition and</span> <span data-start="1053.99" data-end="1057.53">multiplication and you find something</span> <span data-start="1057.53" data-end="1059.09">for one of the operations but it's</span> <span data-start="1059.09" data-end="1061.04">pretty hard to find something for both</span> <span data-start="1061.04" data-end="1062.96">and this would be called fully</span> <span data-start="1062.96" data-end="1066.68">homomorphic encryption and the</span> <span data-start="1066.68" data-end="1068.75">definition there is just extended by</span> <span data-start="1068.75" data-end="1070.67">another operation so you look at two</span> <span data-start="1070.67" data-end="1073.84">operations at the same time and this</span> <span data-start="1073.84" data-end="1077.68">equation has to hold for both operations</span> <span data-start="1077.68" data-end="1080.75">now you might ask yourselves why is this</span> <span data-start="1080.75" data-end="1083.75">so important well it preserves the ring</span> <span data-start="1083.75" data-end="1085.059">structure of the</span> <span data-start="1085.059" data-end="1088.899">original structures to put this in</span> <span data-start="1088.899" data-end="1091.12">simpler terms think about it as it</span> <span data-start="1091.12" data-end="1094.299">allows you to do algorithms unencrypted</span> <span data-start="1094.299" data-end="1097.779">data yielding encrypted results and if</span> <span data-start="1097.779" data-end="1101.71">you decrypt it again it makes sense so a</span> <span data-start="1101.71" data-end="1104.11">good example would be Google search so</span> <span data-start="1104.11" data-end="1106.21">if we had something like fully</span> <span data-start="1106.21" data-end="1108.37">homomorphic encryption then we could</span> <span data-start="1108.37" data-end="1111.429">actually put in our search terms ghoul</span> <span data-start="1111.429" data-end="1113.649">would get this encrypted would perform</span> <span data-start="1113.649" data-end="1115.72">the algorithm would produce a result</span> <span data-start="1115.72" data-end="1118.72">which is still encrypted and only you</span> <span data-start="1118.72" data-end="1120.429">can decrypt the result and it makes</span> <span data-start="1120.429" data-end="1122.289">sense and Google won't learn anything</span> <span data-start="1122.289" data-end="1125.98">about your search of course this can be</span> <span data-start="1125.98" data-end="1129.539">abused but i think the advantages are</span> <span data-start="1129.539" data-end="1132.129">outweigh the disadvantages and this</span> <span data-start="1132.129" data-end="1134.86">would really give us privacy the looks</span> <span data-start="1134.86" data-end="1137.71">and the question has been for a long</span> <span data-start="1137.71" data-end="1139.72">time so many people have claimed that</span> <span data-start="1139.72" data-end="1141.58">this is not possible at all but then</span> <span data-start="1141.58" data-end="1143.95">last year this guy made a major</span> <span data-start="1143.95" data-end="1145.95">breakthrough and actually found a</span> <span data-start="1145.95" data-end="1148.86">function that just allows us to do this</span> <span data-start="1148.86" data-end="1153.7">but it's still rocket science and it</span> <span data-start="1153.7" data-end="1157.45">won't be available in

a major step</span> <span data-start="1357.92" data-end="1360.68">forward even if as we saw at the</span> <span data-start="1360.68" data-end="1362.21">beginning there's no real difference</span> <span data-start="1362.21" data-end="1364.67">between applications side crypto and</span> <span data-start="1364.67" data-end="1367.19">clients are correct or right now I still</span> <span data-start="1367.19" data-end="1370.97">think it's a matter of trust so even if</span> <span data-start="1370.97" data-end="1373.25">you do the crypto on your local machine</span> <span data-start="1373.25" data-end="1376.55">using local tools only you still have to</span> <span data-start="1376.55" data-end="1380.99">apply trust at some point because who</span> <span data-start="1380.99" data-end="1382.76">tells you that your browser or your</span> <span data-start="1382.76" data-end="1385.16">operating system is actually secure have</span> <span data-start="1385.16" data-end="1386.75">you looked through all of the source</span> <span data-start="1386.75" data-end="1391.04">code have you compiled it yourself and I</span> <span data-start="1391.04" data-end="1392.72">think this is a chicken and egg problem</span> <span data-start="1392.72" data-end="1395.99">because of course you can do HCBS</span> <span data-start="1395.99" data-end="1398.72">downloads you can put a signature on the</span> <span data-start="1398.72" data-end="1400.4">package you can verify that signature</span> <span data-start="1400.4" data-end="1403.22">but in order to verify the signature you</span> <span data-start="1403.22" data-end="1405.08">again need some piece of software so you</span> <span data-start="1405.08" data-end="1406.79">would have to do the whole verification</span> <span data-start="1406.79" data-end="1409.429">process over again and this yeah it's</span> <span data-start="1409.429" data-end="1412.7">just not solvable and that's why I</span> <span data-start="1412.7" data-end="1415.07">believe that clients are crypto using</span> <span data-start="1415.07" data-end="1418.1">something like them w3c API is still is</span> <span data-start="1418.1" data-end="1420.65">an improvement because mostly it doesn't</span> <span data-start="1420.65" data-end="1422.96">allow the app to use the keys anymore</span> <span data-start="1422.96" data-end="1425.3">they can't look into the keys they don't</span> <span data-start="1425.3" data-end="1428.54">see our passwords and so it's really an</span> <span data-start="1428.54" data-end="1431.84">improvement but a problem with this API</span> <span data-start="1431.84" data-end="1434.42">is it takes all of this code just to</span> <span data-start="1434.42" data-end="1438.44">encrypt a little piece of data and this</span> <span data-start="1438.44" data-end="1441.29">just calls for ya implementation errors</span> <span data-start="1441.29" data-end="1444.38">and unfortunately it's a low-level API</span> <span data-start="1444.38" data-end="1447.29">like openssl which gives you full</span> <span data-start="1447.29" data-end="1449.84">control which is a good thing but it</span> <span data-start="1449.84" data-end="1452.929">also gives you full possibility to shoot</span> <span data-start="1452.929" data-end="1456.62">yourself in the foot and worst of all</span> <span data-start="1456.62" data-end="1459.77">there's no security false so you have to</span> <span data-start="1459.77" data-end="1461.54">figure out yourself what works and what</span> <span data-start="1461.54" data-end="1464.75">doesn't and I'd rather want something</span> <span data-start="1464.75" data-end="1466.88">like this which is easy to use high</span> <span data-start="1466.88"
