<p><span data-start="14.16" data-end="15.16">[ Applause ] MARLEY: Thank you.</span> <span data-start="15.16" data-end="16.16">And hello.</span> <span data-start="16.16" data-end="17.16">Today I'll be talking to you about the case for augmented reality on the web.</span> <span data-start="17.16" data-end="18.16">I'm Marley Rafson.</span> <span data-start="18.16" data-end="19.21">I'm a software engineer at Google on the web XR team.</span> <span data-start="19.21" data-end="21.47">My Twitter handle is mprafson.</span> <span data-start="21.47" data-end="25.87">Love to talk letter.</span> <span data-start="25.87" data-end="31.68">The two things today with the web and augmented reality.</span> <span data-start="31.68" data-end="36.25">I believe that the combination of these two things, the whole is greater than the sum</span> <span data-start="36.25" data-end="38">of its parts situation.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="38" data-end="43.579">I think that the web will gain from augmented reality, and things that augmented reality</span> <span data-start="43.579" data-end="46.7">will certainly gain from the web.</span> <span data-start="46.7" data-end="55.739">So, to begin, let's start by getting everyone on the same page and let's define augmented</span> <span data-start="55.739" data-end="56.739">reality.</span> <span data-start="56.739" data-end="61.289">It's the mixing of computergenerated content with the real world.</span> <span data-start="61.289" data-end="66.75">To me, we can now add contextualized information into the world around us.</span> <span data-start="66.75" data-end="71.75">So, for example, you're trying to make a coffee at the coffee machine, and you have the instructions</span> <span data-start="71.75" data-end="74.78">overlaid on top of the coffee machine.</span> <span data-start="74.78" data-end="82.53">And implication of augmented reality is you can interact with 3D content in a 3D space.</span> <span data-start="82.53" data-end="87.17">So, the canonical example would be you're trying to buy a piece of furniture and you're</span> <span data-start="87.17" data-end="91.16">able to put it into your room before you buy it.</span> <span data-start="91.16" data-end="93.84">Let's look at what augmented reality looks like today.</span> <span data-start="93.84" data-end="96.2">Today this is smartphone AR.</span> <span data-start="96.2" data-end="100.14">This is run using a smart phone and basically has some understanding of the world around</span> <span data-start="100.14" data-end="104.56">it allowing virtual content to interact with that world too.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="104.56" data-end="108.07">We have augmented reality on headsets.</span> <span data-start="108.07" data-end="111.73">Your hands would be free, and you would be free to interact with the content using your</span> <span data-start="111.73" data-end="112.85">hands.</span> <span data-start="112.85" data-end="118.509">And the third example that I think is less talked about, but I find compelling is audiobased</span> <span data-start="118.509" data-end="120.24">augmented reality.</span> <span data-start="120.24" data-end="123.02">You're seeing Bose frames.</span> <span data-start="123.02" data-end="127.56">It's a pair of sunglasses that have speakers that shoot audio into your ears.</span> <span data-start="127.56" data-end="135.98">With this example, with audio AR, you would have that experience where you're at a coffee</span> <span data-start="135.98" data-end="137.95">machine and you don't know what to do.</span> <span data-start="137.95" data-end="141.129">But instead of seeing the information, it's read off to you.</span> <span data-start="141.129" data-end="146.2">And it I would also like to say if you hear me say AR, that's just short for augmented</span> <span data-start="146.2" data-end="148.08">reality.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="148.08" data-end="153.029">So, this talk, as I mentioned, it's also about the web.</span> <span data-start="153.029" data-end="156.019">Let's talk about where those two things intersect.</span> <span data-start="156.019" data-end="158.439">That's what we'll call the immersive web.</span> <span data-start="158.439" data-end="164.109">And the immersive web is the use of augmented reality, virtual reality and other 3D technologies</span> <span data-start="164.109" data-end="165.51">on the web.</span> <span data-start="165.51" data-end="167.079">It's this whole spectrum of things.</span> <span data-start="167.079" data-end="172.379">It can be more augmented reality than virtual reality and doesn't quite matter.</span> <span data-start="172.379" data-end="176.209">And you'll hear me say XR.</span> <span data-start="176.209" data-end="178.43">And that really just stands for wild card reality.</span> <span data-start="178.43" data-end="184.699">So, it could be virtual, it could be augmented reality and some combination of the two.</span> <span data-start="184.699" data-end="188.15">So, today what the immersive web looks like is something like this.</span> <span data-start="188.15" data-end="193.559">We have seen progressive enhancements of sites we use every day.</span> <span data-start="193.559" data-end="199.19">The left two examples, Facebook 3D posts and they're incorporated directly into the newsfeed.</span> <span data-start="199.19" data-end="203.81">So, that first example is a 3D model that you can interact with on the newsfeed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="203.81" data-end="210.379">The second is using portrait mode depth information to delightfully play with these photos with</span> <span data-start="210.379" data-end="212.859">a bit of depth added.</span> <span data-start="212.859" data-end="218.689">And the third example is from Wikipedia who about a year ago started supporting 3D models</span> <span data-start="218.689" data-end="220.599">in their articles.</span> <span data-start="220.599" data-end="226.769">So, if you're not a large company and you don't have a whole engineering team dedicated</span> <span data-start="226.769" data-end="231.849">to building this model viewing experience, there's a solution to that now.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="231.849" data-end="239.62">So, recently Google, a team at Google open sourced a web component for viewing models.</span> <span data-start="239.62" data-end="241.099">It's called Model viewer.</span> <span data-start="241.099" data-end="242.579">It's fantastic.</span> <span data-start="242.579" data-end="246.469">Using HTML, you can add into your side around it.</span> <span data-start="246.469" data-end="250.4">That's an example with the astronaut which we know and love.</span> <span data-start="250.4" data-end="254.569">And something that's great about the modelviewer team is they're thinking about accessibility</span> <span data-start="254.569" data-end="255.569">early.</span> <span data-start="255.569" data-end="262.21">So, they've already incorporated alt text into the component.</span> <span data-start="262.21" data-end="266.699">So, let's say you have these 3D models on your website.</span> <span data-start="266.699" data-end="269.87">How do you actually get it into augmented reality?</span> <span data-start="269.87" data-end="276.639">So, right now what we've seen is implementations of native system viewers that allow for augmented</span> <span data-start="276.639" data-end="277.71">reality.</span> <span data-start="277.71" data-end="282.24">This is not running in a web browser, but this is slick and tight integration with the</span> <span data-start="282.24" data-end="283.24">web.</span> <span data-start="283.24" data-end="288.31">So, you would have this search result, so it's integrated into search with Google.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="288.31" data-end="294.18">So, you can tap the button and then it intents into this native viewer and then you can place</span> <span data-start="294.18" data-end="302.27">it in augmented reality is the same exists on iOS and it's similarly intense.</span> <span data-start="302.27" data-end="307.83">And so, what I just said there was that we're using native viewers to do augmented reality.</span> <span data-start="307.83" data-end="312.99">But we would like to do that in the browser itself.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="312.99" data-end="317.58">That's where the WebXR device API comes in.</span> <span data-start="317.58" data-end="319.99">It exposes lowlevel sensory information.</span> <span data-start="319.99" data-end="325.27">So, the camera pose, if you can place an object on the floor.</span> <span data-start="325.27" data-end="326.669">And that's under development.</span> <span data-start="326.669" data-end="329.289">It's open so we can all contribute to it.</span> <span data-start="329.289" data-end="334.28">And you can find that on GitHub.</span> <span data-start="334.28" data-end="338.25">And with those examples that I just shared, that's all talking about bringing immersive</span> <span data-start="338.25" data-end="340.349">technologies into the web.</span> <span data-start="340.349" data-end="343.909">But we can also bring the web into immersive technologies.</span> <span data-start="343.909" data-end="346.969">Two examples of XR browsers.</span> <span data-start="346.969" data-end="355.37">And you will see the Helio browser placing images into the world around you and then</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="355.37" data-end="359.56">Firefox Reality, which is a VR browser.</span> <span data-start="359.56" data-end="363.77">So, I think the immersive web today is fantastic.</span> <span data-start="363.77" data-end="368.59">I think it's adding information, it's making it more delightful to browse the web.</span> <span data-start="368.59" data-end="373.11">But when we're developing these technologies, it's important to see where we're going next</span> <span data-start="373.11" data-end="376.199">and to start thinking about that earlier rather than later.</span> <span data-start="376.199" data-end="380.88">So, when I think about a future of augmented reality, I start by thinking about how can</span> <span data-start="380.88" data-end="382.61">this assist me?</span> <span data-start="382.61" data-end="387.919">So, I think about maybe I'm leaving work one day and I'm wearing these lightweight AR goggles,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="387.919" data-end="389.199">I'm walking down the street.</span> <span data-start="389.199" data-end="390.61">I'm looking for dinner.</span> <span data-start="390.61" data-end="398.18">So, as I look at the restaurants on the street, I'm seeing Yelp data populating with the stars</span> <span data-start="398.18" data-end="401.07">rating and the types of menu.</span> <span data-start="401.07" data-end="403.81">And maybe I also want to see photos of the food.</span> <span data-start="403.81" data-end="407.61">So, Instagram information's coming too.</span> <span data-start="407.61" data-end="408.659">And I like Pokemon.</span> <span data-start="408.659" data-end="413.78">So, maybe while I'm doing all of this, I'm catching Pokemon, playing Pokemon Go.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="413.78" data-end="418.56">And when I get to the train station, I'll have information populated for me telling</span> <span data-start="418.56" data-end="421.949">me which train to take so I can get home fastest.</span> <span data-start="421.949" data-end="427.08">And as I mentioned earlier, I probably don't want to be restricted to doing this on just</span> <span data-start="427.08" data-end="428.74">one headset.</span> <span data-start="428.74" data-end="432.02">Maybe I want headphones another day from a different company.</span> <span data-start="432.02" data-end="433.87">Who knows?</span> <span data-start="433.87" data-end="436.08">Maybe I just want to use my smartphone.</span> <span data-start="436.08" data-end="441.3">So, when I'm thinking of this vision of augmented reality going forward, I start to see some</span> <span data-start="441.3" data-end="444.689">interesting things and patterns that I would like to call out here.</span> <span data-start="444.689" data-end="448.52">So, the first is that is inherently uses web content.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="448.52" data-end="453.52">I want access to all the things that I already use when I'm browsing the web.</span> <span data-start="453.52" data-end="460.069">Another thing is it's this really interesting composition of different types of information.</span> <span data-start="460.069" data-end="462.52">So, that could be models or 2D pages.</span> <span data-start="462.52" data-end="467.849">And we're going to have to interact with them in a way that's esthetic and delightful and</span> <span data-start="467.849" data-end="470.08">still makes me want to use it.</span> <span data-start="470.08" data-end="474.969">And onethird trend that I start to see it we're really interacting with the world around</span> <span data-start="474.969" data-end="475.969">us.</span> <span data-start="475.969" data-end="481.169">I could be places information on to a building or on to a tree or on passing by cars.</span> <span data-start="481.169" data-end="487.58">And so, when I start to think about this vision that I want and where we are today, which</span> <span data-start="487.58" data-end="492.919">is mostly placing 3D models, I think there is a lot of work to go.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="492.919" data-end="497.6">And where I see a lot of that work coming into play is with a user agent.</span> <span data-start="497.6" data-end="505.629">So, the definition from W3C of a user agent is a user agent is any software that retrieves,</span> <span data-start="505.629" data-end="509.599">renders and facilitates end user interaction with web content.</span> <span data-start="509.599" data-end="513.32">So, today that's usually just your browser.</span> <span data-start="513.32" data-end="518.62">So, you get a lot of things when you're browsing using any of the modern browsers.</span> <span data-start="518.62" data-end="520.81">It could be Chrome, it could be Firefox.</span> <span data-start="520.81" data-end="522.51">It helps you do safe browsing.</span> <span data-start="522.51" data-end="527.3">It renders the HTML pages for you and things like that.</span> <span data-start="527.3" data-end="533.05">So, to understand how a user agent will play out with this added dimension for augmented</span> <span data-start="533.05" data-end="537.449">reality, let's start to break down this definition of user agent.</span> <span data-start="537.449" data-end="540.1">So, I'll go in reverse order.</span> <span data-start="540.1" data-end="545.97">Start with a user agent facilitates end user interaction with web content.</span> <span data-start="545.97" data-end="552.25">So, what I believe is that the user should always be in control of how information is</span> <span data-start="552.25" data-end="553.59">presented to them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="553.59" data-end="559">So, on a modern web browser, that's preferences like default text sizing.</span> <span data-start="559" data-end="561.48">That's contrast ratios.</span> <span data-start="561.48" data-end="564.33">And Chrome extensions and things like that.</span> <span data-start="564.33" data-end="569.66">But when you think about augmented reality, we have this whole new dimension.</span> <span data-start="569.66" data-end="572.18">It's really immersive.</span> <span data-start="572.18" data-end="574.29">It's, you know?</span> <span data-start="574.29" data-end="579.321">And so, we need to start to think about other ways that we want to have safe browsing and</span> <span data-start="579.321" data-end="581">we want the user to be in control.</span> <span data-start="581" data-end="585">One example, think about physical proximity.</span> <span data-start="585" data-end="590.5">You have content that's being rendered possibly close to you and I should be able to say I'm</span> <span data-start="590.5" data-end="594.87">not comfortable with anything rendering closer than 5 meters away from me.</span> <span data-start="594.87" data-end="598.61">Or I think it's compelling to think about this in terms of sound.</span> <span data-start="598.61" data-end="603.13">I probably would never want to allow someone to whisper into my ear as I'm walking down</span> <span data-start="603.13" data-end="604.73">the street.</span> <span data-start="604.73" data-end="610.68">so, a lot of these considerations come into play when we're talking about augmented reality.</span> <span data-start="610.68" data-end="614.87">And in order to accommodate these things for the years, we're going to need an intervention</span> <span data-start="614.87" data-end="616.75">point for the information.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="616.75" data-end="621.44">So, the user agent knows what's being asked of it to do this.</span> <span data-start="621.44" data-end="628.459">If we think of declarative content that we know and love, that would be HTML and CSS.</span> <span data-start="628.459" data-end="633.279">I see this future where there's declarative content that you're able to add into the world</span> <span data-start="633.279" data-end="641.62">around you so you could specify things like I would like float left and pin to a building.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="641.62" data-end="646.06">Or you could say, I want the depth to be 5 meters from the user.</span> <span data-start="646.06" data-end="651.8">But it's up to the user agent to decide whether or not it can actually honor that request.</span> <span data-start="651.8" data-end="657.49">And it's in that way that it can advocate for the user.</span> <span data-start="657.49" data-end="665.279">So, another thing that declarative content offers is that is provides semantic understanding</span> <span data-start="665.279" data-end="666.3">for the user agent.</span> <span data-start="666.3" data-end="672.23">So, what that means is that the user agent has a view into what's being asking to rendered</span> <span data-start="672.23" data-end="674.49">or presented to the use.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="674.49" data-end="678.98">I find this example extremely lie lighting of what I'm talking about.</span> <span data-start="678.98" data-end="683.029">If we look at the left side, you're seeing the web.</span> <span data-start="683.029" data-end="690.47">If given this canvas to render the object like on the web today, given an XY location,</span> <span data-start="690.47" data-end="692.75">you can only see the color.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="692.75" data-end="696.57">I see a black pixel, a white pixel, a gray pixel.</span> <span data-start="696.57" data-end="697.96">But nothing more than that.</span> <span data-start="697.96" data-end="701.759">But with semantic understanding of what's actually in the scene, we have a much more</span> <span data-start="701.759" data-end="705.17">rich understanding of the model the and the content that we're placing.</span> <span data-start="705.17" data-end="710.23">So, if you look at the right side, you can see I'm looking at the windshield.</span> <span data-start="710.23" data-end="712.72">And it has a material that's class.</span> <span data-start="712.72" data-end="714.36">And it's transparent.</span> <span data-start="714.36" data-end="717.35">You can also see things like the tire and stuff like that.</span> <span data-start="717.35" data-end="722.9">And so, you can imagine with screenreaders or accessible or just translating this into</span> <span data-start="722.9" data-end="727.08">soundbased AR, you can actually talk about what the user is seeing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="727.08" data-end="733.49">So, you could say I see a van with black tires and white car metal paint.</span> <span data-start="733.49" data-end="739.579">So, the next part of the user agent that I'll talk about is rendering.</span> <span data-start="739.579" data-end="745.12">So, the user agent is response for rendering to the browser.</span> <span data-start="745.12" data-end="749.16">So, modern web rendering emergencies are amazing.</span> <span data-start="749.16" data-end="750.8">They're fantastic.</span> <span data-start="750.8" data-end="753.12">That's blank, echo, WebKit, things like that.</span> <span data-start="753.12" data-end="758.81">When you think about what they asked to do, it's mostly 2D and it's textbased.</span> <span data-start="758.81" data-end="765.17">They're fantastic at rendering pages like the verge at 60 frames per second.</span> <span data-start="765.17" data-end="770.6">And some of you might know and some of you might not, but the web already does performant</span> <span data-start="770.6" data-end="771.6">3D rendering.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="771.6" data-end="778.86">That's great and provided to the user through a Canvas element and uses WebGL to create</span> <span data-start="778.86" data-end="780.58">those graphics.</span> <span data-start="780.58" data-end="785.24">What that might look like today is this, this is not augmented or virtual reality.</span> <span data-start="785.24" data-end="790.66">But it's just rendering in a web page using a canvas and WebGL.</span> <span data-start="790.66" data-end="797.81">So, for the rendering needs of augmented reality, thinking back to the vision is this complex</span> <span data-start="797.81" data-end="801.709">composition and layout dynamics of content.</span> <span data-start="801.709" data-end="805.86">So, we're gonna probably need to build a rendering engine that can handle that from the ground</span> <span data-start="805.86" data-end="806.86">up.</span> <span data-start="806.86" data-end="815.85">Whereas the modern rendering engines were optimized for 2D.</span> <span data-start="815.85" data-end="820.139">And so, even though I just said that we probably want this authorized from the ground up and</span> <span data-start="820.139" data-end="823.47">that we don't want to use Canvas elements, we tried it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="823.47" data-end="830.48">So, my team experimented on this internal prototype, air web view.</span> <span data-start="830.48" data-end="838.519">It's a set of libraries that enable AR through native apps and web view.</span> <span data-start="838.519" data-end="845.22">It's a lightweight browse their you can embed into a native app.</span> <span data-start="845.22" data-end="852.23">The technical understanding of what we've done is that we've web rendered and using</span> <span data-start="852.23" data-end="857.389">that to do than we have tracking, AR Core and ARKit.</span> <span data-start="857.389" data-end="860.889">And we combine that with a natively rendered camera feed.</span> <span data-start="860.889" data-end="865.08">Let's look at what that looks like.</span> <span data-start="865.08" data-end="869.54">You look at the example, we have a stormtrooper and it's convincingly rendered into the space</span> <span data-start="869.54" data-end="871.47">around you.</span> <span data-start="871.47" data-end="876.46">You need to make sure that the content that's rendered moves at the same time as a native</span> <span data-start="876.46" data-end="877.79">camera feed.</span> <span data-start="877.79" data-end="880.24">Because if it's off, it completely breaks the illusion.</span> <span data-start="880.24" data-end="884.649">So, we have this transparent web view, it's rendering the content, and this becomes a</span> <span data-start="884.649" data-end="886.69">difficult technical problem.</span> <span data-start="886.69" data-end="889.12">Because if you're familiar, and don't worry if you're not.</span> <span data-start="889.12" data-end="892.51">You have a render loop that's running from the browser.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="892.51" data-end="896.24">But then you also have a render loop that's running natively, and you also have the update</span> <span data-start="896.24" data-end="898.12">loop for the native tracking.</span> <span data-start="898.12" data-end="901.93">So, it's figuring out a way to get all of these things working together in a performant</span> <span data-start="901.93" data-end="903.36">way.</span> <span data-start="903.36" data-end="908.86">And the advantages of AR web view is it's lightweight.</span> <span data-start="908.86" data-end="911.25">It's only 60 kilobytes added to your app.</span> <span data-start="911.25" data-end="912.449">It's crossplatform.</span> <span data-start="912.449" data-end="916.759">So, you write code once and it works on both iOS and Android.</span> <span data-start="916.759" data-end="921.06">It's embeddable into native apps and you can pull down content and code on demand.</span> <span data-start="921.06" data-end="929.39">And that last part, to highlight the advantages of that is that you can make changes to this</span> <span data-start="929.39" data-end="932.97">augmented reality experience that's independent from your native app code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="932.97" data-end="938.75">You don't have to wait for an app release to change your AR experience.</span> <span data-start="938.75" data-end="943.82">So, one use of AR web view in action was at Google IO this year.</span> <span data-start="943.82" data-end="950.17">If you were there, you would have seen this experience that allowed you to orient yourself</span> <span data-start="950.17" data-end="953.06">once you're on site at the conference.</span> <span data-start="953.06" data-end="957.639">Using augmented reality, you could see which way you might want to go next.</span> <span data-start="957.639" data-end="961.01">And so, this experience is literally just a web page.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="961.01" data-end="966.449">And these white text that say water station and eats market are just actually HTML elements</span> <span data-start="966.449" data-end="968.85">styled with 3D transforms.</span> <span data-start="968.85" data-end="975.029">So, again, AR web view, it's a prototype, it's internal.</span> <span data-start="975.029" data-end="978.319">We will a lot of fun and learned a lot with it.</span> <span data-start="978.319" data-end="985.399">So, this last aspect of the user agent that I'll talk about is that the user agent retrieves</span> <span data-start="985.399" data-end="987.689">content on behalf of the user.</span> <span data-start="987.689" data-end="990.23">And this part is so fascinating to me.</span> <span data-start="990.23" data-end="995.81">So, if you think back to this vision of augmented reality, you're walking down the street.</span> <span data-start="995.81" data-end="999.889">And you look at a restaurant and it knows what you want is the menu information.</span> <span data-start="999.889" data-end="1002.23">And it knows what you want is the Instagram photos.</span> <span data-start="1002.23" data-end="1007.189">And so, if I was doing this today on my smartphone, I would go to the restaurant.</span> <span data-start="1007.189" data-end="1008.649">I would see the name.</span> <span data-start="1008.649" data-end="1012.72">I would type it into maybe Google search, who knows.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1012.72" data-end="1014.87">And then I would access the information that I wanted.</span> <span data-start="1014.87" data-end="1020.29">But what we have with augmented reality is this fundamental paradigm shift.</span> <span data-start="1020.29" data-end="1026.15">Now the user agent is querying on my behalf and should know what I want to see.</span> <span data-start="1026.15" data-end="1032">That's very interesting if in a camerafirst browser environment, the user receives content</span> <span data-start="1032" data-end="1036.71">rather than querying for it.</span> <span data-start="1036.71" data-end="1042.5">That means that the user gets it over the surfacing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1042.5" data-end="1045.07">This is an interesting question off the bat.</span> <span data-start="1045.07" data-end="1049.43">We can think about modern questions like echo chambers and stuff like that.</span> <span data-start="1049.43" data-end="1054.88">Manage imagine you're in an augmented reality immersive world and you don't know when there's</span> <span data-start="1054.88" data-end="1056.99">content that you're not seeing.</span> <span data-start="1056.99" data-end="1063.15">Or you should have a way to know and have ways to set preferences on what you do want</span> <span data-start="1063.15" data-end="1064.15">to see.</span> <span data-start="1064.15" data-end="1067.3">And I think that there is kind of this pessimistic view of that.</span> <span data-start="1067.3" data-end="1072.27">But I think there's a lot of advantages of having this intermediary between you and the</span> <span data-start="1072.27" data-end="1073.47">information.</span> <span data-start="1073.47" data-end="1077.82">An example that I like to think Imagine you're a coffee drinker.</span> <span data-start="1077.82" data-end="1081.85">You wake up, you want to wear your AR glasses on the way to work.</span> <span data-start="1081.85" data-end="1086.39">You haven't had your glass of coffee, you want the bare minimum.</span> <span data-start="1086.39" data-end="1090.65">Until you get to the coffee shop, then you are ready to get the other things coming.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1090.65" data-end="1099.47">In that way, the user agent having discretion is an advantage.</span> <span data-start="1099.47" data-end="1102.68">And so, as you start to hear these things about augmented reality and maybe this future</span> <span data-start="1102.68" data-end="1105.4">where everybody is wearing headsets.</span> <span data-start="1105.4" data-end="1112.43">You might be like me yesterday in Conrad electronics thinking, that's a lot of cameras.</span> <span data-start="1112.43" data-end="1115.38">So, it's true.</span> <span data-start="1115.38" data-end="1120.16">A camerafirst future requires a lot of cameras.</span> <span data-start="1120.16" data-end="1122.35">And it's not just augmented reality that's facing these things.</span> <span data-start="1122.35" data-end="1127.68">It would be things like selfdriving cars where they have six censors, eight, a ton of sensors</span> <span data-start="1127.68" data-end="1134.09">looking at the world around it as they're processing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1134.09" data-end="1139.99">What that means is we're capturing basic life everything that happens on the sidewalk.</span> <span data-start="1139.99" data-end="1142.63">Anything that someone wearing one of these headsets can see.</span> <span data-start="1142.63" data-end="1148.63">And so, as we try to build towards this augmented reality feature, we need to have privacy and</span> <span data-start="1148.63" data-end="1153.56">surveillance top of mind when thinking about worldscale AR.</span> <span data-start="1153.56" data-end="1158.76">So, at face value, I think one of the first things you would think about in the context</span> <span data-start="1158.76" data-end="1164.88">of privacy is that these cameras are capturing RGB data about the world around you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1164.88" data-end="1165.88">Which is just a picture.</span> <span data-start="1165.88" data-end="1168.74">So, what happens with that picture data?</span> <span data-start="1168.74" data-end="1172.47">Is your device computing it on device?</span> <span data-start="1172.47" data-end="1173.96">Is it going up to the cloud?</span> <span data-start="1173.96" data-end="1175.6">Who owns that data on the cloud?</span> <span data-start="1175.6" data-end="1177.05">Is it going to your private cloud?</span> <span data-start="1177.05" data-end="1180.6">And then when you think about secondary data.</span> <span data-start="1180.6" data-end="1185.67">So, that's information that's extracted from this camera image which is how augmented reality</span> <span data-start="1185.67" data-end="1186.67">works.</span> <span data-start="1186.67" data-end="1189.28">You can imagine if you're building meshes around you.</span> <span data-start="1189.28" data-end="1194.08">You live in an apartment building with a distinct statue outside.</span> <span data-start="1194.08" data-end="1195.99">You walk out.</span> <span data-start="1195.99" data-end="1202.83">Your headset creates a mesh of this statue and someone could know exactly where that</span> <span data-start="1202.83" data-end="1204.87">statue is and locate you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1204.87" data-end="1210.45">Even if they don't have the camera data, they can understand that from the derivative information</span> <span data-start="1210.45" data-end="1215.22">that's used for augmented reality.</span> <span data-start="1215.22" data-end="1219.68">And what I think, though, is that user user agents being more powerful is actually an</span> <span data-start="1219.68" data-end="1221.46">advantage in this scenario.</span> <span data-start="1221.46" data-end="1225.52">Because if we can move that information away from the developer and closer to a trusted</span> <span data-start="1225.52" data-end="1227.7">user agent, that's a positive thing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1227.7" data-end="1233.69">But we'll need something like open source code to actually know that we're being that</span> <span data-start="1233.69" data-end="1236.67">we can trust our user agents.</span> <span data-start="1236.67" data-end="1246.53">So, to me, augmented reality and the web is an amazing partnership.</span> <span data-start="1246.53" data-end="1250.76">The web will gain a whole new access for understanding information.</span> <span data-start="1250.76" data-end="1251.95">It will be more contextualized.</span> <span data-start="1251.95" data-end="1253.85">It will be ergonomic.</span> <span data-start="1253.85" data-end="1258.13">And for augmented reality, the web for sure is an important piece.</span> <span data-start="1258.13" data-end="1263.05">It will provide the content and I love the webby principles that we use today.</span> <span data-start="1263.05" data-end="1268.22">I think as we look forward to a future with augmented reality, we need to keep those webby</span> <span data-start="1268.22" data-end="1269.99">principles in line.</span> <span data-start="1269.99" data-end="1277.47">If you are interested in using the resources today, check out the resources.</span> <span data-start="1277.47" data-end="1284.98">Look at the model viewer and see if adding 3D models increases use and context to your</span> <span data-start="1284.98" data-end="1285.98">information.</span> <span data-start="1285.98" data-end="1290.32">And also, start talking to us about the WebXR device API.</span> <span data-start="1290.32" data-end="1294.97">Everyone's opinion matters and it will be great for the ecosystem overall.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1294.97" data-end="1301.51">So, to me if the web plus augmented reality is an open ecosystem of rich, contextualized</span> <span data-start="1301.51" data-end="1311">information, then I'm excited and I hope that you all are too.</span> </p>
