<p><span data-start="0.429" data-end="1.429">Bringing back dial up: The Internet over SMS</span> <span data-start="1.429" data-end="2.429">Alexandra Sunderland KATIE: Hello. How were the snacks? Were they</span> <span data-start="2.429" data-end="3.429">good? Yeah. Oh, my gosh, are those chocolate cupcakes with like mousse? I wanted to eat</span> <span data-start="3.429" data-end="4.429">probably 20 of those. But I didn't because I wanted to make sure that everyone else got</span> <span data-start="4.429" data-end="5.429">one too. So, if you had a chocolate little cupcake, you can thank\hme for exercising</span> <span data-start="5.429" data-end="6.429">restraint. All right. So, our next speaker is Alexandra Sunderland. She's an engineer</span> <span data-start="6.429" data-end="7.429">at fellow.app. But the most interesting and amazing thing about her and I am so jealous</span> <span data-start="7.429" data-end="8.429">certify she sews her own clothing. So, the dress she is wearing on stage far outshines</span> <span data-start="8.429" data-end="9.429">my dress that has code on it because she designed and sewed it herself and it even has a little</span> <span data-start="9.429" data-end="10.429">secret pocket on the pack for her to put her like mic pack. Which is genius. And I think</span> <span data-start="10.429" data-end="11.429">she needs to start, like, I don't know. She needs to open up an Etsy store to start selling</span> <span data-start="11.429" data-end="12.429">them women speakers everywhere. All right. She's going to talk to us about bringing back</span> <span data-start="12.429" data-end="13.429">dial up in the Internet over SMS. Give it up for Alexandra.</span> <span data-start="13.429" data-end="14.429">[ Applause ] ALEXANDRA: Hi, everyone. I'm Alexandra. I</span> <span data-start="14.429" data-end="15.429">work at fellow.app. We're building a product that acts as a manager's copilot. Helps you</span> <span data-start="15.429" data-end="18.5">organize your one on ones, organize feedback, action in meetings and track action items.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="18.5" data-end="26.949">If that's interesting, talk to me or check out fell.app. But I want to talk about a completely</span> <span data-start="26.949" data-end="32.34">different project I have been working on in my spare time. This is an app that I built</span> <span data-start="32.34" data-end="36.98">for my phone that lets you access the Internet in a real browser without having to have a</span> <span data-start="36.98" data-end="45.41">data or Wi Fi connection. It transfers it over SMS. To give you a preview, on the left,</span> <span data-start="45.41" data-end="50.55">a screenshot of the app where you are going to enter the URL for the website. And on the</span> <span data-start="50.55" data-end="55.55">right side, there's a website for my default messaging application that shows the communication</span> <span data-start="55.55" data-end="62.35">going on behind the scenes between phone and the server. Why on Earth would I make something</span> <span data-start="62.35" data-end="67.95">like this when we have access to free Wi Fi and data connections all over the world. I</span> <span data-start="67.95" data-end="74.69">come from a country where I get 2 gigabytes of data every month for $80 and the prices</span> <span data-start="74.69" data-end="79.64">for Internet are so expensive in this country that three quarters of a million people are</span> <span data-start="79.64" data-end="85.76">still using dial up Internet connections in their home. I come from Canada.</span> <span data-start="85.76" data-end="90.15">[ Laughter ] So, the data prices are so expensive just</span> <span data-start="90.15" data-end="94.42">when I'm at home in my own country. It's whenever I'm traveling I have to pay an arm and a leg</span> <span data-start="94.42" data-end="99.57">just to be able to browse the Internet. To be here right now, I'm paying $100 just to</span> <span data-start="99.57" data-end="104.72">get access to 1 gigabyte of data. And this is kind of an issue for me because I really,</span> <span data-start="104.72" data-end="109.439">really love to travel. And I spend a lot of time in places like Paris, the streets look</span> <span data-start="109.439" data-end="115.26">like this, they're all over the place. I'm extremely directionally impaired. I get lost</span> <span data-start="115.26" data-end="120.369">in New York City where the streets are in a grid and numbered. And I end up in these</span> <span data-start="120.369" data-end="126.47">situations in places like Paris. And I walk in one direction and I have to take the sub</span> <span data-start="126.47" data-end="132.849">quay to get back to where I was originally trying to go. I could download an offline</span> <span data-start="132.849" data-end="138.669">map and use that to walk around. But when I want to take the subway, that requires up</span> <span data-start="138.669" data-end="145.299">to date real time information and I can't get that online. And so, I decided to do something</span> <span data-start="145.299" data-end="149.04">about this. And one of the first things that I notice when had I started trying to solve</span> <span data-start="149.04" data-end="155.829">this problem is that my phone plan has unlimited SMS in most countries or very, very cheap</span> <span data-start="155.829" data-end="160.999">messaging. So, originally a couple years ago when I started this, the big thing at the</span> <span data-start="160.999" data-end="166.529">time was building chat bots. And a lot of companies started building these interfaces</span> <span data-start="166.529" data-end="171.18">through like Facebook messenger or whatever. So, I decided that because I have unlimited</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="171.18" data-end="177.769">SMS, I'll build a chat bot. And the way that it worked was I would be able to send a message,</span> <span data-start="177.769" data-end="183.339">how do I get from here to there. That message was sent to the server, have unlimited access</span> <span data-start="183.339" data-end="189.629">to the Internet, you could use the Google API and get it back to me. I could use this</span> <span data-start="189.629" data-end="195.939">in France for 15 cents and get all the directions I needed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="195.939" data-end="202.739">I used this a lot. And I could store address books and say, how do I get home? You could</span> <span data-start="202.739" data-end="207.589">say I want to get there at 4 p.m. It would do that for you but, it was so useful that</span> <span data-start="207.589" data-end="212.699">I kind of got addicted to having access to the Internet so I would want to look up a</span> <span data-start="212.699" data-end="218.239">translation of a word. And build an API integration for that. Or look up a rating for a restaurant</span> <span data-start="218.239" data-end="224.219">I was next to and I built an API integration for that. And I started spending so much time</span> <span data-start="224.219" data-end="229.099">building these one off integrations. I decided, this is kind of silly. I shouldn't be doing</span> <span data-start="229.099" data-end="235.209">this. I should just build a browser instead. And that is what we're going to go other now.</span> <span data-start="235.209" data-end="240.76">There are two parts to this project. That's the Android app on one side and the Node.js</span> <span data-start="240.76" data-end="245.959">server on the other. The app I built in Android because I figured this is something I'm going</span> <span data-start="245.959" data-end="249.409">to use, so, screw iPhones. [ Laughter ]</span> <span data-start="249.409" data-end="254.829">I did it in Java and not Kotlin because I was completely new to building phone apps.</span> <span data-start="254.829" data-end="261.139">I had never worked with the SMS API and there's a lot more on StackOverflow about SMS with</span> <span data-start="261.139" data-end="266.75">Java. I'm going with that because of the community around it. The server I built in Node.js because</span> <span data-start="266.75" data-end="272.599">I thought it would be fun to put it on the server where it does not belong to create</span> <span data-start="272.599" data-end="280.68">a browser where it's not supposed to be. For communication between these two parts, I used</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="280.68" data-end="286.61">Twilio. Twilio is a really great company with a lot of services around communication and</span> <span data-start="286.61" data-end="292.56">messaging. The part that I used here is something that lets me forward SMS to a server. So,</span> <span data-start="292.56" data-end="297.701">what I've done is I bought a number on Twilio and phone number\h every message that I send</span> <span data-start="297.701" data-end="301.75">to that phone number will be sent as a post request with a bunch of information about</span> <span data-start="301.75" data-end="309.889">the message to my server. To set up the limitations that I had to deal with for this project,</span> <span data-start="309.889" data-end="315.97">so, I want to transfer an entire web page over SMS to my phone. But SMS only allows</span> <span data-start="315.97" data-end="322.9">for 160 characters at a time which is about the size of a Tweet. So, it kind of is discouraging</span> <span data-start="322.9" data-end="328.79">already to have\htransfer a whole bunch of messages this way. And even more so, if you</span> <span data-start="328.79" data-end="333.8">look at a page that's very simple like Google, all we think about when we look at this page</span> <span data-start="333.8" data-end="338.729">is the input and the button and maybe the word Google. But when you actually look at</span> <span data-start="338.729" data-end="343.4">source of this page, this is a quarter million characters in HTML. So, if we were to break</span> <span data-start="343.4" data-end="348.65">this up into messages and send this over without doing anything to it, it would take 1300 SMS</span> <span data-start="348.65" data-end="353.71">to get there. And this would cost $10 in Twilio fee alone which is a lot more than I was willing</span> <span data-start="353.71" data-end="363.81">to pay. But when we think about the website and the functionality behind it, it's the</span> <span data-start="363.81" data-end="370.169">form, the word, the input, the button and it's very, very small and fits into a single</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="370.169" data-end="375.68">SMS. And so, when I was going about this, I decided that any web page I have, I'm gonna</span> <span data-start="375.68" data-end="381.001">want to make a programmatic way to get it down from this big bulky thing to a tiny thing</span> <span data-start="381.001" data-end="385.94">that just represents the interactions that I want to have with it. We're going to walk</span> <span data-start="385.94" data-end="391.259">through the life cycle of requesting a website and then actually getting around to rendering</span> <span data-start="391.259" data-end="397.33">it. Right off the bat, when we want to the request a URL, we end up with a pretty big</span> <span data-start="397.33" data-end="403.659">limitation. URLs, the spec says that a URL can be 2,000 characters in length which could</span> <span data-start="403.659" data-end="413.37">end up taking 13 whole SMS., when we start off by being an SMS, we chop off the HTTPS,</span> <span data-start="413.37" data-end="418.84">WWW, it's assumed every website has that anyway. It's going to take up space in the message.</span> <span data-start="418.84" data-end="426.849">The browser isn't going to support tracking information or fancy JavaScript stuff. So,</span> <span data-start="426.849" data-end="431.229">anything that follows after the real part of the URL is something we can just get rid</span> <span data-start="431.229" data-end="435.96">of. So, if we have a URL like this, we can just use the yellow part that's highlighted</span> <span data-start="435.96" data-end="443.83">and send that over SMS. And to do that, Android has this very, very simple SMS manager API</span> <span data-start="443.83" data-end="448.78">which is just lines nine and ten here. This took many hours of StackOverflowing to figure</span> <span data-start="448.78" data-end="455.49">out. It was very difficult. But really all you have to do is get permissions to send,</span> <span data-start="455.49" data-end="462.05">receive and read SMS. And then initialize the SMS manager API, specify the phone number</span> <span data-start="462.05" data-end="466.249">you want to send the message to, specify the body of the message, and then it sends it</span> <span data-start="466.249" data-end="472.689">off for you and takes care of everything. So, then this message is sent to the Twilio</span> <span data-start="472.689" data-end="477.879">number that I own. And Twilio takes that and turns it into this very, very big JSON blob</span> <span data-start="477.879" data-end="482.509">with a whole bunch of information. And I've highlighted the parts that are important here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="482.509" data-end="487.84">So, at first we have the body which is just the URL that we're requesting. The two number,</span> <span data-start="487.84" data-end="492.24">which is the number that I have. And the from number, which is the number that we're gonna</span> <span data-start="492.24" data-end="500.259">want to send the data back to at the end. So, this is sent to the server. Which then</span> <span data-start="500.259" data-end="506.87">has to do a lot of processing. So, I spend a lot of time working on React components</span> <span data-start="506.87" data-end="512.75">which, when you look at them on their own, are very, very small, tiny things and I kind</span> <span data-start="512.75" data-end="518.539">of forget sometimes just how big our websites end up being. So, I accidently press new page</span> <span data-start="518.539" data-end="524.6">source pretty often when I mean inspect element and I see this wall of HTML that looks horrible</span> <span data-start="524.6" data-end="529.44">and it's impossible to understand looking tat like this. And this is the HTML that the</span> <span data-start="529.44" data-end="535.3">server has to deal with when it's trying to figure out how to send this over SMS. But</span> <span data-start="535.3" data-end="539.74">there are a lot of things in this HTML that we know we can get rid of right off the bat.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="539.74" data-end="544.81">Like, we aren't gonna support JavaScript. We can get rid of all that code. We're not</span> <span data-start="544.81" data-end="548.82">going to support CSS, we can get rid of all style tags. We're not gonna support thing</span> <span data-start="548.82" data-end="556.33">like images. So, the first thing that happens to get that HTML is on the Node.js server,</span> <span data-start="556.33" data-end="563.23">we're using express to set up this web application. We're going to start by grabbing that URL</span> <span data-start="563.23" data-end="569.43">from the text message. Pre pending HTTPS. It's a real URL. Just getting the HTML for</span> <span data-start="569.43" data-end="576.589">that page and then loading that into a library called Churio. It's like JQuery for the server.</span> <span data-start="576.589" data-end="582.29">And all we're gonna use that for is to get the body for the page so we have a much smaller</span> <span data-start="582.29" data-end="589.76">subset of code to deal\hwith. The next thing we're gonna do is use this library, sanitize</span> <span data-start="589.76" data-end="595.91">HTML. And this is a library this lets you decide what tags you want, what attribute</span> <span data-start="595.91" data-end="600.81">on those tags you want, and then you pass it some HTML and it will filter it down to</span> <span data-start="600.81" data-end="607.86">what you want it to be. So, I figured in this simple browser, the only tags I care about</span> <span data-start="607.86" data-end="614.881">other than text are anchor tags, input elements and forms. That lets you access the rest of</span> <span data-start="614.881" data-end="621.38">the Internet and really interact with the text based website. And on those tabs, we</span> <span data-start="621.38" data-end="627.22">care about the value, the type, the name. And anything that's class or data. Like, we</span> <span data-start="627.22" data-end="632.88">can get rid of. Because we don't have CSS, so, allowing class tags would\h or class attributes</span> <span data-start="632.88" data-end="638.649">would take up quite a bit of space that we don't really have the ability to use. The</span> <span data-start="638.649" data-end="644.6">last part of sanitized HTML here is this exclusive filter. And that's something that lets you</span> <span data-start="644.6" data-end="650">set up a function of the tags and attributes. So, for example, we might want to hide all</span> <span data-start="650" data-end="653.88">hidden inputs because we're not going to be able to see them. So, it's kind of wasted</span> <span data-start="653.88" data-end="659.269">space. And we get rid of privacy policies in terms and conditions because we're not</span> <span data-start="659.269" data-end="666.089">going to click on them. There's no point in setting them. At this point we have a lot</span> <span data-start="666.089" data-end="671.47">of\h like, a lot of tags and a couple of different HTML tags here and there. And so, we have</span> <span data-start="671.47" data-end="676.56">to start compressing the English text. And the logical thing to do at this point is to</span> <span data-start="676.56" data-end="684.41">run this through Gzip and send that. But this is not a logical problem. So, the first way</span> <span data-start="684.41" data-end="690">that I decided to compress the text is by doing character replacements for really common</span> <span data-start="690" data-end="695.7">words. So, the word the and are extremely common in English. And there are a lot of</span> <span data-start="695.7" data-end="700.36">letters in English that aren't used. Like everything except for A and I. And so, what</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="700.36" data-end="705.61">I decided to do is replace these common words with a single letter variations. So the becomes</span> <span data-start="705.61" data-end="712.6">T and becomes ampersand and so on and so forth. And this is a really easy compression to decompress</span> <span data-start="712.6" data-end="720.6">on the Android side. If we see a single later on its own that's not A or I, it's clearly</span> <span data-start="720.6" data-end="726.199">that other word. We can do this for the 24 letters that don't mean anything. And then</span> <span data-start="726.199" data-end="730.74">we can do the combinations of two letters that don't mean anything and we can compress</span> <span data-start="730.74" data-end="736.72">a lot of words in the end this way. To do that, all we have to do is set up this mapping</span> <span data-start="736.72" data-end="741.05">of long word to short word. And then just go through that mapping and do a replace all.</span> <span data-start="741.05" data-end="746.3">We don't care about the structure of the HTML at this point. It's probably going to be okay.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="746.3" data-end="751.5">If you're visiting a website like Wikipedia, there are probably a lot of really big words</span> <span data-start="751.5" data-end="762.86">that don't need to be that big. So, penitentiary means the same as jail, a four letter word.</span> <span data-start="762.86" data-end="768.769">We can find the long words, find synonyms for them that are really short and replace</span> <span data-start="768.769" data-end="775.19">those. This is not a reversible compression. [ Laughter ]</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="775.19" data-end="780.759">So, on the Android side, you could take all the very short words and find the longest</span> <span data-start="780.759" data-end="786.84">possible synonyms for them. But it's\h you're going to get some interesting results. The</span> <span data-start="786.84" data-end="791.75">next way that we're gonna start compressing things is by replacing links. So, when I'm</span> <span data-start="791.75" data-end="796.85">on my computer, I have the proper behavior of hovering over a link before I click it,</span> <span data-start="796.85" data-end="801.32">seeing that it's a good trustworthy link and then clicking on it. When I'm on my phone,</span> <span data-start="801.32" data-end="806.76">I just click on the link and I don't care where it goes. And I decided I should take</span> <span data-start="806.76" data-end="812.42">advantage of that behavior. So, what I do here is let's say I have a link in real HTML</span> <span data-start="812.42" data-end="819.98">that goes to fellow.app. What I can do is replace that link with a three character long</span> <span data-start="819.98" data-end="826.41">random string. Send that over to the browser or the app. And then when I click on the app,</span> <span data-start="826.41" data-end="833.339">that three\h that thing is sent back to the server. And the server knows, this isn't a</span> <span data-start="833.339" data-end="839.56">real URL. I should figure out what it's supposed to be and get the HTML for that link. And</span> <span data-start="839.56" data-end="844.889">this saves a lot of space on a lot of websites. Because websites are covered with links. And</span> <span data-start="844.889" data-end="849.389">sometimes the words that are link ready really, really short. But the URLs tend to be extremely</span> <span data-start="849.389" data-end="856.291">long. So, this saves a lot of space. And the way that I do this is by using Redis, which</span> <span data-start="856.291" data-end="864.18">is a in memory key value data store. So, for every URL that's encountered in the HTML,</span> <span data-start="864.18" data-end="869.97">it's passed to this URL shortener function. And it generates the random string and then</span> <span data-start="869.97" data-end="876.74">is sets the value in Redis as the phone number_short URL. Sorry, that's the key. And then the value</span> <span data-start="876.74" data-end="882.699">is the real URL. And this\h so, setting it "phone number first reduces the chances of</span> <span data-start="882.699" data-end="889.16">there being collisions. But there still is the chance that you'll get the same URL stored</span> <span data-start="889.16" data-end="895.29">under the same\h the same short link. But that's okay. It's all gonna be our own URL.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="895.29" data-end="902.6">So, it's not a big deal. Okay. So, the last way of compressing the HTML is by using Greek</span> <span data-start="902.6" data-end="905.089">characters. [ Laughter ]</span> <span data-start="905.089" data-end="912.589">One of the great things about the SMS character set is that it allows for Greek characters.</span> <span data-start="912.589" data-end="917.589">And most of the websites that I visit, at least, do not have Greek characters on them.</span> <span data-start="917.589" data-end="923.089">And so, I decided to take advantage of that. Now, because we have such a small subset of</span> <span data-start="923.089" data-end="929.25">HTML tags and attributes, I figured there's this way of mapping all of these combinations</span> <span data-start="929.25" data-end="934.79">to different characters. So, I color coded the original version and the shortened version</span> <span data-start="934.79" data-end="940.51">here. So, like the bracket input is that first one, type equals quotation mark is the second</span> <span data-start="940.51" data-end="945.66">one. And it might look a bit odd that the words are combined with the different like</span> <span data-start="945.66" data-end="950.519">equals and quotation marks. But we know that type is always going to be followed by an</span> <span data-start="950.519" data-end="954.99">equals and then a quotation mark. And so, we can do this because we have enough characters</span> <span data-start="954.99" data-end="963.209">in the Greek letters to do this explicit mapping. This shortens can quite a bit. One of the</span> <span data-start="963.209" data-end="968.54">issues with SMS is that it does not have guaranteed delivery or a guarantee that it will arrive</span> <span data-start="968.54" data-end="972.959">in the same order that it's sent. So, we might end up with the situation where we have six</span> <span data-start="972.959" data-end="978.279">messages sent. Two of them never make it and then the four that do arrive completely out</span> <span data-start="978.279" data-end="985.529">of order. I decided to ignore the fact that some SMS might not make it. In order to recover</span> <span data-start="985.529" data-end="990.22">from that kind of issue it would require building out an entire networking system. That was</span> <span data-start="990.22" data-end="994.66">a bit above what I wanted to do with this. Because if some of the messages don't arrive,</span> <span data-start="994.66" data-end="999.07">you can just reload the page and it's not going to be a huge issue. But for the arriving</span> <span data-start="999.07" data-end="1005.129">out of order issue, that's quite a big thing with my phone. What I've done here, is if</span> <span data-start="1005.129" data-end="1009.529">these three messages make up the entirety of the HTML to be sent out. We're going to</span> <span data-start="1009.529" data-end="1020.689">prefix them with met data, we can see that they are there. And we wait for a total of</span> <span data-start="1020.689" data-end="1028.62">three. And once that arrives, we know the order to place them in to get valid HTML.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1028.62" data-end="1034.95">To do this, Twilio has a great Node.js library. All we have to do is say messages.create and</span> <span data-start="1034.95" data-end="1040.65">then specify the body of the message, who the message is from, and then the number that</span> <span data-start="1040.65" data-end="1046.64">it's going to which is something that was sent in the post request earlier on. So, now</span> <span data-start="1046.64" data-end="1051.3">this is being sent back to the phone. And the way we receive it is through something</span> <span data-start="1051.3" data-end="1056.92">on Android called broadcast receiver. And broadcast receiver is something that you can</span> <span data-start="1056.92" data-end="1061.43">set up to listen out for different signals, for events that happen within the phone. Here</span> <span data-start="1061.43" data-end="1067.53">I have one set up for listening for a coming SMS. And what this does is it just waits for</span> <span data-start="1067.53" data-end="1072.22">all the SMS not shown here, very condensed. But waits for the SMS and sends it off to</span> <span data-start="1072.22" data-end="1080.01">an activities and Android's version of a view. So, once we have all the SMS, we've concatenated</span> <span data-start="1080.01" data-end="1084.99">them together, we have to start by reversing the Greek letter conversion so that we have</span> <span data-start="1084.99" data-end="1090.711">some real HTML to deal with. Reverse the shortened English words. Not the thesaurus way, just</span> <span data-start="1090.711" data-end="1096.3">the single letter shortening. We're going to add some spaces between the closing and</span> <span data-start="1096.3" data-end="1103.12">opening tags just to add a little bit of visual interest to the page because there's no CSS,</span> <span data-start="1103.12" data-end="1107.19">there's nothing. We got to make it a little bit more readable. And then we're going to</span> <span data-start="1107.19" data-end="1112.841">load it in a web view. So, if you've ever opened Slack and clicked on a link and it</span> <span data-start="1112.841" data-end="1119.13">opens Chrome within Slack, they're using a web view component. So, a web view is Chrome</span> <span data-start="1119.13" data-end="1123.88">within an app. And you can either send it a URL to open, or Amazingly, you can send</span> <span data-start="1123.88" data-end="1128.81">it some HTML to open which was the best discovery in the world. When I was building this, I</span> <span data-start="1128.81" data-end="1138.27">thought I was going to have to build my own rendering engine. And I almost stopped. And</span> <span data-start="1138.27" data-end="1143.51">this is what it looks like. So, on the right side we have the actual message that was sent</span> <span data-start="1143.51" data-end="1149.76">to transfer all of Google.ca. And on the left we have the rendering in the app of that web</span> <span data-start="1149.76" data-end="1161.09">page. So, this\h [ Applause ]</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1161.09" data-end="1167.42">This is pretty on point with what Google looked like 15 years ago. So, it's not too bad. When</span> <span data-start="1167.42" data-end="1172.44">I started this out, I had a goal of getting this web page down to 10 SMS. I thought that</span> <span data-start="1172.44" data-end="1177.93">would be a completely unattainable amazing thing to do. It was starting off 1300. And</span> <span data-start="1177.93" data-end="1186.97">I got it down to three SMS for the whole page. So, once I did that, I was really interested</span> <span data-start="1186.97" data-end="1192.83">because this project is named dial up, I was curious to see, how fast is this compared</span> <span data-start="1192.83" data-end="1197.92">to actual dial up? On my phone on a good day using a regular browser, it takes 2 seconds</span> <span data-start="1197.92" data-end="1205.37">to load the page. On dial up a few years ago, 45 seconds. And using this method over SMS,</span> <span data-start="1205.37" data-end="1211.161">it takes 10 seconds. Which when it's the only way you have of accessing the Internet, that's</span> <span data-start="1211.161" data-end="1218.25">not long at all. SMS is not secure at all. [ Laughter ]</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1218.25" data-end="1224.5">SMS has the capability of being intercepted, it's not encrypted. It's\h yeah. It's not</span> <span data-start="1224.5" data-end="1230.41">secure. So, this is not something that should be used for password related, anything credit</span> <span data-start="1230.41" data-end="1235.62">card related. Anything like that. So, one of the things that I do is get rid of sign</span> <span data-start="1235.62" data-end="1243.42">in links, if we're not going to click on them anyways, why use the space. Because it's no</span> <span data-start="1243.42" data-end="1251.52">cookies, on the other hand, this is more secure than other browsers. One of the ways that</span> <span data-start="1251.52" data-end="1257.97">this project could have been quite a bit easier is using MMS instead of SMS. That costs a</span> <span data-start="1257.97" data-end="1264.17">fraction of a cent more and it supports quite a bit more data. But just like Gzip, that</span> <span data-start="1264.17" data-end="1270.7">is just not a fun solution. There are a lot of things that could be done with this project.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1270.7" data-end="1274.15">So. , one of the\h we could do thing like web</span> <span data-start="1274.15" data-end="1280.2">sockets. Phones and SMS are by nature bidirectional communication. They could send something to</span> <span data-start="1280.2" data-end="1287.93">the phone when there's communication, nothing fancy there. And AJAX, if I visit Tweeter</span> <span data-start="1287.93" data-end="1296.91">a lot, I could store that on my phone ahead of time and use these requests to get only</span> <span data-start="1296.91" data-end="1302.37">the contents of Tweets or the content that really changes. We could use add support for</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1302.37" data-end="1309.01">JavaScript. Or my favorite one is support for real dial up. So, through the Android</span> <span data-start="1309.01" data-end="1315">API you can also make voice calls. And I thought it would be really cool if instead of doing</span> <span data-start="1315" data-end="1320.32">SMS, if it did real dial up where you initiate a phone call, the server and phone go back</span> <span data-start="1320.32" data-end="1324.62">and forth for a couple seconds and then all the data far website is transferred that way.</span> <span data-start="1324.62" data-end="1328.91">So, it would probably only take a couple seconds and might end up being cheaper and more reliable</span> <span data-start="1328.91" data-end="1338.04">than SMS. That would be super cool. Going backwards. So, I did not know about travel</span> <span data-start="1338.04" data-end="1344.3">SIM cards when I started this project. [ Laughter ]</span> <span data-start="1344.3" data-end="1349.041">I found about these a few months ago. If you don't know, you can get a travel SIM card</span> <span data-start="1349.041" data-end="1354.64">for about $20 or $30 and it gives you access to about 20 gigabytes of data in whatever</span> <span data-start="1354.64" data-end="1361.35">country you're traveling to. In comparison, I pay $80 for 2 gigs. This is a great solution</span> <span data-start="1361.35" data-end="1365.01">and this is what I do now. [ Laughter ]</span> <span data-start="1365.01" data-end="1369.84">If you want to get in touch with me or check out more about the project, here's my website</span> <span data-start="1369.84" data-end="1370.84">and Twitter. Thank you very much. [ Applause ]</span> </p>
