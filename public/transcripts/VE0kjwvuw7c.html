data-start="451.88" data-end="454.34">couple of minutes that you can do and of</span> <span data-start="454.34" data-end="456.05">course at the end there is a target a</span> <span data-start="456.05" data-end="458.63">destination an output which is your</span> <span data-start="458.63" data-end="462.2">headphones or your speakers whatever you</span> <span data-start="462.2" data-end="462.56">like</span> <span data-start="462.56" data-end="465.53">or it could be a recording target so</span> <span data-start="465.53" data-end="467.87">that you could save whatever you created</span> <span data-start="467.87" data-end="471.8">with Web Audio to to an mp3 file much</span> <span data-start="471.8" data-end="473.57">like rendering in a in a digital audio</span> <span data-start="473.57" data-end="477.29">workstation the idea is very simple you</span> <span data-start="477.29" data-end="479.9">create these nodes and you set some</span> <span data-start="479.9" data-end="482.3">parameters which is very very simple</span> <span data-start="482.3" data-end="484.04">extremely simple you don't have to know</span> <span data-start="484.04" data-end="486.77">a lot of math actually you don't even</span> <span data-start="486.77" data-end="488.78">have to know math for anything except</span> <span data-start="488.78" data-end="492.47">one special node that is kind of there</span> <span data-start="492.47" data-end="497.12">to introduce gain distortion effects but</span> <span data-start="497.12" data-end="498.89">then you connect them you connect

data-start="505.64" data-end="507.77">guitar for me but whatever source of</span> <span data-start="507.77" data-end="510.38">input you want maybe it's a mic or</span> <span data-start="510.38" data-end="514.58">another audio file and you connect them</span> <span data-start="514.58" data-end="517.55">in whatever way you like and then to the</span> <span data-start="517.55" data-end="520.729">output and everything happens in real</span> <span data-start="520.729" data-end="529.04">time</span> <span data-start="529.05" data-end="530.23">okay</span> <span data-start="530.23" data-end="534.94">so web audio hosts a lot of components</span> <span data-start="534.94" data-end="536.23">that you can generate that you can</span> <span data-start="536.23" data-end="538.48">create it starts with an audio context</span> <span data-start="538.48" data-end="542.53">everything has to happen within an audio</span> <span data-start="542.53" data-end="546">context anybody familiar with canvas API</span> <span data-start="546" data-end="548.47">to draw some pixels it also has a</span> <span data-start="548.47" data-end="551.08">context so in order to draw something to</span> <span data-start="551.08" data-end="552.79">the screen you have to get a get a hold</span> <span data-start="552.79" data-end="554.95">of a context and audio context is</span> <span data-start="554.95" data-end="556.39">basically the same in order to do any</span> <span data-start="556.39" data-end="558.85">audio application you need to have an</span> <span data-start="558.85" data-end="561.01">audio context now you can have more than</span> <span data-start="561.01" data-end="563.74">one and you can connect anything to more</span> <span data-start="563.74" data-end="566.77">than one context to have multiple</span> <span data-start="566.77" data-end="572.17">plugins or other applications but in the</span> <span data-start="572.17" data-end="574.24">end you need at least one audio context</span> <span data-start="574.24" data-end="576.97">then there's the offline of the context</span> <span data-start="576.97" data-end="579.19">for you to be able to record something</span> <span data-start="579.19" data-end="582.97">again and a lot of processing nodes</span> <span data-start="582.97" data-end="586.44">processing units like again gain delay</span> <span data-start="586.44" data-end="589.6">pan or Cromwell where panner is used to</span> <span data-start="589.6" data-end="592.21">direct the sound to either left or right</span> <span data-start="592.21" data-end="596.17">channels convolve ER is used to</span> <span data-start="596.17" data-end="599.86">introduce effects like the echo effect</span> <span data-start="599.86" data-end="603.91">here the whole effect like a cave you</span> <span data-start="603.91" data-end="607.63">know your your sound kind of echoes and</span> <span data-start="607.63" data-end="611.02">drifts away in a cave those effects are</span> <span data-start="611.02" data-end="613.87">made by finite impulse response filters</span> <span data-start="613.87" data-end="617.14">and a Cromwell ray node is basically</span> <span data-start="617.14" data-end="620.29">used there and you can have an analyzer</span> <span data-start="620.29" data-end="622.48">node so you can actually grab the signal</span> <span data-start="622.48" data-end="627.7">and look at its properties so look at</span> <span data-start="627.7" data-end="629.38">the frequency content look at the power</span> <span data-start="629.38" data-end="632.71">and you can do various effects based on</span> <span data-start="632.71" data-end="635.29">that you can split them into multiple</span> <span data-start="635.29" data-end="637.6">channels multiple tracks so that the</span> <span data-start="637.6" data-end="641.47">graph can get wider and wider as you</span> <span data-start="641.47" data-end="647.07">want it has a lot of a lot of nodes and</span> <span data-start="647.07" data-end="651.91">lately they also introduced some audio</span> <span data-start="651.91" data-end="654.82">worker so it's like a service worker it</span> <span data-start="654.82" data-end="657.52">works in the background it has separate</span> <span data-start="657.52" data-end="659.379">threads and basic</span> <span data-start="659.379" data-end="660.879">it allows you to implement your own</span> <span data-start="660.879" data-end="666.189">algorithms your own scripts or functions</span> <span data-start="666.189" data-end="669.22">that will run per sample but it will run</span> <span data-start="669.22" data-end="671.649">off thread and so you won't hit a</span> <span data-start="671.649" data-end="673.419">performance penalty so you won't be</span> <span data-start="673.419" data-end="677.709">using the the main thread of the browser</span> <span data-start="677.709" data-end="680.019">but it's parallel so that you can have</span> <span data-start="680.019" data-end="681.97">multiple of them which makes the browser</span> <span data-start="681.97" data-end="685.539">a very nice competitor for digital audio</span> <span data-start="685.539" data-end="687.339">workstations like you can really get</span> <span data-start="687.339" data-end="691.239">real production grade audio applications</span> <span data-start="691.239" data-end="696.069">riding inside the browser and okay</span> <span data-start="696.069" data-end="700.869">here's a very small example you start by</span> <span data-start="700.869" data-end="704.409">creating a context which you do new</span> <span data-start="704.409" data-end="708.159">audio context and as I said everything</span> <span data-start="708.159" data-end="710.439">is hosted under the under that context</span> <span data-start="710.439" data-end="714.159">so you can create a gain node which will</span> <span data-start="714.159" data-end="716.889">amplify the the incoming signal by doing</span> <span data-start="716.889" data-end="719.769">context that create gain and you can</span> <span data-start="719.769" data-end="722.289">connect it to the destination which is</span> <span data-start="722.289" data-end="724.989">the speaker output or whatever you like</span> <span data-start="724.989" data-end="728.369">again here's another example to</span> <span data-start="728.369" data-end="731.949">basically load an mp3 file and use it as</span> <span data-start="731.949" data-end="734.259">the source you can create a buffer</span> <span data-start="734.259" data-end="737.699">source and load the buffer that you</span> <span data-start="737.699" data-end="742.209">download from the internet and use it</span> <span data-start="742.209" data-end="745.689">connect it to the gain as the input so</span> <span data-start="745.689" data-end="748.299">this basically gives you a graph where</span> <span data-start="748.299" data-end="750.399">the source is at the beginning in the</span> <span data-start="750.399" data-end="752.739">middle you have the gain and in the end</span> <span data-start="752.739" data-end="755.47">you have the destination but this is</span> <span data-start="755.47" data-end="757.659">basically as simple as as this loading</span> <span data-start="757.659"

data-start="1218.94" data-end="1221.25">does it look like really it's extremely</span> <span data-start="1221.25" data-end="1224.55">simple again you do navigator that</span> <span data-start="1224.55" data-end="1228.87">request media access so I want some MIDI</span> <span data-start="1228.87" data-end="1232.08">devices to be available and it gives you</span> <span data-start="1232.08" data-end="1234.42">something with inputs and outputs so</span> <span data-start="1234.42" data-end="1237.65">what you do is you traverse over the</span> <span data-start="1237.65"

data-end="1255.39">device like when you press a button or</span> <span data-start="1255.39" data-end="1258.48">when you turn a knob or anything you get</span> <span data-start="1258.48" data-end="1261.62">an event that is not that significant</span> <span data-start="1261.62" data-end="1265.5">except for the data which is an array of</span> <span data-start="1265.5" data-end="1268.38">three values or sometimes even two</span> <span data-start="1268.38" data-end="1270.48">values and they are the numbers the</span> <span data-start="1270.48" data-end="1272.28">channel that the middle signal is coming</span> <span data-start="1272.28" data-end="1275.58">in the note the the control change or</span> <span data-start="1275.58" data-end="1278.07">program change signals and its value and</span> <span data-start="1278.07" data-end="1284.24">it's either 0 or any value up to 127</span> <span data-start="1284.24" data-end="1286.62">it's very simple and then you do</span> <span data-start="1286.62" data-end="1288.3">whatever you want with it and of course</span> <span data-start="1288.3" data-end="1290.7">as you can imagine what I did with that</span> <span data-start="1290.7" data-end="1296.43">is I connected it to my pedal board and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1296.43" data-end="1299.24">I can turn on turn on and off my pedals</span> <span data-start="1299.24" data-end="1301.86">in real time as I play because I don't</span> <span data-start="1301.86" data-end="1308.39">have a third hand yet so here's the demo</span> <span data-start="1308.39" data-end="1312.06">that that is the the patch that I was</span> <span data-start="1312.06" data-end="1315.48">using first I actually want to show</span> <span data-start="1315.48" data-end="1326.49">you have the yeah so if you see it there</span> <span data-start="1326.49" data-end="1330.39">the the LED is blinking it's turning off</span> <span data-start="1330.39" data-end="1335.37">and on and I can also turn on and off</span> <span data-start="1335.37" data-end="1341.52">the second one if I long press this it</span> <span data-start="1341.52" data-end="1344.43">will change the patch so it will go to</span> <span data-start="1344.43" data-end="1346.32">the second song so that I can play that</span> <span data-start="1346.32" data-end="1352.5">one and yeah I can turn and turn on and</span> <span data-start="1352.5" data-end="1361.1">off different petals and the other one</span> <span data-start="1361.1" data-end="1364.13">has a very nice pedal called a wah pedal</span> <span data-start="1364.13" data-end="1366.99">anybody familiar with the wah pedal wah</span> <span data-start="1366.99" data-end="1370.74">wah pedal good well there were more</span> <span data-start="1370.74" data-end="1372.33">heaters here you should learn the while</span> <span data-start="1372.33" data-end="1378.42">pedal ok so basically it's it's like at</span> <span data-start="1378.42" data-end="1380.58">this device this is a this is called the</span> <span data-start="1380.58" data-end="1382.95">pedal it's a very confusing name</span> <span data-start="1382.95" data-end="1384.24">everything apparently is called the</span> <span data-start="1384.24" data-end="1385.77">pedal but this is also called the pedal</span> <span data-start="1385.77" data-end="1389.1">you can step on it and as you see you</span> <span data-start="1389.1" data-end="1391.46">can step on it to change the value and</span> <span data-start="1391.46" data-end="1394.38">look at the second one I hope you can</span> <span data-start="1394.38" data-end="1398.91">see it the the effect knob changes as I</span> <span data-start="1398.91" data-end="1402.75">move my my pedal which means it opens</span> <span data-start="1402.75" data-end="1404.19">the wah pedal or closes the wah pedal</span> <span data-start="1404.19" data-end="1406.89">depending on the position so basically I</span> <span data-start="1406.89" data-end="1411.96">use these with my library to make some</span> <span data-start="1411.96" data-end="1430.82">music ok now let's see some code</span> <span data-start="1430.83" data-end="1434.97">cool</span> <span data-start="1434.98" data-end="1440.77">so is it readable from the back that's</span> <span data-start="1440.77" data-end="1444.34">nice thank you so again it's very very</span> <span data-start="1444.34" data-end="1448.36">simple I included pedal board chairs as</span> <span data-start="1448.36" data-end="1450.67">a global library so even though this is</span> <span data-start="1450.67" data-end="1454.27">a module some of the the components are</span> <span

data-start="1466.42" data-end="1468.76">is what you use to create your other</span> <span data-start="1468.76" data-end="1472.3">pedals so you create a stage you create</span> <span data-start="1472.3" data-end="1477.22">a board a pedal board you use the stream</span> <span data-start="1477.22" data-end="1481.9">input to get the guitar and you set the</span> <span

data-end="1500.11">so</span> <span data-start="1500.12" data-end="1507.75">you have three pedals out there</span> <span data-start="1507.76" data-end="1510.52">yeah the first one is in noise gate a</span> <span data-start="1510.52" data-end="1512.22">noise gate basically saves our ears</span> <span data-start="1512.22" data-end="1514.78">because when you use distortion or</span> <span

data-start="1519.01" data-end="1519.85">now</span> <span data-start="1519.85" data-end="1523.39">that's really that's not ideal so you</span> <span data-start="1523.39" data-end="1525.24">use the
