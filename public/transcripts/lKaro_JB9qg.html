it can use something</span> <span data-start="711.01" data-end="713.86">else and you say where in this case if</span> <span data-start="713.86" data-end="715.839">value is larger than born in smaller</span> <span data-start="715.839" data-end="718.899">than five then it's that's actually a my</span> <span data-start="718.899" data-end="720.83">small number and</span> <span data-start="720.83" data-end="722.87">then there's um otherwise it's not and</span> <span data-start="722.87" data-end="724.79">there is a coerce function that says</span> <span data-start="724.79" data-end="728.149">something from Jews type string is</span> <span data-start="728.149" data-end="732.05">getting coerced to a number via return</span> <span data-start="732.05" data-end="739.73">new number and string in other words of</span> <span data-start="739.73" data-end="743.329">course it can set the string and it will</span> <span data-start="743.329" data-end="747.14">be automatically cursed and oh that</span> <span data-start="747.14" data-end="752.54">might feel x 2 will then alert 6 I think</span> <span data-start="752.54" data-end="754.94">it would otherwise too good for a matter</span> <span data-start="754.94" data-end="758.6">of convenience and that's that's how its</span> <span data-start="758.6" data-end="761.839">declared so in the attribute you declare</span> <span data-start="761.839" data-end="764.269">this is a juice type my small number and</span> <span data-start="764.269" data-end="767.48">you activate coerce it has to be</span> <span data-start="767.48" data-end="768.68">activated because it's really expensive</span> <span data-start="768.68" data-end="772.22">and you don't always want it as you can</span> <span data-start="772.22" data-end="774.019">see you can declare attributes on</span> <span data-start="774.019" data-end="776.51">attributes that's of course because</span> <span data-start="776.51" data-end="778.61">attributes are do have metaclasses too</span> <span data-start="778.61" data-end="780.26">so not all in class the metaclass about</span> <span data-start="780.26" data-end="782.87">attributes and methods and whatever do</span> <span data-start="782.87" data-end="791.45">have to I think might have been a little</span> <span data-start="791.45" data-end="794.86">boring but there's more code coming</span> <span data-start="794.86" data-end="797.959">because of course that was all really</span> <span data-start="797.959" data-end="800.089">boring so let's drove into a meta class</span> <span data-start="800.089" data-end="804.11">programming declaring a new meta class</span> <span data-start="804.11" data-end="806.57">is really easy you just declare a class</span> <span data-start="806.57" data-end="809.32">and you inherit from juice dot class</span> <span data-start="809.32" data-end="812.24">because that's the regular meta class</span> <span data-start="812.24" data-end="818.089">and then you can declare new methods on</span> <span data-start="818.089" data-end="818.899">the metaclass</span> <span data-start="818.899" data-end="820.91">and there is a special thing that I want</span> <span data-start="820.91" data-end="823.339">to talk about is you've seen those</span> <span data-start="823.339" data-end="826.52">things in plastic locations like methods</span> <span data-start="826.52" data-end="831.02">and has a Nissa those are actually</span> <span data-start="831.02" data-end="833.029">methods which will be eventually caught</span> <span data-start="833.029" data-end="835.16">in the meta class so you can completely</span> <span data-start="835.16" data-end="837.649">control what they do and you can declare</span> <span data-start="837.649" data-end="840.47">much more of those properties like it in</span> <span data-start="840.47" data-end="843.16">this case with programming stuff to</span> <span data-start="843.16" data-end="846.23">enable us to declare events within</span> <span data-start="846.23" data-end="850.04">classes so here we define that mess</span> <span data-start="850.04" data-end="853.579">handle flop events and then afterwards I</span> <span data-start="853.579" data-end="856.339">go forward you have a class declaration</span> <span data-start="856.339" data-end="858.259">you say this the metaclass of this class</span> <span data-start="858.259" data-end="860.389">is the controller Matic class and then</span> <span data-start="860.389" data-end="861.86">you have can have those events</span> <span data-start="861.86" data-end="866.17">properties and declare events which will</span> <span data-start="866.17" data-end="869.48">be bound to the documents and which can</span> <span data-start="869.48" data-end="871.699">other things can publish to so that's</span> <span data-start="871.699" data-end="875.92">just some way on two declaratively</span> <span data-start="875.92" data-end="880.759">declare stuff which is cool and while I</span> <span data-start="880.759" data-end="881.66">was working on this presentation</span> <span data-start="881.66" data-end="883.43">actually on the way back from Burlington</span> <span data-start="883.43" data-end="885.86">where I lived in Hamburg I had any to</span> <span data-start="885.86" data-end="890.48">give I'm a Twitter it of course before I</span> <span data-start="890.48" data-end="891.92">started working on it</span> <span data-start="891.92" data-end="894.649">but of course it's really ugly that</span> <span data-start="894.649" data-end="896.779">declaring handle prop he wins whatever</span> <span data-start="896.779" data-end="901.19">name mangling not done well so we can</span> <span data-start="901.19" data-end="902.899">make that even nicer if you use meta</span> <span data-start="902.899" data-end="907.67">meta programming and so I implemented</span> <span data-start="907.67" data-end="909.44">actually within the Jews class handle</span> <span data-start="909.44" data-end="916.279">properties and you know there and now</span> <span data-start="916.279" data-end="918.829">the original source code looks like this</span> <span data-start="918.829" data-end="922.04">so now the new meta class can declare</span> <span data-start="922.04" data-end="925.16">that implements the property events</span> <span data-start="925.16" data-end="929.66">which is in my world way nicer than name</span> <span data-start="929.66" data-end="933.38">angling and of course now you can also</span> <span data-start="933.38" data-end="936.05">eat more easily override whatever that</span> <span data-start="936.05" data-end="939.399">handle properties do and yeah it's fun</span> <span data-start="939.399" data-end="943.97">anyway that's so much for the short</span> <span data-start="943.97" data-end="947.66">introduction to juice there's always the</span> <span data-start="947.66" data-end="954.47">question telecom was overhead yes using</span> </p>
