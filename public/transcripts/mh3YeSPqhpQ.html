data-start="274.68" data-end="277.66">mouseup mouse up and mouse move so all</span> <span data-start="277.66" data-end="279.52">I'm going to care about is when I click</span> <span data-start="279.52"

one that i'm</span> <span data-start="287.09" data-end="289.43">looking at here okay and so what this is</span> <span data-start="289.43" data-end="290.9">a little pong demo and you can see i</span> <span data-start="290.9" data-end="294.5">move my mouse and that works decently i</span> <span data-start="294.5" data-end="296.24">move my mouse to this side and that</span> <span data-start="296.24" data-end="298.28">works decently excitement excitement</span> <span data-start="298.28" data-end="301.58">right okay so I'm going to click that</span> <span data-start="301.58" data-end="307.099">and so I can go play pong badly and it's</span> <span data-start="307.099" data-end="312.749">accommodation kind of pong and break out</span> <span data-start="312.759" data-end="315.68">anyways so this all looks fine right</span> <span data-start="315.68" data-end="318.62">this is this is working so i can ignore</span> <span data-start="318.62" data-end="321.83">touch no no actually I can't and there's</span> <span data-start="321.83" data-end="323.779">a couple of reasons for that the primary</span> <span data-start="323.779" data-end="326.509">one is your user has more than one</span> <span data-start="326.509" data-end="329.389">finger so what happens when they want to</span> <span data-start="329.389" data-end="331.159">move over here because that actually</span> <span data-start="331.159" data-end="335.15">does work okay but now this one over</span> <span data-start="335.15" data-end="338.3">here doesn't anybody have a guess as to</span> <span data-start="338.3" data-end="340.49">why this one doesn't while I can move</span> <span data-start="340.49" data-end="346.279">this one over here because mouse there's</span> <span data-start="346.279" data-end="348.56">only one right so what do you do here</span> <span data-start="348.56" data-end="350.96">you start programming for touch and so</span> <span data-start="350.96" data-end="354.589">you start start using touch as it's</span> <span data-start="354.589" data-end="357.379">meant to be so the two other things you</span> <span data-start="357.379" data-end="361.039">can do here is you can retrofit you know</span> <span data-start="361.039" data-end="364.43">touch on to your application or you can</span> <span data-start="364.43" data-end="366.44">design for touch first and I'm going to</span> <span data-start="366.44" data-end="368.029">suggest that if you design for touch</span> <span data-start="368.029" data-end="369.589">first you'll actually be in a much</span> <span data-start="369.589" data-end="372.11">better position and because all the</span> <span data-start="372.11" data-end="374.15">things that you do for touch should work</span> <span data-start="374.15" data-end="376.719">for the mouse and keyboard as well so</span> <span data-start="376.719" data-end="378.62">there's a couple of things that you have</span> <span data-start="378.62" data-end="379.759">to remember when you're designing for</span> <span data-start="379.759" data-end="382.279">touch first and foremost is hover sucks</span> <span data-start="382.279" data-end="385.25">don't don't do it don't don't use hover</span> <span data-start="385.25" data-end="387.409">because you actually you know the thing</span> <span data-start="387.409" data-end="389.419">with touch is it's touching you have to</span> <span data-start="389.419" data-end="391.4">actually touch if you actually click in</span> <span data-start="391.4" data-end="393.729">order to get something to happen because</span> <span data-start="393.729" data-end="396.349">this computer has no idea that my finger</span> <span data-start="396.349" data-end="398.81">is a millimeter off the screen it just</span> <span data-start="398.81" data-end="401.3">doesn't okay someday we may have</span> <span data-start="401.3" data-end="403.43">computers that can do that but I'm</span> <span data-start="403.43" data-end="404.629">betting it's not to be built into your</span> <span data-start="404.629" data-end="406.699">mobile phone anytime soon now there</span> <span data-start="406.699" data-end="409.039">there's a lot of great scenarios where</span> <span data-start="409.039" data-end="411.05">browsers are compensating for this and</span> <span data-start="411.05" data-end="413.33">so on it's still not ideal don't use</span> <span data-start="413.33" data-end="416.44">hover instead use click or better</span> <span data-start="416.44" data-end="418.09">actually build a menu that is designed</span> <span data-start="418.09" data-end="421.48">for touch okay obviously hopefully use</span> <span data-start="421.48" data-end="423.79">touch size buttons okay now the reason</span> <span data-start="423.79" data-end="425.71">for this is that the average human</span> <span data-start="425.71" data-end="429.61">finger is about 11 millimeters okay now</span> <span data-start="429.61" data-end="431.56">basketball players they're up kind of</span> <span data-start="431.56" data-end="435.34">the 19 20 millimeter range the babies</span> <span data-start="435.34" data-end="437.44">are kind of in this seven six seven</span> <span data-start="437.44" data-end="439.42">millimeter range but when you get to</span> <span data-start="439.42" data-end="441.67">this range you know it's it's kind of a</span> <span data-start="441.67" data-end="442.99">love it well I've got these big Moose</span> <span data-start="442.99" data-end="446.95">claws it's like 40 but anyways the so</span> <span data-start="446.95" data-end="449.5">one is obviously big touch things but</span> <span data-start="449.5" data-end="451.39">you also have to remember where your</span> <span data-start="451.39" data-end="453.55">users are so your users are going to be</span> <span data-start="453.55" data-end="455.86">using your device all over the place</span> <span data-start="455.86" data-end="457.18">they could be on the couch they could be</span> <span data-start="457.18" data-end="459.85">walking they could be on a bus and the</span> <span data-start="459.85" data-end="461.47">bus is kind of jiggling back and forth</span> <span data-start="461.47" data-end="466.21">you don't know where they are and so you</span> <span data-start="466.21" data-end="467.83">also have to remember that the touch</span> <span data-start="467.83" data-end="470.32">devices that there's a very large</span> <span data-start="470.32" data-end="473.41">percentage of missed taps okay where</span> <span data-start="473.41" data-end="474.43">they're

that they may</span> <span data-start="479.05" data-end="480.82">or may not actually hit the target think</span> <span data-start="480.82" data-end="482.14">about that as you're developing your</span> <span data-start="482.14" data-end="485.65">application okay remember where your</span> <span data-start="485.65" data-end="488.44">users are touching the device so if I've</span> <span

comfortable okay same thing goes</span> <span data-start="503.62" data-end="506.2">on a slate okay on a tablet I mean</span> <span data-start="506.2" data-end="508.51">anybody pick up their slates and

data-start="514.18" data-end="516.49">beyond that and it's not so think about</span> <span data-start="516.49" data-end="518.26">where you're putting your interactions</span> <span data-start="518.26" data-end="520.12">and so when you're thinking about your</span> <span data-start="520.12" data-end="522.849">interactions you should be there's a big</span> <span data-start="522.849" data-end="524.229">stand right there you should be looking</span> <span data-start="524.229" data-end="526.06">at kind of the very bottom and the</span> <span data-start="526.06" data-end="527.74">corners being the best possible</span> <span data-start="527.74" data-end="529.75">interaction so for example if you're</span> <span data-start="529.75" data-end="531.79">developing

data-start="580.45" data-end="583.72">towards the bottom okay remember that</span> <span data-start="583.72" data-end="585.459">there's more than one finger okay so</span> <span data-start="585.459" data-end="587.44">this gets to the part of a part of the</span> <span data-start="587.44" data-end="588.91">demo there was there is more than one</span> <span data-start="588.91" data-end="592.589">finger and so we want to be able to</span> <span data-start="592.589" data-end="596.709">scroll back and forth and and use more</span> <span data-start="596.709" data-end="598.42">than one finger for things like pinch</span> <span data-start="598.42" data-end="599.89">and zoom things like controlling both</span> <span data-start="599.89" data-end="601.51">sides of the screen there's a whole</span> <span data-start="601.51" data-end="602.709">bunch of different things that we can do</span> <span data-start="602.709" data-end="604.36">there and also remember that there's</span> <span data-start="604.36" data-end="607.54">more than one type of input okay so more</span> <span data-start="607.54" data-end="608.98">than one type of input you know I</span> <span data-start="608.98" data-end="611.23">already talked about the mouse and I are</span> <span data-start="611.23" data-end="612.63">you talking about the pin a little bit</span> <span data-start="612.63" data-end="615.49">the mouse and the pin are very important</span> <span data-start="615.49" data-end="620.38">parts of the user's input so from a</span> <span data-start="620.38" data-end="621.49">technical perspective now i'll talk</span> <span data-start="621.49" data-end="623.98">about the design side a little bit how</span> <span data-start="623.98" data-end="627.64">do we actually do this okay and so the</span> <span data-start="627.64" data-end="629.079">exciting part is there's actually one</span> <span data-start="629.079" data-end="631.6">set of events that we can catch that'll</span> <span data-start="631.6" data-end="633.459">actually catch all those different types</span> <span data-start="633.459" data-end="635.8">of inputs and can handle multiple types</span> <span data-start="635.8" data-end="638.23">of inputs okay all the same time and</span> <span data-start="638.23" data-end="643.45">it's pointers okay pointers is a is w3c</span> <span data-start="643.45" data-end="645.97">pointer standard Microsoft has been</span> <span data-start="645.97" data-end="648.7">working on this we've submitted it he's</span> <span data-start="648.7" data-end="650.47">telling I should be doing this one</span> <span data-start="650.47" data-end="652.39">here's a big grin on his face back there</span> <span data-start="652.39" data-end="656.47">so the events here actually very similar</span> <span data-start="656.47" data-end="657.94">to what you would be comfortable with if</span> <span data-start="657.94" data-end="660.97">you've done any Mouse work so pointer</span> <span data-start="660.97" data-end="662.68">down pointer move pointer out pointer</span> <span data-start="662.68" data-end="665.11">over pointer out and cancel okay those</span> <span data-start="665.11" data-end="666.97">are all very similar events to what you</span> <span data-start="666.97" data-end="669.61">would have for for a mouse so if you've</span> <span data-start="669.61" data-end="670.839">done anything with the mouse you're</span> <span data-start="670.839" data-end="673.12">ready to go with pointers okay the</span> <span data-start="673.12" data-end="674.68">exciting part is this is a new candidate</span> <span data-start="674.68" data-end="676.779">recommendation and what this is going to</span> <span data-start="676.779" data-end="678.97">do is capture all of our different types</span> <span data-start="678.97" data-end="681.91">of events and what we're going to get on</span> <span data-start="681.91" data-end="682.84">a</span> <span data-start="682.84" data-end="687.37">given event is we're actually going to</span> <span data-start="687.37" data-end="690.13">get the width of the touch okay are the</span> <span data-start="690.13" data-end="692.23">width of the of the the pointer we're</span> <span data-start="692.23" data-end="694.21">gonna get the height of it we're gonna</span> <span data-start="694.21" data-end="696.25">get the pressure if it's a pin you get</span> <span data-start="696.25" data-end="698.17">the tilt if it's a pin where do you get</span> <span data-start="698.17" data-end="700.74">the rotation if it's a pen or a mouse or</span> <span data-start="700.74" data-end="703.6">touch so if I touch it this way that's</span> <span data-start="703.6" data-end="704.98">different than if I touch it this way</span> <span data-start="704.98" data-end="705.97">which is different than I've had touched</span> <span data-start="705.97" data-end="708.13">it this way we may want to react to that</span> <span data-start="708.13" data-end="711.4">differently okay you get the pointer</span> <span data-start="711.4" data-end="715.51">type so was it a finger was it a and</span> <span data-start="715.51" data-end="716.65">actually I believe it just says touch</span> <span data-start="716.65" data-end="719.65">was it a pin or was it a mouse and it's</span> <span data-start="719.65" data-end="722.26">open for additional types of inputs as</span> <span data-start="722.26" data-end="725.53">we go forward the pointer ID you because</span> <span data-start="725.53" data-end="726.91">you can actually have more than one and</span> <span data-start="726.91" data-end="729.61">so we can have you know the demo I'll</span> <span data-start="729.61" data-end="731.17">show later I forget how many touch</span> <span data-start="731.17" data-end="732.1">points how many touch points to the</span> <span data-start="732.1" data-end="734.14">surface pro have five ok so I'll show</span> <span data-start="734.14" data-end="735.85">five plus a mouse and i'll see if i can</span> <span data-start="735.85" data-end="740.17">get a pin in there as well and then then</span> <span data-start="740.17" data-end="741.46">that you know the event type and so on</span> <span data-start="741.46" data-end="742.57">and so forth so there's a lot of</span> <span data-start="742.57" data-end="745.77">different things that come in with that</span> <span data-start="745.77" data-end="747.94">alright so let's go back over here and</span> <span data-start="747.94" data-end="759.21">let's fix this demo here so first of all</span> <span data-start="759.22" data-end="763.839">it's coming out that killed there okay</span> <span data-start="763.839" data-end="765.49">we don't need that code anymore and</span> <span data-start="765.49" data-end="770.05">instead I'm going to not that that is</span> <span data-start="770.05" data-end="773.889">the comment so you're gonna block</span> <span data-start="773.889" data-end="775.98">comment on that as well but oh well</span> <span data-start="775.98" data-end="778.449">alright so let me scroll out a little</span> <span data-start="778.449" data-end="779.8">bit and I'll show you what I just</span> <span data-start="779.8" data-end="782.56">uncommented there so this is exactly the</span> <span data-start="782.56" data-end="785.019">same code it's just copy pasted with ms</span> <span data-start="785.019" data-end="787.72">pointer up ms pointer up ms point or</span> <span data-start="787.72" data-end="790.3">move and ms pointer move what we're</span> <span data-start="790.3" data-end="794.379">doing here is we've got two basic blocks</span> <span data-start="794.379" data-end="797.29">and we're setting up the MS pointer up</span> <span data-start="797.29" data-end="799.18">and Emmet swinter move for the left</span> <span data-start="799.18" data-end="801.37">overlay and for the right overlay that</span> <span data-start="801.37" data-end="803.319">way we can actually control you know to</span> <span data-start="803.319" data-end="804.939">the two different sides the deuteron</span> <span data-start="804.939" data-end="807.1">paddles at the same time okay and so I'm</span> <span data-start="807.1" data-end="810.459">going to save that I come back over to</span> <span data-start="810.459" data-end="815.639">my little game and let's refresh and</span> <span data-start="815.639" data-end="818.56">we'll pick our little block here now but</span> <span data-start="818.56" data-end="822.73">now notice as I'm touching here both of</span> <span data-start="822.73" data-end="824.35">them are working one on either side</span> <span data-start="824.35" data-end="826.149">because there's more than one type of</span> <span data-start="826.149" data-end="832.6">touch and we'll see if we can get a one</span> <span data-start="832.6" data-end="834">little game here between the two of them</span> <span data-start="834" data-end="836.439">now what if I dropped my mouse over here</span> <span data-start="836.439" data-end="839.23">that's cool too so I can now do mouse</span> <span data-start="839.23" data-end="841.98">and pointer all at the same time and</span> <span data-start="841.98" data-end="844.48">that's fine or if I wanted to drag the</span> <span data-start="844.48" data-end="849.16">pin in here oops boom I've now got a pin</span> <span data-start="849.16" data-end="852.459">and mouse and finger and all them of</span> <span data-start="852.459" data-end="854.699">them will work at the same time okay</span> <span data-start="854.699" data-end="858.129">cool I think that's pretty awesome</span> <span data-start="858.129" data-end="862.209">alright so now this begs the question</span> <span data-start="862.209" data-end="865.149">though what happens and come back over</span> <span data-start="865.149" data-end="868.149">to hear so well you're a little too</span> <span data-start="868.149" data-end="869.29">briefly go through the code here and</span> <span data-start="869.29" data-end="877.129">then we'll then we'll take a look at the</span> <span data-start="877.139" data-end="879.73">need a little feedback on the mic I'm my</span> <span data-start="879.73" data-end="883.329">phone is way over there so i'll take a</span> <span data-start="883.329" data-end="884.319">look through the code a little bit and</span> <span data-start="884.319" data-end="885.899">then we'll then we'll talk about the the</span> <span data-start="885.899" data-end="887.86">obvious question what's the obvious</span> <span data-start="887.86" data-end="890.86">question</span> <span data-start="890.87" data-end="896.52">nobody what's that browser support very</span> <span data-start="896.52" data-end="900.72">good all right so very similar to how</span> <span data-start="900.72" data-end="903.63">you would do with a touch events we're</span> <span data-start="903.63" data-end="905.64">going to if you've done any that with</span> <span data-start="905.64" data-end="908.55">that one on iOS we're going to iterate</span> <span data-start="908.55" data-end="910.5">through just the list of pointers here</span> <span data-start="910.5" data-end="913.44">and say for this pointer we're going to</span> <span data-start="913.44" data-end="915.899">you know act upon it okay it's very very</span> <span data-start="915.899" data-end="918.75">simple to roll through you get a list of</span> <span data-start="918.75" data-end="921.41">those and you can get all the other</span> <span data-start="921.41" data-end="924.26">items off of like the pointer type the</span> <span data-start="924.26" data-end="928.16">tilt and so on and so forth if you're on</span> <span data-start="928.16" data-end="932.7">iOS or on Android you get these events</span> <span data-start="932.7" data-end="934.98">which are very hard to read it I'm</span> <span data-start="934.98" data-end="937.08">seeing from the cheap seats there in the</span> <span data-start="937.08" data-end="940.62">back but this is touch start here at the</span> <span data-start="940.62" data-end="942.959">top and then there's also touch in touch</span> <span data-start="942.959" data-end="945.3">move and so on and so forth the thing</span> <span data-start="945.3" data-end="949.37">both of those those events is that a</span> <span data-start="949.37" data-end="952.95">they are just touched they're not touch</span> <span data-start="952.95" data-end="955.88">and mouse and pen and everything else</span> <span data-start="955.88" data-end="960.24">second of all those are not a standard</span> <span data-start="960.24" data-end="962.7">they're not a w3c standard and are not</span> <span data-start="962.7" data-end="965.399">likely to become one because there are</span> <span data-start="965.399" data-end="967.709">multiple patents on the implementations</span> <span data-start="967.709" data-end="969.899">of touch start and touch end that are</span> <span data-start="969.899" data-end="971.339">not going to be licensed out to the</span> <span data-start="971.339" data-end="973.38">other browsers so there's there's some</span> <span data-start="973.38" data-end="976.11">issues with those which is why we</span> <span data-start="976.11" data-end="979.44">recommend staying away from those the</span> <span data-start="979.44" data-end="981.42">are not not recommend staying away it's</span> <span data-start="981.42" data-end="984">a don't use those as your only and we're</span> <span data-start="984" data-end="985.32">not going to be looking at those in</span> <span data-start="985.32" data-end="988.529">internet explorer but it's touch starts</span> <span data-start="988.529" data-end="991.62">and then we also have to add the mouse</span> <span data-start="991.62" data-end="994.61">here because we're doing both okay</span> <span data-start="994.61" data-end="997.17">because the mouse and touch we don't</span> <span data-start="997.17" data-end="999.18">want to just react to one of the other</span> <span data-start="999.18" data-end="1001.97">now does anybody spot the flaw in this</span> <span data-start="1001.97" data-end="1007.82">code here besides if you read it so at</span> <span data-start="1007.82" data-end="1010.01">the beginning it says if all in touch</span> <span data-start="1010.01" data-end="1011.87">starts in elements sorry</span> <span data-start="1011.87" data-end="1014.12">document.documentelement so if we're</span> <span data-start="1014.12" data-end="1018.77">able to do touch my button event handler</span> <span data-start="1018.77" data-end="1020.87">sorry did add add event handler touch</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1020.87" data-end="1024.199">Starks blah blah blah else add the</span> <span data-start="1024.199" data-end="1028.909">14 click for mouse can't do both at the</span> <span

data-start="1034.069" data-end="1036.189">to your websites and i have seen this in</span> <span data-start="1036.189" data-end="1038.659">probably three or four dozen websites as</span> <span

data-start="1043.88" data-end="1045.529">and i can't use the mouse anymore</span> <span data-start="1045.529" data-end="1047.899">because it detects that i have a touch</span> <span data-start="1047.899" data-end="1054.529">screen and freaks out whoops okay so so</span> <span data-start="1054.529" data-end="1057.26">don't do that so instead what we're</span> <span data-start="1057.26" data-end="1059.69">going to do is and I'm going to blow</span> <span data-start="1059.69" data-end="1062.36">this code up if i can and i zoom in a</span> <span data-start="1062.36" data-end="1066.83">little bit on this two hundred percent</span> <span data-start="1066.83" data-end="1073.789">and see now that is unworkable so I'll</span> <span data-start="1073.789" data-end="1075.5">just walk you through it sorry about</span> <span data-start="1075.5" data-end="1077.659">that the resolution on the screen is</span> <span data-start="1077.659" data-end="1081.59">crazy so what we've got is we've got a</span> <span data-start="1081.59" data-end="1085.49">if ms pointer enabled so are we able to</span> <span data-start="1085.49" data-end="1089.769">do the pointer events if so add those</span> <span data-start="1089.769" data-end="1092.75">otherwise we're going to add the touch</span> <span

data-start="1096.649" data-end="1098.659">back but I'm actually going to tell you</span> <span data-start="1098.659" data-end="1101.48">don't do that instead use one of the</span> <span data-start="1101.48" data-end="1103.669">polyfills for pointers okay so this gets</span> <span data-start="1103.669" data-end="1105.11">to the browsers support question which</span> <span

data-end="1124.88">it's the one that i've used the most of</span> <span data-start="1124.88" data-end="1128.09">the moment so let me come back over here</span> <span data-start="1128.09" data-end="1131.539">to this code and let me show you first</span> <span data-start="1131.539" data-end="1133.46">of all what happens in chrome at the</span> <span data-start="1133.46"
