<p><span data-start="479.15" data-end="482.48">I login then this funny authorization</span> <span data-start="482.48" data-end="485.99">token gets generated and on my console</span> <span

data-end="509.6">so far so good but all of one had some</span> <span data-start="509.6" data-end="515.24">flaws initially the client got the</span> <span data-start="515.24" data-end="518.57">redirect

data-end="546.73">your identity which is not really nice</span> <span data-start="546.73" data-end="550.07">so they came up in this this thing</span> <span data-start="550.07" data-end="554.27">called oh of one dot a or 10 a whatever</span> <span data-start="554.27" data-end="554.96">you like</span> <span data-start="554.96" data-end="558.68">and the idea was we move this now and to</span> <span data-start="558.68" data-end="560.87">be first step so you cannot just easily</span> <span data-start="560.87" data-end="563.84">modify the officer flow and therefore</span> <span data-start="563.84" data-end="566.45">it's much more secure and actually kind</span> <span data-start="566.45" data-end="570.83">of worked but having a look at this it's</span> <span data-start="570.83" data-end="572.81">kind of complex there's a lot of steps</span> <span data-start="572.81" data-end="576.23">involved and the issues this was not</span> <span data-start="576.23" data-end="577.73">really designed the things like mobile</span> <span data-start="577.73" data-end="579.74">and minds this was not designed with</span> <span data-start="579.74" data-end="582.14">things like embedded systems in mind so</span> <span data-start="582.14" data-end="584.66">it had to be simplified and there had to</span> <span data-start="584.66" data-end="589.51">be more scenarios so oh of two came up</span> <span data-start="589.51" data-end="592.43">so this was definitely focused on</span> <span data-start="592.43" data-end="595.13">simplicity this was focused on things</span> <span data-start="595.13" data-end="597.71">like different scenarios define a</span> <span data-start="597.71" data-end="601.09">framework basically released in 2012 and</span> <span data-start="601.09" data-end="604.04">everything seemed to be amazing it uses</span> <span data-start="604.04" data-end="606.71">bearer tokens which basically are used</span> <span data-start="606.71" data-end="608.75">to do the authorization via the header</span> <span data-start="608.75" data-end="611.03">it was much easier than all of one</span> <span data-start="611.03" data-end="613.25">because of one without using a library</span> <span data-start="613.25" data-end="615.89">on the client side was a

<span data-start="624.29" data-end="626.84">much easier really basically if you</span> <span data-start="626.84" data-end="628.52">understand how to set one single header</span> <span data-start="628.52" data-end="631.49">that's it that's all you need it's much</span> <span data-start="631.49" data-end="636.88">easier sadly there were again issues</span> <span data-start="636.88" data-end="642.26">let's have a look at the flow so instead</span> <span data-start="642.26" data-end="644.51">of doing something like generating this</span> <span data-start="644.51" data-end="647.33">request token that's kind of not really</span> <span data-start="647.33" data-end="649.91">is authorized we direct the user</span> <span data-start="649.91" data-end="653.18">immediately to the service again we</span> <span data-start="653.18" data-end="656.54">obtained the authorization again we get</span> <span data-start="656.54" data-end="658.7">the

got rid of</span> <span data-start="665.54" data-end="668.24">one whole step so there's this thing</span> <span data-start="668.24" data-end="669.95">called free leg or off and there's this</span> <span data-start="669.95" data-end="672.32">pin code to let go off and that's</span> <span data-start="672.32" data-end="674.72">basically what you see over here so if</span> <span data-start="674.72" data-end="678.46">you depend basically compare this</span> <span data-start="678.46" data-end="682.61">against this it's much easier and this</span> <span data-start="682.61" data-end="684.41">is why you don't have to feel around so</span> <span data-start="684.41" data-end="687.62">much with libraries anymore because it</span> <span data-start="687.62" data-end="688.62">gots basically</span> <span data-start="688.62" data-end="692.28">designed with easiness in mind now the</span> <span data-start="692.28" data-end="697.02">issue again is 0 of 2 was designed</span> <span
