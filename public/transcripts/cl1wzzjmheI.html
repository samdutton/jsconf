data-end="2732.2">good and it's what we should do to each</span> <span data-start="2732.2" data-end="2734.18">other much much more rather than</span> <span data-start="2734.18" data-end="2735.74">outbidding each other on who's the</span> <span data-start="2735.74" data-end="2737.72">coolest javascript developer of tomorrow</span> <span data-start="2737.72"

data-end="2778.32">of over engineering things and and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2778.32" data-end="2781.27">Kenley in delivering product and focused</span> <span data-start="2781.27" data-end="2784.09">too much on maybe performance and how</span> <span data-start="2784.09" data-end="2785.86">will you suggest us to balance between</span> <span data-start="2785.86" data-end="2789.88">these are these two things so the</span> <span data-start="2789.88" data-end="2792.01">question was to how do we how do we find</span> <span data-start="2792.01" data-end="2794.95">how do we stop ourselves from over from</span> <span data-start="2794.95" data-end="2797.11">over architecting and from thinking too</span> <span data-start="2797.11" data-end="2799.57">much about performance I think you can't</span> <span data-start="2799.57" data-end="2801.88">think too much about performance if it</span> <span data-start="2801.88" data-end="2803.47">means the performance of your end users</span> <span data-start="2803.47" data-end="2805.57">if it means the thing will run better on</span> <span data-start="2805.57" data-end="2807.73">the end machine that's great put as much</span> <span data-start="2807.73" data-end="2809.71">as time as you want in there and I'd</span> <span data-start="2809.71" data-end="2811.57">rather us work a week longer on a</span> <span data-start="2811.57" data-end="2813.34">product that is good for our end users</span> <span data-start="2813.34" data-end="2815.71">then to release it and say like where</span> <span data-start="2815.71" data-end="2818.11">the fastest engineers out there when it</span> <span data-start="2818.11" data-end="2820.24">comes to over architecting our things</span> <span data-start="2820.24" data-end="2822.13">and talking about the future is what I</span> <span data-start="2822.13" data-end="2824.62">said about we try to predict things of</span> <span data-start="2824.62" data-end="2826.96">the future that will come I'd rather</span> <span data-start="2826.96" data-end="2830.32">have a clean code that is easy to</span> <span data-start="2830.32" data-end="2833.02">understand then have a very generic code</span> <span data-start="2833.02" data-end="2834.94">that can deal with every situation out</span> <span data-start="2834.94" data-end="2837.01">there because this generic code will be</span> <span data-start="2837.01" data-end="2840.04">used to ten percent of what it can do in</span> <span data-start="2840.04" data-end="2843.58">most of the cases so I think if you find</span> <span data-start="2843.58" data-end="2845.74">that you're using only a part of what</span> <span data-start="2845.74" data-end="2848.53">you've written then you have wasted a</span> <span data-start="2848.53" data-end="2851.02">lot of time at the same time to release</span> <span data-start="2851.02" data-end="2852.58">it as a JavaScript library and when how</span> <span data-start="2852.58" data-end="2856.4">can use for a day that makes us excited</span> <span data-start="2856.41" data-end="2858.82">performance is the most important thing</span> <span data-start="2858.82" data-end="2860.83">in terms of what our end users have</span> <span data-start="2860.83" data-end="2863.65">performance of us as developers how much</span> <span data-start="2863.65" data-end="2866.11">code can we turn out in a month is what</span> <span data-start="2866.11" data-end="2868.27">made us what made the web so broken</span> <span data-start="2868.27" data-end="2870.49">right now it's not about how much code</span> <span data-start="2870.49" data-end="2872.2">we write its how much clever code we</span> <span data-start="2872.2" data-end="2874.93">write how much our code does to our end</span> <span data-start="2874.93" data-end="2877.48">users and that also means we have to</span> <span data-start="2877.48" data-end="2878.92">communicate much more with other</span> <span data-start="2878.92" data-end="2880.92">departments where I found ourselves</span> <span data-start="2880.92" data-end="2883.36">architecting wrongly as well is that we</span> <span data-start="2883.36" data-end="2885.07">think as developers we have to do</span> <span data-start="2885.07" data-end="2887.47">everything I found for example paper</span> <span data-start="2887.47" data-end="2890.47">prototyping when Yahoo made us go</span> <span data-start="2890.47" data-end="2890.95">through like</span> <span data-start="2890.95" data-end="2892.99">five iterations of a tool before we</span> <span data-start="2892.99" data-end="2894.609">actually build it and we spent the time</span> <span data-start="2894.609" data-end="2896.2">that people spend paid a paper</span> <span data-start="2896.2" data-end="2898.329">prototyping with end users to write the</span> <span data-start="2898.329" data-end="2901.839">data API is instead so parallel work on</span> <span data-start="2901.839" data-end="2903.52">different parts of the interface is a</span> <span data-start="2903.52" data-end="2905.05">very important thing we can only do that</span> <span data-start="2905.05" data-end="2907.15">when we start communicating with other</span> <span data-start="2907.15" data-end="2908.95">parts of our company and not only do</span> <span data-start="2908.95" data-end="2911.079">everything in engineering talking to</span> <span data-start="2911.079" data-end="2913.03">humans I know it's scary but it's a good</span> <span

data-start="2918.339" data-end="2920.89">focus on life was too shiny new</span> <span data-start="2920.89" data-end="2924.46">framework but if um how do you convince</span> <span data-start="2924.46" data-end="2926.89">companies that even if you don't know</span> <span data-start="2926.89" data-end="2930.18">framework X you're a very good developer</span> <span data-start="2930.18" data-end="2934.359">mmm that is a really good question so</span> <span data-start="2934.359" data-end="2936.22">companies won't want you to see the</span> <span data-start="2936.22"

data-end="2941.56">way and I think that's where the whole</span> <span data-start="2941.56" data-end="2946">hype thing went pear-shaped in terms of</span> <span data-start="2946" data-end="2948.13">like in terms of how do you convince</span> <span data-start="2948.13" data-end="2949.78">companies you show them how much you</span> <span data-start="2949.78" data-end="2952.089">really know about the basics you you</span> <span data-start="2952.089" data-end="2954.369">shouldn't just guard new frameworks that</span> <span data-start="2954.369"

data-end="2959.92">use case is there in if you come to an</span> <span data-start="2959.92" data-end="2961.39">interview and they say look well what do</span> <span data-start="2961.39" data-end="2962.68">you think about react and you say like</span> <span data-start="2962.68" data-end="2964.24">for this kind of application that kind</span> <span data-start="2964.24" data-end="2965.829">of stuff and that kind of things it's a</span> <span data-start="2965.829" data-end="2967.869">really good idea whereas most of the</span> <span data-start="2967.869" data-end="2969.43">time I would go for this kind of</span> <span data-start="2969.43" data-end="2970.96">solution because then it performs better</span> <span data-start="2970.96"
