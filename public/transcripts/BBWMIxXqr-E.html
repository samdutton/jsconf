probably doesn't really matter if</span> <span data-start="21.93" data-end="23.43">I have a microphone or not but anyway</span> <span data-start="23.43" data-end="26.58">this is probably better so that was a</span> <span data-start="26.58" data-end="28.08">really great introduction so I can just</span> <span data-start="28.08" data-end="32.489">skip all the stuff about me this is last</span> <span data-start="32.489" data-end="34.53">year I attended jazz con for ages so</span> <span data-start="34.53" data-end="35.79">it's really cool to actually be standing</span> <span data-start="35.79" data-end="39.18">on stage this time but what I'm gonna do</span> <span data-start="39.18" data-end="40.71">is jump right in and tell you about the</span> <span data-start="40.71" data-end="41.85">talk today I'm going to talk about</span> <span data-start="41.85" data-end="44.76">variable fonts we're gonna do a quick</span> <span data-start="44.76" data-end="46.559">explanation of what they are for</span> <span data-start="46.559" data-end="49.02">everyone that doesn't know I will very</span> <span data-start="49.02" data-end="51.75">very briefly touch on performance and</span> <span data-start="51.75" data-end="52.8">then we'll just look at some ways that</span> <span data-start="52.8" data-end="54.6">you can implement them to do some</span> <span data-start="54.6" data-end="57.75">practical things but my favorite demos</span> <span data-start="57.75" data-end="59.25">are the ones that are a bit fun so</span> <span data-start="59.25" data-end="62.789">there's quite a few of those so what's</span> <span data-start="62.789" data-end="64.47">important to know is that I'm a</span> <span data-start="64.47" data-end="68.25">developer I love to design that looks</span> <span data-start="68.25" data-end="73.28">really terrible but oh well hopefully oh</span> <span data-start="73.28" data-end="78.299">wow it looks so pixelated that's so sad</span> <span data-start="78.299" data-end="81.24">okay well I guess we'll just have to</span> <span data-start="81.24" data-end="83.939">live with that so I started creating</span> <span data-start="83.939" data-end="85.47">text effects like a couple of years ago</span> <span data-start="85.47" data-end="88.86">and during my experiments I started</span> <span data-start="88.86" data-end="90.299">playing with variable fonts and it</span> <span data-start="90.299" data-end="92.7">became really clear to me very quickly</span> <span data-start="92.7" data-end="94.32">that they offer a lot of unique</span> <span data-start="94.32" data-end="96.39">opportunities that standard fonts just</span> <span data-start="96.39" data-end="100.71">can't provide us so the reason for that</span> <span data-start="100.71" data-end="103.89">is that mobile fonts are basically one</span> <span data-start="103.89" data-end="105.689">font file that acts like multiple fonts</span> <span data-start="105.689" data-end="108.21">and that's basically the crux of what</span> <span data-start="108.21" data-end="110.34">they are and what that means is that</span> <span data-start="110.34" data-end="113.22">where we might have normally had maybe</span> <span data-start="113.22" data-end="115.649">six different font styles as separate</span> <span data-start="115.649" data-end="118.32">individual files you can now have all of</span> <span data-start="118.32" data-end="122.45">that information in the one file instead</span> <span data-start="122.45" data-end="124.86">that looks not too bad so that's good</span> <span data-start="124.86" data-end="127.5">the way this is achieved all comes down</span> <span data-start="127.5" data-end="129.42">to the way that the font itself is</span> <span data-start="129.42" data-end="132.54">created so a variable font can have one</span> <span data-start="132.54" data-end="133.15">or more</span> <span data-start="133.15" data-end="135.579">maxi's and what they do is provide</span> <span data-start="135.579" data-end="137.349">different variations between different</span> <span data-start="137.349" data-end="140.2">extremes so in this case we have a light</span> <span data-start="140.2" data-end="141.64">- a bold weight</span> <span data-start="141.64" data-end="144.79">now along that axis you can have named</span> <span data-start="144.79" data-end="147.79">instances like regular and bold which is</span> <span data-start="147.79" data-end="149.439">things that we're used to seeing in our</span> <span data-start="149.439" data-end="152.5">code on the web but you also gain the</span> <span data-start="152.5" data-end="156.37">ability to interpolate between those</span> <span data-start="156.37" data-end="159.28">values and this allows for intermediate</span> <span data-start="159.28" data-end="161.829">designs providing much finer control</span> <span data-start="161.829" data-end="164.95">over the font itself so along with those</span> <span data-start="164.95" data-end="167.23">standard values you can have everything</span> <span data-start="167.23" data-end="171.31">in between as well like I don't know 207</span> <span data-start="171.31" data-end="173.97">and that includes decimal places and</span> <span data-start="173.97" data-end="176.709">because the axis is interpolated it</span> <span data-start="176.709" data-end="178.87">means that we can animate between the</span> <span data-start="178.87" data-end="180.28">values creating really smooth</span> <span data-start="180.28" data-end="183.849">transitions between the variations but</span> <span data-start="183.849" data-end="186.099">we're not just limited to a single axis</span> <span data-start="186.099" data-end="188.019">at a time a variable font can contain</span> <span data-start="188.019" data-end="191.92">thousands of axes and what you get out</span> <span data-start="191.92" data-end="194.079">of this is the interpolation isn't just</span> <span data-start="194.079" data-end="196.209">applied to one axis at a time it's</span> <span data-start="196.209" data-end="197.799">applied to the combinations of those</span> <span data-start="197.799" data-end="198.91">axes as well</span> <span data-start="198.91" data-end="202.599">so if you wanted to have a wide heavy</span> <span data-start="202.599" data-end="205.569">font or a really narrow thin font you</span> <span data-start="205.569" data-end="208.889">can have that all within the one file so</span> <span data-start="208.889" data-end="212.26">in essence a variable font gives us a</span> <span data-start="212.26" data-end="214.419">single file with a greater amount of</span> <span data-start="214.419" data-end="216.669">variation and a significant increase in</span> <span data-start="216.669" data-end="219.159">style choices and they don't just have</span> <span data-start="219.159" data-end="221.199">to be standard things like font weight</span> <span data-start="221.199" data-end="223.69">or width it can be something totally</span> <span data-start="223.69" data-end="226.18">different or a little bit weird like</span> <span data-start="226.18" data-end="228.43">deco bar this is probably my favorite</span> <span data-start="228.43" data-end="232">font it's by a designer called David</span> <span data-start="232" data-end="234.519">bellow it's the first one that I ever</span> <span data-start="234.519" data-end="236.62">played with and it has a lot of</span> <span data-start="236.62" data-end="238.659">different creative axes in it that you</span> <span data-start="238.659" data-end="240.129">can do awesome things with then we'll</span> <span data-start="240.129" data-end="243.94">have a look at some demos later now the</span> <span data-start="243.94" data-end="246.19">way that we use variable fonts is really</span> <span data-start="246.19" data-end="247.9">similar to how we would normally use</span> <span data-start="247.9" data-end="252.069">fonts on the web for the most part we</span> <span data-start="252.069" data-end="253.87">set it up exactly the same way as we</span> <span data-start="253.87" data-end="255.97">normally would in our CSS using font</span> <span data-start="255.97" data-end="258.88">face the main difference is how we</span> <span data-start="258.88" data-end="261.13">define variations for descriptors like</span> <span data-start="261.13" data-end="263.71">font weight font stretch and font style</span> <span data-start="263.71" data-end="266.35">so in this example</span> <span data-start="266.35" data-end="268.15">might have previously set a font face</span> <span data-start="268.15" data-end="270.43">block for the light version and then we</span> <span data-start="270.43" data-end="272.47">do another one for the bold version and</span> <span data-start="272.47" data-end="274.2">so on until we'd hit all of our styles</span> <span data-start="274.2" data-end="276.31">but with variable fonts you don't need</span> <span data-start="276.31" data-end="278.44">to do that you can simply define a range</span> <span data-start="278.44" data-end="280.42">for the font weight so in this case I'm</span> <span data-start="280.42" data-end="285.67">going to hundred to 700 and then from</span> <span data-start="285.67" data-end="288.4">here when we reference it in our CSS we</span> <span data-start="288.4" data-end="289.81">do it exactly the same way that we</span> <span data-start="289.81" data-end="291.61">normally would but instead of being</span> <span data-start="291.61" data-end="295.75">limited to values like bold or 700 you</span> <span data-start="295.75" data-end="298.81">can pick any number between 200 and 700</span> <span data-start="298.81" data-end="303.07">like 658 now this is really really good</span> <span data-start="303.07" data-end="304.9">for something like weight because we've</span> <span data-start="304.9" data-end="307.63">already got a CSS property that we can</span> <span data-start="307.63" data-end="310.78">use in the land of variable fonts this</span> <span data-start="310.78" data-end="312.97">is known as a registered axis and all</span> <span data-start="312.97" data-end="314.29">that means is that it's been</span> <span data-start="314.29" data-end="316.96">standardized in the spec at the moment</span> <span data-start="316.96" data-end="319.27">there are five registered axes weight</span> <span data-start="319.27" data-end="323.17">with slant italic and optical sized and</span> <span data-start="323.17" data-end="325.69">they're all matched to preexisting CSS</span> <span data-start="325.69" data-end="328">properties but if you want to use</span> <span data-start="328" data-end="329.95">something more custom like the deck of</span> <span data-start="329.95" data-end="331.84">our examples we're going to need a new</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="331.84" data-end="334.33">CSS property and that's called font</span> <span data-start="334.33" data-end="337.03">variation settings now this is an</span> <span data-start="337.03" data-end="339.55">example of a font that I have invented</span> <span data-start="339.55" data-end="342.28">called my jello font jello is the name</span> <span data-start="342.28" data-end="344.2">of my dog he does feature in this</span> <span data-start="344.2" data-end="347.14">presentation so look out he's very cute</span> <span data-start="347.14" data-end="350.5">and in font variation settings you can</span> <span data-start="350.5" data-end="352.87">define as many registered or custom axes</span> <span data-start="352.87" data-end="355.48">as you want so here I have two custom</span> <span data-start="355.48" data-end="357.46">axes one is called jello and one is</span> <span data-start="357.46" data-end="359.56">called fellow and they both have an</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="359.56" data-end="362.68">Associated number value custom access</span> <span data-start="362.68" data-end="364.87">codes are defined by the font creator</span> <span data-start="364.87" data-end="367.15">inside the font and they're always four</span> <span data-start="367.15" data-end="369.55">characters whereas a registered axis</span> <span data-start="369.55" data-end="373.48">that's defined in the spec now as I said</span> <span data-start="373.48" data-end="375.46">you can use registered axes in front</span> <span data-start="375.46" data-end="377.62">variation settings however it is</span> <span data-start="377.62" data-end="379.39">strongly recommended that you use their</span> <span data-start="379.39" data-end="381.73">map CSS property instead so we like font</span> <span data-start="381.73" data-end="384.37">weight and the reason for this is it's</span> <span data-start="384.37" data-end="386.74">not really this is kind of like a backup</span> <span data-start="386.74" data-end="389.14">if the axis doesn't exist because</span> <span data-start="389.14" data-end="391.27">there's a lot of custom stuff but to be</span> <span data-start="391.27" data-end="393.58">honest it's way easier to manage your</span> <span data-start="393.58" data-end="395.44">typography if you use the map properties</span> <span data-start="395.44" data-end="399.85">when you can anyway and I'm sure people</span> <span data-start="399.85" data-end="400.24">one</span> <span data-start="400.24" data-end="401.919">about browser support it's actually</span> <span data-start="401.919" data-end="403.569">really really good</span> <span data-start="403.569" data-end="405.85">ie doesn't support it but that's not</span> <span data-start="405.85" data-end="407.74">unexpected they're not developing that</span> <span data-start="407.74" data-end="408.19">anymore</span> <span data-start="408.19" data-end="413.229">so you know it's fair the only caveat to</span> <span data-start="413.229" data-end="416.05">this browser support is you do need more</span> <span data-start="416.05" data-end="419.169">modern operating systems so on Mac I</span> <span data-start="419.169" data-end="421.21">believe it's high sierra some of the</span> <span data-start="421.21" data-end="423.569">browser's rely on the operating system</span> <span data-start="423.569" data-end="428.199">versions in order to for it to render if</span> <span data-start="428.199" data-end="429.91">you are worried about browser support</span> <span data-start="429.91" data-end="431.56">and you have to support ie still which a</span> <span data-start="431.56" data-end="435.55">lot of us do you can use the CSS feature</span> <span data-start="435.55" data-end="438.13">detection to detect for support of font</span> <span data-start="438.13" data-end="440.56">variation settings and then you can fall</span> <span data-start="440.56" data-end="445.06">back to a standard font if variable</span> <span data-start="445.06" data-end="446.59">fonts are not supported so there are</span> <span data-start="446.59" data-end="449.11">options there for us if we need to</span> <span data-start="449.11" data-end="450.43">support it in browsers that don't</span> <span data-start="450.43" data-end="452.409">currently support variable fonts but to</span> <span data-start="452.409" data-end="454.12">be honest it's pretty good and you're</span> <span data-start="454.12" data-end="455.59">probably going to get away with it I'm</span> <span data-start="455.59" data-end="461.199">using them for most use cases so as I</span> <span data-start="461.199" data-end="463.3">said earlier I did want to briefly talk</span> <span data-start="463.3" data-end="465.099">about performance because it's a</span> <span data-start="465.099" data-end="466.69">question people often ask there's a</span> <span data-start="466.69" data-end="468.31">whole lot of stuff around web font</span> <span data-start="468.31" data-end="471.759">performance that can impact this I'm not</span> <span data-start="471.759" data-end="474.37">gonna go into it because that's like 40</span> <span data-start="474.37" data-end="476.289">minutes of a talk on its own but</span> <span data-start="476.289" data-end="477.909">essentially everything that you apply to</span> <span data-start="477.909" data-end="480.4">web fonts on the web now also apply to</span> <span data-start="480.4" data-end="482.44">variable fonts but there are a couple of</span> <span data-start="482.44" data-end="484.18">things that I wanted to specifically</span> <span data-start="484.18" data-end="485.65">mention because I get asked about it a</span> <span data-start="485.65" data-end="488.139">lot the first one is the number of font</span> <span data-start="488.139" data-end="490.15">requests and the second one is font file</span> <span data-start="490.15" data-end="493.8">size so often when we think about</span> <span data-start="493.8" data-end="496.12">reducing the number of font requests to</span> <span data-start="496.12" data-end="498.099">improve our font performance it means</span> <span data-start="498.099" data-end="499.78">that we would plan our typography</span> <span data-start="499.78" data-end="501.52">choices and we'd weigh up the cost of</span> <span data-start="501.52" data-end="503.889">design over the cost of performance and</span> <span data-start="503.889" data-end="506.409">this is why we have that rule where you</span> <span data-start="506.409" data-end="508.27">can only have like three fonts in your</span> <span data-start="508.27" data-end="512.05">website that's an employee's limitation</span> <span data-start="512.05" data-end="514.75">because of things like performance but</span> <span data-start="514.75" data-end="516.789">because variable fonts can contain all</span> <span data-start="516.789" data-end="519.279">that information in one file that means</span> <span data-start="519.279" data-end="521.14">we've immediately reduced the number of</span> <span data-start="521.14" data-end="523.209">font requests simply by using a variable</span> <span data-start="523.209" data-end="528.279">font however if all of that information</span> <span data-start="528.279" data-end="530.94">now exists in one file instead of three</span> <span data-start="530.94" data-end="533.6">what's that going to do to file size</span> <span data-start="533.6" data-end="537.89">so that brings me to file sizes you'd be</span> <span data-start="537.89" data-end="539.81">right in assuming that a variable phone</span> <span data-start="539.81" data-end="541.82">is going to be larger than a standard</span> <span data-start="541.82" data-end="545.06">font typically not always but typically</span> <span data-start="545.06" data-end="547.22">so I want to give you a bit of a</span> <span data-start="547.22" data-end="549.65">comparison I'm gonna use source sans Pro</span> <span data-start="549.65" data-end="551.83">which is on github</span> <span data-start="551.83" data-end="554.84">the single weight of source sans Pro is</span> <span data-start="554.84" data-end="556.46">approximately two hundred and thirty</span> <span data-start="556.46" data-end="558.29">four kilobytes it varies a little bit</span> <span data-start="558.29" data-end="560.33">depending on the style but about that in</span> <span data-start="560.33" data-end="563.39">the OTF file version now if we use a</span> <span data-start="563.39" data-end="565.22">more efficient front weight format like</span> <span data-start="565.22" data-end="566.93">wofe two that will drop down to about</span> <span data-start="566.93" data-end="569.12">one hundred and eleven kilobytes that</span> <span data-start="569.12" data-end="570.74">still seems like a lot but keep in mind</span> <span data-start="570.74"
