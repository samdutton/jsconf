data-start="184.53" data-end="186.69">is open type features and CSS how you</span> <span data-start="186.69" data-end="188.4">can use them so it's fine you can</span> <span data-start="188.4"

<span data-start="209.34" data-end="211.32">soon I hope and of course the more</span> <span data-start="211.32" data-end="212.88">people clamor for it and say we want</span> <span data-start="212.88" data-end="214.11">this to be implemented the more the</span> <span data-start="214.11" data-end="215.549">browser's are likely to actually do</span> <span data-start="215.549" data-end="217.41">something about it in a reasonable</span> <span data-start="217.41" data-end="221.519">timeframe so basics and by the way this</span> <span data-start="221.519" data-end="222.93">picture here did people know what this</span> <span data-start="222.93" data-end="229.86">is the metal box yes what is it yes</span> <span data-start="229.86" data-end="231.33">that's right it's metal blocks that we</span> <span data-start="231.33" data-end="232.92">use to actually print on paper and</span> <span data-start="232.92" data-end="234.6">that's where the idea of an M Square</span> <span data-start="234.6" data-end="236.4">comes from you had all your letters on</span> <span data-start="236.4" data-end="238.35">an actual block of metal and the

data-start="249.75" data-end="250.53">a number</span> <span data-start="250.53" data-end="253.11">it's a code pointer unicode code point</span> <span data-start="253.11" data-end="255.239">not just a code point though it also has</span> <span data-start="255.239" data-end="259.38">some properties so for example a is 65</span> <span data-start="259.38" data-end="262.229">but it's also the property of not a</span> <span data-start="262.229" data-end="265.86">number and not punctuation and has a</span> <span data-start="265.86" data-end="268.35">different case form things like that so</span> <span data-start="268.35" data-end="269.82">these are properties of characters</span> <span data-start="269.82" data-end="271.979">characters can be used without rendering</span> <span

data-end="2231.43">there's my fonts directory that I'm</span> <span data-start="2231.43" data-end="2234.4">using there's the kafeel now I don't</span> <span data-start="2234.4" data-end="2241.24">want it there stupid thing and it has</span> <span data-start="2241.24" data-end="2243.04">produced four different fonts why four</span> <span data-start="2243.04" data-end="2245.17">because there are four different ways of</span> <span data-start="2245.17" data-end="2248.95">doing this there's the way that Google</span> <span data-start="2248.95" data-end="2251.23">does it which involves using PNG images</span> <span data-start="2251.23" data-end="2253.74">all different sizes which kind of sucks</span> <span data-start="2253.74" data-end="2255.94">there's the way Apple does it which is</span> <span data-start="2255.94" data-end="2257.829">called s fix which is an undocumented</span> <span data-start="2257.829" data-end="2259.839">thing which also uses raster images and</span> <span

data-end="2269.65">which is what I was telling you about</span> <span data-start="2269.65" data-end="2271.299">earlier okay so we have these four</span> <span data-start="2271.299" data-end="2277.96">things let us see if this doesn't work</span> <span data-start="2277.96" data-end="2281.049">then it's okay because I do actually</span> <span data-start="2281.049" data-end="2284.74">have a backup</span> <span data-start="2284.75" data-end="2291.2">quick look what did I do for this yeah</span> <span data-start="2291.2" data-end="2293.349">that looks what right doesn't it</span> <span data-start="2293.349" data-end="2303.39">okay and</span> <span data-start="2303.4" data-end="2311.329">okay let's quickly recover from that as</span> <span data-start="2311.329" data-end="2313.28">they say in cooking programs here the</span> <span data-start="2313.28" data-end="2328.64">ones I prepared earlier</span> <span data-start="2328.65" data-end="2343.42">yes really do thank you</span> <span data-start="2343.43" data-end="2346.2">okay so this is the first format that is</span> <span data-start="2346.2" data-end="2349.229">useful it uses a an open type table</span> <span data-start="2349.229" data-end="2352.289">called color which holds a stack of true</span> <span data-start="2352.289" data-end="2354.089">type outlines the first one will be used</span> <span data-start="2354.089" data-end="2355.979">as a fallback if you eat color fonts are</span> <span data-start="2355.979" data-end="2357.93">not supported and then there's another</span> <span data-start="2357.93" data-end="2361.229">one called pal see pal which holds the</span> <span data-start="2361.229" data-end="2363.15">palettes so you have you saw me</span> <span data-start="2363.15" data-end="2364.859">selecting the colors there those colors</span> <span data-start="2364.859" data-end="2367.739">go into the font itself and there's the</span> <span data-start="2367.739" data-end="2369.029">white actually that's the ones I picked</span> <span data-start="2369.029" data-end="2371.239">last time owners practicing this demo so</span> <span data-start="2371.239" data-end="2373.95">okay that works and this is just you</span> <span data-start="2373.95" data-end="2375.989">know it's a single line of text we have</span> <span data-start="2375.989" data-end="2377.63">got multiple lines or anything like that</span> <span data-start="2377.63" data-end="2379.859">so it's pretty good right it's working</span> <span data-start="2379.859" data-end="2384.38">well can anyone see a problem with it</span> <span data-start="2384.38" data-end="2390.69">yes the color property yeah exactly in</span> <span data-start="2390.69" data-end="2392.43">fact how do i style any of this we've</span> <span data-start="2392.43" data-end="2394.89">lost something haven't we where did the</span> <span data-start="2394.89" data-end="2396.39">styling go they have colors are now</span> <span data-start="2396.39" data-end="2399.059">baked into the font which is fine if</span> <span data-start="2399.059" data-end="2400.47">you're making your own fonts but if</span> <span data-start="2400.47" data-end="2401.849">you're buying them or something that's</span> <span data-start="2401.849" data-end="2409.019">really not very helpful is it so let's</span> <span data-start="2409.019" data-end="2411.69">have another option so SVG so you've</span> <span data-start="2411.69" data-end="2413.489">heard of SVG fonts right I didn't</span> <span data-start="2413.489" data-end="2414.719">mention them earlier but you've heard of</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2414.719" data-end="2416.579">SVG fonts and you know that you</span> <span data-start="2416.579" data-end="2419.969">shouldn't use them ever okay good he was</span> <span data-start="2419.969" data-end="2421.71">a hottie was a temporary hack at a time</span> <span data-start="2421.71" data-end="2423.119">when we didn't have reliable</span> <span data-start="2423.119" data-end="2425.039">downloadable fonts okay it served its</span> <span data-start="2425.039" data-end="2426.719">purpose it had really terrible</span> <span data-start="2426.719" data-end="2428.579">internationalization it was only ever</span> <span data-start="2428.579" data-end="2430.319">intended as a throw away temporary</span> <span data-start="2430.319" data-end="2432.18">stopgap so don't use them they're</span> <span data-start="2432.18" data-end="2435.69">terrible so it's much the same you have</span> <span data-start="2435.69" data-end="2438.479">an SVG table which contains some SVG</span> <span data-start="2438.479" data-end="2440.489">which can do anything so I mean that's</span> <span data-start="2440.489" data-end="2442.41">the problem with the the previous thing</span> <span data-start="2442.41" data-end="2445.049">each each overlay is a solid color</span> <span data-start="2445.049" data-end="2446.489">that's all you can have is a solid color</span> <span data-start="2446.489" data-end="2449.609">fill and then you've got C pal</span> <span data-start="2449.609" data-end="2451.529">optionally to have these palettes and</span> <span data-start="2451.529" data-end="2454.44">then you use CSS variables to alter the</span> <span data-start="2454.44" data-end="2457.109">palette so this is the neat this is one</span> <span data-start="2457.109" data-end="2458.729">of the other ones this is the SVG one</span> <span data-start="2458.729" data-end="2460.829">that I exported looks much the same I</span> <span data-start="2460.829" data-end="2462.45">mean here it's not using the SVG it's</span> <span data-start="2462.45" data-end="2464.009">not using gradients or doing anything</span> <span data-start="2464.009" data-end="2467.85">fancy it's just overlaid solid text</span> <span data-start="2467.85" data-end="2471.22">but let's see how we can do this so I've</span> <span data-start="2471.22" data-end="2475.75">used different colors here let's pick</span> <span data-start="2475.75" data-end="2478.05">something and make it really hideous</span> <span data-start="2478.05" data-end="2481.38">let's change the hue there and change</span> <span data-start="2481.38" data-end="2487.99">the hue there and maybe the saturation</span> <span data-start="2487.99" data-end="2494.44">and let's change that white to yellow</span> <span data-start="2494.44" data-end="2498.58">and yeah okay so we can using CSS</span> <span data-start="2498.58" data-end="2500.53">variables and these are pre these are</span> <span data-start="2500.53" data-end="2502.51">predefined in the spec it says you must</span> <span data-start="2502.51" data-end="2504.46">have them called color zero two color N</span> <span data-start="2504.46" data-end="2506.77">and they will correspond to entries in</span> <span data-start="2506.77" data-end="2508.78">the palette and you can therefore style</span> <span data-start="2508.78" data-end="2511.09">and the SVG ones themselves</span> <span data-start="2511.09" data-end="2512.8">you can't style the other ones though</span> <span data-start="2512.8" data-end="2515.68">the the TrueType ones they're not style</span> <span data-start="2515.68" data-end="2518.02">like that which is a shame but okay at</span> <span data-start="2518.02" data-end="2523.48">least this one works so it's now I've</span> <span data-start="2523.48" data-end="2525.37">been telling you about css3 fonts let's</span> <span data-start="2525.37" data-end="2527.11">talk about CSS for fonts which is</span> <span data-start="2527.11" data-end="2529.09">basically about two pages long and full</span> <span data-start="2529.09" data-end="2530.8">of jotted down ideas on the back of an</span> <span data-start="2530.8" data-end="2532.96">envelope one of which is a thing called</span> <span data-start="2532.96" data-end="2535.15">font palette so you can have multiple</span> <span data-start="2535.15" data-end="2537.04">palettes in these fonts you can have for</span> <span data-start="2537.04" data-end="2538.96">example one that's designed for text set</span> <span data-start="2538.96" data-end="2540.52">on the dark background and one on light</span> <span data-start="2540.52" data-end="2542.26">background so this lets you select</span> <span data-start="2542.26" data-end="2546.1">between available palettes also an app</span> <span data-start="2546.1" data-end="2548.53">palette entries function which lets you</span> <span data-start="2548.53" data-end="2550.3">override specific palette entries so</span> <span data-start="2550.3" data-end="2552.37">instead of relying on using CSS</span> <span data-start="2552.37" data-end="2554.08">variables and having the SVG actually</span> <span data-start="2554.08" data-end="2556.42">have var functions to call up those</span> <span data-start="2556.42" data-end="2558.61">instead it says no let's just override</span> <span data-start="2558.61" data-end="2561.28">the power directly just just override</span> <span data-start="2561.28" data-end="2562.99">individual palette entries and that's</span> <span data-start="2562.99" data-end="2564.88">how you would do that using app palette</span> <span data-start="2564.88" data-end="2569.47">entries lastly I mentioned font</span> <span data-start="2569.47" data-end="2571.66">synthesis already and said you can</span> <span data-start="2571.66" data-end="2573.67">switch off fake bold and you can switch</span> <span data-start="2573.67" data-end="2575.65">off fake italic there is another</span> <span data-start="2575.65" data-end="2577.87">abomination waiting to be killed which</span> <span data-start="2577.87" data-end="2580.69">is fake small caps and you do fake small</span> <span data-start="2580.69" data-end="2582.58">caps by taking a capital and squashing</span> <span data-start="2582.58" data-end="2584.08">it down and making it smaller which</span> <span data-start="2584.08" data-end="2585.61">means it's in there and lighter than it</span> <span data-start="2585.61" data-end="2586.96">should be compared to the other glyphs</span> <span data-start="2586.96" data-end="2588.79">that looks kind of ugly so this will be</span> <span data-start="2588.79" data-end="2592.81">a way to disable that too and lastly you</span> <span data-start="2592.81" data-end="2594.43">know about the font families you know</span> <span data-start="2594.43" data-end="2597.05">the serif and sans serif and and</span> <span data-start="2597.05" data-end="2600.02">to see has anyone ever used generic font</span> <span data-start="2600.02"
