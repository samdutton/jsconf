<p><span data-start="95.45" data-end="97.67">Web developers.</span> <span data-start="97.67" data-end="101.24">What about web designers?</span> <span data-start="101.24" data-end="106.1">My name is Razvan, and, today, I want to talk about DevTools for web designers.</span> <span data-start="106.1" data-end="111.29">I'm a software engineer at Mozilla, I work on Firefox DevTools, and, previously to this,</span> <span data-start="111.29" data-end="117.2">I worked on a bunch of things at Adobe like CSS Shapes, regions, masking, blend modes,</span> <span data-start="117.2" data-end="120.62">and many other things that never actually made it.</span> <span data-start="120.62" data-end="125.65">Throughout my career, I always have been interested in the sort of tools we can provide for these</span> <span data-start="125.65" data-end="127.78">powerful new features.</span> <span data-start="127.78" data-end="134.019">Now, it's good to begin with a bit of back story of how we got to this point.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="134.019" data-end="141.48">Firebug was a very, very popular Firefox extension which revolutionised the way we develop.</span> <span data-start="141.48" data-end="147.09">Itself was inspired, and it competed with, the sort of tools like DOM inspector.</span> <span data-start="147.09" data-end="153.18">What set apart Firebug was a community of enthusiast developer from different companies,</span> <span data-start="153.18" data-end="160.579">ecosystem of extensions, and people who wanted to build better tools right into the context</span> <span data-start="160.579" data-end="165.84">of the browser so we could get inspection, we dug debugging, and many other things.</span> <span data-start="165.84" data-end="172.3">Firebug was a pioneer in developer tools, and it is the pioneer of and which many DevTools</span> <span data-start="172.3" data-end="174.069">are based today.</span> <span data-start="174.069" data-end="179.4">When it comes to web design features, the pioneer I would like to point out is Dabblet,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="179.4" data-end="187.909">CSS playground built by Lea Verou, which is an interesting way of showing property previews</span> <span data-start="187.909" data-end="189.86">on CSS.</span> <span data-start="189.86" data-end="197.209">She collected some of the examples at the time and collected them into Dabblet for us</span> <span data-start="197.209" data-end="198.319">to use.</span> <span data-start="198.319" data-end="204.18">It serves as an inspiration for DevTools, and sometimes, it makes me sad would be today,</span> <span data-start="204.18" data-end="213.06">we have DevTools which do not yet match Dabblet in expressiveness.</span> <span data-start="213.06" data-end="217.459">What do web designers actually need in order to design in the browser?</span> <span data-start="217.459" data-end="221.4">I think it is good to make the distinction by what I mean by web designers, and that</span> <span data-start="221.4" data-end="226.469">is people who predominantly use CSS and HTML in their work.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="226.469" data-end="231.95">Not to say they don't use JavaScript, but their work is primarily in CSS and HTML.</span> <span data-start="231.95" data-end="237.349">I think there are a few key principles that DevTools would need to solve in order for</span> <span data-start="237.349" data-end="239.949">people to truly design in the browser.</span> <span data-start="239.949" data-end="246.029">These are things like the free form canvas where you can explore ideas in an unhindered</span> <span data-start="246.029" data-end="249.659">manner with less structure to worry about.</span> <span data-start="249.659" data-end="254.68">The confidence that your changes will not be lost and you can undo them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="254.68" data-end="258.82">Web designers also need specialised tools for the sort of problems they solve.</span> <span data-start="258.82" data-end="264.14">A simple form with input fields is not enough, and they also want their tools to be flexible</span> <span data-start="264.14" data-end="267.64">and customisable to fit the way they work.</span> <span data-start="267.64" data-end="269.58">So let's get into it.</span> <span data-start="269.58" data-end="270.97">Freedom.</span> <span data-start="270.97" data-end="276.84">By freedom here, I mean bringing in some of the creative freedom that people have in tools</span> <span data-start="276.84" data-end="281.92">like Photoshop or Sketch, where it is easy to start designing something and let your</span> <span data-start="281.92" data-end="288.06">creativity flow and allow for the serendipitous moments when you stumble upon a design that</span> <span data-start="288.06" data-end="289.06">you like.</span> <span data-start="289.06" data-end="296.7">That's not to say we do it in tools or in the browser today, but that it is less expressive</span> <span data-start="296.7" data-end="301.87">and conducive to experimentation to write code when you want the solution as opposed</span> <span data-start="301.87" data-end="304.22">to free-form editing.</span> <span data-start="304.22" data-end="313.5">No DevTools actually solves this today because this is a very complex problem to solve.</span> <span data-start="313.5" data-end="318.371">The web is built over very many years, and it has to be backwards compatible, and it</span> <span data-start="318.371" data-end="321.39">has to lend itself to progressive enhancement.</span> <span data-start="321.39" data-end="325.43">With one tool which comes close to this is web flow.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="325.43" data-end="332.97">Web flow is a tool, an online he had for for creating websites in a completely manual way,</span> <span data-start="332.97" data-end="335.64">just dragging things around, and using specialised editors.</span> <span data-start="335.64" data-end="339.54">This is a video I pulled from their website which highlights some of the functionality</span> <span data-start="339.54" data-end="340.54">you have there.</span> <span data-start="340.54" data-end="346.85">It is a lot more expressive, and it is a lot more fast to get to results with web flow.</span> <span data-start="346.85" data-end="353.95">Even it, which exports good-quality code, from the editor, it needs to fit into their</span> <span data-start="353.95" data-end="359.71">CMS ecosystem, and it needs some form of structure in order to build these things, so you don't</span> <span data-start="359.71" data-end="366.11">have true free capabilities to put things wherever you want, you still have some form</span> <span data-start="366.11" data-end="369.82">of limitations in structure, but it's getting very close.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="369.82" data-end="374.71">While the freedom aspect of DevTools is not solved in a general sense, I do believe per</span> <span data-start="374.71" data-end="381.74">component, key can still have tools which give you free-form editing capabilities.</span> <span data-start="381.74" data-end="384.33">Next up is confidence.</span> <span data-start="384.33" data-end="389.98">Picture this: you're doing a design in Photoshop, you make some changes, you made a mistake.</span> <span data-start="389.98" data-end="392.56">There is no way to go back.</span> <span data-start="392.56" data-end="397.28">Or you accidentally refresh the tool, and all of your changes have gone.</span> <span data-start="397.28" data-end="401.96">Well, sadly, that is the situation in many of the DevTools today.</span> <span data-start="401.96" data-end="403.53">The changes are very ephemeral.</span> <span data-start="403.53" data-end="406.95">You come in, make tweaks, refresh the page, and they're gone.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="406.95" data-end="412.12">That's not something you can use as a professional tool if you don't have control over these</span> <span data-start="412.12" data-end="413.54">tweaks.</span> <span data-start="413.54" data-end="415.06">Changes are happening, though.</span> <span data-start="415.06" data-end="420.02">There is a new feature launched recently in Chrome called Local Overrides.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="420.02" data-end="426.77">What that does is it tracks changes happening in DevTools, writes them to a file, and then</span> <span data-start="426.77" data-end="431.28">reapplies them every time you refresh the browser, so you don't lose changes any more.</span> <span data-start="431.28" data-end="433.9">Here's a video of it in action in Chrome.</span> <span data-start="433.9" data-end="435.88">You find it under the sources panel.</span> <span data-start="435.88" data-end="438.16">There's the overrides sub panel there.</span> <span data-start="438.16" data-end="444.14">You first need to select the folder where you would save the changes, the whole file</span> <span data-start="444.14" data-end="445.14">changes.</span> <span data-start="445.14" data-end="448.41">Once you allow this, you can return to your normal work flow in DevTools.</span> <span data-start="448.41" data-end="453.15">So you can start making changes to properties and the browser will start monitoring those</span> <span data-start="453.15" data-end="459.64">changes, and it essentially saves an entire copy of the file to disk, so, then, when you</span> <span data-start="459.64" data-end="464.29">refresh, even hard refresh, like clearing the cache, you always get your changes back</span> <span data-start="464.29" data-end="465.47">from that file on disk.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="465.47" data-end="470.59">There is an indicator in the network panel saying, "By the way we may be overwriting</span> <span data-start="470.59" data-end="471.59">properties."</span> <span data-start="471.59" data-end="476.53">As soon as you disable DevTools, you're back to the normal website.</span> <span data-start="476.53" data-end="480.49">When you re-enable DevTools, local changes are always reapplied.</span> <span data-start="480.49" data-end="485.13">Essentially, it's taking the local file and using it instead of what is coming from the</span> <span data-start="485.13" data-end="490">server, which is great, but there's a caveat: if you forget this thing open, you may not</span> <span data-start="490" data-end="494.4">know why your dev changes are not applying on your machines.</span> <span data-start="494.4" data-end="497.1">There's a caveat there on which you need to be mindful.</span> <span data-start="497.1" data-end="500.99">The indicator next to the network panel is a hint there.</span> <span data-start="500.99" data-end="506.44">An alternative to local overrides is a Chrome developer tools citizens called Finch Developer</span> <span data-start="506.44" data-end="507.69">Tools.</span> <span data-start="507.69" data-end="509.52">It does pretty much the same thing.</span> <span data-start="509.52" data-end="511.28">You have to explicitly enable it.</span> <span data-start="511.28" data-end="513.47">There is no folder to save.</span> <span data-start="513.47" data-end="518.229">Once you enable Finch, you can start making changes to your style and DevTools as usual.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="518.229" data-end="522.099">It monitors the changes and saves them into memory.</span> <span data-start="522.099" data-end="526.77">Every time you refresh the page, it goes to memory and brings the changes back.</span> <span data-start="526.77" data-end="532.34">You have the panel called DevTools which shows you a diff of everything you've done which</span> <span data-start="532.34" data-end="538.78">you can toggle on and off, and you can export these changes.</span> <span data-start="538.78" data-end="543.56">And the difference with Finch is that you can export just the subset of changes you</span> <span data-start="543.56" data-end="551.45">made immediately of having a future file saved locally to disk.</span> <span data-start="551.45" data-end="555.53">Next up, it is specialised tool, and there's lots to talk in specialised tools.</span> <span data-start="555.53" data-end="561.35">By this, I mean editors focused on doing one thing and doing it very, very well.</span> <span data-start="561.35" data-end="565.71">Probably, the classic example in specialised tools, is the colour-picker.</span> <span data-start="565.71" data-end="572">The colour-picker in Chrome, I'm convinced everyone has used it before, you start inspecting</span> <span data-start="572" data-end="577.08">an element, you find a colour value, and you trigger the colour-picker over there, and</span> <span data-start="577.08" data-end="580.37">you make changes to the hue and see your changes live on the page.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="580.37" data-end="583.97">This is powerful because we want contextual changes.</span> <span data-start="583.97" data-end="589.94">I don't know if you've noticed recently, there's a recent addition of contrast ratio which</span> <span data-start="589.94" data-end="594.43">tells you if the colours you're picking are compliant with accessibility guidelines which</span> <span data-start="594.43" data-end="601.49">make text easier to read for people who have difficulty reading text of different colours.</span> <span data-start="601.49" data-end="606.01">Once you change colours, you actually get a line over there, and it shows you the threshold</span> <span data-start="606.01" data-end="611.82">above which colours are not considered compliant with the standards, double A or AAA.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="611.82" data-end="617.27">I particularly like this integration of accessibility right into the tool when you're developing</span> <span data-start="617.27" data-end="621.339">as opposed to having an accessibility step later down the road.</span> <span data-start="621.339" data-end="625.6">It brings the importance of the field up close and personal.</span> <span data-start="625.6" data-end="628.07">I like this.</span> <span data-start="628.07" data-end="631.11">Next up, the text shadow editor, also in Chrome DevTools.</span> <span data-start="631.11" data-end="636.15">I don't know if you've noticed this because it is very subtle, but in the styles panel</span> <span data-start="636.15" data-end="643.14">of Chrome DevTools, there's a hamburger, or meat ball menu, giving you more options to</span> <span data-start="643.14" data-end="644.63">add properties.</span> <span data-start="644.63" data-end="648">One of these is properties is adding the shadow.</span> <span data-start="648" data-end="652.64">This gives you a specialised editor which gives you a lot more flexibility in playing</span> <span data-start="652.64" data-end="658.38">around with the shadow, changing the direction of it, or the spread, or the blur, which,</span> <span data-start="658.38" data-end="665.61">again, lends itself to creativity, to exploration, to figuring out what works and what doesn't.</span> <span data-start="665.61" data-end="669.38">Next up, the CSS Grid inspector.</span> <span data-start="669.38" data-end="675.62">People love CSS grids because they're an amazing new layout tool and they need help designing</span> <span data-start="675.62" data-end="676.92">with Grid.</span> <span data-start="676.92" data-end="681.2">CSS Grid is actually being used on the website conference right now.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="681.2" data-end="686.64">The Grid inspector gives you a preview of the grid so you can inspect where the elements</span> <span data-start="686.64" data-end="689.88">are actually positioned on that grid.</span> <span data-start="689.88" data-end="694.39">Here's a more complex example built by my colleagues, Jen Simmons, where the need for</span> <span data-start="694.39" data-end="699.74">the Grid inspector comes in handy because you want to know where the positions are on</span> <span data-start="699.74" data-end="700.74">the grid.</span> <span data-start="700.74" data-end="707">You can toggle the display line numbers, and you can extend the lines infinitely if that</span> <span data-start="707" data-end="708.29">helps you or not.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="708.29" data-end="712.91">A cool thing is you can change the colour of the grid, so you maybe have more contrast</span> <span data-start="712.91" data-end="717.52">if it doesn't work well with your design, and the setting is maintained after you refresh</span> <span data-start="717.52" data-end="718.52">the page.</span> <span data-start="718.52" data-end="724.65">So I know for a fact that this demo is also responsive, and, when you make changes, this</span> <span data-start="724.65" data-end="728.78">is where the inspector comes in very hand which, because some elements may have repositioned,</span> <span data-start="728.78" data-end="734.26">and then you can see them on the grid inspector, and you can understand what changed in your</span> <span data-start="734.26" data-end="735.26">layout.</span> <span data-start="735.26" data-end="739.3">This is an invaluable tool if you're learning Grid, or if you're playing with Grid, because</span> <span data-start="739.3" data-end="744.72">it can get very complex, and having a specialised preview in the grid inspector is really useful</span> <span data-start="744.72" data-end="746.46">for people.</span> <span data-start="746.46" data-end="751.94">CSS filters in Firefox: they have an editor in Firefox DevTools.</span> <span data-start="751.94" data-end="758.13">There are really cool ways of changing the graphic of something, the styling.</span> <span data-start="758.13" data-end="765.48">So, over here, we're using the filter editor to add a hue rotate and dragging against that</span> <span data-start="765.48" data-end="771.339">label over there to pick up colours for a hue rotate, and we can also add, for example,</span> <span data-start="771.339" data-end="776.25">brightness, so we can change and stack multiple filters together, and, what makes this very</span> <span data-start="776.25" data-end="781.02">powerful is that, instead of writing the values manually, you can play around with them, and</span> <span data-start="781.02" data-end="783.63">you don't need to know their limits, their constraints.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="783.63" data-end="790">You can also saturation to see what desaturation does, and an important thing about filters</span> <span data-start="790" data-end="794.339">is that their order is important, so you can change the order in the editor, and you can</span> <span data-start="794.339" data-end="799.04">live-preview that on the page to understand the subtle differences that are actually happening</span> <span data-start="799.04" data-end="801.3">when you're doing that.</span> <span data-start="801.3" data-end="806.05">One thing which is not shown in the video is that you can also save these filters presets,</span> <span data-start="806.05" data-end="810.52">so you can reapply them next time you want to edit.</span> <span data-start="810.52" data-end="812.59">Next up, the CSS gradient editor.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="812.59" data-end="817.8">We have a gradient editor integrated into the Safari DevTools, wherever you see a linear</span> <span data-start="817.8" data-end="825.91">repeat ing gradient, you get a contextual editor to do this, and this is on grabient.com</span> <span data-start="825.91" data-end="832.57">which is a playground for choosing gradients or creating them online and getting them.</span> <span data-start="832.57" data-end="836.97">There are a lot of great editors out there.</span> <span data-start="836.97" data-end="841.14">People are trying to solve this problem in many different ways, and it's really good</span> <span data-start="841.14" data-end="844.31">to have a lot of different opinions.</span> <span data-start="844.31" data-end="849.63">One very cool gradient editor that I found recently is one for easing gradients.</span> <span data-start="849.63" data-end="856.089">So, Andreas Larsen suggested introducing the concept of easing to your gradients like we</span> <span data-start="856.089" data-end="861.05">have in animations, so you don't have a straight gradient, you can have a curve.</span> <span data-start="861.05" data-end="866.11">He built this specialised editor to represent what this a would mean.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1319.8" data-end="1323.57">People work in many different ways throughout our industry.</span> <span data-start="1323.57" data-end="1325.57">And that's probably not news to you.</span> <span data-start="1325.57" data-end="1332.74">But what maybe is news is that the developer tools team in any browser you know has very</span> <span data-start="1332.74" data-end="1338.55">few people working on it, and there is generally very few people maintaining codebase for a</span> <span data-start="1338.55" data-end="1340.4">large, large audience.</span> <span data-start="1340.4" data-end="1345.43">Some of us are thankful to have contributors like volunteers we have at Mozilla who fix</span> <span data-start="1345.43" data-end="1350.679">bugs, and who even implement features altogether, and we are really thankful foyer their effort</span> <span data-start="1350.679" data-end="1356.34">but the reality is we need to work against some priorities, and sometimes, those priorities</span> <span data-start="1356.34" data-end="1358.919">may not be the same thing you care about.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1358.919" data-end="1363.07">And, when people want something built, they just go ahead and do it.</span> <span data-start="1363.07" data-end="1369.66">So, I was really happy to learn earlier this month that a Chrome DevTools extension now</span> <span data-start="1369.66" data-end="1373.49">has over one million users.</span> <span data-start="1373.49" data-end="1380.04">As much as we love React in DevTools, I think it is hard to imagine that anyone would prioritise</span> <span data-start="1380.04" data-end="1385.88">building DevTools for React into DevTools knowing how transient and ever-changing frameworks</span> <span data-start="1385.88" data-end="1386.88">are.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1386.88" data-end="1390.6">That didn't stop people who were motivated and skilled enough to build these tools and</span> <span data-start="1390.6" data-end="1391.73">share them with others.</span> <span data-start="1391.73" data-end="1395.91">They recognise the need, build the tool for it, and this is popular.</span> <span data-start="1395.91" data-end="1398.09">This is the power of billing extensions.</span> <span data-start="1398.09" data-end="1404.21">So, at this point, I should just encourage you all to build DevTools extensions for web</span> <span data-start="1404.21" data-end="1405.21">designers.</span> <span data-start="1405.21" data-end="1407.429">Well, I could do that.</span> <span data-start="1407.429" data-end="1413.5">Well, you can get a panel added to your DevTools — like my extension over there — or you can</span> <span data-start="1413.5" data-end="1417.74">get a sidebar panel placed next to the rules over there.</span> <span data-start="1417.74" data-end="1422.62">If you're using free-paint mode in Firefox, you have the rules panels separate and you</span> <span data-start="1422.62" data-end="1427.581">have a design surface next to it, and you can see those changes happening in the rule</span> <span data-start="1427.581" data-end="1429.27">view.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1429.27" data-end="1434.87">But if that panel looks very lonely and empty, it is because it is.</span> <span data-start="1434.87" data-end="1439.22">In reality, DevTools extensions are very, very isolated.</span> <span data-start="1439.22" data-end="1444.12">They know almost nothing about the DevTools environment, and they have a very loose connection</span> <span data-start="1444.12" data-end="1448.28">with the inspected page through rudimentary text-based protocol.</span> <span data-start="1448.28" data-end="1453.651">So, if you want to build DevTools, for designers, you don't actually have access to the rule</span> <span data-start="1453.651" data-end="1454.651">view.</span> <span data-start="1454.651" data-end="1456.91">You don't know which rules have applied to that element.</span> <span data-start="1456.91" data-end="1460.48">You don't know if the node is changing.</span> <span data-start="1460.48" data-end="1463.28">You don't knee if the DevTools has closed underneath your feet.</span> <span data-start="1463.28" data-end="1464.53">That's kind of weird.</span> <span data-start="1464.53" data-end="1470.669">So, if you want to build DevTools extensions right now, you have to do a lot of work just</span> <span data-start="1470.669" data-end="1473.94">to get to the point where you can start building your specialised editor.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1473.94" data-end="1476.12">Now, that's not a good way of working.</span> <span data-start="1476.12" data-end="1480.13">So, here comes a proposal: what if we could change that?</span> <span data-start="1480.13" data-end="1487.37">What if we can write extension APIs that allow you to plug into the rule view and subscribe</span> <span data-start="1487.37" data-end="1489.84">with the specialised editor for a property?</span> <span data-start="1489.84" data-end="1495.5">Say, you want to write an editor for font weight which has a slider with notches over</span> <span data-start="1495.5" data-end="1505.43">there, and maybe a dropdown to pick one of the instances.</span> <span data-start="1505.43" data-end="1515.15">The browser should do the leg work of closing your editor and events in the change, and</span> <span data-start="1515.15" data-end="1519.13">then sending events by something else.</span> <span data-start="1519.13" data-end="1532.87">But there's no real reason why we expose this one editor at</span> <span data-start="1532.87" data-end="1535.54">a time.</span> <span data-start="1535.54" data-end="1552.03">.. So we can</span> <span data-start="1552.03" data-end="1562.32">have  a font size editor which allows you to see</span> <span data-start="1562.32" data-end="1567.64">what you're picking is not legible or not, or margin that does shorthand ex-pangs over</span> <span data-start="1567.64" data-end="1568.71">there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1568.71" data-end="1573.87">These would be inline editors, and I give you the freedom to really focus on something</span> <span data-start="1573.87" data-end="1577.12">you want to implement, a specialised editor.</span> <span data-start="1577.12" data-end="1581.65">We can also open up the previews, so we can have previews of angles.</span> <span data-start="1581.65" data-end="1584.57">This is a demo built by one of my colleagues.</span> <span data-start="1584.57" data-end="1595.929">We can get closer to the vision Leah had and ex pose the tool tip to preview one at a time.</span> <span data-start="1595.929" data-end="1601.36">If we have an extension ecosystem and the browser knows these extensions exist in the</span> <span data-start="1601.36" data-end="1605.88">store, then it could get to a point where we could smartly look at something, see a</span> <span data-start="1605.88" data-end="1611.13">property that there's an editor for, and we can recommend this to you in context, so you</span> <span data-start="1611.13" data-end="1617.32">can install an extension for DevTools right in context, and solve the problem as you are</span> <span data-start="1617.32" data-end="1618.88">there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1618.88" data-end="1626.62">Now, if these things sound interesting to you, and if you want to build extensions like</span> <span data-start="1626.62" data-end="1631.84">these, if you're a web designer that wants extensions built for them like this, we're</span> <span data-start="1631.84" data-end="1634.3">very, very interested in hearing from you.</span> <span data-start="1634.3" data-end="1638.33">Please reach out to me or my colleagues in Firefox DevTools.</span> <span data-start="1638.33" data-end="1643.59">We want to understand what classes of problems you're trying to solve, so as to build an</span> <span data-start="1643.59" data-end="1650.99">API which really serves your needs well, because we're really interested in building tools</span> <span data-start="1650.99" data-end="1652.45">that work well for you.</span> <span data-start="1652.45" data-end="1657">Because, until we do that, we are always going to do some form of limitation in the creative</span> <span data-start="1657" data-end="1663.23">expression you get into DevTools, and we cannot design in the browser unless we make DevTools</span> <span data-start="1663.23" data-end="1667.24">for designers actually good.</span> <span data-start="1667.24" data-end="1668.24">Thank you very much.</span> </p>
