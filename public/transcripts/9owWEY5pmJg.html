<p><span data-start="6.12" data-end="7.12"><span class="speaker">Audience</span>: Whoo!</span> <span data-start="7.12" data-end="8.12"Audience member: All right, so let's welcome Tierney Cyren.</span> <span data-start="8.12" data-end="9.12"Audience member: Hello.</span> <span data-start="9.12" data-end="10.12">Could we give another round of applause to the organizers and the supporting staff who</span> <span data-start="10.12" data-end="16.81">have built this amazing event that I've really had an amazing time with and I hope you have</span> <span data-start="16.81" data-end="17.81">too.</span> <span data-start="17.81" data-end="21.62">Awesome, OK, so today I want to talk about building open source communities.</span> <span data-start="21.62" data-end="25.77">Before I get started, I'm going to do a quick who am I.</span> <span data-start="25.77" data-end="29.07">My name is Tierney Cyren, my pronouns are he and him.</span> <span data-start="29.07" data-end="35.37">I work at Microsoft, I collaborate on the Node project and a number of other projects</span> <span data-start="35.37" data-end="41.75">in various different ways, that's basically what you need to know about me.</span> <span data-start="41.75" data-end="46.719">So what is an open source community?</span> <span data-start="46.719" data-end="51.46"Audience member: Open source is everything, or at least the community side of open source is everything</span> <span data-start="51.46" data-end="52.699">beyond the code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="52.699" data-end="58.03">So everything that's not technical, like literally writing lines of code and consuming lines</span> <span data-start="58.03" data-end="60.96">of code, is the community.</span> <span data-start="60.96" data-end="67.95">This includes people, coordinating a bunch of different aspects of your community itself,</span> <span data-start="67.95" data-end="80.72">processes, location, funding, social media, blogging, diversity</span> <span data-start="80.72" data-end="85.99">and inclusivity, outreach, documentation, licensing, there's lot.</span> <span data-start="85.99" data-end="90.8"Audience member: I think like a year and a half ago, I asked what open source community is.</span> <span data-start="90.8" data-end="95.46">And there was a bunch of different responses and they're all pretty good and honestly I</span> <span data-start="95.46" data-end="98.17">agree with all of them.</span> <span data-start="98.17" data-end="105.78">That said, they're all pretty different, and it kind of leads us to understand that there's</span> <span data-start="105.78" data-end="111.96">not consensus around what open source community is, because it's so individual to us as individual</span> <span data-start="111.96" data-end="116.89">contributors, to us as maintainers, to us as consumers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="116.89" data-end="122.53">You have to really take into account those aspects when you're asking like such a broad</span> <span data-start="122.53" data-end="125.17">question.</span> <span data-start="125.17" data-end="128.829">Whatever technology you came from originally, whatever you started with, is going to influence</span> <span data-start="128.829" data-end="131.43">how you perceive an open source community.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="131.43" data-end="135.65">Whatever your personal history is going to influence how you see a community in general</span> <span data-start="135.65" data-end="145.92">and then you are aapplying open source definition to that of what's important to you.</span> <span data-start="145.92" data-end="151.439">Again differentiate how you'd perceive an open source community so everyone's idea is</span> <span data-start="151.439" data-end="155.099">different of what a community is.</span> <span data-start="155.099" data-end="160.349">So taking that, how do you actually build an open source community?</span> <span data-start="160.349" data-end="165.379">It's kind of challenging, but it's also very easy in a lot of ways.</span> <span data-start="165.379" data-end="171.43">I generally try not to say easy, but it's  —  I'm using it in in this case, because it's</span> <span data-start="171.43" data-end="175.61">easy to stumble into it and do it accidentally and this is how a lot of communities do end</span> <span data-start="175.61" data-end="177.36">up starting.</span> <span data-start="177.36" data-end="182.22">So I'm using easy very intentionally there.</span> <span data-start="182.22" data-end="187.139">Every open source community has a lot of its own quirks and unique aspects and often those</span> <span data-start="187.139" data-end="190.54">are really good and often those can be really bad.</span> <span data-start="190.54" data-end="196.099">Luckily, there are some fundamental traits, at least in my experience of the open source</span> <span data-start="196.099" data-end="204.31">communities I've been a part of that are shared and these aren't necessarily like I can give</span> <span data-start="204.31" data-end="207.489">you XYZ answer to a problem.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="207.489" data-end="212.659">These are kind of cultural things that are shared and kind of manifest no matter how</span> <span data-start="212.659" data-end="218.18">you get to open source community evolves and builds up.</span> <span data-start="218.18" data-end="226.349">So let's go into some of the lessons I've personally learned from being parts of open</span> <span data-start="226.349" data-end="234.68">source communities and helping them grow and also seeing them fail.</span> <span data-start="234.68" data-end="236.739">So these are the communities I participated in.</span> <span data-start="236.739" data-end="240.209">MyBB is an open source forum system.</span> <span data-start="240.209" data-end="244.019">It's been around for a very long time.</span> <span data-start="244.019" data-end="249.879">It was created in 2006, I think, 2005, which for me is a long time.</span> <span data-start="249.879" data-end="255.459">It's PHP, so you know, very different from JavaScript that we're used to, and kind of</span> <span data-start="255.459" data-end="260.12">the build speed was a very different pace than what we're used to in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="260.12" data-end="265.38">Tent was a protocol, the implementation was Ruby.</span> <span data-start="265.38" data-end="269.18">Whoo Ruby.</span> <span data-start="269.18" data-end="271.53">Interesting choice in this crowd!</span> <span data-start="271.53" data-end="277.91">So Tent was very much an idea and a definition similar to what HTTP is, people go implement</span> <span data-start="277.91" data-end="285.35">T very interesting community and one that I really loved and very sad to have seen it</span> <span data-start="285.35" data-end="286.35">die.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="286.35" data-end="293.99">Io.js, I assume many of you know what that is, but that is the fork of node that happened</span> <span data-start="293.99" data-end="303.57">in node 10 just before Node 12 shipped.</span> <span data-start="303.57" data-end="309.58">Eventually got merged into Node.js and got moved under Node.js foundation.</span> <span data-start="309.58" data-end="310.94">And then there's Node itself.</span> <span data-start="310.94" data-end="313.229">I know these kind of merged.</span> <span data-start="313.229" data-end="319">I do absolutely classify them as two different communities and two different experiences.</span> <span data-start="319" data-end="321.56">And we can get into that a bit later.</span> <span data-start="321.56" data-end="325.81">So lesson one, don't build too much.</span> <span data-start="325.81" data-end="330.36">Creating too much structure can be a really bad thing that hinders your community.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="330.36" data-end="337.15">Specifically it sets guardrails on how your community can grow and sets implicit expectations</span> <span data-start="337.15" data-end="342.631">about that growth, and it limits what you can do once you begin getting momentum, because</span> <span data-start="342.631" data-end="346.389">people try to stay within those guardrails rather than doing something natural and probably</span> <span data-start="346.389" data-end="350.24">something that you're not going to expect.</span> <span data-start="350.24" data-end="365.22">So my experience in MyBB was I created a website called techno board.net: It was a forum for</span> <span data-start="365.22" data-end="369.21">people who were interested in technology.</span> <span data-start="369.21" data-end="375.729">And I built a lot of structure, because that's how all of the forums I saw were doing it.</span> <span data-start="375.729" data-end="377.2">Turns out that didn't work.</span> <span data-start="377.2" data-end="380.22">There were two forums that had a bunch of posts and al.</span> <span data-start="380.22" data-end="384.539">Rests were empty and that creates an environment where oh, I see a bunch of empty things, this</span> <span data-start="384.539" data-end="387.86">looks dead and so I'm not going to participate.</span> <span data-start="387.86" data-end="395.97">So defining those guide rails and setting up structure when it's not needed yet is actually</span> <span data-start="395.97" data-end="401.56">really challenging because it one, makes your community look empty, and two, it limits how</span> <span data-start="401.56" data-end="404.36">you can actually grow naturally.</span> <span data-start="404.36" data-end="411.259">So yeah, that's an example of how to do something that's maybe not the best, because you're</span> <span data-start="411.259" data-end="416.34">trying to do, and you're trying to mimic what others do, and that can hamper your actual</span> <span data-start="416.34" data-end="417.47">growth.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="417.47" data-end="424.97">Additionally, in Node, going through the process of creating a PR and submitting it, and, you</span> <span data-start="424.97" data-end="429.639">know, getting it merged and going through the entire process can be a little bit cumbersome</span> <span data-start="429.639" data-end="435.59">and can kind of feel like this, where it's just a cycle, and you know, certain groups</span> <span data-start="435.59" data-end="438.639">in Node have gotten a lot better about this.</span> <span data-start="438.639" data-end="441.53">That said, this process is also very intentional.</span> <span data-start="441.53" data-end="445.5">We do this because it's needed in a lot of cases.</span> <span data-start="445.5" data-end="450.18">Node is a very highly impactful project, and making sure that we're not letting things</span> <span data-start="450.18" data-end="454.001">slip through that shouldn't be slipping through is really important, because we don't want</span> <span data-start="454.001" data-end="458.259">to create, you know, a bad experience for the end users for the people who are using</span> <span data-start="458.259" data-end="463.28">this in production, for the developers like you who are using this on their machines.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="463.28" data-end="469.699">So that said, in a lot of cases, if you set up too much red tape early on, it can actually</span> <span data-start="469.699" data-end="471.86">limit growth.</span> <span data-start="471.86" data-end="474.43">I ended up setting up too much red tape, or at least trying to.</span> <span data-start="474.43" data-end="481.18">I got a lot of push-back and I really appreciated it, in the Node.js committee.</span> <span data-start="481.18" data-end="485.009">There's two committees in Node.</span> <span data-start="485.009" data-end="491.419">The technical steering committee, the inward stuff and the org and the community committee</span> <span data-start="491.419" data-end="496.939">focuses on outreach community stuff.</span> <span data-start="496.939" data-end="500.62">When I was beginning to get involved there, I was like, oh, yeah, we need to mimic all</span> <span data-start="500.62" data-end="509.05">the things that the TS C and.</span> <span data-start="509.05" data-end="514.8"> —  I got a lot of push-back on that and rightfully so, because it was going to be limiting the</span> <span data-start="514.8" data-end="521.919">growth of how we can actually engage with the community, and it was very unnecessary</span> <span data-start="521.919" data-end="524.29">at the time, because we didn't actually know if we needed that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="524.29" data-end="528.139">Those things existed in the technical steering committee and working groups for a very good</span> <span data-start="528.139" data-end="529.36">reason.</span> <span data-start="529.36" data-end="534.48">Whereas the com com was new, the community committee was new and didn't necessarily need</span> <span data-start="534.48" data-end="536.399">that.</span> <span data-start="536.399" data-end="545.25">We decided to go down different paths and I'm very glad we did this.</span> <span data-start="545.25" data-end="557.56">Instead of doing working groups and teams we went down a path of pure initiatives.</span> <span data-start="557.56" data-end="561.69">In the com com we've gone a completely different path and if those things that I've actually</span> <span data-start="561.69" data-end="566.41">PRed landed, we would not be on that path today.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="566.41" data-end="568.41">So lesson 2: Empowerment.</span> <span data-start="568.41" data-end="570.18">Empower your contributors.</span> <span data-start="570.18" data-end="575.15">So without contributors being empowered, there's not a reason for them to stick around.</span> <span data-start="575.15" data-end="579.97">This is a vital, vital thing to make people feel welcome and like they're making an impact,</span> <span data-start="579.97" data-end="583.149">because they are.</span> <span data-start="583.149" data-end="587.63">You need to actually give them that to make them kind of want to be there and to feel</span> <span data-start="587.63" data-end="591.29">like they own something or that they belong.</span> <span data-start="591.29" data-end="597.7">And this is a phrase I like: So enabling contributors enables contributors to enable contributors,</span> <span data-start="597.7" data-end="604.07">so by you doing something to help lift someone else up, that someone that you helped lift</span> <span data-start="604.07" data-end="606.95">up actually helps them go lift other people up.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="606.95" data-end="610.61">So it becomes a network effect of you being able to grow your community just by being</span> <span data-start="610.61" data-end="614.72">present and welcoming and giving trust to people.</span> <span data-start="614.72" data-end="620.3">And that's something I really believe in and I've personally seen this happen and be very</span> <span data-start="620.3" data-end="624">successful many times.</span> <span data-start="624" data-end="628.43">So in Node, we had the evangelism working group.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="628.43" data-end="631.69">This was in both Node.js and io.js.</span> <span data-start="631.69" data-end="633.95">I was involved in both sides of it.</span> <span data-start="633.95" data-end="636.47">I didn't mean to both sides there.</span> <span data-start="636.47" data-end="637.47">But you get the point.</span> <span data-start="637.47" data-end="640.87">It was a working group that was both in io and Node.</span> <span data-start="640.87" data-end="645.91">We had a pretty tremendous scope.</span> <span data-start="645.91" data-end="647.26">How do you define that?</span> <span data-start="647.26" data-end="649.18">What is that scope?</span> <span data-start="649.18" data-end="650.18">That social media?</span> <span data-start="650.18" data-end="651.18">Is that blogging?</span> <span data-start="651.18" data-end="656.85">Is that providing resources for events?</span> <span data-start="656.85" data-end="660.1">How do you actually get that?</span> <span data-start="660.1" data-end="663.76">And because that scope was so big, we didn't actually necessarily have the resources that</span> <span data-start="663.76" data-end="669.07">we needed to, and so we ended up a little bit like Oliver Twist here, asking for more</span> <span data-start="669.07" data-end="673.81">and not necessarily getting it.</span> <span data-start="673.81" data-end="683.389">more because it was too broad and we weren't actually giving them a usable request.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="683.389" data-end="687.72">And that was a case of a group not necessarily being empowered and not because of anyone</span> <span data-start="687.72" data-end="694.829">else not empowering them, but because we were not defining our scope well enough to be empowered.</span> <span data-start="694.829" data-end="701.6">And so in that, we eventually kind of split out into the community committee.</span> <span data-start="701.6" data-end="705.779">It's a very long arc that we could go into later if anyone is interested, but basically</span> <span data-start="705.779" data-end="711.399">they're a new committee that kind of did similar work was eventually instantiated at the top</span> <span data-start="711.399" data-end="718.051">level of the Node foundation and we kind of got to this place where we were able to have</span> <span data-start="718.051" data-end="725.44">power and define what we were doing a lot better and actually find success with certain</span> <span data-start="725.44" data-end="730.07">pron projects and kill off other projects when they weren't needed.</span> <span data-start="730.07" data-end="735.509">And it was really good way for us to be able to flex that muscle of empowerment and get</span> <span data-start="735.509" data-end="738.28">more people involved actively.</span> <span data-start="738.28" data-end="740.12">Cool.</span> <span data-start="740.12" data-end="744.199">So lesson 3: Accept help along the way.</span> <span data-start="744.199" data-end="751.13">The first time I gave this talk, it was to student ambassadors or campus experts for</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="751.13" data-end="754.05">GitHub education.</span> <span data-start="754.05" data-end="760.55">I at the time was chairperson of the community committee and was feeling super burnt out.</span> <span data-start="760.55" data-end="765.73">I  —  it was toward the end of my time there and I had just spent a lot of time on it,</span> <span data-start="765.73" data-end="773.209">and it was just basically direct correlation to how much time I spent on it, and me not</span> <span data-start="773.209" data-end="775.79">kind of setting boundaries for myself.</span> <span data-start="775.79" data-end="780.509">And also going and trying to do everything by myself.</span> <span data-start="780.509" data-end="785.48">So one of the lessons that I think is really, really important is you can't actually own</span> <span data-start="785.48" data-end="787.269">a community.</span> <span data-start="787.269" data-end="789.85">Because at that point it ceases becoming a community.</span> <span data-start="789.85" data-end="794.38">It's a project that you are the owner of.</span> <span data-start="794.38" data-end="803.44">And this kind of came  —  I learned about this in Tent.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1198.71" data-end="1215.58">In io.js, it became very transparent of how do we do these things, but I was still really</span> <span data-start="1215.58" data-end="1218.75">nervous and not really comfortable.</span> <span data-start="1218.75" data-end="1223.9">I ended up back-channeling a lot of people, Michael Rogers specifically I back-channelled</span> <span data-start="1223.9" data-end="1229.44">quite a bit, just because I didn't know what I was doing, I also commented on GitHub a</span> <span data-start="1229.44" data-end="1230.44">lot.</span> <span data-start="1230.44" data-end="1231.44">I engaged in there.</span> <span data-start="1231.44" data-end="1234.49">GitHub is also a valid communication media.</span> <span data-start="1234.49" data-end="1237.07">And I also reached out to people on Slack.</span> <span data-start="1237.07" data-end="1245.02">And I basically tried to go through all of the channels and make sure that I was connecting</span> <span data-start="1245.02" data-end="1250.2">with people and that helped me succeed, but I also realize the inverse is true, where</span> <span data-start="1250.2" data-end="1255.98">if you go to other people, you can help lift them up and help them succeed more.</span> </p>
